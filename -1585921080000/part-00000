From 1640 onward, he had changed his alias to Vermeer.</ref> As an apprentice in Amsterdam, Reijnier lived on fashionable [[Sint Antoniesbreestraat]], a street with many resident painters at the time. In 1615, Reijnier married Digna Baltus.<!--and to facilitate their marriage, he brought a testimonial from Delft.<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kalden/dart/d-a-vermeer1.htm Vermeer's father Reynier Jansz (c. 1591 \u2013 1652)] His parents were tailor Jan Reyersz and Cornelia, alias Neeltge Goris</ref>--> The couple moved to Delft and had a daughter named Gertruy who was baptized in 1620.<ref group=Note>In 1647 Geertruy, Vermeer's only sister, married a frame maker.

In 1631, he leased an inn, which he called \"The Flying Fox\". In 1635, he lived on Voldersgracht 25 or 26. In 1641, he bought a larger inn on the market square, named after the Flemish town \"[[Mechelen]]\". The acquisition of the inn constituted a considerable financial burden.<ref name=p42 group=Huerta/> When Reijnier died in October 1652, Vermeer took over the operation of the family's art business.\n\n===Marriage and family===\n\nIn April 1653, Johannes Reijniersz Vermeer married a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] woman, Catharina Bolenes (Bolnes). The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of [[Schipluiden]]. Vermeer's new mother-in-law [[Maria Thins]] was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April.<ref group=\"Note\">Catholicism was not a forbidden religion, but tolerated in the [[Dutch Republic]]. They were not allowed to build new churches, so services were held in hidden churches (so-called [[Schuilkerk]]). Catholics were restrained in their careers, unable to get high-rank  jobs in city administration or civic guard. It was impossible to be elected as a member of the city council; therefore, the Catholics were not represented in the provincial and national assembly.</ref> According to art historian [[Walter Liedtke]], Vermeer's conversion seems to have been made with conviction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Liedtke|first1=Walter|last2=Plomp|first2=Michiel C.|last3=R\u00fcger|first3=Axel|authorlink1=Walter Liedtke|title=Vermeer and the Delft school: [catalogue ... in conjunction with the exhibition \"Vermeer and the Delft School\" held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, from 8 March to 27 May 2001, and at The National Gallery, London, from 20 June to 16 September 2001]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0870999737|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC/page/n373 359]}}</ref> His painting ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/32.100.18 |title=Johannes Vermeer: Allegory of the Catholic Faith (32.100.18) &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> made between 1670 and 1672, placed less emphasis on the artists' usual naturalistic concerns and more on symbolic religious applications, including the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]].

There is some speculation that [[Carel Fabritius]] may have been his teacher, based upon a controversial interpretation of a text written in 1668 by printer Arnold Bon. Art historians have found no hard evidence to support this.<ref name=p104 group=Montias/> Local authority [[Leonaert Bramer]] acted as a friend, but their style of painting is rather different.<ref name=Gallery/> Liedtke suggests that Vermeer taught himself, using information from one of his father's connections.<ref name=p866 group=Liedtke/> Some scholars think that Vermeer was trained under Catholic painter [[Abraham Bloemaert]]. Vermeer's style is similar to that of some of the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], whose works are depicted as paintings-within-paintings in the backgrounds of several of his compositions.<ref group=\"Note\">Identifiable works include compositions by Utrecht painters [[Dirck van Baburen|Baburen]] and [[Caesar van Everdingen|Everdingen]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Delftsedonderslag.jpg|thumb|left|''A View of Delft after the Explosion of 1654'', by [[Egbert van der Poel]]]]\nOn 29 December 1653, Vermeer became a member of the [[Guild of Saint Luke#Dutch Republic|Guild of Saint Luke]], a trade association for painters. The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[First Anglo-Dutch War|war]], and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, the city suffered the terrible explosion known as the [[Delft Explosion|Delft Thunderclap]], which destroyed a large section of the city.<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/maps/delft/delft_in_vermeer's_time.html \"Delft in Johannes Vermeer's Time\"], Essential Vermeer. Retrieved 29 September 2009</ref> In 1657, he might have found a patron in local art collector [[Pieter van Ruijven]], who lent him some money. It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the [[fijnschilder]]s from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of [[Gerard Dou]]'s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]], too. Vermeer also charged higher than average prices for his work, most of which were purchased by an unknown collector.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The age of Rembrandt and Vermeer: Dutch painting in the seventeenth century|last=Nash|first=J.M.|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1972|isbn=9780030918704|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40 40]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Delft]]'' (1660\u201361): \"He took a turbulent reality, and made it look like Heaven on earth.\"<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]], ''The Madness of Vermeer'', BBC Four.</ref>]]\n\nThe influence of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: the light from the left, the marble floor.<ref>Adriaan E.

Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with [[Nicolaes Maes]], who produced [[genre works]] in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. [[Balthasar de Monconys]] visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to [[Hendrick van Buyten]], a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.\n\nIn 1671, [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh]] organised the auction of [[Gerrit Reynst]]'s collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]]. Frederick accused them of being counterfeits and had sent 12 back on the advice of [[Hendrick Fromantiou]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&pg=PA207|title=Vermeer and His Milieu|author=Montias |date=1989|page=207|isbn=0691002894}}</ref> Van Uylenburg then organized a counter-assessment, asking a total of 35 painters to pronounce on their authenticity, including [[Jan Lievens]], [[Melchior de Hondecoeter]], [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]], and Johannes Vermeer.\n\n===Wars and death===\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Gezicht op huizen in Delft, bekend als 'Het straatje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Little Street]]'' (1657\u201358)]]\n[[File:Burial of Johannes Vermeer in Oude Kerk.

During the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], an English fleet and two allied German bishops attacked the country from the east, causing more destruction. Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Five years passed before circumstances improved. In 1674, Vermeer was listed as a member of the [[schutterij|civic guards]].<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/schutterij.html#.VC-ZUBY09EI \"Vermeer's Delft Today: Schutterij and the Doelen\"], Essential Vermeer.</ref> In the summer of 1675, Vermeer borrowed 1,000 guilders in Amsterdam from [[Hendrick Sorgh|Jacob Romboutsz]], an Amsterdam silk trader, using his mother-in-law's property as a [[surety]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Michael Montias|title=Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&pg=PA337|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00289-4|page=337}}</ref><ref>[https://cmkschilderwerken.nl/vermeer-en-milieu/ \"A Postscript on Vermeer and His Milieu\"], Auteur: John Michael Montias, Uitgever: Uitgeverij Atlas Contact B.V.</ref>\n\nIn December 1675, Vermeer died after a short illness.

The collapse of the art market damaged Vermeer's business as both a painter and an art dealer.

These paintings were sold in Amsterdam the following year in a much-studied auction, published by [[Gerard Hoet]].</ref> Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Binstock, Benjamin.|title=Vermeer's family secrets : genius, discovery, and the unknown apprentice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Vermeer, Johannes, 1632-1675.|isbn=978-0-415-96664-1|location=New York|oclc=191024081}}</ref> Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art-dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\n\n==Style==\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"[[grisaille]]\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment [[lapis lazuli]] (natural [[ultramarine]]) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed.<ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/> This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.<ref name=wadum95/> This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.\n\nA comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with the Wine Glass''. The shadows of the red satin dress are [[underpainting|underpainted]] in natural ultramarine,<ref>Gaskell, I., M. Jonker & National Gallery of Art (US) (1998), ''Vermeer Studies''. Washington: National Gallery of Art, p. 157. {{ISBN|0300075219}}</ref> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and [[vermilion]] mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.\n\nEven after Vermeer's supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]\u2019 theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer's patron.\n\nVermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\n\n===Painting materials===\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments.<ref>Kuhn, H. \"A Study of the Pigments and Grounds Used by Jan Vermeer\".

This became known as the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M. Falco]], another proponent of the theory.\n\nProfessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.<ref name=BBC_Steadman/>\n\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a [[camera lucida]] but much simpler and makes it easy to match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''.<ref name=Vanity/>\n\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist [[Colin Blakemore]], in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene.<ref name=Tims/> Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\n\nThis theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals in ''[[The Music Lesson]]''. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device.<ref name=Obscura/> However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death.<ref name=bryson/>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer|Category:Johannes Vermeer }}\nVermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived.<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Vermeer was brilliant, but he was not without influences|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730134-blockbuster-show-punctures-myth-solitary-genius-vermeer-was-brilliant-he|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656; Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden); ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris); and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669; St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\n\nVermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins owned [[Dirck van Baburen]]'s 1622 oil-on-canvas ''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]'', Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two [[townscape]]s have also been attributed to this period: ''[[View of Delft]]'' (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and ''[[The Little Street (Vermeer)|''A street in Delft'']]'' (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\n\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and ''[[The Love Letter (Vermeer)|The Love Letter]]'' (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile_Thor\u00e9_by_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]]]]\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death. A select number of connoisseurs in the Netherlands did appreciate his work, yet even so, many of his works were attributed to better-known artists such as [[Gabriel Metsu|Metsu]] or [[Frans van Mieris the Elder|Mieris]]. The Delft master's modern rediscovery began about 1860, when German museum director [[Gustav Waagen]] saw ''[[The Art of Painting]]'' in the Czernin gallery in Vienna and recognized the work as a Vermeer, though it was attributed to [[Pieter de Hooch]] at that time.<ref>Gaskell, Jonker & National Gallery of Art (1998).

The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[First Anglo-Dutch War|war]], and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, the city suffered the terrible explosion known as the [[Delft Explosion|Delft Thunderclap]], which destroyed a large section of the city.<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/maps/delft/delft_in_vermeer's_time.html \"Delft in Johannes Vermeer's Time\"], Essential Vermeer.

It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the [[fijnschilder]]s from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of [[Gerard Dou]]'s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]], too. Vermeer also charged higher than average prices for his work, most of which were purchased by an unknown collector.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The age of Rembrandt and Vermeer: Dutch painting in the seventeenth century|last=Nash|first=J.M.|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1972|isbn=9780030918704|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40 40]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Delft]]'' (1660\u201361): \"He took a turbulent reality, and made it look like Heaven on earth.\"<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]], ''The Madness of Vermeer'', BBC Four.</ref>]]\n\nThe influence of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: the light from the left, the marble floor.<ref>Adriaan E.

Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with [[Nicolaes Maes]], who produced [[genre works]] in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. [[Balthasar de Monconys]] visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to [[Hendrick van Buyten]], a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.\n\nIn 1671, [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh]] organised the auction of [[Gerrit Reynst]]'s collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]].

Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Five years passed before circumstances improved.

These paintings were sold in Amsterdam the following year in a much-studied auction, published by [[Gerard Hoet]].</ref> Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Binstock, Benjamin.|title=Vermeer's family secrets : genius, discovery, and the unknown apprentice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Vermeer, Johannes, 1632-1675.|isbn=978-0-415-96664-1|location=New York|oclc=191024081}}</ref> Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art-dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\n\n==Style==\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"[[grisaille]]\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment [[lapis lazuli]] (natural [[ultramarine]]) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed.<ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/> This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.<ref name=wadum95/> This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.\n\nA comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with the Wine Glass''. The shadows of the red satin dress are [[underpainting|underpainted]] in natural ultramarine,<ref>Gaskell, I., M. Jonker & National Gallery of Art (US) (1998), ''Vermeer Studies''. Washington: National Gallery of Art, p. 157. {{ISBN|0300075219}}</ref> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and [[vermilion]] mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.\n\nEven after Vermeer's supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]\u2019 theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer's patron.\n\nVermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\n\n===Painting materials===\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments.<ref>Kuhn, H. \"A Study of the Pigments and Grounds Used by Jan Vermeer\". ''Reports and Studies in the History of Art'', 1968, 154\u2013202</ref> He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive [[ultramarine]] (''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''), and also [[lead-tin-yellow]] (''[[A Lady Writing a Letter]]''), [[madder lake]] ([[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Vermeer)|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'']]), and [[vermilion]]. He also painted with [[ochres]], [[bone black]] and [[azurite]].<ref>Illustrated pigment analyses of Vermeer's paintings: [http://colourlex.com/paintings/paintings-painter/dutch-painters/ Dutch Painters], Colourlex</ref> The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in ''[[Woman Holding a Balance]]''<ref>Kuhn, 1968, pp. 191\u2013192</ref> has been disproven by later pigment analysis.<ref>Gifford, E.M., \"Painting Light: Recent Observations on Vermeer\u2019s Technique\", in Gaskell, I. and Jonker, M., ed., ''Vermeer Studies, in Studies in the History of Art'', 55, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1998, pp. 185\u2013199</ref>\n\nIn Vermeer's oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Janson|first1=Jonathan|title=Vermeer's Palette|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_vermeer'_palette.html#.WM7coBIrJE5|website=Essential Vermeer|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Camera obscura===\n\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost [[photorealistic]] attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2001, British artist [[David Hockney]] published the book ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of [[curved mirror]]s, [[camera obscura]], and [[camera lucida]]. This became known as the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M. Falco]], another proponent of the theory.\n\nProfessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.<ref name=BBC_Steadman/>\n\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a [[camera lucida]] but much simpler and makes it easy to match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''.<ref name=Vanity/>\n\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist [[Colin Blakemore]], in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene.<ref name=Tims/> Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\n\nThis theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals in ''[[The Music Lesson]]''. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device.<ref name=Obscura/> However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death.<ref name=bryson/>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer|Category:Johannes Vermeer }}\nVermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived.<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Vermeer was brilliant, but he was not without influences|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730134-blockbuster-show-punctures-myth-solitary-genius-vermeer-was-brilliant-he|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656; Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden); ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris); and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669; St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\n\nVermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins owned [[Dirck van Baburen]]'s 1622 oil-on-canvas ''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]'', Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two [[townscape]]s have also been attributed to this period: ''[[View of Delft]]'' (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and ''[[The Little Street (Vermeer)|''A street in Delft'']]'' (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\n\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and ''[[The Love Letter (Vermeer)|The Love Letter]]'' (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile_Thor\u00e9_by_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]]]]\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death. A select number of connoisseurs in the Netherlands did appreciate his work, yet even so, many of his works were attributed to better-known artists such as [[Gabriel Metsu|Metsu]] or [[Frans van Mieris the Elder|Mieris]]. The Delft master's modern rediscovery began about 1860, when German museum director [[Gustav Waagen]] saw ''[[The Art of Painting]]'' in the Czernin gallery in Vienna and recognized the work as a Vermeer, though it was attributed to [[Pieter de Hooch]] at that time.<ref>Gaskell, Jonker & National Gallery of Art (1998).

Other artists who were inspired by Vermeer include Danish painter [[Wilhelm Hammershoi]]<ref>Gunnarsson, Torsten (1998), ''Nordic Landscape Painting in the Nineteenth Century''. Yale University Press, p. 227. {{ISBN|0300070411}}</ref> and American [[Thomas Wilmer Dewing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/resources/resource/473 |title=Interpretive Resource: Artist Biography: Thomas Wilmer Dewing |publisher=Artic.edu |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> In the 20th century, Vermeer's admirers included [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], who painted his own version of ''The Lacemaker'' (on commission from collector [[Robert Lehman]]) and pitted large copies of the original against a rhinoceros in some surrealist experiments. Dali also immortalized the [[Dutch Masters|Dutch Master]] in ''[[The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table]]'', 1934.\n\n[[Han van Meegeren]] was a 20th-century Dutch painter who worked in the classical tradition. He became a master forger, motivated by a blend of aesthetic and financial reasons, creating and selling many new \"Vermeers\" before turning himself in for forgery to avoid being charged with capital treason for collaboration with the Nazis, specifically, in selling what had been believed to be original artwork to the Nazis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/books/review/Julius-t.html?_r=2 |title=The Lying Dutchman |author=Anthony Julius|newspaper=The New York Times |date=22 June 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 23 September 1971, a 21-year-old hotel waiter, Mario Pierre Roymans, stole Vermeer's ''Love Letter'' from the Fine Arts Palace in Brussels where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum as a part of the Rembrandt and his Age exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/fakes_thefts_school_of_delft_lost_sp/vermeer_theft_01.html#.VrvQ8fk4HIU|title=Vermeer Thefts: The Love Letter|last=Janson|first=Jonathan|website=www.essentialvermeer.com|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{See also|Johannes Vermeer in popular culture}}\n\nVermeer's reputation and works have been featured in both literature and in films such as ''Girl with a Pearl Earring''.

She is an expert in the application of advanced X-ray spectroscopy to understand catalytic transformations.\n\n===Nitrogenase===\nA strong focus of her research is to study the enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of [[Nitrogen|dinitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) to [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>)\u2014[[Nitrogenase]]. Serena DeBeer and her group study this remarkable system comprising a [[FeMoco|FeMo cofactor]] (FeMoco) as its active site, and structural model complexes utilizing high-resolution [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy|X-ray absorption]] (XAS) and [[X-ray emission spectroscopy]] (XES). Through this work, great progress has been made in understanding the structure of this active site. A key contribution was a spectroscopic identification of the central atom in the active site as a carbide.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=K.

She is an expert in the application of advanced X-ray spectroscopy to understand catalytic transformations.\n\n===Nitrogenase===\nA strong focus of her research is to study the enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of [[Nitrogen|dinitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) to [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>)\u2014[[Nitrogenase]]. Serena DeBeer and her group study this remarkable system comprising a [[FeMoco|FeMo cofactor]] (FeMoco) as its active site, and structural model complexes utilizing high-resolution [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy|X-ray absorption]] (XAS) and [[X-ray emission spectroscopy]] (XES). Through this work, great progress has been made in understanding the structure of this active site. A key contribution was a spectroscopic identification of the central atom in the active site as a carbide.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=K.

The river [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]] divides the city into two halves, the so-called Romanian Lugoj that spreads on the right bank and the [[Banat Swabians|German]] Lugoj on the left bank.

During the Middle Ages and eighteenth century, it was of greater relative importance than at present.\n\nA diploma dated Wednesday 22 August 1376, signed by King [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]], shows that Lugoj city was donated to Losonczy family. At the end of the 14th century, after the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] (1396), the Turks crossed the Danube, invading the region of Banat and reached the gates of Lugoj. The city was strengthened with trenches, ramparts and palisades in 1440 by the initiatives of Hunyadi, as a comite of Timis , in order to its defense system. It resisted Ottoman pressures until 1658, when the Prince of Transylvania asked Lugoj and [[Caransebe\u0219]] to accept the decision taken by the Diet of Sighi\u0219oara to agree to Turkish occupation.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Turks during the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683, the Habsburgs went on the offensive and briefly occupied the cities of Lugoj and Lipova (1688). On September 25, 1695 the battle between the armies of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] that took place near Lugoj ended with the defeat of the Austrians.\n\nAfter signing the [[Treaty of Karlovitz]] (1699), the region of Banat remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 20 years. The [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (21 July 1718) was signed and the Turks were expelled. The Habsburg Monarchy wanted to repopulate the Banat, which had emptied following the years of occupation and earlier [[bubonic plague]]. The government recruited Germans from [[Bavaria]], [[Swabia]] and Alsace-Lorraine, particularly farmers to revive agriculture in the rich floodplain. They traveled down the Danube River on boats to this area.  They later took the rafts apart to use to build their first houses. In this area, the first German colonists settled on the left bank of the river [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]] (circa 1720), creating what was called \"German Lugoj\". The government had offered them the privileges of keeping their German language and religion; most were Roman Catholic.\n\nIn the 18th century, many public buildings were built in the city, including the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church \"Assumption\". In 1778, following the incorporation of [[Banat]] into Hungary, Lugoj became the county seat of Cara\u0219. In 1795 the government unified the Romanian Lugoj and the German Lugoj.\n\n[[Eftimie Murgu]] settled in Lugoj in 1841.  In June 1848 he chaired the second [[National Assembly]] of Romanians of Banat, where they expressed in postulates the National Order of Romanians during the Revolutionary Movement from Banat, whose center was Lugoj.\n\nIn the summer of 1842 a great fire took place, in which about 400 houses and important buildings were destroyed.\n\nIn August 1849 Lugoj was the last seat of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolutionary government]]. It served as the last refuge of [[Lajos Kossuth]] and several other leaders of the Revolution prior to their escape to the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nUnder the imperial resolution of 12 December 1850, Lugoj became the seat of the Greek-Catholic Diocese of Banat. Lugoj was the seat of [[Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny County]] from 1881 to 1918. Following the break-up of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, the region of Banat, after a brief period of Serbian occupation came under Romanian administration. [[Severin County]] was organized and named, and its seat was located in Lugoj until the temporary abolition of counties in 1950.\n\nThe Iron Bridge, a symbol of Lugoj, was built in 1902. On November 3, 1918 a Great National Assembly took place in Lugoj. The right of self-determination of the Romanian nation was proclaimed after the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in World War I.\n\nIn modern times, the city was the home town of famous Dracula actor [[Bela Lugosi]].\n\nIt is the seat of the [[Eparchy of Lugoj]] in the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic]].\n\n==Population and demographics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:93%;width:300px;height:16;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:120%; margin-bottom: 10px\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"14\" style=\"text-align:center; background: #F4F4F4\" height=24px |'''Historical population of Lugoj'''<ref>[http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=3608 Erd\u00e9ly etnikai \u00e9s felekezeti statisztik\u00e1ja<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n!

During the Middle Ages and eighteenth century, it was of greater relative importance than at present.\n\nA diploma dated Wednesday 22 August 1376, signed by King [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]], shows that Lugoj city was donated to Losonczy family. At the end of the 14th century, after the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] (1396), the Turks crossed the Danube, invading the region of Banat and reached the gates of Lugoj. The city was strengthened with trenches, ramparts and palisades in 1440 by the initiatives of Hunyadi, as a comite of Timis , in order to its defense system.

She went to school at [[Fyling Hall School]] in [[North Yorkshire]].\n\nAt the age of thirteen Carthy formed the Waterdaughters with her mother, aunt ([[Lal Waterson]]) and cousin [[Marry Waterson]]. She has subsequently worked with [[Nancy Kerr]], with her parents as [[Waterson\u2013Carthy]], and as part of the \"supergroup\" [[Blue Murder (folk)|Blue Murder]], in addition to her own solo work.\n\nShe has twice been nominated for the [[Mercury Music Prize]] for UK album of the year: in 1998 for ''Red Rice'', and again in 2003 for ''Anglicana''. Carthy was a guest on the album ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' by [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Wilco]]. Eliza and Billy also recorded together on the song \"My Father's Mansions\" which appeared on the [[Pete Seeger]] tribute album called ''Where Have All The Flowers Gone'' (1998). Thanks all bums are yummy.\n\nIn September 2002, Carthy took part in the tribute concert for [[Kirsty MacColl]], \"The Song's the Thing\" along with other artists.\n\nIn 2003, Carthy swept the boards at the [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards|Folk Awards]], winning 'Folk Singer of the Year', 'Best Album' (for ''Anglicana'') and 'Best Traditional Track' (for \"Worcester City\", on the album ''Anglicana''). She was also the first traditional English musician to be nominated for a [[BBC Radio 3]] Award for World Music in the same year (for ''Anglicana'').\n\nIn 2004, she was part of Oysterband Big Session, a collaboration with numerous folk artists brought together by [[Oysterband]]. They produced an album ''The Big Session Volume One'', and the group as a whole were awarded Best Group at the Folk Awards in 2005. On 29 May 2005, Carthy took part in a tribute to [[Peggy Seeger]] at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], London. A double CD ''Three Score and Ten'' (2007) contains highlights of the concert.\n\n[[File:Eliza Carthy with The Imagined Village 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Eliza Carthy performing with The Imagined Village at [[Camp Bestival]] \u2013 20 July 2008]]\nIn 2006, she contributed three songs (one as lead vocalist, two as backing vocalist) to ''[[Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys]]'', produced by [[Hal Willner]]. Performing as a duo with Richard Thompson, she contributed \"The Coo Coo Bird\" to a boxed set called ''The Harry Smith Project'' (2006) also by Hal Willner. As a duo with [[Bob Neuwirth]], she sang \"I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground\" by [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]] on the same boxed set.\n\n''[[Dreams of Breathing Underwater]]'', Carthy's second collection of self penned songs was released on 23 June 2008. Combining traditional instrumentation with experimental arrangements, and drawing influences from all aspects of her career so far, the album was conceived as the follow-up to 2000s ''Angels and Cigarettes'' and has been in the making for the best part of seven years.\n\nCarthy's 2008 tour was cancelled in November, as a cyst on her throat made singing inconsistent and painful. Because of her pregnancy, doctors delayed treatment until spring 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=115899&messages=10|title=Eliza Carthy - Farnham 8 November CANCELLED|first=Max|last=Spiegel|website=Mudcat.org|accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref> She became a mother to Florence Daisy on 24 December 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201073812/http://eliza-carthy.com/eliza/news.cfm?id=89|title=Eliza Carthy : Dreams of Breathing Underwater|date=1 February 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[St George's Day]] Celebrations in [[Trafalgar Square]] on 25 April 2009 were opened by Carthy who performed two songs.\n\nIn 2010, Carthy released an album of collaborations with her mother entitled ''Gift''. A BBC reviewer wrote: \"The gift in question here, one gathers, is a handing of talent from generation to generation; Norma Waterson and Eliza Carthy are, after all, the sublimely gifted mother and daughter who make up part of British folk\u2019s great dynasty.\" Commenting on the final song, \"Shallow Brown\", the reviewer noted: \"Backed variously by other family members, including Eliza\u2019s father Martin Carthy on guitar as well as her cousin Oliver Knight on electric guitar, vocals and cello, there is a real sense of congregation and rootedness about this song, and indeed this record as a whole.

The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. Later, other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \"backdoors\" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]].

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] writes:\n\n{{cquote|The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make ''high-quality decisions''. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome [[utility]] of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer.

Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

Instead, he proposes to engineer a coherent system of laws, ethics and morals with a top-most restriction to enforce social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's functional definition of morality:<ref>Haidt, Jonathan; Kesebir, Selin (2010) \"Chapter 22: Morality\" In Handbook of Social Psychology,  Fifth Edition, Hoboken NJ, Wiley, 2010, pp. 797-832.</ref> \"to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible\". He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt\u2019s functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans)|last = Waser|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Procedia Computer Science|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213|pmid = |pages = 106\u2013111|type = Print |volume=71}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===\n{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}\n\nWhile current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify it, a sufficiently advanced, rational, \"self-aware\" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] would not want to take a pill that makes him want to kill people.

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

{"title_page": "Travancore State Manual", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=April 2017}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Travancore State Manual''''' was a publication of the erstwhile [[Travancore kingdom]], written and published under the statutory command of the [[king of Travancore]]. The Travancore kingdom was located at the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, on its western side. \n''Travancore State Manual'' was written by [[V. Nagam Aiya]], who was then working as the [[Diwan of Travancore|Dewan Peishcar in Travancore]] government service. \n\nThe section on the Fauna of Travancore was contributed by [[Harold S. Ferguson]], Esq. (F. L. N., F. Z. S), who Nagam Aiya describes in the following words: \"a subject upon which he is an authority having spent nearly the whole of his life in the country, first as a Planter for several years on the Travancore Hills, then as the Guardian of the Princes, then as Commandant of one of the battalions in the Travancore army (Nayar Brigade), and lastly as the Director of the Government Museum and the Public Gardens at Trivandrum.\"\n\n== The writing ==\n\nV Nagam Aiya mentions that he was commanded by His Highness, the Maharajah of Travancore to write the ''Travancore State Manual'' with the simple instruction that it should follow the model of the district manuals of the Madras Presidency, which was under English rule.  However, he also mentions that the idea had been \u2018broached\u2019 to him by Dewan T. Rama Row, C.I.E., some fourteen years earlier.  At that time, Nagam Aiya had been working as the Dewan Peishcar and District Magistrate of Quilon.  Even though, the Dewan did obtain the Maharajah sanction for the project, the Dewan himself retired within a few months, and the matter was dropped. \n\nHowever, the matter was revived by Dewan Mr. K. Krishnaswamy Row, C.I.E., in 1901.  Nagam Aiya did a lot of pioneering and original research and work to obtain a lot of information for the preparation of this book. What came out was a book of \u2018encyclopaedic nature spread over a space of more than 1820 pages of letter-press\u2019. \n\nIt might be correct to think that Nagam Aiya did have this project in his mind, and he must have collected or at least noted down a lot of information much before he started on this work.  He started his work on this project as a full-time officer from December 1904. \n\n== Contents ==\n\nThe ''Travancore State Manual'' is a huge book not only on the antiquity of Travancore, but also of various other features of the place.  It is not a just a book on the history of the place. A detailed study and examination of the physical features, geology, Climate, Rainfall, Meteorology, Flora, Fauna, and Archaeology of the place is also there. \n\nDetailed writings are there on the geographical location, boundaries, shape and area of the landscape, mountains, plateaus, mountain passes,  rivers, canal and backwaters, coastline, ports, shipping facilities, economic geology of the place, climate, rainfall, meteorology, trees,  and medicinal plants, flowering and ornamental plants, birds and animals etc., archaeology, architecture, sculpture, coins, inscriptions, forts and military works, \u2018Archaeology\u2019, \u2018Fauna\u2019, census and population, language, economic condition  and various other things are dealt with, in a manner that should astound.\nThere are a number of photographs. Apart from that, there are many pictures of the stone inscriptions collected from various parts of the kingdom. \nThe latter part of the book deals in detail on the history of the localities that were later to be joined together to form Travancore kingdom.  The delineation of history starts from the Parasurama legend.  This legend is also mentioned in great detail.  Then it slowly moves to the times of the Perumals. \n\nMentions about the Malabar and Travancore coasts in the ancient maritime trade records are seen sourced out. \n\nThen the history part deals with the ancient kings. There is a mention of a Kurava King, who seems to have been assassinated in a premeditated conspiracy. \n\nThere is either detailed mention or detailed write-up on such items as early missionaries, neighbouring kingdoms, accounts of Travellers, Portuguese in Malabar and Travancore, Ettuvittial Pillamaar, Marthanda Varma, Zamorin, small kings  and kingdoms north of Travancore, small-time rulers of Malabar, the attacks and occupation attempts by Sultan Tipu etc. \n\nVelu Thampi Dalawa\u2019s rebellion is dealt with in details. Even though there is sympathy for the person, in a profound analysis, Nagam Aiya does not find his cause correct or praiseworthy.  The proclamation made by Velu Thampi from Kundara is quoted in an elaborate manner. However, a full reading of the same would not find it to be in sync with modern Indian aspirations.  \n\n'''QUOTE''': Velu Tampi was a daring and clever though unscrupulous man. Rebellion was his forte. '''END of QUOTE'''. \n\n'''QUOTE''': His favourite modes of punishment were: imprisonment, confiscation of property, public flogging, cutting off the palm of the hand, the ears or the nose, impalement or crucifying people by driving down nails on their chests to trees, and such like, too abhorrent to record here. '''END of QUOTE'''.\n\nAll rulers of Travancore, since the reign of King Marthanda Varma are dealt in reasonable detail. Swathi Thirunal\u2019s (King Rama Varma) tragic life has been mentioned.\n\n== Problems with the contents ==\n\nFrom the perspective of modern Indian history and sociology writings, this book has many issues which can make it a disturbance.  The main problem is that it is written in a sort of impartial and non-jingoistic manner.  \n\nThe writing of this book has been done from a most impartial manner with regard to caste and social issues. Even though Nagam Aiya is a Brahmin, there has been no attempt to portray any group or castes as above blame. In fact, the detailing is so honest, that not many modern Travancorians would actually like to recommend this book to anyone for a detailed reading. \n\nThe various false aspirations and claims of the various castes and the tragic sides of their lives have been portrayed with rare honesty. \n\nThe general culture of official corruption rampant in Travancore bureaucracy, which was more or less hereditary caste-based in mentioned in raw words. \nThe lower castes are also not mentioned in a praiseworthy manner. \n\nThe next item of jingoistic reproach would be the very obvious support to the English colonial rule. This feature can be felt in many pages dealing with the colonial times in the subcontinent.  In the very introduction of the book, Nagam Aiya mentions thus: \n\n'''QUOTE''': ultimate success of the English East India Company, our early friendships with them and the staunch support which they in return uniformly gave us through all vicissitudes of fortune, ultimately resulting in a strong bond of political alliance and reciprocal trust and confidence, which assured to us internal security and immunity from external aggression, thus enabling us to achieve the triumphs of peace and good government, until step by step we reached the enviable height of being known as the Model Native State\u2019 of India '''END OF QUOTE'''\n\nKing Marthanda Varma\u2019s words on his deathbed: '''QUOTE''': That, above all, the friendship existing between the English East India Company and Travancore should be maintained at any risk, and that full confidence should always be placed in the support and aid of that honourable association.\" '''END OF QUOTE''' is also mentioned in the book. \n\nThese kind of writings found in various parts of the book as well as other items of a similar kind does lend support to the feeling that Nagam Aiya was supportive of the English rulers in the neighbouring Madras Presidency. \n\nAnother item that can disturb modern folks in south Kerala would be the details given about the social revolts by the lower castes, such as the Ezhava, Shanars, Pulaya, Pariah etc. for social and political freedom.

The Travancore kingdom was located at the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, on its western side. \n''Travancore State Manual'' was written by [[V. Nagam Aiya]], who was then working as the Dewan Peishcar in Travancore government service. \n\nThe section on the Fauna of Travancore was contributed by [[Harold S. Ferguson]], Esq. (F. L. N., F. Z. S), who Nagam Aiya describes in the following words: \"a subject upon which he is an authority having spent nearly the whole of his life in the country, first as a Planter for several years on the Travancore Hills, then as the Guardian of the Princes, then as Commandant of one of the battalions in the Travancore army (Nayar Brigade), and lastly as the Director of the Government Museum and the Public Gardens at Trivandrum.\"\n\n== The writing ==\n\nV Nagam Aiya mentions that he was commanded by His Highness, the Maharajah of Travancore to write the ''Travancore State Manual'' with the simple instruction that it should follow the model of the district manuals of the Madras Presidency, which was under English rule.  However, he also mentions that the idea had been \u2018broached\u2019 to him by Dewan T. Rama Row, C.I.E., some fourteen years earlier.  At that time, Nagam Aiya had been working as the Dewan Peishcar and District Magistrate of Quilon.  Even though, the Dewan did obtain the Maharajah sanction for the project, the Dewan himself retired within a few months, and the matter was dropped. \n\nHowever, the matter was revived by Dewan Mr. K. Krishnaswamy Row, C.I.E., in 1901.  Nagam Aiya did a lot of pioneering and original research and work to obtain a lot of information for the preparation of this book. What came out was a book of \u2018encyclopaedic nature spread over a space of more than 1820 pages of letter-press\u2019. \n\nIt might be correct to think that Nagam Aiya did have this project in his mind, and he must have collected or at least noted down a lot of information much before he started on this work.  He started his work on this project as a full-time officer from December 1904. \n\n== Contents ==\n\nThe ''Travancore State Manual'' is a huge book not only on the antiquity of Travancore, but also of various other features of the place.  It is not a just a book on the history of the place. A detailed study and examination of the physical features, geology, Climate, Rainfall, Meteorology, Flora, Fauna, and Archaeology of the place is also there. \n\nDetailed writings are there on the geographical location, boundaries, shape and area of the landscape, mountains, plateaus, mountain passes,  rivers, canal and backwaters, coastline, ports, shipping facilities, economic geology of the place, climate, rainfall, meteorology, trees,  and medicinal plants, flowering and ornamental plants, birds and animals etc., archaeology, architecture, sculpture, coins, inscriptions, forts and military works, \u2018Archaeology\u2019, \u2018Fauna\u2019, census and population, language, economic condition  and various other things are dealt with, in a manner that should astound.\nThere are a number of photographs. Apart from that, there are many pictures of the stone inscriptions collected from various parts of the kingdom. \nThe latter part of the book deals in detail on the history of the localities that were later to be joined together to form Travancore kingdom.  The delineation of history starts from the Parasurama legend.  This legend is also mentioned in great detail.  Then it slowly moves to the times of the Perumals. \n\nMentions about the Malabar and Travancore coasts in the ancient maritime trade records are seen sourced out. \n\nThen the history part deals with the ancient kings. There is a mention of a Kurava King, who seems to have been assassinated in a premeditated conspiracy. \n\nThere is either detailed mention or detailed write-up on such items as early missionaries, neighbouring kingdoms, accounts of Travellers, Portuguese in Malabar and Travancore, Ettuvittial Pillamaar, Marthanda Varma, Zamorin, small kings  and kingdoms north of Travancore, small-time rulers of Malabar, the attacks and occupation attempts by Sultan Tipu etc. \n\nVelu Thampi Dalawa\u2019s rebellion is dealt with in details. Even though there is sympathy for the person, in a profound analysis, Nagam Aiya does not find his cause correct or praiseworthy.  The proclamation made by Velu Thampi from Kundara is quoted in an elaborate manner. However, a full reading of the same would not find it to be in sync with modern Indian aspirations.  \n\n'''QUOTE''': Velu Tampi was a daring and clever though unscrupulous man. Rebellion was his forte. '''END of QUOTE'''. \n\n'''QUOTE''': His favourite modes of punishment were: imprisonment, confiscation of property, public flogging, cutting off the palm of the hand, the ears or the nose, impalement or crucifying people by driving down nails on their chests to trees, and such like, too abhorrent to record here. '''END of QUOTE'''.\n\nAll rulers of Travancore, since the reign of King Marthanda Varma are dealt in reasonable detail. Swathi Thirunal\u2019s (King Rama Varma) tragic life has been mentioned.\n\n== Problems with the contents ==\n\nFrom the perspective of modern Indian history and sociology writings, this book has many issues which can make it a disturbance.  The main problem is that it is written in a sort of impartial and non-jingoistic manner.  \n\nThe writing of this book has been done from a most impartial manner with regard to caste and social issues. Even though Nagam Aiya is a Brahmin, there has been no attempt to portray any group or castes as above blame. In fact, the detailing is so honest, that not many modern Travancorians would actually like to recommend this book to anyone for a detailed reading. \n\nThe various false aspirations and claims of the various castes and the tragic sides of their lives have been portrayed with rare honesty. \n\nThe general culture of official corruption rampant in Travancore bureaucracy, which was more or less hereditary caste-based in mentioned in raw words. \nThe lower castes are also not mentioned in a praiseworthy manner. \n\nThe next item of jingoistic reproach would be the very obvious support to the English colonial rule. This feature can be felt in many pages dealing with the colonial times in the subcontinent.  In the very introduction of the book, Nagam Aiya mentions thus: \n\n'''QUOTE''': ultimate success of the English East India Company, our early friendships with them and the staunch support which they in return uniformly gave us through all vicissitudes of fortune, ultimately resulting in a strong bond of political alliance and reciprocal trust and confidence, which assured to us internal security and immunity from external aggression, thus enabling us to achieve the triumphs of peace and good government, until step by step we reached the enviable height of being known as the Model Native State\u2019 of India '''END OF QUOTE'''\n\nKing Marthanda Varma\u2019s words on his deathbed: '''QUOTE''': That, above all, the friendship existing between the English East India Company and Travancore should be maintained at any risk, and that full confidence should always be placed in the support and aid of that honourable association.\" '''END OF QUOTE''' is also mentioned in the book. \n\nThese kind of writings found in various parts of the book as well as other items of a similar kind does lend support to the feeling that Nagam Aiya was supportive of the English rulers in the neighbouring Madras Presidency. \n\nAnother item that can disturb modern folks in south Kerala would be the details given about the social revolts by the lower castes, such as the Ezhava, Shanars, Pulaya, Pariah etc. for social and political freedom. Enough and more historical incidences are mentioned that point to the fact that this social upheaval was the handiwork of the English Missionaries from the London Missionary Society.  Beyond that it is seen mentioned that each time such social problems happened, the English officials from Madras exerted pressure on the raja family to give the freedom that was demanded by the lower castes. \n\nHowever, Nagam Aiya does hint that the English rulers did not understand the social issues correctly. That even when the lower castes were given some freedom that had not been traditionally given to them, they used the occasion to go beyond what was allowed, and create social problems and rioting.\nThe history of such incidences could more or less deprive the claims of some lower castes leaders that they were the persons who had spearheaded the social revolution in Travancore. \n\nAnother item that can be actively disliked is the statement that Malayalam, the erstwhile language of Travancore kingdom, and currently the state language of Kerala, is of very recent origin. \n\n'''QUOTE''': Another fact disclosed by the statements already given is that the language of most of the inscriptions is Tamil.
