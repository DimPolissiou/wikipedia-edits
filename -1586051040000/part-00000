However, to merit the issuance of an \u201cSPG\u201d rating, the gravity of the material must, in the judgment of the Board, be leaning towards the maximum allowable for Parental Guidance rating. In determining the proper classification rating, the Board shall consider the purpose, genre, and time slot of the program as well as the treatment and depiction of attendant factors such as, but not limited to: Theme (''Tema''), Language (''Lenggwahe''), Violence (''Karahasan''), Sex (''Sekswal''), Horror and Drugs (''Droga'').\n\nIn the exercise of its judgment, the Board shall take due consideration of balancing the interest of the State to protect the welfare of the youth with the interest of the broadcast networks to freedom of expression.\n\nA pictogram advisory accompanied by a full-screen written advisory with voice over to the effect that the program is classified as \u201cStrong Parental Guidance\u201d shall be broadcast for at least 20 seconds, immediately before the opening credits and midway in the full airing of the particular television material classified as such.

The board may suspend, reject or cancel programs, but cannot revoke broadcast licenses.\n\n===Exemptions===\nNational and local newscasts are exempted from the ratings system (except in the case of selected news stories, such as in ABS-CBN's [[TV Patrol]], which uses an SPG graphic for stories with sensitive or graphic content). Some regional news programs and some [[CNN Philippines]] newscasts air a PG advisory before the show, which may violate the rules.

Cable channels (e.g., [[CNN Philippines]] and [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|ETC]]) that are carried by Free TV affiliates are required to follow the new rating system.\n\n[[Myx]], a cable television channel of ABS-CBN, originally adopted the blue PG graphic on October 6 for the majority of their programs, but reverted to the static '''Parental Guidance''' DOG only two weeks after, only in showing music videos with graphic content. This was due to the fact that it may be hard to place the PG DOG while a music video is played along with the lyrics being shown at the same time. On February 1, 2018, the music channel started to use a '''PG''' DOG which is a text version only when playing music videos. Sometime in April 2018, the DOG was changed into a variation of the blue 'PG' which is in color black. On July 30, 2018, upon the channel's inclusion on [[ABS-CBN TV Plus]], the standard blue 'PG' rating was used again.\n[[Jeepney TV]], [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]] also added the blue 'PG', green 'G' and red 'SPG' graphic at the same time as its mother network, but it is only applied to its public affairs programs which also air on ABS-CBN. Selected programs from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao contain the blue 'PG' graphic are aired from [[ABS-CBN Regional]] such as ''[[Agri Tayo Dito]]'', ''[[Kapamilya, Mas Winner Ka!]]'', ''[[Mag TV Na]]'' (three of them were cancelled at the end of June 2018 as a part of cost-cutting measures to digitize all ABS-CBN Regional stations)<ref>[https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/abs-cbn-regional-cancels-agri-tayo-dito-magtv-na/ ABS-CBN Regional cancels Agri Tayo Dito, MagTV na] accessed June 30, 2018 </ref> and various morning shows and public affairs programs (since the end of 2017, one of which is ''Ano Ngani?'' of TV-2 Tacloban, ''Arangkada'' of TV-2 Cagayan de Oro, ''[[Bida Kapampangan]]'' of TV-46 Pampanga and ''Salandigan'' of TV-4 Bacolod plus Saturday morning editions of ''[[Maayong Buntag Kapamilya]]'' (TV-3 Cebu) and ''[[Maayong Buntag Mindanao]]'' (TV-4 Davao) extend their broadcast on Saturday effective from December 2014) with the exception of the green 'G' and red 'SPG' graphics.\n\nAmong local cable networks, ABS-CBN's [[Balls (TV channel)|Balls]], Global Pinoy Cinema and [[Lifestyle (TV channel)|Lifestyle]] (formerly Lifestyle Network and relaunched since 2018 as [[Metro Channel]]), as well as Solar Entertainment's [[Solar Sports]] and [[Jack TV]] continue to adopt the earlier static 'Parental Guidance' graphic on their programs (although channels like [[Cinema One]], [[Pinoy Box Office]], [[Tagalized Movie Channel]], [[Viva TV (Philippines)|Viva TV]], [[Zee Sine]], [[Fox Filipino]], [[AXN Asia]], [[Animax Asia]], [[GEM TV Asia|GEM]], [[History (Southeast Asian TV channel)|History Asia]], [[Lifetime (South East Asia)|Lifetime Asia]], [[Crime & Investigation Network (South East Asia)|Crime & Investigation Network Asia]], and [[FYI (Southeast Asia TV channel)|Fyi Asia]], have a full screen advisory regularly aired before the show/movie without the static 'Parental Guidance' graphic) together with [[Sari-Sari Channel]], the newest cable channel owned by [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5 Network Inc.]] and [[Viva Entertainment|Viva Communications Inc.]] starting January 15, 2016.\n\nIBC 13 does not use either the blue 'PG', green 'G' or red 'SPG' graphics on selected programs and documentaries produced by the government-controlled [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)#Presidential Communications Operations Office|Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)]] (PCOO), considering that they are information-based materials.\n\n[[Fox Channel Asia|Fox (Asia)]], [[Fox Life]], [[National Geographic (Asia)|National Geographic]] and [[Fox Movies (Asia)|Fox Movies]] use their own rating systems, and [[Cartoon Network (Philippines)|Cartoon Network]] has 'PG' rating systems for selected programs which contains themes, violence, adult content, and thriller.\n\nSince January 1, 2013, [[Jack TV]] and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] use the abbreviated PG and SPG on the bottom right corner of the screen indicating the rating of the show. As the channel does not subscribe to MTRCB's new system, the SPG rating does not have sub-ratings.\n\nIn May 2018, [[Yey!]], [[Cine Mo!]] and [[Knowledge Channel]], which are all exclusive channels for [[ABS-CBN TV Plus]], has began subscribing to the MTRCB rating system. The channels are using the MTRCB advisory before the show starts, and they adopted the green 'G', blue 'PG' and red 'SPG' graphic, replacing the old \"(Strong) Parental Guidance\" DOG.\n\n[[Cebu Catholic Television Network]] (CCTN) didn't show a 'PG' advisory. But, they adopted only the blue 'PG' graphic. In some talk shows, they don't show the blue 'PG' graphic.\n\nFor newscasts, the MTRCB DOGs were not present in all newscasts except for the following:\n* [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]'s ''[[TV Patrol]]'', ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'' and ''[[News Patrol]]'' use the red '''SPG''' for sensitive content.\n* [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]]'s ''[[Aksyon]]'' uses the '''SPG''' DOG, which is shown permanently on the upper left corner of the screen, for coarse language, usually for ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'', which was the first newscast to be rated 'SPG' by the MTRCB because of their segment \"Itimbre Mo Kay Tulfo\" where anchor Raffy Tulfo solves issues by calling those involved in the issue, with occasional profanities or other similar insults thrown by both parties which cannot be censored in a live program. \n* ''[[CNN Philippines Cebuano News|Cebuano News]]'' and ''[[CNN Philippines Kapampangan News|Kapampangan News]]'', both from [[CNN Philippines]] (formerly [[Solar News Channel]] and [[9TV]]), show the blue '''PG''' advisory at the start but doesn't show the ''PG'' DOG during the newscast themselves.\n\n==Home videos==\nThe [[Optical Media Board]] formerly governed [[censorship]] for home video releases; this has since been managed by the MTRCB.\n\nBefore 2015, unlike the theatrical ratings, only three are applied to video releases and printed on labels: General Audience (G) for films previously rated G in cinemas, Parental Guidance (PG) for most PG and some R-13 or R-16 titles (with cuts for the R-ratings), and Restricted For Adults (R) for some R-13, many R-16, and most R-18 titles [without cuts for R-16 and R-18, including films released unrated or with adults-only rating equivalents (e.g. R, 18+, M18, NC-17, Category III, R21) outside the Philippines].\n\nSince 2015, the theatrical ratings were applied as home video ratings, replacing the former three-rating system.\n\nIn addition to issuing ratings for home video, the MTRCB also conducts routine inspections at public transport terminals where passenger buses equipped with onboard entertainment systems can be found, to ensure that the films in question are approved by the MTRCB and Optical Media Board for public exhibition and are free of obscene content.<ref name=\"cubao\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/560116/metro/mtrcb-conducts-surprise-inspection-at-cubao-bus-station|title=MTRCB conducts surprise inspection at Cubao bus station|work=[[GMA News]]|publisher=[[GMA Network]]|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Content reprimand==\nThe MTRCB does not only rates movies and shows, but they also reserve the right to [[Suspension (punishment)|suspend]] a certain program for a few days to a few months, ban movies, or even impose self-regulation on a certain program depending on the gravity of the violation as a means of disciplinary action. The following cases involving local and international content have been reprimanded due to the following issues with their content or cast.\n\n===Minor and government television networks in the Philippines===\n* On August 16, 2004, MTRCB preemptively suspended the showing of the ''[[Ang Dating Daan]]'' on [[UNTV (Philippines)|UNTV]] for 20 days due to slander and use of offensive and obscene language by its televangelist-host [[Eliseo Soriano]], as a mean of disciplinary action.\n* During the 2007 elections, [[DZRJ-DTV|RJTV]] aired political advertisements for the electoral alliance [[Genuine Opposition]] containing offensive and obscene language; they were later pulled off.\n*On July 27, 2019, [[People's Television Network]]'s [[PCSO Lottery Draw]] the program was put into hiatus following orders from President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] to suspend all gambling-related operations of [[Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office|PCSO]] due to corruption allegations.

Certain portions of the film, especially the portions with regard to the [[2001 EDSA Revolution]], were deemed by the MTRCB to be inciting political rebellion, a charge denied by the producers of the documentary.\n\n===Use of Movie Ratings in Television===\n[[Celestial Movies Pinoy#Celestial Movies Pinoy (Philippines)|Celestial Movies Pinoy]] uses an advisory for these movie ratings before showing of the film, instead of television ratings.\n\n===[[Television content rating system|Television]]===\nThe MTRCB has implemented a television content rating system since November 1, 1995. Historically, there were only two television ratings used (see the table below). These ratings consisted of a plain text [[digital on-screen graphic]] (or pictogram) appearing on the corner of the screen during a program's run time:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ System used from November 1, 1995 to October 5, 2011<br>February 11, 2015 - May 9, 2018 ([[Cine Mo!]] and [[Yey!]] only)<br>July 20, 2019 to present ([[People's Television Network|PTV-4]] and Island Living on BEAM TV only).\n|-\n!

The rating voice-overs are usually in Filipino, but predominantly English-language stations have the ratings notice spoken in English. Ratings notices were previously broadcast in a 4:3 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], but has since been broadcast in a 16:9 [[widescreen]] format.\n\nThe green 'G', blue 'PG' and red 'SPG' graphic/DOG below are usually seen on the lower right or upper left corner of the screen during the entire show.\n\n<!--PROGRAMS ARE NOT NEEDED TO BE ENUMERATED.

Use of a strong expletive in a sexual context or sexually-based expletives shall not be allowed.

No detail or prolonged showing of violence or suffering.\n# ''Horror'' \u2013 Scary sequences must be mild and brief.\n# ''Drugs'' \u2013 There may only be implied depiction of prohibited drugs and/or substances or their use provided it does not condone, encourage or glamorize drug and/or substance use and it should be necessary to the theme and characterization.\n\nA pictogram advisory accompanied by full-screen written and verbal advisory to the effect that the program is classified as \u201cParental Guidance\u201d shall be broadcast for at least 10 seconds immediately before the opening credits of the particular television material classified as such. [[GMA Network]]'s ''[[Wowowin]]'' airs two PG DOGs, the second one being the cue for regional stations to join in the Manila feed.\n\n====Strong Parental Guidance / ''Striktong Patnubay at Gabay'' (\u201cSPG\u201d)====\n[[File:MTRCB Strong Parental Guidance.svg|100px|right]] [[File:MTRCB Strong Parental Guidance Filipino.svg|100px|right]]\n\n<span style=\"background:#ff0000; color:white\">&nbsp;'''SPG'''&nbsp;</span> '''Stronger and more vigilant parental guidance is suggested'''. Programs classified as \u201cSPG\u201d may contain more serious topics and themes, which may not be advisable for children to watch except under the very vigilant guidance and presence of a parent or an adult.\n\nTelevision programs classified as \u201cSPG\u201d must still fall within the parameters of the existing Parental Guidance classification rating. However, to merit the issuance of an \u201cSPG\u201d rating, the gravity of the material must, in the judgment of the Board, be leaning towards the maximum allowable for Parental Guidance rating. In determining the proper classification rating, the Board shall consider the purpose, genre, and time slot of the program as well as the treatment and depiction of attendant factors such as, but not limited to: Theme (''Tema''), Language (''Lenggwahe''), Violence (''Karahasan''), Sex (''Sekswal''), Horror and Drugs (''Droga'').\n\nIn the exercise of its judgment, the Board shall take due consideration of balancing the interest of the State to protect the welfare of the youth with the interest of the broadcast networks to freedom of expression.\n\nA pictogram advisory accompanied by a full-screen written advisory with voice over to the effect that the program is classified as \u201cStrong Parental Guidance\u201d shall be broadcast for at least 20 seconds, immediately before the opening credits and midway in the full airing of the particular television material classified as such.

The material shall be disapproved for television broadcast if, in the judgment of the Board applying contemporary Filipino cultural values as standard, it is objectionable for being immoral, indecent, contrary to law and/or good customs, injurious to the prestige of the Republic of the Philippines or its people, or with a dangerous tendency to encourage the commission of violence, or of a wrong, or crime, such as but not limited to:\n# The work depicts in a patently lewd, offensive, or demeaning manner, excretory functions, and sexual conduct such as sexual intercourse, masturbation and exhibition of the genitals.\n# The work clearly constitutes an attack against any race, creed or religion.\n# The work condones or encourages the use of illegal drugs and substances.\n# The work tends to undermine the faith and confidence of the people in their government and/or duly constituted authorities.\n# The work glorifies criminals or condones crimes.\n# The work is libelous or defamatory to the good name and reputation of any person, whether living or dead.\n# The work may constitute contempt of court of a quasi-judicial tribunal, or may pertain to matters, which are subjudicial in nature.\n\nAll programs shown by the television channels are reviewed and classified by the said board. The board may suspend, reject or cancel programs, but cannot revoke broadcast licenses.\n\n===Exemptions of Television Ratings===\nNational and local newscasts are exempted from the ratings system (except in the case of selected news stories, such as in ABS-CBN's [[TV Patrol]], which uses an SPG graphic for stories with sensitive or graphic content). Some regional news programs and some [[CNN Philippines]] newscasts air a PG advisory before the show, which may violate the rules. These circumstances, however, do not affect the program itself.{{cn|date=March 2017}} [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]'s ''[[Aksyon|Aksyon sa Tanghali]]'', on the other hand, is given a Strong Parental Guidance rating since April 2018 due to its public service segments profane nature. The rating also includes the news segments of the said edition.\n\nMTRCB cannot censor, rate, and use its power in films and shows presented in the University of the Philippines Film Center and its various grounds and venues.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Timeline of Television Ratings===\nThis timeline shows when did the networks first used the system (this pertains only to the G and PG ratings, the SPG rating has been adopted simultaneously by almost all of the networks).\n\n* [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]] (formerly [[Studio 23]]) and [[People's Television Network|PTV]] on October 6, 2011\n* [[UNTV (Philippines)|UNTV]] on October 7, 2011\n* [[Shop TV]] on October 8, 2011\n* [[GMA Network]] and [[GMA News TV]] on October 10, 2011\n* [[5 (TV channel)|5]] (formerly TV5), [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]] and [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports]] (formerly [[5 Plus]] and [[AksyonTV]]), on October 11, 2011\n* [[Net 25]] on October 12, 2011\n* [[ZOE Broadcasting Network|Light Network]] on October 14, 2011\n* [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|RJTV]] and [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] on October 26, 2011 <!---CNN Philippines is formerly Solar News Channel and TalkTV so no need to separate its implementation--->\n* [[Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media|BEAM TV]] on October 30, 2011 <!---Implemented since The Game Channel era--->\n* [[Global News Network|GNN]] and Global Pinoy Cinema on October 31, 2011\n* [[Central Luzon Television|CLTV 36]] on October 11, 2011\n* [[Sonshine Media Network International|SMNI]] (selected programs only) on January 26, 2012\n* [[DZCE-TV|INC TV]] (formerly GEM TV), on April 12, 2012\n* [[Jeepney TV]] on January 1, 2014\n* [[Yey!]] and [[Cine Mo!]] on May 10, 2018\n* [[Knowledge Channel]] on May 25, 2018\n* [[Asianovela Channel]], [[Movie Central (Philippines)|Movie Central]], [[Myx]] and [[O Shopping]] (digital platform and [[Cignal]] only) on July 30, 2018\n\nThe board gave a deadline of until October 31, 2011 for the other national, local, cable, and satellite [[television network]]s to switch onto the new graphic, although some of the programs adopted the system at a later date, or did not adopt at all. Cable channels (e.g., [[CNN Philippines]] and [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|ETC]]) that are carried by Free TV affiliates are required to follow the new rating system.\n\n[[Myx]], a cable television channel of ABS-CBN, originally adopted the blue PG graphic on October 6 for the majority of their programs, but reverted to the static '''Parental Guidance''' DOG only two weeks after, only in showing music videos with graphic content. This was due to the fact that it may be hard to place the PG DOG while a music video is played along with the lyrics being shown at the same time. On February 1, 2018, the music channel started to use a '''PG''' DOG which is a text version only when playing music videos. Sometime in April 2018, the DOG was changed into a variation of the blue 'PG' which is in color black. On July 30, 2018, upon the channel's inclusion on [[ABS-CBN TV Plus]], the standard blue 'PG' rating was used again.\n[[Jeepney TV]], [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]] also added the blue 'PG', green 'G' and red 'SPG' graphic at the same time as its mother network, but it is only applied to its public affairs programs which also air on ABS-CBN. Selected programs from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao contain the blue 'PG' graphic are aired from [[ABS-CBN Regional]] such as ''[[Agri Tayo Dito]]'', ''[[Kapamilya, Mas Winner Ka!]]'', ''[[Mag TV Na]]'' (three of them were cancelled at the end of June 2018 as a part of cost-cutting measures to digitize all ABS-CBN Regional stations)<ref>[https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/abs-cbn-regional-cancels-agri-tayo-dito-magtv-na/ ABS-CBN Regional cancels Agri Tayo Dito, MagTV na] accessed June 30, 2018 </ref> and various morning shows and public affairs programs (since the end of 2017, one of which is ''Ano Ngani?'' of TV-2 Tacloban, ''Arangkada'' of TV-2 Cagayan de Oro, ''[[Bida Kapampangan]]'' of TV-46 Pampanga and ''Salandigan'' of TV-4 Bacolod plus Saturday morning editions of ''[[Maayong Buntag Kapamilya]]'' (TV-3 Cebu) and ''[[Maayong Buntag Mindanao]]'' (TV-4 Davao) extend their broadcast on Saturday effective from December 2014) with the exception of the green 'G' and red 'SPG' graphics.\n\nAmong local cable networks, ABS-CBN's [[Balls (TV channel)|Balls]], Global Pinoy Cinema and [[Lifestyle (TV channel)|Lifestyle]] (formerly Lifestyle Network and relaunched since 2018 as [[Metro Channel]]), as well as Solar Entertainment's [[Solar Sports]] and [[Jack TV]] continue to adopt the earlier static 'Parental Guidance' graphic on their programs (although channels like [[Cinema One]], [[Pinoy Box Office]], [[Tagalized Movie Channel]], [[Viva TV (Philippines)|Viva TV]], [[Zee Sine]], [[Fox Filipino]], [[AXN Asia]], [[Animax Asia]], [[GEM TV Asia|GEM]], [[History (Southeast Asian TV channel)|History Asia]], [[Lifetime (South East Asia)|Lifetime Asia]], [[Crime & Investigation Network (South East Asia)|Crime & Investigation Network Asia]], and [[FYI (Southeast Asia TV channel)|Fyi Asia]], have a full screen advisory regularly aired before the show/movie without the static 'Parental Guidance' graphic) together with [[Sari-Sari Channel]], the newest cable channel owned by [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5 Network Inc.]] and [[Viva Entertainment|Viva Communications Inc.]] starting January 15, 2016.\n\nIBC 13 does not use either the blue 'PG', green 'G' or red 'SPG' graphics on selected programs and documentaries produced by the government-controlled [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)#Presidential Communications Operations Office|Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)]] (PCOO), considering that they are information-based materials.\n\n[[Fox Channel Asia|Fox (Asia)]], [[Fox Life]], [[National Geographic (Asia)|National Geographic]] and [[Fox Movies (Asia)|Fox Movies]] use their own rating systems, and [[Cartoon Network (Philippines)|Cartoon Network]] has 'PG' rating systems for selected programs which contains themes, violence, adult content, and thriller.\n\nSince January 1, 2013, [[Jack TV]] and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] use the abbreviated PG and SPG on the bottom right corner of the screen indicating the rating of the show. As the channel does not subscribe to MTRCB's new system, the SPG rating does not have sub-ratings.\n\nIn May 2018, [[Yey!]], [[Cine Mo!]] and [[Knowledge Channel]], which are all exclusive channels for [[ABS-CBN TV Plus]], has began subscribing to the MTRCB rating system.

The rate is determined for a cohort of students who all entered any high school for the first time during the same school year.   The Pennsylvania Department of Education, Division of Data Quality, compiles statistical information covering the 4-Year, 5-Year, and 6-Year Graduation Rates for Pennsylvania public schools. Pennsylvania's public high schools provide the graduate and enrollment data through the Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS), which is used to calculate the above rates. However, for three sequential audits, 2010, 2013, and 2015 by the Pennsylvania Auditor General, the SCASD has been cited for PIMS deficiencies. Contact the SCASD or the Auditor General for copies of the audit reports.\n\nBelow are the graduation rates contained in the Pennsylvania Department of Education, Data and Statistics, Cohort Graduation Rates, 4-year cohort.\n\n*2015 - 91%\n*2014 - 93%\n*2013 - 94%\n*2012 - 93%\n*2011 - 96%\n*2010 - 93% \n*2009 - 95.7% <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scasd.org/page/616 |title=State College Area School District Report about the district |author=State College Area School District Administration |year=2009}}</ref>\n*2008 - 95% <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19002039/State-College-Area-School-District-Report-Card-2008 |title=State College Area School District Report Card 2008 |author=The Times Tribune |year=2009}}</ref>\n*2007 - 94% <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23571629/PA-High-School-Graduation-Info-by-School-District-2007 |author=Pennsylvania Partnerships for Children |title=High School Graduation rate 2007 |access-date=February 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105062625/http://www.scribd.com/doc/23571629/PA-High-School-Graduation-Info-by-School-District-2007 |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===State College Area High School===\nIn 2015 the high school had an ADM enrollment of 2,358 students (a decrease of 180 over five years).

The school board plans [http://www.scasd.org/2497_10012214422/blank/browse.asp?A=383&BMDRN=2000&BCOB=0&C=53203&2497Nav=|&NodeID=409 High School Facilities Plan] to demolish one of the high school buildings and disintegrate the other.  The school board believes this is the most cost effective option and that they have looked at all of the options.  State High Vision, an organization of some community citizens, claims that the plan was decided on with little community input.  SHV also does not like the creation of what they deem a mega-school (3,400 students in one building), claiming that students learn better in a smaller environment.  About 200 students held walk outs in protest of the renovation project in 2007. Eric Topp provides a comprehensive description of the hullabaloo and opined incompetence by the school board at: http://www.erictopp.net/5.html  State College Area School District in Pennsylvania several years ago abandoned plans to build a new high school.    In May 2011 the district received  notice that it owed $10 million to the Royal Bank of Canada for skipping an interest payment on money it never borrowed for a school it didn't build. The State College case has an unusual twist reported by the Wall Street Journal. the district agreed to swap interest rates before it borrowed the money, called a forward swap; it filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court saying their ignorance made the contract void. The district skipped its first payment\u2014for $978,000. Royal Bank of Canada says the school authorized the debt\u2014even if it never borrowed money for the project\u2014and that the swap is valid. The court agreed. The SCASD earned the distinction of approving the only forward SWAP  by a school district in Pennsylvania and probably in the nation.  It was a failed attempt to circumvent the then new Pennsylvania Act 1 (2006) requiring public referendum for excessive constructive spending.. They did this despite advice from financial advisors not to.

The school board committed during public meetings urging support of the referendum that the cost would not exceed $115 million ($85 million debt plus $30 million capital reserve). During a March 28, 2016 school board meeting the total project cost was stated as $137,249,182, an increase of $7 million before construction has begun. http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article68731897.html#navlink=SecList Other estimates projected a total cost of $143 million. In June 2016, with construction only beginning, the actual cost increased to $140 million (22 percent over budget). http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/article85942462.html#navlink=Lead    Other estimates, by State College Watchdog, project a total cost of $150 million (30 percent over budget). The district superintendent Robert O'Donnell reportedly explained during a school board meeting on July 25 that the referendum was approved to pay for a concept not a project plan commitment of $115 million. The local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times printed an opinion article, \"Don't Be Fooled\" which accused the school district of strategic misrepresentation with respect to financial planning.http://www.centredaily.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article115985388.html#navlink=Lead\n\n==Elementary schools==\nThe SCASD has nine elementary schools.

Community emphasis and preference was to retain and refurbish neighborhood elementary schools as the top priority.  Despite the excellence and wide acceptance of the 2008 Master Plan.  District administrators and school board members had the plan rewritten in 2013 to favor closing smaller neighborhood schools, such as Corl Street and Lemont, in order to create larger consolidated elementary schools. The new plan was met with fierce opposition from the community. The local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times, archives provide details. Many residents contended that the proposals for mega elementary schools were costly, wasteful of valuable resources, and poorly envisioned for its historic properties. In particular, the proposal to close Lemont Elementary School [http://www.scasd.org/lemont/site/default.asp], a splendid limestone structure from the 1930s in the historic village of Lemont,  garnered community involvement. A group opposed to its closing has formed as the [http://www.friendsoflemontschool.roundtablelive.org/ Friends of Lemont School] to convince the District to remain committed to neighborhood schools and be respectful of its historic schools through rehabilitating them rather than abandoning them. In June 2016 the school board announced it will most likely close (called \"repurpose\" in education speak)  neighborhood schools again despite protests from parents and teachers.  Advocates speaking at high attendance public meetings emphasized that consolidating neighborhood schools contravened the 2008\u20132009 District Wide Facilities Master Plan in which refurbishment of neighborhood schools was afforded top priority.  Instead, in 2013, the priority was changed to building a mostly new high school (again exceeding the announced cost).  Architects and new consultants were hired to sell the revised master plan. As of June, 2014 with construction only beginning, the announced cost  increased from $115 to $140 million (an increase of $25 million or 22 percent). http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/article85942462.html#navlink=SecList\n\nThe $25 million high school cost overrun, as of June 2016, is more than half of the funds needed to refurbish all the elementary schools.\n\n==Special education==\nThe SCASD has not reported information for this section since 2010.

Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, Act 511 Tax Report, 2004</ref>  The millage rate increased 34 percent in ten years (3.4 percent average) during the same period that inflation increased 1.95 percent\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*2016\u20132017 - 43.473 mills a 4.32 percent increase over 2015\u20132016\n*2015\u20132016 - 41.674 mills a 5.5 percent increase\n*2014\u20132015 - 39.506 mills<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centredaily.com/2014/06/23/4237495/tax-increase-set-for-state-college.html?sp=/99/264/&ihp=1 |title=Tax increase set for State College Area School District residents |author=Centre Daily Times |date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>\n*2013\u20132014 - 38.75 mills<ref>M Morgan., State College school board OKs budget with tax increase, The Centre Daily Times, June 10, 2013</ref>\n*2012\u20132013 - 37.7300 mills <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Rates by School District 2012-13 Real Estate Mills, 2012</ref>\n*2011\u20132012 - 36.8500 mills <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011}}</ref>\n*2010\u20132011 - 35.9000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/40141929/Pennsylvania-Department-of-Education-Finances-Real-Estate-Tax-Rates-2010-2011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2010-11}}</ref>\n*2009\u20132010 - 34.8500 mills.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010</ref>\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n*2008\u20132009 - 33.7219 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/25369575/Pennsylvania-School-District-Real-Estate-Tax-Rates-2008-09 |title=Pennsylvania School District Real Estate Tax Rates 2008-09 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015024221/http://www.scribd.com/doc/25369575/Pennsylvania-School-District-Real-Estate-Tax-Rates-2008-09 |archive-date=2013-10-15 |df= }}</ref>\n*2007\u20132008 - 32.5130 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2008}}</ref>\n*2006\u20132007 - 32.5660 mills.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006</ref>\n*2005\u20132006 - 31.3730 mills.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005</ref>\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe average yearly property tax paid by Centre County residents amounts to about 3.34% of their yearly income.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010\u20132011 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines, 2010</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the State College Area School District 2006\u20132007 through 2011\u20132016\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqCAjQ6eteArdFFCaWRjMUhzSkl5RTYxMjNJN1RQemc&hl=en#gid=0 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for  2006-2007 through 2010-2011, |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*2006\u20132007 - 3.9%, Base 3.9%\n*2007\u20132008 - 3.4%, Base 3.4%\n*2008\u20132009 - 4.4%, Base 4.4%\n*2009\u20132010 - 4.1%, Base 4.1%\n*2010\u20132011 - 2.9%, Base 2.9%\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n*2011\u20132012 - 1.4%, Base 1.4% <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol40/40-38/1760.html |title=Index Calculation Required by the Taxpayer Relief Act |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=Sep 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Data Elements}}</ref>\n*2012\u20132013 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, September 2011</ref>\n*2013\u20132014 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, September 2012</ref>\n*2014\u20132015 - 2.1%, Base 2.1% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-2015 School District Adjusted Index, September 2013</ref>\n*2015\u20132016 - 5.5%, Base 1.9%\n*2016\u20132017 - 4.3%, Base 2.4%\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''For the 2015\u201316, and 2015\u20132017''' '''budget years,''' the State College Area School board levied the maxim Act 1 permitted tax increase with exceptions of 5.5 and 4.32 percent respectively.\n\n'''For the 2015\u201316 and 2015\u20132017 budget years,''' the State College Area School board did not evidence any attempt to restrain increased spending.\n\n'''For the 2013\u20132014 budget year''', State College Area School Board applied for one exception to exceed their Act 1 Index limit due to rapidly escalating teacher pension costs.

So are many parents. In plain English, the SCASD has a graduation rate of 91 percent for those students attending four years of high school. The SCASD does not explain its 97.5 graduation rate.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Education introduced cohort graduation rates in 2010\u20132011. The cohort graduation rates are a calculation of the percentage of students who have graduated with a regular high school diploma within a designated number of years since the student first entered high school. The rate is determined for a cohort of students who all entered any high school for the first time during the same school year.   The Pennsylvania Department of Education, Division of Data Quality, compiles statistical information covering the 4-Year, 5-Year, and 6-Year Graduation Rates for Pennsylvania public schools. Pennsylvania's public high schools provide the graduate and enrollment data through the Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS), which is used to calculate the above rates. However, for three sequential audits, 2010, 2013, and 2015 by the Pennsylvania Auditor General, the SCASD has been cited for PIMS deficiencies.

The school board plans [http://www.scasd.org/2497_10012214422/blank/browse.asp?A=383&BMDRN=2000&BCOB=0&C=53203&2497Nav=|&NodeID=409 High School Facilities Plan] to demolish one of the high school buildings and disintegrate the other.  The school board believes this is the most cost effective option and that they have looked at all of the options.  State High Vision, an organization of some community citizens, claims that the plan was decided on with little community input.  SHV also does not like the creation of what they deem a mega-school (3,400 students in one building), claiming that students learn better in a smaller environment.  About 200 students held walk outs in protest of the renovation project in 2007. Eric Topp provides a comprehensive description of the hullabaloo and opined incompetence by the school board at: http://www.erictopp.net/5.html  State College Area School District in Pennsylvania several years ago abandoned plans to build a new high school.    In May 2011 the district received  notice that it owed $10 million to the Royal Bank of Canada for skipping an interest payment on money it never borrowed for a school it didn't build. The State College case has an unusual twist reported by the Wall Street Journal. the district agreed to swap interest rates before it borrowed the money, called a forward swap; it filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court saying their ignorance made the contract void. The district skipped its first payment\u2014for $978,000. Royal Bank of Canada says the school authorized the debt\u2014even if it never borrowed money for the project\u2014and that the swap is valid. The court agreed. The SCASD earned the distinction of approving the only forward SWAP  by a school district in Pennsylvania and probably in the nation.  It was a failed attempt to circumvent the then new Pennsylvania Act 1 (2006) requiring public referendum for excessive constructive spending.. They did this despite advice from financial advisors not to.

The school board committed during public meetings urging support of the referendum that the cost would not exceed $115 million ($85 million debt plus $30 million capital reserve). During a March 28, 2016 school board meeting the total project cost was stated as $137,249,182, an increase of $7 million before construction has begun. http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article68731897.html#navlink=SecList Other estimates projected a total cost of $143 million. In June 2016, with construction only beginning, the actual cost increased to $140 million (22 percent over budget). http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/article85942462.html#navlink=Lead    Other estimates, by State College Watchdog, project a total cost of $150 million (30 percent over budget). The district superintendent Robert O'Donnell reportedly explained during a school board meeting on July 25 that the referendum was approved to pay for a concept not a project plan commitment of $115 million. The local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times printed an opinion article, \"Don't Be Fooled\" which accused the school district of strategic misrepresentation with respect to financial planning.http://www.centredaily.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article115985388.html#navlink=Lead\n\n==Elementary schools==\nThe SCASD has nine elementary schools.

Community emphasis and preference was to retain and refurbish neighborhood elementary schools as the top priority.  Despite the excellence and wide acceptance of the 2008 Master Plan.  District administrators and school board members had the plan rewritten in 2013 to favor closing smaller neighborhood schools, such as Corl Street and Lemont, in order to create larger consolidated elementary schools. The new plan was met with fierce opposition from the community. The local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times, archives provide details. Many residents contended that the proposals for mega elementary schools were costly, wasteful of valuable resources, and poorly envisioned for its historic properties. In particular, the proposal to close Lemont Elementary School [http://www.scasd.org/lemont/site/default.asp], a splendid limestone structure from the 1930s in the historic village of Lemont,  garnered community involvement. A group opposed to its closing has formed as the [http://www.friendsoflemontschool.roundtablelive.org/ Friends of Lemont School] to convince the District to remain committed to neighborhood schools and be respectful of its historic schools through rehabilitating them rather than abandoning them. In June 2016 the school board announced it will most likely close (called \"repurpose\" in education speak)  neighborhood schools again despite protests from parents and teachers.  Advocates speaking at high attendance public meetings emphasized that consolidating neighborhood schools contravened the 2008\u20132009 District Wide Facilities Master Plan in which refurbishment of neighborhood schools was afforded top priority.  Instead, in 2013, the priority was changed to building a mostly new high school (again exceeding the announced cost).  Architects and new consultants were hired to sell the revised master plan. As of June, 2014 with construction only beginning, the announced cost  increased from $115 to $140 million (an increase of $25 million or 22 percent). http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/article85942462.html#navlink=SecList\n\nThe $25 million high school cost overrun, as of June 2016, is more than half of the funds needed to refurbish all the elementary schools.\n\n==Special education==\nThe SCASD has not reported information for this section since 2010.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010\u20132011 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines, 2010</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the State College Area School District 2006\u20132007 through 2011\u20132016\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqCAjQ6eteArdFFCaWRjMUhzSkl5RTYxMjNJN1RQemc&hl=en#gid=0 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for  2006-2007 through 2010-2011, |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*2006\u20132007 - 3.9%, Base 3.9%\n*2007\u20132008 - 3.4%, Base 3.4%\n*2008\u20132009 - 4.4%, Base 4.4%\n*2009\u20132010 - 4.1%, Base 4.1%\n*2010\u20132011 - 2.9%, Base 2.9%\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n*2011\u20132012 - 1.4%, Base 1.4% <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol40/40-38/1760.html |title=Index Calculation Required by the Taxpayer Relief Act |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=Sep 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Data Elements}}</ref>\n*2012\u20132013 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, September 2011</ref>\n*2013\u20132014 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, September 2012</ref>\n*2014\u20132015 - 2.1%, Base 2.1% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-2015 School District Adjusted Index, September 2013</ref>\n*2015\u20132016 - 5.5%, Base 1.9%\n*2016\u20132017 - 4.3%, Base 2.4%\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''For the 2015\u201316, and 2015\u20132017''' '''budget years,''' the State College Area School board levied the maxim Act 1 permitted tax increase with exceptions of 5.5 and 4.32 percent respectively.\n\n'''For the 2015\u201316 and 2015\u20132017 budget years,''' the State College Area School board did not evidence any attempt to restrain increased spending.\n\n'''For the 2013\u20132014 budget year''', State College Area School Board applied for one exception to exceed their Act 1 Index limit due to rapidly escalating teacher pension costs.

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another,<ref name=\"mcnichol71\"/> and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] and [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Exceptions to this rule do occur.</ref>\n\nIn the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes. [[U.S. Route 201|US&nbsp;201]], for example, splits from [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] at [[Brunswick, Maine]], and runs north to Canada.<ref name=\"rm\">{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title=The Road Atlas and Travel Guide |year=2009 |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |isbn= 978-0-528-94209-9}}</ref>  Not all spurs travel in the same direction as their \"parents\"; some are connected to their parents only by other spurs, or not at all, instead only traveling near their parents, Also, a spur may travel in different cardinal directions than its parent, such as [[U.S. Route 522|US&nbsp;522]], which is a north-south route, unlike its parent [[U.S. Route 22|US&nbsp;22]], which is east-west. As originally assigned, the first digit of the spurs increased from north to south and east to west along the parent; for example, [[U.S. Route 60 (1925)|US&nbsp;60]] had spurs, running from east to west, designated as [[U.S. Route 160 (1925)|US&nbsp;160]] in [[Missouri]], [[U.S. Route 260 (1925)|US&nbsp;260]] in [[Oklahoma]], [[U.S. Route 360 (1925)|US&nbsp;360]] in [[Texas]], and [[U.S. Route 460|US&nbsp;460]] and [[U.S. Route 560 (1925)|US&nbsp;560]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"1925 list\"/>  As with the two-digit routes, three-digit routes have been added, removed, extended and shortened; the \"parent-child\" relationship is not always present.<ref name=\"rm\"/><ref name=\"esso\">{{cite map |author1=[[Esso]] |title=United States Featuring the Interstate Highway System |year=1966 |author2=[[General Drafting]] |last-author-amp= yes |scale= [c. 1:3,870,000] |location= Convent Station, NJ |publisher= General Drafting |oclc= 749860157}}</ref>\n\nAASHTO guidelines specifically prohibit [[Interstate Highway]]s and U.S. Routes from sharing a number within the same state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |format= PDF |title= Establishment of a Marking System of the Routes Comprising the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |author= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date= January 2000 |work= AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |accessdate= December 31, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140101011142/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |archivedate= January 1, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As with other guidelines, exceptions exist across the U.S.  <ref name=\"esso\"/>\n\nSome two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 39, 47, 86 and 88.\n\n===Signage===\nRoute numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center.  Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details\u2014May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase.

Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]]. The 1985 removal of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] is often seen as the end of an era of US highways.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/californiahighwa196465calirich#page/n85/mode/2up |title= Route Renumbering: New Green Markers Will Replace Old Shields |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= March\u2013April 1964 |volume= 43 |issue= 3\u20134 |pages= 11\u201313 |issn= 0008-1159 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA few major connections not served by Interstate Highways include US&nbsp;6 from Hartford, Connecticut, to Providence, Rhode Island and US&nbsp;93 from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada, though the latter is planned to be upgraded to [[Interstate 11]].
