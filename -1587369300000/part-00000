The ongoing impacts of land clearing, noxious weeds, introduced herbivore and introduced predators are likely to cause further declines throughout the species range, which may warrant further environmental protection measures.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

The ongoing impacts of land clearing, noxious weeds, introduced herbivore and introduced predators are likely to cause further declines throughout the species range, which may warrant further environmental protection measures.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the Chateau d'Hennemont to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of Ren\u00e9 Tallard. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 French children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, Ren\u00e9 Tallard, retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected Ren\u00e9 Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in Belgium, and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, Edgar Scherer. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, Jean-Pierre Maillard, had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to Patrick Charpeil, who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\nYves Lemaire took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools.

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 French children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in Belgium, and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling.

Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

Belgo-Congolese troops, British Commonwealth forces and local resistance fighters besieged the fort at the market town of [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]] in south-western [[Ethiopia]] in 1941. The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender.\n\nIn the first months of 1941, British and [[Force Publique|Belgian colonial forces]] attacked [[Italian East Africa]] from the colony of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. By the end of March, they had seized the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Sa\u00efo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]] and later General [[Pietro Gazzera]]. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Sa\u00efo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the [[South African Air Force]] put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.\n\nAt the end of the month General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] took charge of the Belgian force.

In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|Daniel Sandford]] arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. [[Gideon Force|Mission 101]] was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots). In June 1940, [[Haile Selassie]] arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of [[Lake Tana]], to [[Dangila]], Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the ''Arbegnoch''. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=403}}\n\nThe Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and \u00a31 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma\u2013Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n===Belgian plans===\n{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Force Publique'' soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa]]\nAt the conclusion of the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (\"Public Force\" i.e. the colonial army) of the [[Belgian Congo]] in Central Africa.

After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a [[salient (geography)|salient]] formed around the [[Baro River]].

Belgo-Congolese troops, British Commonwealth forces and local resistance fighters besieged the fort at the market town of [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]] in south-western [[Ethiopia]] in 1941. The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender.\n\nIn the first months of 1941, British and [[Force Publique|Belgian colonial forces]] attacked [[Italian East Africa]] from the colony of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. By the end of March, they had seized the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Sa\u00efo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]] and later General [[Pietro Gazzera]]. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Sa\u00efo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the [[South African Air Force]] put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.\n\nAt the end of the month General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] took charge of the Belgian force. He was instructed by the British to attack when an opportunity presented itself. On 3 July, he assaulted the base of Sa\u00efo Mountain and in the afternoon Gazzera sued for peace. On 6 July, the Belgians formally accepted the surrender of Gazzera, eight of his generals and over {{nowrap|6,000 Italian}} soldiers.\n\n== Background ==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)|l1=Order of Battle, East African Campaign|First Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the colony of ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian victory in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], fought 3 October 1935 \u2013 May 1936) and the existing Italian possessions of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]].{{efn|The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during World War II but the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=6\u20137, 69}}}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===''Regio Esercito''===\n\n{{see also|Regio Esercito}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia shaded relief map 1999, CIA.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Ethiopia}}]]\n[[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], was appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor-General]] of Italian East Africa in November 1937, with a headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]], the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of the ''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana'' (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and ''Generale d'Armata Aerea'' (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 locally recruited}} and Italian-born army, naval and air force personnel, available. By 1 August, mobilisation in Italian East Africa had increased that number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=93}} On 10 June, the ''Regio Esercito'' (Italian Royal Army) was organised in four commands, with the military forces in Ethiopia led by General [[Pietro Gazzera]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\nAosta had the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division ''Cacciatori d'Africa'']] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] from Italy, a battalion of ''[[Alpini]]'' (elite mountain troops), a ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' battalion of motorised infantry, several {{lang|it|Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale}} (MSVN [[MVSN Colonial Militia|''Camicie Nere'']] [Blackshirt]) battalions and an assortment of smaller units; about 70 percent of the Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in Italian East Africa and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\n===British plans===\n\nIn August 1939, Wavell ordered a plan covertly to encourage a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of [[Gojjam]], which the Italians had never been able entirely to repress after the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|Daniel Sandford]] arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. [[Gideon Force|Mission 101]] was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots). In June 1940, [[Haile Selassie]] arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of [[Lake Tana]], to [[Dangila]], Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the ''Arbegnoch''. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=403}}\n\nThe Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and \u00a31 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma\u2013Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n===Belgian plans===\n{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Force Publique'' soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa]]\nAt the conclusion of the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (\"Public Force\" i.e. the colonial army) of the [[Belgian Congo]] in Central Africa. It thus made up the bulk of the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Consisting of 15,000 native ranks and Belgian officers, it was well equipped, well disciplined and dispersed throughout the colony.<ref name= Veranneman83>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=83}}</ref> Through the year, the ''Force Publique'''s defence obligations were considered too important for it to be spared for any offensive operations.

The [[Belgian government in exile]] was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940.<ref name= Veranneman84>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=84}}</ref> Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo.<ref name= weller5>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=5}}</ref>\n\n[[Free French Forces]] consolidated their control over Equatorial Africa at the [[Battle of Gabon]] and more German involvement in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] (begun by Italy in 1939) made the possibility of intervention in Portugal remote.<ref name= weller4/> The staff of the ''Force Publique'' and the Belgian government then resolved to assemble an expedition to fight in Italian East Africa.<ref name= weller5/> Plans were coordinated with the British and in February 1941, after an extended period of preparation, the first group of 8,000 troops and porters set out from the Congo for Ethiopia.<ref name= Veranneman84/> Starting in [[Stanley Pool]], they rode a dozen {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} barges and a tugboat up the [[Congo River]] to [[Aketi (town)|Aketi]].

After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a [[salient (geography)|salient]] formed around the [[Baro River]]. In March 1941, the Italian forces began to withdraw from the salient under increasing pressure.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> On 8 March the first battalion of the Belgo-Congolese expeditionary force marched from Kurmuk towards the Italian-held town of Asosa.<ref name=weller6/>\n\nThe expeditionary force attacked three days later in conjunction with troops of the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR), forcing the garrison to retreat to [[Gidami]].<ref name=weller6/> Next, the Belgians and Congolese began attacking the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] directly from the west while two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of the 2/6 KAR under Captain J.

Numbering at 1,600 soldiers and 600 non-combatant [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], they lacked the strength to seize the plateau. With the Italians receiving reinforcements of troops retreating from the east, the Belgians decided to keep the initiative to disguise their small numbers.<ref name= weller16>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThree days of cold weather and rain preceded the offensive.<ref name= weller21>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=21}}</ref> On 15 April, Lieutenant Colonel Edmond van der Meersch led an attack on the brook. A Belgian lieutenant scouting in [[no man's land]] was ambushed and killed. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by [[sniper]]s concealed in [[the bush]]. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were killed. Three Italians and an estimated 40 [[Eritrean Ascari]] were killed, with approximately 70 Ascari wounded.<ref name= weller16/>\n\nDuring the ensuring stalemate, the Belgians studied the Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and artillery spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads.

The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their communications and supplies. The Baro and [[Sobat River|Sobat]] rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by [[airdrop]], forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations.<ref name= weller17/> Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Sudan, but died of fatigue and undernourishment.

They then decided to try to sever the Italian supply line between Sa\u00efo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack.<ref name= weller18/> It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Sa\u00efo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered by the arrival of a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Sa\u00efo was being supplied.<ref name= weller19/>\n\nAt the regular front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to increase their patrol activities upon the Sa\u00efo Plateau, to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces.<ref name= weller19/> They used [[shoot-and-scoot]] tactics, avoiding [[counter-battery fire]] and leaving the Italians with the impression that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison and the Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder.

Since 1997 and independence, the capital is [[Nur-Sultan]], formerly known as Astana. It was moved from [[Almaty]], the country's largest city.\n\nThe territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic groups and empires. In antiquity, the nomadic [[Scythians]] inhabited the land and the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] expanded towards the southern territory of the modern country. [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[nomads]], who trace their ancestry to many [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries|Turkic states]] such as [[Turkic Khaganate]], etc., have inhabited the country throughout its history. \n\nIn the 13th century, the territory was subjugated by the [[Mongolian Empire]] under [[Genghis Khan]]. By the 16th century, the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] emerged as a distinct group, divided into three ''[[j\u00fcz]]'' (ancestor branches occupying specific territories). The [[Russians]] began advancing into the [[Kazakh steppe]] in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century, they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganised several times. In 1936, it was made the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], part of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKazakhstan was the last of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] to declare independence during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], the first [[president of Kazakhstan]], was characterised as an authoritarian, and his government was accused of numerous human rights violations, including suppression of dissent and censorship of the media. Nazarbayev resigned in March 2019 but was made the Kazakh [[Security Council of Kazakhstan|Security Council's]] chairman-for-life. He had the capital's name changed to his first name. \n\nSenate Chairman [[Kassym-Jomart Tokayev]] succeeded Nazarbayev as president.<ref name=\"time\" /> In the 21st century, Kazakhstan has worked to develop its [[Economy of Kazakhstan|economy]], especially its dominant [[hydrocarbon]] industry.<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|last=Zarakhovich|first=Yuri|date=27 September 2006|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1539999,00.html|title=Kazakhstan Comes on Strong|work=Time|access-date=13 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207235354/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1539999,00.html|archivedate=7 December 2015}}</ref> [[Human Rights Watch]] says that \"Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion.\"<ref name=\"World Report 2015: Kazakhstan\">[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/kazakhstan World Report 2015: Kazakhstan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028020227/https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/kazakhstan |date=28 October 2016 }}, accessed October 2015.</ref> Other human rights organisations regularly describe [[Human rights in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan's human rights situation]] as poor.\n\nKazakhstan's 131 ethnicities include [[Kazakhs]] (65.5% of the population), [[Russians]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Germans]], [[Tatars]], and [[Uyghurs]].<ref name=\"Census2009\">{{cite web |script-title=ru:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d 2009 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438.

While ancient cities [[Taraz]] (Aulie-Ata) and [[Hazrat-e Turkestan]] had long served as important way-stations along the [[Silk Road]] connecting Asia and Europe, true political consolidation began only with the Mongol rule of the early 13th century. Under the [[Mongol Empire]], the largest in world history, administrative districts were established. These eventually came under the rule of the emergent [[Kazakh Khanate]] (Kazakhstan).\n\nThroughout this period, traditional [[nomad]]ic life and a [[livestock]]-based economy continued to dominate the [[steppe]]. In the 15th century, a distinct [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] identity began to emerge among the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes, a process which was consolidated by the mid-16th century with the appearance of the [[Kazakh language]], culture, and economy.\n\nNevertheless, the region was the focus of ever-increasing disputes between the native Kazakh [[emir]]s and the neighbouring [[Persian-speaking peoples]] to the south. At its height, the Khanate would rule parts of Central Asia and control [[Cumania]]. By the early 17th century, the Kazakh Khanate was struggling with the impact of tribal rivalries, which had effectively divided the population into the Great, Middle and Little (or Small) hordes (''[[j\u00fcz]]''). Political disunion, tribal rivalries, and the diminishing importance of overland trade routes between east and west weakened the Kazakh Khanate. [[Khiva Khanate]] used this opportunity and annexed [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]].

The \"[[Great Game]]\" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]]. The [[tsar]]s effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Russian Empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so-called \"Great Game\" for dominance in the area against the [[British Empire]], which was extending its influence from the south in India and Southeast Asia. Russia built its first outpost, [[Orsk]], in 1735. Russia introduced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organisations.\n\nRussian efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment by the [[Kazakh people]], and, by the 1860s, some Kazakhs resisted Russia's rule. It had disrupted the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy, and people were suffering from hunger and starvation, with some Kazakh tribes being decimated. The Kazakh national movement, which began in the late 19th century, sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to assimilate and stifle them.\n\nFrom the 1890s onward, ever-larger numbers of settlers from the Russian Empire began [[colonising]] the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, in particular, the province of [[Semirechye]]. The number of settlers rose still further once the [[Trans-Aral Railway]] from [[Orenburg]] to [[Tashkent]] was completed in 1906. A specially created Migration Department (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) in [[St. Petersburg]] oversaw and encouraged the migration to expand Russian influence in the area.

Since then, the industry has shrunk and been restructured, with system-wide loans dropping to 39% of GDP in 2011 from 59% in 2007. Although the Russian and Kazakhstani banking systems share several common features, there are also some fundamental differences. Banks in Kazakhstan have experienced a lengthy period of political stability and economic growth. Together with a rational approach to banking and finance policy, this has helped push Kazakhstan's banking system to a higher level of development. Banking technology and personnel qualifications alike are stronger in Kazakhstan than in Russia. On the negative side, past stability in Kazakhstan arose from the concentration of virtually all political power in the hands of a single individual \u2013 the key factor in any assessment of system or country risk.

By 2013, this ratio stood at 0.18% of GDP. It will be difficult to reach the target as long as economic growth remains strong. Since 2005, the economy has grown faster (by 6% in 2013) than gross domestic expenditure on research and development, which only progressed from PPP$598 million to PPP$714 million between 2005 and 2013.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInnovation expenditure more than doubled in Kazakhstan between 2010 and 2011, representing KZT 235 billion (''circa'' US$1.6 billion), or around 1.1% of GDP. Some 11% of the total was spent on research and development. This compares with about 40\u201370% of innovation expenditure in developed countries. This augmentation was due to a sharp rise in product design and the introduction of new services and production methods over this period, to the detriment of the acquisition of machinery and equipment, which has traditionally made up the bulk of Kazakhstan's innovation expenditure. Training costs represented just 2% of innovation expenditure, a much lower share than in developed countries.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn December 2012, President&nbsp;[[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]&nbsp;announced the&nbsp;''[[Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy]]''&nbsp;with the slogan \"Strong Business, Strong State.\" This pragmatic strategy proposes sweeping socio-economic and political reforms to hoist Kazakhstan among the top 30 economies by 2050. In this document, Kazakhstan gives itself 15 years to evolve into a knowledge economy. New sectors are to be created during each five-year plan. The first of these, covering the years 2010\u20132014, focused on developing industrial capacity in car manufacturing, aircraft engineering and the production of locomotives, passenger and cargo railroad cars. During the second five-year plan to 2019, the goal is to develop export markets for these products. To enable Kazakhstan to enter the world market of geological exploration, the country intends to increase the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors such as oil and gas. It also intends to develop rare earth metals, given their importance for electronics, laser technology, communication and medical equipment. The second five-year plan coincides with the development of the ''Business 2020'' roadmap for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which makes provision for the allocation of grants to SMEs in the regions and for microcredit. The government and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs also plan to develop an effective mechanism to help start-ups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Soyuz expedition 19 launch pad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] is the world's oldest and largest operational [[Spaceport|space launch facility]]]]\n\nDuring subsequent five-year plans to 2050, new industries will be established in fields such as mobile, multi-media, nano- and space technologies, robotics, genetic engineering and alternative energy. Food processing enterprises will be developed with an eye to turning the country into a major regional exporter of beef, dairy and other agricultural products. Low-return, water-intensive crop varieties will be replaced with vegetable, oil and fodder products. As part of the shift to a \"green economy\" by 2030, 15% of acreage will be cultivated with water-saving technologies.

The literary magazines ''[[Ay Qap]]'' (published between 1911 and 1915 in Arabic script) and ''Qazaq'' (published between 1913 and 1918) played an important role in the development of the intellectual and political life among early 20th-century Kazakhs.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Kazakhstan}}\n[[File:Stamp of Kazakhstan 659.jpg|thumb|[[Nowruz]] on stamp of Kazakhstan]]\nThe modern state of Kazakhstan is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]], a famous composer and dombra player from the 19th century. The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music. Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html].\nThe Foundation Asyl Mura is archivating and publishing historical recordings of great samples of Kazakh music both traditional and classical.\nThe leading conservatoire is in Almaty, the Qurmanghazy Conservatoire. It currently competes with the national conservatoire in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan's capital.\n\nWhen referring to traditional Kazakh music, authentic folklore must be separated from \"folklorism\". The latter denotes music executed by academically trained performers who aim at preserving the traditional music for coming generations. As far as can be reconstructed, the music of Kazakhstan from the period before a strong Russian influence consists of instrumental music and vocal music. Instrumental music, with the pieces (\"K\u00fcy\") being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the background (or \"program\") for the music, as a lot of K\u00fcy titles refer to stories. Vocal music, either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into subgenres: epic singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe's genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u0430\u043d\u044d\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0422\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0448\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c 1) \u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 2015.jpg|thumb|{{Esccnty|Kazakhstan|Junior|y=2018#Daneliya_Tuleshova|t=Daneliya Tuleshova}} represented Kazakhstan at the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]]]\nThe Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres: first, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories, where the European music was performed and taught, and second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.\nControlled first by the [[Russian Empire]] and then the [[Soviet Union]], Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with [[ethnic Russian music]] and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research teams including [[composer]]s, [[music critic]]s and [[musicology|musicologists]]. In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear [[musical notation|notation]]. Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style [[European classical music]].\n\nThe Kazakhs themselves, however, did not write their own music in notation until 1931. Later, as part of the Soviet Union, Kazakh folk culture was encouraged in a sanitised manner designed to avoid political and social unrest. The result was a bland derivative of real Kazakh folk music. In 1920, [[Aleksandr Zatayevich]], a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements of Kazakh folk music. Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles, such as by increasing the number of [[fret]]s and [[strings (music)|strings]]. Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavours [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html].\n\n[[File:Astudio.jpg|thumb|left|[[A-Studio]] was created in 1982 in [[Almaty]], then called Alma-Ata, hence called \"Alma-Ata Studio\"]]\n\nThe current situation could be described as the effort to rediscover the traditional music as it had been practised before the heavy influence of European musical styles. Although the quality of the performances and the striving for authenticity cannot be ignored, it is for methodological reasons important to remember that the contemporary musicians performing among traditional folk music are all well trained professionals (Rauchan Orazbaeva, Ramazan Stamgazi).\n\nAnother very challenging aspect arises from the young composers generation, and the rock and jazz musicians, as they aim to incorporate their traditional heritage into the music they learned from the western cultures, thus forming a new stage of \"ethnic contemporary classics\", respectively ethnic rock or jazz music that sounds distinctly Kazakh. For the classical sector outstanding: Aqtoty Raimkulova, [[Turan ensemble]]; for jazz: \"Magic of Nomads\"; for rock: Roksonaki, [[Urker]], [[Ulytau]], Alda span.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Kazakh cuisine}}\n\nIn the national cuisine, livestock meat can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products. Refreshments often include black tea and traditional milk-derived drinks such as [[ayran]], [[shubat]] and [[kymyz]]. A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as [[pilaf]] and [[beshbarmak]]. They also drink their national beverage, which consists of fermented mare's milk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cuisine of Kazakhstan|url=https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/kazakhstan_cuisine.shtml|website=Oriental Express Central Asia|accessdate=17 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118053709/https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/kazakhstan_cuisine.shtml|archivedate=18 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Kazakhstan}}\n[[File:2016 Brussels Cycling Classic 032.jpg|thumb|[[Astana Pro Team]] is professional cycling team representing Kazakhstan and sponsored by the state-owned companies from Kazakhstan]]\nKazakhstan consistently performs in Olympic competitions.

Since 1997 and independence, the capital is [[Nur-Sultan]], formerly known as Astana. It was moved from [[Almaty]], the country's largest city.\n\nThe territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic groups and empires. In antiquity, the nomadic [[Scythians]] inhabited the land and the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] expanded towards the southern territory of the modern country. [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[nomads]], who trace their ancestry to many [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries|Turkic states]] such as [[Turkic Khaganate]], etc., have inhabited the country throughout its history. \n\nIn the 13th century, the territory was subjugated by the [[Mongolian Empire]] under [[Genghis Khan]]. By the 16th century, the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] emerged as a distinct group, divided into three ''[[j\u00fcz]]'' (ancestor branches occupying specific territories). The [[Russians]] began advancing into the [[Kazakh steppe]] in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century, they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganised several times. In 1936, it was made the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], part of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKazakhstan was the last of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] to declare independence during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], the first [[president of Kazakhstan]], was characterised as an authoritarian, and his government was accused of numerous human rights violations, including suppression of dissent and censorship of the media. Nazarbayev resigned in March 2019 but was made the Kazakh [[Security Council of Kazakhstan|Security Council's]] chairman-for-life. He had the capital's name changed to his first name. \n\nSenate Chairman [[Kassym-Jomart Tokayev]] succeeded Nazarbayev as president.<ref name=\"time\" /> In the 21st century, Kazakhstan has worked to develop its [[Economy of Kazakhstan|economy]], especially its dominant [[hydrocarbon]] industry.<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|last=Zarakhovich|first=Yuri|date=27 September 2006|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1539999,00.html|title=Kazakhstan Comes on Strong|work=Time|access-date=13 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207235354/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1539999,00.html|archivedate=7 December 2015}}</ref> [[Human Rights Watch]] says that \"Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion.\"<ref name=\"World Report 2015: Kazakhstan\">[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/kazakhstan World Report 2015: Kazakhstan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028020227/https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/kazakhstan |date=28 October 2016 }}, accessed October 2015.</ref> Other human rights organisations regularly describe [[Human rights in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan's human rights situation]] as poor.\n\nKazakhstan's 131 ethnicities include [[Kazakhs]] (65.5% of the population), [[Russians]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Germans]], [[Tatars]], and [[Uyghurs]].<ref name=\"Census2009\">{{cite web |script-title=ru:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d 2009 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438.

While ancient cities [[Taraz]] (Aulie-Ata) and [[Hazrat-e Turkestan]] had long served as important way-stations along the [[Silk Road]] connecting Asia and Europe, true political consolidation began only with the Mongol rule of the early 13th century. Under the [[Mongol Empire]], the largest in world history, administrative districts were established. These eventually came under the rule of the emergent [[Kazakh Khanate]] (Kazakhstan).\n\nThroughout this period, traditional [[nomad]]ic life and a [[livestock]]-based economy continued to dominate the [[steppe]]. In the 15th century, a distinct [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] identity began to emerge among the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes, a process which was consolidated by the mid-16th century with the appearance of the [[Kazakh language]], culture, and economy.\n\nNevertheless, the region was the focus of ever-increasing disputes between the native Kazakh [[emir]]s and the neighbouring [[Persian-speaking peoples]] to the south. At its height, the Khanate would rule parts of Central Asia and control [[Cumania]]. By the early 17th century, the Kazakh Khanate was struggling with the impact of tribal rivalries, which had effectively divided the population into the Great, Middle and Little (or Small) hordes (''[[j\u00fcz]]''). Political disunion, tribal rivalries, and the diminishing importance of overland trade routes between east and west weakened the Kazakh Khanate. [[Khiva Khanate]] used this opportunity and annexed [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]]. Uzbek rule there lasted two centuries until the Russian arrival.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Kazakhs fought [[Oirats]], a federation of western [[Mongol]] tribes, including the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Kazakhstan/Cultural-life#toc73648 |title=Kazakhstan to c.

The \"[[Great Game]]\" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]]. The [[tsar]]s effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Russian Empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so-called \"Great Game\" for dominance in the area against the [[British Empire]], which was extending its influence from the south in India and Southeast Asia. Russia built its first outpost, [[Orsk]], in 1735. Russia introduced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organisations.\n\nRussian efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment by the [[Kazakh people]], and, by the 1860s, some Kazakhs resisted Russia's rule. It had disrupted the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy, and people were suffering from hunger and starvation, with some Kazakh tribes being decimated. The Kazakh national movement, which began in the late 19th century, sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to assimilate and stifle them.\n\nFrom the 1890s onward, ever-larger numbers of settlers from the Russian Empire began [[colonising]] the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, in particular, the province of [[Semirechye]]. The number of settlers rose still further once the [[Trans-Aral Railway]] from [[Orenburg]] to [[Tashkent]] was completed in 1906. A specially created Migration Department (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) in [[St. Petersburg]] oversaw and encouraged the migration to expand Russian influence in the area.

Since then, the industry has shrunk and been restructured, with system-wide loans dropping to 39% of GDP in 2011 from 59% in 2007. Although the Russian and Kazakhstani banking systems share several common features, there are also some fundamental differences. Banks in Kazakhstan have experienced a lengthy period of political stability and economic growth. Together with a rational approach to banking and finance policy, this has helped push Kazakhstan's banking system to a higher level of development. Banking technology and personnel qualifications alike are stronger in Kazakhstan than in Russia. On the negative side, past stability in Kazakhstan arose from the concentration of virtually all political power in the hands of a single individual \u2013 the key factor in any assessment of system or country risk.

By 2013, this ratio stood at 0.18% of GDP. It will be difficult to reach the target as long as economic growth remains strong. Since 2005, the economy has grown faster (by 6% in 2013) than gross domestic expenditure on research and development, which only progressed from PPP$598 million to PPP$714 million between 2005 and 2013.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInnovation expenditure more than doubled in Kazakhstan between 2010 and 2011, representing KZT 235 billion (''circa'' US$1.6 billion), or around 1.1% of GDP. Some 11% of the total was spent on research and development. This compares with about 40\u201370% of innovation expenditure in developed countries. This augmentation was due to a sharp rise in product design and the introduction of new services and production methods over this period, to the detriment of the acquisition of machinery and equipment, which has traditionally made up the bulk of Kazakhstan's innovation expenditure. Training costs represented just 2% of innovation expenditure, a much lower share than in developed countries.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn December 2012, President&nbsp;[[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]&nbsp;announced the&nbsp;''[[Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy]]''&nbsp;with the slogan \"Strong Business, Strong State.\" This pragmatic strategy proposes sweeping socio-economic and political reforms to hoist Kazakhstan among the top 30 economies by 2050. In this document, Kazakhstan gives itself 15 years to evolve into a knowledge economy. New sectors are to be created during each five-year plan. The first of these, covering the years 2010\u20132014, focused on developing industrial capacity in car manufacturing, aircraft engineering and the production of locomotives, passenger and cargo railroad cars. During the second five-year plan to 2019, the goal is to develop export markets for these products. To enable Kazakhstan to enter the world market of geological exploration, the country intends to increase the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors such as oil and gas. It also intends to develop rare earth metals, given their importance for electronics, laser technology, communication and medical equipment. The second five-year plan coincides with the development of the ''Business 2020'' roadmap for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which makes provision for the allocation of grants to SMEs in the regions and for microcredit. The government and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs also plan to develop an effective mechanism to help start-ups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Soyuz expedition 19 launch pad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] is the world's oldest and largest operational [[Spaceport|space launch facility]]]]\n\nDuring subsequent five-year plans to 2050, new industries will be established in fields such as mobile, multi-media, nano- and space technologies, robotics, genetic engineering and alternative energy. Food processing enterprises will be developed with an eye to turning the country into a major regional exporter of beef, dairy and other agricultural products. Low-return, water-intensive crop varieties will be replaced with vegetable, oil and fodder products. As part of the shift to a \"green economy\" by 2030, 15% of acreage will be cultivated with water-saving technologies.

The literary magazines ''[[Ay Qap]]'' (published between 1911 and 1915 in Arabic script) and ''Qazaq'' (published between 1913 and 1918) played an important role in the development of the intellectual and political life among early 20th-century Kazakhs.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Kazakhstan}}\n[[File:Stamp of Kazakhstan 659.jpg|thumb|[[Nowruz]] on stamp of Kazakhstan]]\nThe modern state of Kazakhstan is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]], a famous composer and dombra player from the 19th century. The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music. Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html].\nThe Foundation Asyl Mura is archivating and publishing historical recordings of great samples of Kazakh music both traditional and classical.\nThe leading conservatoire is in Almaty, the Qurmanghazy Conservatoire. It currently competes with the national conservatoire in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan's capital.\n\nWhen referring to traditional Kazakh music, authentic folklore must be separated from \"folklorism\". The latter denotes music executed by academically trained performers who aim at preserving the traditional music for coming generations. As far as can be reconstructed, the music of Kazakhstan from the period before a strong Russian influence consists of instrumental music and vocal music. Instrumental music, with the pieces (\"K\u00fcy\") being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the background (or \"program\") for the music, as a lot of K\u00fcy titles refer to stories. Vocal music, either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into subgenres: epic singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe's genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u0430\u043d\u044d\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0422\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0448\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c 1) \u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 2015.jpg|thumb|{{Esccnty|Kazakhstan|Junior|y=2018#Daneliya_Tuleshova|t=Daneliya Tuleshova}} represented Kazakhstan at the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]]]\nThe Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres: first, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories, where the European music was performed and taught, and second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.\nControlled first by the [[Russian Empire]] and then the [[Soviet Union]], Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with [[ethnic Russian music]] and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research teams including [[composer]]s, [[music critic]]s and [[musicology|musicologists]]. In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear [[musical notation|notation]]. Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style [[European classical music]].\n\nThe Kazakhs themselves, however, did not write their own music in notation until 1931. Later, as part of the Soviet Union, Kazakh folk culture was encouraged in a sanitised manner designed to avoid political and social unrest. The result was a bland derivative of real Kazakh folk music. In 1920, [[Aleksandr Zatayevich]], a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements of Kazakh folk music. Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles, such as by increasing the number of [[fret]]s and [[strings (music)|strings]]. Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavours [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html].\n\n[[File:Astudio.jpg|thumb|left|[[A-Studio]] was created in 1982 in [[Almaty]], then called Alma-Ata, hence called \"Alma-Ata Studio\"]]\n\nThe current situation could be described as the effort to rediscover the traditional music as it had been practised before the heavy influence of European musical styles. Although the quality of the performances and the striving for authenticity cannot be ignored, it is for methodological reasons important to remember that the contemporary musicians performing among traditional folk music are all well trained professionals (Rauchan Orazbaeva, Ramazan Stamgazi).\n\nAnother very challenging aspect arises from the young composers generation, and the rock and jazz musicians, as they aim to incorporate their traditional heritage into the music they learned from the western cultures, thus forming a new stage of \"ethnic contemporary classics\", respectively ethnic rock or jazz music that sounds distinctly Kazakh. For the classical sector outstanding: Aqtoty Raimkulova, [[Turan ensemble]]; for jazz: \"Magic of Nomads\"; for rock: Roksonaki, [[Urker]], [[Ulytau]], Alda span.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Kazakh cuisine}}\n\nIn the national cuisine, livestock meat can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products. Refreshments often include black tea and traditional milk-derived drinks such as [[ayran]], [[shubat]] and [[kymyz]]. A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as [[pilaf]] and [[beshbarmak]]. They also drink their national beverage, which consists of fermented mare's milk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cuisine of Kazakhstan|url=https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/kazakhstan_cuisine.shtml|website=Oriental Express Central Asia|accessdate=17 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118053709/https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/kazakhstan_cuisine.shtml|archivedate=18 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Kazakhstan}}\n[[File:2016 Brussels Cycling Classic 032.jpg|thumb|[[Astana Pro Team]] is professional cycling team representing Kazakhstan and sponsored by the state-owned companies from Kazakhstan]]\nKazakhstan consistently performs in Olympic competitions.

The tehsil head-quarter although located in Kalukhan is named Tehsil \"Razar\" and not Tehsil Kalu-Khan.\n\nThe people here belong to the Mandanr-Yousafzai (Isapzi in [[Pashto]]) branch of Afghans through Mandanr and his sons.\n\nRazar was one of the four sons of Mandanr. The other three were Khazar, Mahmood and Manu. The areas falling under this Tehsil are inhabited by the sons of Razar and Khazar. The people of Kalu Khan are the children of Khazar and therefore Khazarzis of the Mandanr-Ispazis tribe of Afghans.\n\nBy following the Facebook link below you can see a family tree that shows the sons of Mandanr and his ancestry.\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/215341988488214/photos/a.745009945521413/745009962188078/?type=3&source=54&ref=page_internal\n\nKhazar had four sons namely Shamo, Umar, Yusaf and Ghai. Umar son of Khazar son of Mandanr also had four sons namely Munan, Mama, Bazid and Lodar. Umar and his four sons got the possession of lands of Kalu Khan sometime around the 1530s. The people of Kalukhan are therefore the children of Mandanr through his sons Khazar and Umar.\n\nBeside the Mandanr Isapzais, inhabitants include Akhundzadas, Wardaks, Syeds and Mians (considered as religious and spiritual families) who had come along with the former somewhere between 1490 and 1510 AD from the Kabul region of Afghanistan and got possession of these lands after successful tribal wars and pushing the previous local people across the river Indus. Some other families living in this and surrounding villages are Awans, Kamangars, etc who may or may not be Afghans but were allotted lands after their good performances during the old tribal wars. Some others here did not own any land but provided services to the land-owners.\n\nThe name of the village is after a famous 16th-century tribal army general named Malak Kalukhan. The Malak here is an ancient pakhtun title only and is not to be confused with the Malik families of the Punjab. He is believed to have fought the Mughal Emperor of his Era who was [[Akbar]]. He fought him for freedom of his states, his tribe and nation. He got several times jailed by [[Akbar]] at his capital in Delhi but instead of punishing and torturing him he began to like him because of which he was able to escape.\n\nLike every other village in the Isapzai country, stretching from the plains of present-day Swabi and Mardan in the South to the valleys of Buner and Swat in the north, the land of Kalu-Khan village was equally divided into four families in the early 1500s. These families or ''khels'' (in Pashto) are the Munankhel, Mamakhel, Bazidkhel, and Lodarkhel. The entire village was divided into four parts or wands (\u0648\u0646\u0689) which was then further divided into four and each family received one part in every wand. Family residences, Hujras and Mosques were built at a central raised ground which also served as a vantage point during ancient times.\n\nThis division of lands in the entire Isapzai country was completed by Sheikh Malli Baba in the early 1500s on the instructions of Malak Ahmed Khan, a Mandanr himself and the then chief of the tribe. With the passage of time, each family's population has risen manifolds and the inherited land in some cases during the current times is left to a negligible share.\n\nKalu Khan is well known for its production of Kalu khani talay (dish) in old times and Kalukhanay ''paroonay'' (or shawl for women) which is still in vogue.

The tehsil head-quarter although located in Kalukhan is named Tehsil \"Razar\" and not Tehsil Kalu-Khan. \n\nThe people here belong to the Mandanr-Yousafzai (Isapzi in [[Pashto]]) branch of Afghans through Mandanr and his sons.   \n\nRazar was one of the four sons of Mandanr. The other three were Khazar, Mahmood and Manu. The areas falling under this Tehsil are inhabited by the sons of Razar and Khazar. The people of Kalu Khan are the children of Khazar and therefore Khazarzis of the Mandanr-Ispazis tribe of Afghans.    \n\nBy following the Facebook link below you can see a family tree that shows the sons of Mandanr and his ancestry. \n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/215341988488214/photos/a.745009945521413/745009962188078/?type=3&source=54&ref=page_internal\n\nKhazar had four sons namely Shamo, Umar, Yusaf and Ghai. Umar son of Khazar son of Mandanr also had four sons namely Munan, Mama, Bazid and Lodar. Umar and his four sons got the possession of lands of Kalu Khan sometime around 1530s. The people of Kalukhan are therefore the children of Mandanr through his sons Khazar and Umar.   \n\nBeside the Mandanr Isapzais, inhabitants include Akhundzadas, Wardaks, Syeds and Mians (considered as religious and spiritual families) who had come along with the former somewhere between 1490 and 1510 AD from the Kabul region of Afghanistan and got possession of these lands after successful tribal wars and pushing the previous local people across the river Indus. Some other families living in this and surrounding villages are Awans, Kamangars, etc who may or may not be Afghans but were allotted lands after their good performances during the old tribal wars. Some others here did not own any land but provided services to the land-owners.\n\nThe name of the village is after a famous 16th-century tribal army general named Malak Kalukhan. The Malak here is an ancient pakhtun title only and is not to be confused with the Malik families of the Punjab. He is believed to have fought the Mughal Emperor of his Era who was [[Akbar]]. He fought him for freedom of his states, his tribe and nation. He got several times jailed by [[Akbar]] at his capital in Delhi but instead of punishing and torturing him he began to like him because of which he was able to escape. \n\nLike every other village in the Isapzai country, stretching from the plains of present-day Swabi and Mardan in the South to the valleys of Buner and Swat in the north, the land of Kalu-Khan village was equally divided into four families in the early 1500s. These families or ''khels'' (in Pashto) are the Munankhel, Mamakhel, Bazidkhel, and Lodarkhel. The entire village was divided into four parts or wands (\u0648\u0646\u0689) which was then further divided into four and each family received one part in every wand. Family residences, Hujras and Mosques were built at a central raised ground which also served as a vantage point during ancient times. \n\nThis division of lands in the entire Isapzai country was completed by Sheikh Malli Baba in early 1500s on the instructions of Malak Ahmed Khan, a Mandanr himself and the then chief of the tribe. With the passage of time, each family's population has risen manifolds and the inherited land in some cases during the current times is left to a negligible share.\n\nKalu Khan is well known for its production of Kalu khani talay (dish) in old times and Kalukhanay ''paroonay'' (or shawl for women) which is still in vogue. The land is very fertile and produces good quality wheat, sugarcane, tobacco and corn.\n\nIt is located at 34\u00b013'0N 72\u00b018'0E with an altitude of 317 meters (1043 feet).<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PK/3/Kalu_Khan2.html Location of Kalu Khan - Falling Rain Genomics]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nKalu khan has a hospital that is now upgraded to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and a police station which is the oldest in the area. There is a government high school and college for girls with over 2,000 students, and a high school for boys.\n\nThe village is surrounded by the villages of Turlanday and Yar-Hussain on the south-east and south-west respectively and by Adina on the west.

This costal town is rather humid, since it is very close to the sea.Summers here prevail from early March till\nlate May. Temperatures in the Summer vary from 32 degree celsius and can go up to 41 degree celsius. There is no particular Monsoon season for Kalpakkam as rains are unpredictable here, although there is heavy rainfall in the months of October and November,Usually turning into a storm.Coolest months are December and January. A study by the Madras Atomic Power Station(MAPS) revealed that the pollution in Kalpakkam is very low, which when compared to the neighbouring city [[Chennai]] is 50 times less.\n \nKalpakkam is famous for its [[nuclear plant]]s and affiliated research installations. These include the [[Madras Atomic Power Station]] (MAPS), one of India's nuclear power plants, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research ([[IGCAR]]), an affiliate of the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy]] (DAE) and [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC). Eminent scientists from various different fields of science work here for research and development in nuclear science and engineering. Kalpakkam hosts the only nuclear plant in India with a Fast Breeder Test Reactor(FBTR) and a Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor(PHWR).\n\nDue to increasing congestion in Kalpakkam arising from the need to accommodate more employees, a new township of Anupuram/Amaipakkam, {{convert|8|km}} from Kalpakkam, was inaugurated in 1998.\n\nOne of the most tragic events in the history of Kalpakkam took place on 26 December 2004 on a Sunday. Kalpakkam was held in a panic which led to chaos and a lot of people evacuating the town.The [[tsunami]] caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] generated widespread damage and resulted in 200 deaths in and around Kalpakkam. There is a tsunami memorial having a white oval plaque engraved with the names of 39 people who lost their lives in the tsunami.\n\n==Facilities==\nKalpakkam is a well built and planned township.

Both sides have similar facilities and also good facilities for sports, but Pudupattinam has more complete and bigger facilities, such as the hospital and the General Services Organization (GSO). The two sides are separated by two bridges over the canal which joins the sea nearby and well over the backwater with thousands of jellyfish moving underneath.

It was located near a railroad junction of the Hooppole, Yorktown & Tampico Railroad and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. The first mentioned was abandoned in 1953. In 1967, there were 153 students enrolled at TTHS. In the 1980s, Tampico lost its main railroad, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy route, that was the reason Tampico became a settlement like most other small towns. Declining enrollment and financial concerns led to the closing of Tampico High School in 1996.  The 1921 brick building was torn down during the summer of 2012 as part of a district wide facility improvement plan.. As of 2003, the old football field is still there, along with the padded hitting machine which is now rusted. The track outside of the field is still there in cement form.
