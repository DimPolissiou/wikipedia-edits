The words \"[[melancholia]]\", an old word for depression, and \"mania\" originated in Ancient Greece. The word melancholia is derived from ''melas'' ({{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2}}), meaning \"black\", and ''chole'' ({{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae}}), meaning \"bile\" or \"gall\",{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980}} indicative of the term's origins in pre-Hippocratic [[humoral theory]]. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of yellow bile, or a mixture of black and yellow bile. The linguistic origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies were proposed by the Ancient Roman physician [[Caelius Aurelianus]], including the Greek word ''ania'', meaning \"to produce great mental anguish\", and ''manos'', meaning \"relaxed\" or \"loose\", which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul.<ref name=\"Angst-2001\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Angst J, Marneros A | title = Bipolarity from ancient to modern times: conception, birth and rebirth | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 67 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 3\u201319 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11869749 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(01)00429-3 }}</ref> There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic poetry and mythology.<ref name=\"Angst-2001\" />\n\nIn the early 1800s, French psychiatrist [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol]]'s lypemania, one of his affective [[monomania]]s, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Borch-Jacobsen M | title = Which came first, the condition or the drug? | journal = London Review of Books | volume = 32 | issue = 19 | pages = 31\u201333 | date = October 2010 | url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug | quote = at the beginning of the 19th century with Esquirol's 'affective monomanias' (notably 'lypemania', the first elaboration of what was to become our modern depression) | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150313201452/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug | archivedate = March 13, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The basis of the current conceptualization of bipolar illness can be traced back to the 1850s.

She is a [[senior citizen]] who has lived in an unspecified part in the [[Southern United States]] for her entire life which is evident by the [[Southern American English|southern]] [[drawl]] of her speech and her customs.  She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the United States South. Vicki Lawrence originated the Mama character, which first appeared in \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' that aired on [[CBS]] from 1967 until 1978, and in 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In 1982, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' was a [[television film|made-for-TV movie]] based on \"The Family\" sketches characters. ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (first on [[NBC]], then revolutionized in [[first-run syndication]]), and finally in the ongoing ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''. With Lawrence continuing to play the role into the present day, the \"Mama\" character has made numerous other post-television show appearances, such as on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; ''[[The Talk (TV series)|The Talk]]'';<ref name=\"1of100\">Handleman, Jay (21 February 2003).

Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from \"The Family\" sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Persona evolution===\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.<ref name=\"origin\">McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,3546407&dq=carol-burnett+mama&hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''</ref> Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#</ref>\n\n===Mama's catch phrases===\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''\"Good Lord!\"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''\"Good Lord in heaven!\"'' or ''\"Good night Louise!\"'' Among her other locutions included ''\"Now hear this!\"'' ''\"Hell's bells!\"'' ''\"God-awful!\"'' ''\"The hell you say,\"'' ''\"Smut,\"'' ''\"For heaven's sake!\"'' ''\"For crying out loud!\"'' ''\"In a pig's eye,\"'' ''\"Shoot!\"'' ''\"Real good,\"'' ''\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''\"Nitwit,\"'' ''\"Dimwit,\"'' ''\"Goon,\"'' ''\"Goober Goon,\"'' ''\"Lamebrain,\"'' ''\"Dunce,\"'' ''\"Tramp,\"'' etc.\n\n==Evolution of family members' personas==\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in \"The Family\" sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\n== Mama's life history ==\nIn ''[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]'' sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton \"Vint\" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of ''The Family'' sketches.\n\nIn ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''\"Get the hell out of my life!\"''\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor [[Alvin Tutweiler]]'s chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\n==Post-television show appearances==\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, 2009]]\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled ''Mama for President''.<ref name=\"ref9of100\">Harper, Thelma with Vicki Lawrence & Monty Aidem.

She ended up winning $8,000 [[USD]], getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]'' as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch.

She is a [[senior citizen]] who has lived in an unspecified part in the [[Southern United States]] for her entire life which is evident by the [[Southern American English|southern]] [[drawl]] of her speech and her customs.  She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the United States South. Vicki Lawrence originated the Mama character, which first appeared in \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' that aired on [[CBS]] from 1967 until 1978, and in 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

As much of Mama's time on ''Mama's Family'' was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping [[apron]]. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible support hose since the outset of ''Mama's Family''; she wore no support hose during \"The Family\" sketches nor the ''Eunice'' movie.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=758mUmQxV6gC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+Mama's+orthopedic+shoes&source=bl&ots=duy-zxLKkw&sig=So6pPTb4V_ZePwU42hrRObEh4K8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OvM5UfumGqrr2QWShIEY&ved=0CGIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Vicki%20Lawrence%20Mama's%20orthopedic%20shoes&f=false |title=Funny Ladies - Michael Karol - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> For [[footwear]], Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a [[High-heeled footwear|high heeled]] [[brogue shoe|brogue]] style.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuoCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=Mama's+Family+Thelma+Harper&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iPA5Ua3WH4bk2AWnw4GgCw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Mama's%20Family%20Thelma%20Harper&f=false |title=Indianapolis Monthly - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref>\n\nMama has also invariably worn a few [[fashion accessory|fashion accessories]]: a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings. \n \nMama's outerwear has always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually, draped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral [[headpiece]]s; and a white purse, which she didn't hesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.\n\n==Mama's persona==\n\n===Vicki Lawrence on Mama's persona evolution===\n\nThe persona of the \"Mama\" character was revolutionized as between \"The Family\" sketches and the first life of ''Mama's Family''. Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from ''The Family'' sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Persona evolution===\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.<ref name=\"origin\">McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,3546407&dq=carol-burnett+mama&hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''</ref> Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#</ref>\n\n===Mama's catch phrases===\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''\"Good Lord!\"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''\"Good Lord in heaven!\"'' or ''\"Good night Louise!\"'' Among her other locutions included ''\"Now hear this!\"'' ''\"Hell's bells!\"'' ''\"God-awful!\"'' ''\"The hell you say,\"'' ''\"Smut,\"'' ''\"For heaven's sake!\"'' ''\"For crying out loud!\"'' ''\"In a pig's eye,\"'' ''\"Shoot!\"'' ''\"Real good,\"'' ''\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''\"Nitwit,\"'' ''\"Dimwit,\"'' ''\"Goon,\"'' ''\"Goober Goon,\"'' ''\"Lamebrain,\"'' ''\"Dunce,\"'' ''\"Tramp,\"'' etc.\n\n==Evolution of family members' personas==\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in \"The Family\" sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\n== Mama's life history ==\nIn ''[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]'' sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton \"Vint\" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of ''The Family'' sketches.\n\nIn ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''\"Get the hell out of my life!\"''\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor [[Alvin Tutweiler]]'s chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\n==Post-television show appearances==\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, 2009]]\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled ''Mama for President''.<ref name=\"ref9of100\">Harper, Thelma with Vicki Lawrence & Monty Aidem.

(U.S. syndicated game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' on October 2, 2009 playing for charity. She ended up winning $8,000 [[USD]], getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]'' as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch. Later seen out of the Thelma persona, Vicki Lawrence played as a special guest judge to the contestants alongside RuPaul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-2-season-1-rupauls-all-stars-drag-race/1696401/playlist.jhtml#vid=851720 |title=RuPaul's Drag Race, Eden's World Full Episodes, Reality TV Shows |publisher=LogoTV |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Thelma appeared in a special sketch during ''[[Betty White]]'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday'' in honor of Betty White. The sketch features a Beverly Hills high school class reunion with three of Betty's \"classmates\" from 1939. The sketch has a run time just over two minutes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n[[MeTV]]'s insertion of ''Mama's Family'' into their 2015\u20132016 schedule also brought with it several new video spots of Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, used for bumpers and promotional commercials on the network.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harper, Thelma}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Mama's Family characters]]\n[[Category:Comedy characters]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVicki Lawrence on Mama's persona evolution", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Harper"}

''who did more than any other to hold together the diversity of first-century Christianity.'' James the brother of Jesus, and Paul of Tarsus, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2}}, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage\u2014which Paul lacked\u2014and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance, he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself. But none of them, including the rest of the twelve, seem to have played any role of continuing significance for the whole sweep of Christianity\u2014though James the brother of John might have proved an exception had he been spared.\" [Italics original] [[James Dunn (theologian)|Dunn, James D.G.]] ''The Canon Debate''. McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, ch. 32, p. 577.</ref>\n\n== Matthew 16:18 ==\n\nControversy has surrounded one particular text that is linked with the Aramaic nickname name \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (''Cepha''), meaning \"rock,\" that Jesus gave the man previously known as Simon.{{Bibleref2c|John|1:42}} The Greeks translated it as \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''Petros''), a new form, appropriately masculine, of the standard feminine word \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (''petra''), also meaning \"rock;\" and the Latins translated it as ''Petrus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cephas |title=Cephas - Dictionary.com - Reference.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nWhile the reasons for disagreement on the nature of the primacy are complex, hinging on matters of doctrine, history and politics, the debate is often reduced to a discussion of the meaning and translation of Matthew 16:18: \"And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18, Douay-Rheims Bible}}\n\nIn the [[Greek language|Greek]] text, the new name given is \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''Petros''), and in the second half of the same verse the word translated as \"rock\" is \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (''petra''). A literal translation, in the style of the [[King James Version]], of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\".<ref>In [[French language|French]], the translation, \"Tu es ''Pierre'', et sur cette ''pierre'' je b\u00e2tirai mon \u00c9glise, et les portes de l'enfer ne pr\u00e9vaudront point contre elle\" preserves exactly the play on words in what is believed to be the original Aramaic.</ref> To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" rather than as \"\u039a\u03b7\u03c6\u1fb6\u03c2\" (Cephas).\n\nOne common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the [[New Testament]] in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see [[Aramaic primacy]]. According to the Protestant transliteration argument,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} in the [[Aramaic of Jesus|language that Jesus spoke]], the same word, \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.<ref name=Engler>John Engler. \"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\". <http://www.greatcommission.com/Matthew161720.html> Accessed 12 Mar 2013</ref><ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}</ref>\n\n==Catholic view on relationship to the Church today==\n{{Papal primacy and infallibility|expanded=overview}}\n\nIn [[Catholicism]], it is argued that the primacy of Peter is a basis for the primacy of the bishop of Rome over other [[bishops]] throughout the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the [[pope|papacy]] has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the [[Christendom|entire Church]]. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and [[Apostolic succession|passed on]]. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of [[pope]] which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Protestants do not believe the pope holds any authority over the [[Christian Church|universal Church]].\n\nSome [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Saint Paul saw Judaism]] as the [[Typology (theology)|type]] or figure of [[Christianity]]: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\"{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:11||1 Cor. 10:11}} In the [[613 Mitzvot|Old Law]], {{bibleref2|Deut.|17:8-12}} attributes to the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic suggests that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church,{{cn|date=August 2019}} though the relevance of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed; see also [[New Covenant]] and [[The New Commandment|New Commandment]]. Furthermore, it is typically the local bishop who is considered the high priest of his flock, rather than the pope alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Holy Orders|website=www.va|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], which some call the ''New Law'' or \"New Greek Testament\",<ref>Knight, Kevin. \"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\" ''New Advent.'' Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm</ref> {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16-18}} reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]].\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the [[Book of Revelation]], that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:21-22}} also supports this. [[James Gibbons|Cardinal Gibbons]], in his book ''The Faith of Our Fathers'', points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence. In receiving the keys, Peter takes on the office of [[prime minister]], which was well-known to ancient and contemporary Hebrews, and depicted in the Old Testament, as the one who had authority from the King to bind and loose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/hahn.asp|title=Dr Scott Hahn on the Papacy {{!}} Catholic-Pages.com|website=www.catholic-pages.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/apologetics/catholic-doctrines-and-practices/st-peter-and-the-popes|title=St. Peter and the Popes|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the [[clergy]]), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the [[laity]]). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is invariably mentioned last. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:2}} Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles.{{bibleref2c|Mk.|3:16}} {{bibleref2c|Mt.|4:18-19}} According to {{bibleref2|Acts|1-2,10-11,15}}, St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to {{bibleref2|Luke|22:31-32}}.\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. [[John Chrysostom]]) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.<ref name=\"Veselin Kesich 1992 61\u201366\">{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 61\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council I]] defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint.

In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[James the Just|James \"the brother of the Lord\"]] is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]]. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. James was indeed the first bishop or [[patriarch]] of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\".<ref>Mckenzie, John L. ''The Dictionary of the Bible'' (Catholic)</ref> It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to [[Herod Agrippa]]'s persecution. {{bibleref2c|Acts|12}}<ref>''The Navarre Bible'', footnotes</ref>\n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek ''exegesato'' to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EvQJ_i7J4CEC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=exegesato+james&source=bl&ots=0T7FZfHbub&sig=MSPr7qcxxSLvgY1BDHdUgA3xu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mbqave7JAhUJlB4KHTVgDV0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=exegesato%20james&f=false The Biblical Basis for the Papacy] by John Salza</ref> However, James uses the Greek word ''akouoo'' in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his ''Saint Peter and the Popes'' in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm</ref>\n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|And why, then, passing by the others, does He converse with Peter on these things? (John 21:15). He was the chosen one of the Apostles, and the mouth of the disciples, and the leader of the choir. On this account, Paul also went up on a time to see him rather than the others (Galatians 1:18). And withal, to show him that he must thenceforward have confidence, as the denial was done away with, He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren. And He brings not forward the denial, nor reproaches him with what had past, but says, \"If you love me, preside over the brethren.\" ...And the third time He gives him the same injunction, showing what a price He sets the presidency over His own sheep. And if one should say, \"How then did James receive the throne of Jerusalem?,\" this I would answer that He appointed this man (Peter) teacher, not of that throne, but of the whole world.<ref>http://www.catholicbridge.com/catholic/orthodox/pope_acts_15_james_and_peter.php</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the [[end times]] but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the [[body of Christ]], the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\n===Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy===\n\n====Irenaeus====\n[[Irenaeus]] has been called the most important witness of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|Christianity of the 2nd century]].<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6.</ref> Taught by [[Polycarp]], who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became [[Bishop of Lyon]] in 178. In his ''Against the Heresies'', Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8.</ref> In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way \u2026 gather more than they ought.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 9.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\n====Ignatius of Antioch====\n[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at [[Smyrna]] in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 4.</ref>\n\n====Tertullian====\nBorn in [[Carthage]] around 155 AD, [[Tertullian]] became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his ''Scorpiace'' of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold. \u2026For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23.</ref> ''Scorpiace'' is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\", rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,<ref>Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D..

Published online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.viii.xxi.html</ref> listing various reasons why the Keys of Peter pertained to Peter alone. The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\n====Cyprian====\n[[Cyprian|Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus]] was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30.</ref> In his 251 AD ''De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate'', Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 53.</ref>\n\n====John Chrysostom====\n[[John Chrysostom]] was born at [[Antioch]] around 347 and would fight for the reform of the Church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. He called Peter \"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 126.</ref> His writings also emphasize the mortality of Peter, linking him more closely to the people of the Church.\n\n====Augustine of Hippo====\n[[Saint Augustine]] was born in [[Numidia]] in 354 AD and was baptized in [[Milan]] in 387 AD. He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 163.</ref> His ''Sermo'' states, \"Peter in many places in the Scriptures appears to represent the Church, especially in that place where it was said 'I give to thee the keys \u2026 shall be loosed in heaven'. What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 175.</ref> His 395 A.D. ''Contra Epistolam Manichaei'' states, \"There are many other things which rightly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church. \u2026The succession of the priests keeps me, from the very seat of the apostle Peter (to whom the Lord after his resurrection gave charge to feed his sheep) down to the present episcopate.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 182.</ref>\n\n====Pope Innocent I====\n[[Pope Innocent I|Innocent I]] held the papal office from 402 to 417. Modern theories of papal primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to [[Decentius]], bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194.</ref> It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes to the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198.</ref> The doctrine of primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\n====Pope Leo I====\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]] identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted to but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter. \u2026So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles.\" The [[Council of Chalcedon]] would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 280, 323.</ref>\n\n====Pope Gregory VII====\nThe [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian Reform movement]] was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101.</ref> Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry IV]] of Germany, known as the \"[[Investiture Contest]]\". Gregory's ''Dictus Pape'' outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129.</ref> This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\"<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133.</ref> The Petrine primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\n===Challenges===\n\n====Councils====\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The [[Edict of Milan]], the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD).<ref>Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. Pp. 238-256.</ref> Although the highlight of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD was the confession of the [[Person of Christ]], the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \"the most holy and beloved of God\" and \"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, the Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 297-321.</ref>\n\n====Schism====\nInternally, people questioned who rightfully was pope, while others wondered as to the role the pope was to play outside of Rome.<ref>Logan, F. Donald.  A History of the Church in the Middle Ages.  New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 133.</ref> The papacy's most widely known crisis, as well as its largest challenge to authority, came with the \"[[Western Schism]]\" in the late Middle Ages, dating from 1378\u20131417.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.

The Cardinals called the election into question and elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378\u20131394) and his successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1394&ndash;1417) who would reside in Avignon.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox view on relationship to the Church today==\n\n===Many hold the ''Primacy'' of Peter===\n[[File:StPeter-RussianMuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of St. Peter (15th century, [[Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \"preeminent apostles\". Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director,\" or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al.

In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\n{{quote|A very clear patristic tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine of St Cyprian of Carthage on the \"See of Peter\" being present in every local Church, and not only in Rome, is well-known. It is also found in the East, among people who certainly never read the ''De unitate ecclesia'' of Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ \"through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly honors,\" and the author of the ''Areopagitica'', when speaking of the \"hierarchs\" of the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium, including such documents as the lives of the saint, would certainly show that this tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of Christian ecclesiology to consider any local bishop to be the teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, through apostolic succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter. ...There exists, however, another succession, equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only on the level of the analogy existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college, this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order. Its limits are determined by the Councils, and \u2013 in the Byzantine practice \u2013 by the \"very pious emperors.\"|''The Primacy of Peter'', p. 89|title=|source=}}\n\nThe notion that many [[Episcopal see|Sees]] were \u2018\u2019of Peter\u2019\u2019 had also once been held in the West. We hear from [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]:\n\n{{quote|Your most sweet Holiness has spoken much in your letter to me about the chair of Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, saying that he himself now sits on it in the persons of his successors. ...Wherefore though there are many apostles, yet with regard to the principality itself the See of the Prince of the apostles alone has grown strong in authority, which in three places is the See of one. ...He himself stablished (sic) the See in which, though he was to leave it, he sat for seven years. Since then it is the See of one, and one See, over which by Divine authority three bishops now preside, whatever good I hear of you, this I impute to myself.<ref>\u2019\u2019To Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria\u2019\u2019Book VII, Epistle XL</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nConsequently, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the unique successor of St. Peter and consider him to be in a state of schism and heresy. However, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul.\n\nThe Orthodox also consider that [[Pope Linus|St. Linus]], not Peter, was actually the first [[Bishop of Rome]].\n{{quote|Of the church of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul; and Clemens (Clement), after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me Peter.<ref>\u2019\u2019Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions\u2019\u2019, Book 7, Chapter XLVI \u2013 \"Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?\"</ref>}}\n\n===''Keys'' and ''rock'' not exclusive to Peter===\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] theologians agree that in {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}, \"rock\" is a likely reference to Peter personally since the very name \"Peter\" means \"rock.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 47\u201348}}</ref> However {{bibleref2|Matthew|18:18}} implies that the other Apostles were given the same powers.

There were no positions of power between the twelve, only \"degrees of intimacy\" or \"degrees of honor.\" According to this view, Peter has a weak symbolic primacy or primacy of honor (in the sense of a purely honorary primacy). In the patristic era, this was actually the Western view held by St Augustine. Others (see above), following the traditional Byzantine view of St John Chrysostom see Peter as the icon of the bishop and therefore endowed with authority in the Church (i.e. the diocese).\n\n[[Tertullian]]\n{{quote|Come now, you who would indulge a better curiosity, if you would apply it to the business of your salvation, run over the apostolic churches, in which the very thrones of the apostles are still pre-eminent in their places, in which their own authentic writings are read, uttering the voice and representing the face of each of them severally. Achaia is very near you, (in which) you find Corinth. Since you are not far from Macedonia, you have Philippi; (and there too) you have the Thessalonians.

Although Peter is mentioned as speaking first, and all are silent \u2013 all are silent too when Paul speaks. Further, if Peter's pronouncement was authoritative then Paul speaking afterwards would be superfluous; given that the \"decision\" had already been made.\n\nEquality of all the Apostles is shown in {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:19-20}}; that all the Apostles together are the foundation of the church.\n\n{{bibleref2|Galatians|2:7}} shows that Paul taught in the same terms as Peter did.\n\nThe ''forgiveness of sins'' (one of the powers of ''the keys'') is granted to many; see {{bibleref2|John|20:23}} and {{bibleref2|Matthew|18:19}}.\n\n===Examples from history===\nOrthodox historians also maintain that Rome's authority in the early Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) empire was recognized only partially because of Rome's Petrine character, and that this factor was not the decisive issue. Moreover, the Orthodox view is that Rome's privileges were not understood as an absolute power (i.e., the difference between primacy and supremacy). In the East, there were numerous \"apostolic sees\", Jerusalem being considered the \"mother of all churches\", and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|bishop of Antioch]]. \"Canon 28 of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ...The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |page= 68}}</ref>\n\n==Protestant views on relationship to the Church today==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Saint Raphael Catholic Church (Springfield, Ohio) - stained glass, Upon this Rock, detail - St. Peter's Basilica.jpg\n | caption1 = Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome sitting \"Upon this rock,\" a reference to [[:s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 16|Matthew 16]]:18.

However he refers to the \"rock\" as ''petra''. The inspired New Testament Scriptures were written in Greek, not Aramaic. [[Aramaic of Jesus|What Jesus ''might'' have said in Aramaic]] is conjecture. In Greek, there is a distinction between the two words, \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 being a \"rock\" but \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 being a \"small stone\" or \"pebble\". (James G.

Blomberg who states, \"The expression \u2018this rock\u2019 almost certainly refers to Peter, following immediately after his name, just as the words following \u2018the Christ\u2019 in verse 16 applied to Jesus. The play on words in the Greek between Peter's name (Petros) and the word \u2018rock\u2019 (petra) makes sense only if Peter is the Rock and if Jesus is about to explain the significance of this identification.\" [New American Commentary: {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1998/9801word.asp |title=PETER IS THE ROCK (This Rock: January 1998) |publisher=Catholic.com |accessdate=2012-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726101430/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1998/9801word.asp |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref>\n\nDonald A. Carson III (Baptist and Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Seminary) states:\n{{quote|Although it is true that ''petros'' and ''petra'' can mean \"stone\" and \"rock\" respectively in earlier Greek, the distinction is largely confined to poetry. Moreover the underlying Aramaic is in this case unquestionable; and most probably ''kepha'' was used in both clauses (\"you are ''kepha''\" and \"on this ''kepha''\"), since the word was used both for a name and for a \"rock\". The Peshitta (written in Syriac, a language cognate with Aramaic) makes no distinction between the words in the two clauses. The Greek makes the distinction between ''petros'' and ''petra'' simply because it is trying to preserve the pun, and in Greek the feminine ''petra'' could not very well serve as a masculine name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |title=Who is the Rock? |publisher=Users.stargate.net |accessdate=2012-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055823/http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAn alternate Protestant argument is that when Jesus said \"upon this rock\" in the aforementioned Matthew verse, he referred to himself, in reference to {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|32:3-4}}, which states that \"God...is the Rock, his work is perfect\". This idea also appears in {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|10:4}}, which says \"...that Rock is Christ.\" In {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}}, Jesus is called \"the chief cornerstone\".\n\n===Meaning of \"Rock\"===\n\nIn the original [[Greek language|Greek]] the word translated as \"Peter\" is ''\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2'' (Petros) and that translated as \"rock\" is ''\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1'' (petra), two words that, while not identical, give an impression of one of many times when Jesus used a play on words.

In classical Attic Greek ''petros'' generally meant \"pebble,\" while ''petra'' meant \"boulder\" or \"cliff.\" Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \"pebble,\" they argue that the \"rock\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter'', by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481\u201382)]]\nHowever, even though the feminine noun ''petra'' is translated as ''rock'' in the phrase \"on this rock I will build my church,\" the word ''petra'' (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in Greek) is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\"\n\nAlthough {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.<ref>Mathison, Keith A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp.184\u2013185</ref>\n\nAnother rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if ''Peter'' really means ''the Rock'' which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict Bible's teaching in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}} which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone. They posit that the meaning of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}} is that Jesus uses a play on words with Peter's name to say that the confession he had just made is the rock on which the church is built.<ref name=WELS-ROCK>{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090927075835/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2009 |work=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Matthew 16:18 - Peter, This Rock |publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=16 Mar 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOther theologically conservative Christians, including Confessional Lutherans, also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A.

The Lutheran theologians<ref>Danker, Frederick W., ''The concise Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament'', p. 282.</ref> state that the dictionaries of [[Koine Greek|Koine/NT Greek]], including the authoritative<ref>Rykle Borger, \"Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Worterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis,\" Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W.

He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html Religion: Peter & the Rock.]\" \"Time,\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]] in the [[Early Church]].\n\n===Lutheran view===\nFrom the ''[[Book of Concord]]'': {{quote|Chrysostom says thus: \"Upon this rock,\" not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that he should say, \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Therefore, the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation of the Church. \"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/treatise.php |title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope |publisher=Book of Concord |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>}}\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref name=WLS-Gawrisch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |title=The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today |last1=Gawrisch |first1=Wilbert R. |date=5 Aug 1991 |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-03 }}</ref><ref name=WLS-Balge>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In The New Testament \n |last1=Balge \n |first1=Richard D. \n |date=6 June 1995 \n |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary \n |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |archivedate=2015-02-03 \n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.htm ''Some thoughts on Matthew 16:18''] {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2}}, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage\u2014which Paul lacked\u2014and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance, he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself. But none of them, including the rest of the twelve, seem to have played any role of continuing significance for the whole sweep of Christianity\u2014though James the brother of John might have proved an exception had he been spared.\" [Italics original] [[James Dunn (theologian)|Dunn, James D.G.]] ''The Canon Debate''.

A literal translation, in the style of the [[King James Version]], of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\".<ref>In [[French language|French]], the translation, \"Tu es ''Pierre'', et sur cette ''pierre'' je b\u00e2tirai mon \u00c9glise, et les portes de l'enfer ne pr\u00e9vaudront point contre elle\" preserves exactly the play on words in what is believed to be the original Aramaic.</ref> To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" rather than as \"\u039a\u03b7\u03c6\u1fb6\u03c2\" (Cephas).\n\nOne common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the [[New Testament]] in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see [[Aramaic primacy]]. According to the Protestant transliteration argument,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} in the [[Aramaic of Jesus|language that Jesus spoke]], the same word, \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.<ref name=Engler>John Engler. \"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\". <http://www.greatcommission.com/Matthew161720.html> Accessed 12 Mar 2013</ref><ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}</ref>\n\n==Catholic view on relationship to the Church today==\n{{Papal primacy and infallibility|expanded=overview}}\n\nIn [[Catholicism]], it is argued that the primacy of Peter is a basis for the primacy of the bishop of Rome over other [[bishops]] throughout the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the [[pope|papacy]] has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the [[Christendom|entire Church]]. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and [[Apostolic succession|passed on]]. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of [[pope]] which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Protestants do not believe the pope holds any authority over the [[Christian Church|universal Church]].\n\nSome [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Saint Paul saw Judaism]] as the [[Typology (theology)|type]] or figure of [[Christianity]]: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\"{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:11||1 Cor. 10:11}} In the [[613 Mitzvot|Old Law]], {{bibleref2|Deut.|17:8-12}} attributes to the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic suggests that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church,{{cn|date=August 2019}} though the relevance of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed; see also [[New Covenant]] and [[The New Commandment|New Commandment]]. Furthermore, it is typically the local bishop who is considered the high priest of his flock, rather than the pope alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Holy Orders|website=www.va|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], which some call the ''New Law'' or \"New Greek Testament\",<ref>Knight, Kevin. \"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\" ''New Advent.'' Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm</ref> {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16-18}} reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]].\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the [[Book of Revelation]], that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:21-22}} also supports this. [[James Gibbons|Cardinal Gibbons]], in his book ''The Faith of Our Fathers'', points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence. In receiving the keys, Peter takes on the office of [[prime minister]], which was well-known to ancient and contemporary Hebrews, and depicted in the Old Testament, as the one who had authority from the King to bind and loose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/hahn.asp|title=Dr Scott Hahn on the Papacy {{!}} Catholic-Pages.com|website=www.catholic-pages.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/apologetics/catholic-doctrines-and-practices/st-peter-and-the-popes|title=St. Peter and the Popes|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the [[clergy]]), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the [[laity]]). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is invariably mentioned last. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:2}} Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles.{{bibleref2c|Mk.|3:16}} {{bibleref2c|Mt.|4:18-19}} According to {{bibleref2|Acts|1-2,10-11,15}}, St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to {{bibleref2|Luke|22:31-32}}.\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. [[John Chrysostom]]) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.<ref name=\"Veselin Kesich 1992 61\u201366\">{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 61\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council I]] defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint. At the same time, the history of papal primacy has always been imperfect and much-debated.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.  Papal Primacy: From Its Origins to the Present.  Translated by John A. Otto and Linda M.

In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[James the Just|James \"the brother of the Lord\"]] is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]]. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. James was indeed the first bishop or [[patriarch]] of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\".<ref>Mckenzie, John L. ''The Dictionary of the Bible'' (Catholic)</ref> It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to [[Herod Agrippa]]'s persecution. {{bibleref2c|Acts|12}}<ref>''The Navarre Bible'', footnotes</ref>\n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek ''exegesato'' to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EvQJ_i7J4CEC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=exegesato+james&source=bl&ots=0T7FZfHbub&sig=MSPr7qcxxSLvgY1BDHdUgA3xu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mbqave7JAhUJlB4KHTVgDV0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=exegesato%20james&f=false The Biblical Basis for the Papacy] by John Salza</ref> However, James uses the Greek word ''akouoo'' in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his ''Saint Peter and the Popes'' in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm</ref>\n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|And why, then, passing by the others, does He converse with Peter on these things? (John 21:15). He was the chosen one of the Apostles, and the mouth of the disciples, and the leader of the choir. On this account, Paul also went up on a time to see him rather than the others (Galatians 1:18). And withal, to show him that he must thenceforward have confidence, as the denial was done away with, He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren. And He brings not forward the denial, nor reproaches him with what had past, but says, \"If you love me, preside over the brethren.\" ...And the third time He gives him the same injunction, showing what a price He sets the presidency over His own sheep. And if one should say, \"How then did James receive the throne of Jerusalem?,\" this I would answer that He appointed this man (Peter) teacher, not of that throne, but of the whole world.<ref>http://www.catholicbridge.com/catholic/orthodox/pope_acts_15_james_and_peter.php</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the [[end times]] but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the [[body of Christ]], the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\n===Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy===\n\n====Irenaeus====\n[[Irenaeus]] has been called the most important witness of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|Christianity of the 2nd century]].<ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6.</ref> Taught by [[Polycarp]], who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became [[Bishop of Lyon]] in 178. In his ''Against the Heresies'', Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8.</ref> In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way \u2026 gather more than they ought.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.

He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\n====Ignatius of Antioch====\n[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at [[Smyrna]] in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 4.</ref>\n\n====Tertullian====\nBorn in [[Carthage]] around 155 AD, [[Tertullian]] became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his ''Scorpiace'' of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold. \u2026For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23.</ref> ''Scorpiace'' is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\", rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,<ref>Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D..

Published online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.viii.xxi.html</ref> listing various reasons why the Keys of Peter pertained to Peter alone. The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\n====Cyprian====\n[[Cyprian|Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus]] was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30.</ref> In his 251 AD ''De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate'', Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 53.</ref>\n\n====John Chrysostom====\n[[John Chrysostom]] was born at [[Antioch]] around 347 and would fight for the reform of the Church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. He called Peter \"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 126.</ref> His writings also emphasize the mortality of Peter, linking him more closely to the people of the Church.\n\n====Augustine of Hippo====\n[[Saint Augustine]] was born in [[Numidia]] in 354 AD and was baptized in [[Milan]] in 387 AD. He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 163.</ref> His ''Sermo'' states, \"Peter in many places in the Scriptures appears to represent the Church, especially in that place where it was said 'I give to thee the keys \u2026 shall be loosed in heaven'. What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 175.</ref> His 395 A.D. ''Contra Epistolam Manichaei'' states, \"There are many other things which rightly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church. \u2026The succession of the priests keeps me, from the very seat of the apostle Peter (to whom the Lord after his resurrection gave charge to feed his sheep) down to the present episcopate.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 182.</ref>\n\n====Pope Innocent I====\n[[Pope Innocent I|Innocent I]] held the papal office from 402 to 417. Modern theories of papal primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to [[Decentius]], bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194.</ref> It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes to the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198.</ref> The doctrine of primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\n====Pope Leo I====\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]] identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted to but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter. \u2026So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles.\" The [[Council of Chalcedon]] would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 280, 323.</ref>\n\n====Pope Gregory VII====\nThe [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian Reform movement]] was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101.</ref> Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry IV]] of Germany, known as the \"[[Investiture Contest]]\". Gregory's ''Dictus Pape'' outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129.</ref> This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\"<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133.</ref> The Petrine primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\n===Challenges===\n\n====Councils====\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The [[Edict of Milan]], the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD).<ref>Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. Pp. 238-256.</ref> Although the highlight of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD was the confession of the [[Person of Christ]], the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \"the most holy and beloved of God\" and \"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, the Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 297-321.</ref>\n\n====Schism====\nInternally, people questioned who rightfully was pope, while others wondered as to the role the pope was to play outside of Rome.<ref>Logan, F. Donald.  A History of the Church in the Middle Ages.  New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 133.</ref> The papacy's most widely known crisis, as well as its largest challenge to authority, came with the \"[[Western Schism]]\" in the late Middle Ages, dating from 1378\u20131417.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.

The Cardinals called the election into question and elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378\u20131394) and his successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1394&ndash;1417) who would reside in Avignon.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox view on relationship to the Church today==\n\n===Many hold the ''Primacy'' of Peter===\n[[File:StPeter-RussianMuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of St. Peter (15th century, [[Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \"preeminent apostles\". Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director,\" or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al.

In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\n{{quote|A very clear patristic tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine of St Cyprian of Carthage on the \"See of Peter\" being present in every local Church, and not only in Rome, is well-known. It is also found in the East, among people who certainly never read the ''De unitate ecclesia'' of Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ \"through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly honors,\" and the author of the ''Areopagitica'', when speaking of the \"hierarchs\" of the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium, including such documents as the lives of the saint, would certainly show that this tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of Christian ecclesiology to consider any local bishop to be the teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, through apostolic succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter. ...There exists, however, another succession, equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only on the level of the analogy existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college, this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order. Its limits are determined by the Councils, and \u2013 in the Byzantine practice \u2013 by the \"very pious emperors.\"|''The Primacy of Peter'', p. 89|title=|source=}}\n\nThe notion that many [[Episcopal see|Sees]] were \u2018\u2019of Peter\u2019\u2019 had also once been held in the West. We hear from [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]:\n\n{{quote|Your most sweet Holiness has spoken much in your letter to me about the chair of Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, saying that he himself now sits on it in the persons of his successors. ...Wherefore though there are many apostles, yet with regard to the principality itself the See of the Prince of the apostles alone has grown strong in authority, which in three places is the See of one. ...He himself stablished (sic) the See in which, though he was to leave it, he sat for seven years. Since then it is the See of one, and one See, over which by Divine authority three bishops now preside, whatever good I hear of you, this I impute to myself.<ref>\u2019\u2019To Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria\u2019\u2019Book VII, Epistle XL</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nConsequently, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the unique successor of St. Peter and consider him to be in a state of schism and heresy. However, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul.\n\nThe Orthodox also consider that [[Pope Linus|St. Linus]], not Peter, was actually the first [[Bishop of Rome]].\n{{quote|Of the church of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul; and Clemens (Clement), after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me Peter.<ref>\u2019\u2019Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions\u2019\u2019, Book 7, Chapter XLVI \u2013 \"Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?\"</ref>}}\n\n===''Keys'' and ''rock'' not exclusive to Peter===\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] theologians agree that in {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}, \"rock\" is a likely reference to Peter personally since the very name \"Peter\" means \"rock.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 47\u201348}}</ref> However {{bibleref2|Matthew|18:18}} implies that the other Apostles were given the same powers.

There were no positions of power between the twelve, only \"degrees of intimacy\" or \"degrees of honor.\" According to this view, Peter has a weak symbolic primacy or primacy of honor (in the sense of a purely honorary primacy). In the patristic era, this was actually the Western view held by St Augustine.

In the East, there were numerous \"apostolic sees\", Jerusalem being considered the \"mother of all churches,\" and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|bishop of Antioch]]. \"Canon 28 of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that the accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ... The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |page= 68}}</ref>\n\n==Protestant views on relationship to the Church today==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Saint Raphael Catholic Church (Springfield, Ohio) - stained glass, Upon this Rock, detail - St. Peter's Basilica.jpg\n | caption1 = Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome sitting \"Upon this rock,\" a reference to [[:s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 16|Matthew 16]]:18.

However he refers to the \"rock\" as ''petra''. The inspired New Testament Scriptures were written in Greek, not Aramaic. [[Aramaic of Jesus|What Jesus ''might'' have said in Aramaic]] is conjecture. In Greek, there is a distinction between the two words, \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 being a \"rock\" but \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 being a \"small stone\" or \"pebble\". (James G.

Carson III (Baptist and Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Seminary) states:\n{{quote|Although it is true that ''petros'' and ''petra'' can mean \"stone\" and \"rock\" respectively in earlier Greek, the distinction is largely confined to poetry. Moreover the underlying Aramaic is in this case unquestionable; and most probably ''kepha'' was used in both clauses (\"you are ''kepha''\" and \"on this ''kepha''\"), since the word was used both for a name and for a \"rock\". The Peshitta (written in Syriac, a language cognate with Aramaic) makes no distinction between the words in the two clauses. The Greek makes the distinction between ''petros'' and ''petra'' simply because it is trying to preserve the pun, and in Greek the feminine ''petra'' could not very well serve as a masculine name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |title=Who is the Rock? |publisher=Users.stargate.net |accessdate=2012-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055823/http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAn alternate Protestant argument is that when Jesus said \"upon this rock\" in the aforementioned Matthew verse, he referred to himself, in reference to {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|32:3-4}}, which states that \"God...is the Rock, his work is perfect\". This idea also appears in {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|10:4}}, which says \"...that Rock is Christ.\" In {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}}, Jesus is called \"the chief cornerstone\".\n\n===Meaning of \"Rock\"===\n\nIn the original [[Greek language|Greek]] the word translated as \"Peter\" is ''\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2'' (Petros) and that translated as \"rock\" is ''\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1'' (petra), two words that, while not identical, give an impression of one of many times when Jesus used a play on words.

In classical Attic Greek ''petros'' generally meant \"pebble,\" while ''petra'' meant \"boulder\" or \"cliff.\" Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \"pebble,\" they argue that the \"rock\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter'', by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481\u201382)]]\nHowever, even though the feminine noun ''petra'' is translated as ''rock'' in the phrase \"on this rock I will build my church,\" the word ''petra'' (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in Greek) is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\"\n\nAlthough {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.<ref>Mathison, Keith A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp.184\u2013185</ref>\n\nAnother rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if ''Peter'' really means ''the Rock'' which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict Bible's teaching in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}} which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone. They posit that the meaning of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}} is that Jesus uses a play on words with Peter's name to say that the confession he had just made is the rock on which the church is built.<ref name=WELS-ROCK>{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090927075835/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2009 |work=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Matthew 16:18 - Peter, This Rock |publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=16 Mar 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOther theologically conservative Christians, including Confessional Lutherans, also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A.

The Lutheran theologians<ref>Danker, Frederick W., ''The concise Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament'', p. 282.</ref> state that the dictionaries of [[Koine Greek|Koine/NT Greek]], including the authoritative<ref>Rykle Borger, \"Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Worterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis,\" Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W.

Conservative Lutheran apologists state:\n\n{{quote|There is no biblical or historical evidence for the claims of the Roman Catholic church that Peter was the first pope.

He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html Religion: Peter & the Rock.]\" \"Time,\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]] in the [[Early Church]].\n\n===Lutheran view===\nFrom the ''[[Book of Concord]]'': {{quote|Chrysostom says thus: \"Upon this rock,\" not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that he should say, \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Therefore, the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation of the Church. \"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/treatise.php |title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope |publisher=Book of Concord |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>}}\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref name=WLS-Gawrisch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |title=The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today |last1=Gawrisch |first1=Wilbert R. |date=5 Aug 1991 |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-03 }}</ref><ref name=WLS-Balge>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In The New Testament \n |last1=Balge \n |first1=Richard D. \n |date=6 June 1995 \n |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary \n |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |archivedate=2015-02-03 \n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.htm ''Some thoughts on Matthew 16:18''] {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Conservative ideology in Taiwan constitutes the character and policies of the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]] party and that of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]].\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Overview: Three spheres of Conservative Policy ==\n\n=== Cross-Strait Policy ===\nThe relationship between the Republic of China (ROC) and the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] is Taiwan's main concern in foreign affairs. In a broad sense, the conservative Cross-Strait stance adheres to the notion of One-China, represented by the Kuomintang (KMT). However, the integration of this [[One-China|One-China philosophy]] into the party line has changed considerably. By the end of [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chiang Kai-shek\u2019]]<nowiki/>s presidency, the agenda of radical pro-unification via military force has slowly devolved into the desire for peaceful and strategic, albeit competitive coexistence rather than outright contention. Over time, the latter strategy has consolidated into the [[One China principle|One-China principle]] as a result of the [[1992 Consensus]], which proposed a unified entity comprising both Taiwan and the Mainland, while leaving the issue of representation open to interpretation. From a comparative standpoint, conservatives derive economic and security benefits from communication with the PRC, while warning against Taiwan's isolation and insecurity implied under [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese sovereignty.]] For Taiwan's political conservatives, the status quo is less than optimal, but at least better than independence from the PROC.\n\n=== Domestic Policy ===\nConservative domestic policy in Taiwan reflects a strong government at the center of policy and decision-making, in which the state takes initiative for individuals and closely intervenes in their daily lives. This runs counter to [[Western conservatism|Western political conservatism]], which supports a [[small government]] that operates on the perimeter of social life in order to respect the liberty of citizens. As such, conservative KMT policies may also be characterized by a focus on maintaining the traditions and doctrine of Confucian thought, namely reinforcing the morals of paternalism and patriarchy in Taiwan's society. Moreover, conservatism focuses on preserving the safety of the status quo under the [[One China principle|One-China principle]], which embodies the traditional political thought of the KMT party, as opposed to the uncertainty of change under the opposition parties' associated pro-independence movement. On a broader level, political conservatism within Taiwan revolves around building and later, preserving a unified Chinese national identity based on [[Sinocentrism]]. Similar to the threat of multiculturalism which governs one primary concern for western conservatives  i.e. United States,  KMT policies are against the integration of [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aboriginal culture]] into the mainstream Chinese identity.\n\n=== Economic Policy ===\nIn terms of [[Economic policy|economic policies]], [[conservatism]] in [[Taiwan]] can be described as highly interventionist. The national economy is centrally planned for the purpose of development and little separation between state and society exists. That opposes the general notion of economic conservatism, where little to no [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] in the economic affairs is desired. This ideological difference stems from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] roots of Taiwanese conservatism. Following the notion of Confucian [[Paternalistic conservatism|paternalism]], where the father is the head of the family, conservatives see the state as the head of society. As such, the state has to ensure the well-being of the population by promoting development and interfering in the economic affairs. Examples of conservative policies include the 1949-1953 Land Reforms, the 1950-1968 Economic Reforms aimed at encouraging production for export, the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]] and the establishment of the [[Three Links|Three Direct Links]] with [[China]].\n\n== Origins and Philosophy  ==\n\n=== Socioreligious tradition of Confucianism ===\nThere are four basic elements of [[Confucianism]] which apply to conservatist governance. The [[Paternalism|Paternalistic State]] entails top-down decision making under the notion that the \u201cFather is the head of the house, and likewise, the state the head of society.\u201d Leaders possess, ''[[Jen (Confucianism)|jen]]'', a supreme virtue representing human qualities at their best which determines their right to rule. The idea of s''ocial order and harmony'' translates into the assumption of the benevolent state - ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren/humaneness]],'' with which civil society works together - ''shu/reciprocity,'' rather than oppose, monitor, and scrutinize.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Chun-chieh|last2=Wu|first2=Kung-ming|date=|title=Taiwan and the Confucius Aspiration: Towards the Twenty-first Century|url=http://huang.cc.ntu.edu.tw/pdf/CCB1306.pdf|journal=NTU Databases|volume=3|pages=72\u201386|via=ntu.edu.tw}}</ref> The [[Patriarchy|Notion of Patriarchy]] positions men as leaders, and women as passive. Confucius and [[Mencius]], in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues|''three obediences'']] depict obedience to the father and elder brothers when young, to the husband when married, and to the sons when widowed. Finally, c''ollectivity'' captures the absence of the tradition of celebrating the individual in contrast to the United States. Instead, hierarchy is respected because it reflects naturally ordained positions in society. Moreover, the fulfilment of individual duties in a given position is necessary for the function of society.\n\n=== Sun Yat-sen's Political Perspectives ===\nMany of the Kuomintang's policies were inspired by its founder [[Sun Yat-sen]]\u2019s vision, and his ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'': nationalism (\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u7fa9), democracy (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9) and people\u2019s livelihood (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9). These [[Three Principles of the People|three principles]] combine to make Taiwan a free, powerful, and prosperous nation, although they are selectively interpreted in a specific context which deviates from Sun Yat-sen's original intent. For example, during Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s rule and much of [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]\u2019s, the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian state]] overshadowed democracy by censoring the people\u2019s voice. However, most of his political ideas which were later adapted by his successors in governing Taiwan included equalization of land ownership, learning Chinese traditional morality through Confucian values, and the regulation of state capital by national corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6996|title=Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Political Philosophy - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=1965-04-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==  Chronology of Kuomintang governments   ==\n\n=== Chiang Kai-shek (1945\u20131975) ===\n{{Main|Chiang Kai-shek}}\n[[File:\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63\u8096\u50cf(\u4e0a\u8272).jpg|thumb|President Chiang Kai-shek]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nChiang Kai-shek`s retreat to Taiwan following the [[Chinese Civil War]], and the subsequent establishment of the ROC in December 1949, marked the beginning of the One-China party line.  In Taiwan, the KMT immediately insisted on its right to maintain the position of the legal representative of all of China. The \u201cgovernment in exile\u201d, a term the ROC under Chiang Kai-shek elected to call itself, remained a status recognized by the international community until October 1971, when Taiwan's seat in the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] was replaced by that of the PRC, and February 1972, which marked [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|Nixon's historical visit to Peking]] which ended in the shocking [[Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9|Shanghai Communique.]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Republic of China under Chiang Kai-Shek: Taiwan Today .|last=Lumley|first=F.A.|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the KMT sought to bide time and strength under US assistance and protection in order to retake the mainland. The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] prompted [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to order the Seventh Fleet to defend Taiwan against the possibility of invasion on June 27, 1950.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Taiwan under Chiang Kai Shek's Era: 1945-1976|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/Sinologie/repository/uePRDemokrUIdentTaiwanSeit1980/Cheng_TaiwanUnderChiangKai-shek_sEra1945-1976.pdf|journal=Asian Profile|volume= 16| issue =  4|pages=299\u2013315|via=}}</ref> Although the US overall goal was not to aid Chiang's return to the mainland, but to build Taiwan into a fortress against communism, it allowed Chiang to pursue his military vision of reunification.\n\nAs a staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], Chiang pushed his doctrine of pro-reunification under the ideology of liberating the mainland from the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] using force. Hence, the army of civilians, legal specialists, troops, and other skilled workers that came with him viewed Taiwan as a temporary base for building industrial and military strength towards the level necessary to retake the mainland. In August 1955, and later in 1958, Chiang demonstrated his commitment for settling KMT-[[Communist Party of China|Communist Party of China (CCP)]] representative rivalry with military force by instigating conflict along the Tachen, Kinmen and Matsu islands in the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jinghua|date=November 2011|title=Taiwan's Role in the Breakout of the Taiwan Strait Crises: A Historical Perspective|url=http://isdp.eu/content/uploads/publications/2011_lu_taiwans-role-in-the-breakout.pdf|journal=Institute for Security and Development Policy|volume=|pages=6\u201315|via=}}</ref> The PROC began shelling the islands in response to Chiang's deployment of approximately 60,000 armed troops into the area, which prompted the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. In the 1960s smaller skirmishes were accompanied by unconventional strategies aimed at the liberation of China. Chiang Kai-shek deployed planes which dropped leaflets and sent the air force on reconnaissance and espionage missions i.e. blowing up bridges and infrastructure in the mainland. Nevertheless, the 1970s was marked by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], signaling Taiwan's decline in the international community, and with it, the desire to recapture the mainland was replaced by the necessity to survive under the new unstable status quo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/TaiwansFailureattheUN_JPPanda_240908|title=Taiwan's Failure at the UN {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nThe KMT's [[One-China policy]] also influenced its governing policy in Taiwan. Dealing with the island's weakening economy after a long period of prosperity under the Japanese, as well as the residents\u2019 dissatisfaction of KMT's administration, Chiang Kai-shek decided on consolidating his dominance through an authoritarian political system to stabilize Taiwan's internal affairs, opening path for reunification with Mainland.\n\nStructure-wise, the government of Chiang imposed on Taiwan was of little difference than the [[Government of the Republic of China|previous form used to administer Mainland China]]. Almost all of the governmental positions, with the addition of the highest military positions, police, and the educational system, were occupied by [[Mainland Chinese|Mainlanders]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Taiwan/Government-and-society|title=Taiwan {{!}} History, Facts, & People - Government and society|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en}}</ref> Ethnic division in the establishment of the administration system was visible: [[Hoklo people|Hokkien people]], the major ethnicity in Taiwan, took control over local governments. Meanwhile, the minority [[Hakka people|Hakka]] occupied top positions in bodies such as police and railroads, due to their favorability towards Mainlanders.<ref name=\":4\" /> The KMT created a separate government for Taiwan, consisting of five municipalities and sixteen counties, where local residents could exercise voting rights.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Taiwan: A New History|last=Wang|first=Peter Chen-main|publisher=M.E.

Their goal was to change the Japanese colonial laid rental system which promoted unfair distribution of land and contributed to the gap between rich and poor. The reforms aimed at making all farmers the owners of their own fields.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,23,45,10&post=15716|title=Land-to-the-tiller program transformed Taiwan - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2009-08-28|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The reforms consisted of three stages. First, compulsory reduction of land rent, which limited farm rents to a maximum of 37,5 percent of the annual yield of the main crops. The second stage - sale of public land, that was previously owned and confiscated from Japanese colonists, to actual tenants at a price significantly below market value. The final third stage - the \u201cLand-to-the-Tiller Act\u201d, under which land owned by landlords in excess of 2,9 hectares was compulsorily sold to the government, which in turn resold it to tenants.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Samuel P.S.|date=1987|title=Economics, Economic Bureaucracy, and Taiwan's Economic Development|jstor=2758133|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=60|issue=2|pages=226\u2013247|doi=10.2307/2758133}}</ref> These reforms touched a vast majority of the Taiwanese agricultural population, with 70% of tenant households having their rents reduced in the first stage. The second and third stages also contributed to reducing the land farmed by tenants from 44% in 1949 to 17% in 1953.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1582258/land-reform-in-taiwan|title=Land Reform in Taiwan by Chen Cheng, 1961 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\nEconomically, the reforms were important as with the change of ownership, the incentive framework of the cultivator was transformed - promoting an increase of work efforts, production, investment and adoption of new technologies. This rising productivity was necessary for the subsequent transfer of resources - labor and capital, to other sectors of the economy.<ref name=\":0\" /> The reforms also brought an impact to the income distribution, improving the incomes of tenants and new owners. It is argued that such policy of distribution first, and growth later also contributed to the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] growth pattern of the country.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Chiang Ching-kuo (1975\u20131988) ===\n{{Main|Chiang Ching-kuo}}\n[[File:ChiangChingkuo photo.jpg|thumb|255x255px|President Chiang Ching-kuo]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nTaiwan under KMT president Chiang Ching-kuo embodied a move towards more flexible Cross-Strait relationship in an era of official diplomatic isolation, launched by the [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|US recognition of the PRC]] on January 1, 1979.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-announces-that-it-will-recognize-communist-china|title=United States announces that it will recognize communist China - Dec 15, 1978 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>  While Chiang Kai-shek's original One-China philosophy maintained Taiwan as its sole legitimate representative, a stance at the time recognized by the international community, his son, confronted by Taiwan's declining international status and the rise of China's power and relevance, could no longer maintain the same hard stance and openly hostile policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,23,45,10&post=14527|title=Book explores Taiwan's 'pragmatic' approach to foreign policy-making - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2007-07-06|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> Thus, the KMT under Kuo shifted its interpretation of One-China  to the notion of representative rivalry within its current [[Cross-Strait relations]], which expresses Taiwan's necessity to negotiate for its relevance and its concessions made in other foreign arenas in light of the CPP's competing claim of representation.\n\nUnder the One-China line, Chiang Ching-kuo negotiated for its own security in order to compete with the PRC's growing power. As such, he filled the void of formal diplomatic ties to other countries with unofficial ties, sharing the modern paradigm of [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|Taiwan's foreign relations.]] Chiang Ching-kuo's responded bitterly to the severing of official relations in 1979 and the termination of the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty|Mutual Defense Treaty]], causing him to reiterate his five principles with regard to ROC-US relations under the banner of \u201creality, continuity, security, legality, and governmentality.\" As a result, the United States Congress pushed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] on Oct. 10 the same year. The act was an unofficial brokerage which allowed the US to deal with external threats to Taiwan and to sell arms for the purpose of defense building.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yeh|first=Chung-lu|date=April 2014|title=Policy Brief III: Taiwan Relations Act: Time For A Change?|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/TRAPolicyBrief.Lu__0.pdf|journal=Policy Brief Series: Wilson Center|volume=Three|pages=2\u20138|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the \u201c[[Three Noes]]\u201d: no contact, no compromise, no negotiation, with the PROC was adopted in response to the ROC's \u201cThree Links\u201d and maintained by president Kuo. However, the [[China Airlines Flight 334|hijacking of a Chinese Airline Cargo Plane]] on May 3, 1986, combined with domestic pressure by citizens demanding to reach the mainland, undid the policy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Language Politics and identity in Taiwan: Naming China|last=Hui|first=Ching-Chang|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-0415836012|location=|pages=}}</ref> In 1987, an Open Door policy allowed the ROC Red Cross to issue permits for people from Taiwan to travel to their relatives in the mainland, prompting the start of ongoing civilian exchanges between the ROC and the PRC.\n\nThe compromise of \u201c[[Chinese Taipei]]\u201d at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] is a significant example of concessions made during Chiang Ching-kuo's administration. Due to China's complaints regarding the term Chinese Taiwan, and the registering of athletes as Chinese athletes, Taiwan adopted \"Chinese Taipei\"  - a term that silently endorsed the One-China principle, and resembled a compromise of representation to which both parties were satisfied.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/the-curious-case-of-taiwan-and-chinese-taipei/1128282|title=The curious case of Taiwan and Chinese Taipei|work=outlookindia.com/|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> This was a pragmatic move toward regaining international space for the ROC, one which embodied a move toward reunification.\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nIn light of growing domestic pro-democracy sentiment, abandonment by the international community - starting from the United States\u2019 decision to not recognize the ROC diplomatically, and China's rising power and international status, Chiang Ching-kuo initiated various strategic, limited democratic concessions in order to consolidate KMT authority against internal and external pressures. Doing so would allow the KMT to strategically continue as a strong state under the semblance of democracy, while also enabling the ROC securely allocate attention abroad in negotiating its One-China policy. Ultimately, human rights issues still remained a major controversy in this era, given that Chiang Ching-kuo kept the main policies of his father's reign alive. However, the [[Martial law in Taiwan|Martial Law]], the product of his father's security concerns of a communist rebellion was eventually lifted in 1987.\n\nChiang Ching-kuo's gradual switch from ethnic Chinese conservatism to Taiwanese conservatism began with reshuffling the cabinet to include more ethnically Taiwanese members, albeit on a small scale.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Taiwan: A New History|last=Rubinstein|first=Murray A.|publisher=M.E.

While Chiang Ching-kuo began slowly relaxing restraints on political opposition, \u201cTang-wai\u201d was already earning large support from local elections in the end of the 1970s; much to the extent that after [[Kaohsiung Incident]] in 1979, the KMT initiated stricter surveillance, and capture, of opposition members.<ref name=\":6\" /> As political activism in the 1980s attracted more and more Taiwanese, the KMT government started carrying out open policies to encourage participation of the remaining population, such as including new  talents and religious people.<ref name=\":6\" /> A prominent example would be Chiang's decision to pick [[Lee Teng-hui]], an original Taiwanese, to be the country's vice-president in 1982.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite thesis |last=Hansson |first=Ulf |date=2007 |title=Chiang Ching-Kuo A Motive Analysis |type=Bachelor |publisher=Lund University |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1319621}}</ref> In, 1986, Chiang Ching-kuo did the unthinkable: he flouted the KMT by allowing the illegal formation of the [[Democratic Progressive Party|Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)]]. These policies demonstrate that Chiang Ching-kuo sought to gain international support in order to strengthen his regime, by taking the moral high ground of democratic legitimacy against the rising threat of China. In doing so, he also sought to appease the United States for finance and security reasons.\n\nAnother element of Chiang Ching-kuo's era represented the continued exclusion of [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal people of Taiwan]] for fear of polluting Sinocentric national identity. Although the DPP was formed, it was never based on the intention of restoring rights of Aboriginals, but rather as a front to dissipate anger and satisfaction. Furthermore, there were no policies set in motion to return land stolen under Chiang Kai-shek, lift the ban addressing Aboriginal languages, or provide education in schools to continue Aboriginal culture. Only after democratic consolidation occurred after Chiang Ching-kuo, were aboriginal rights restored. In tandem with maintaining a strict Sino-centric identity, as Chiang Ching-kuo and his men were attempting to introduce a new brand of conservatism to the party structure, on the nationwide scale the government was still labeled authoritarian conservative.\n\n==== Economic Policy ====\nThe 1970s was period of rapid economic development for the Taiwanese economy. The government realized that the existing infrastructure was reaching its maximum capacity and was no longer able to accommodate the economy's needs. Chiang Ching-kuo became the driving force behind the proposal of the first post war large-scale infrastructure construction, namely the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]]. They included six projects covering highway, rail, sea and air transportation infrastructure, and others - shipbuilding, oil refining, steel manufacturing and nuclear power generation. The work on the projects started in the early 1970s while Chiang was still a Premier and most of the projects were completed by the end of the decade.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=13964|title=Building the Economy of the Future - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2011-06-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The construction significantly contributed to mitigating the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, such as spiking unemployment resulting from factory closures.

Thus, his contributions to Conservatism must be carefully limited to the economy sphere. Indeed, throughout his presidency, Lee rejected the \u201c1992\u201d Consensus\" under the claim that China's characterization of Taiwan as a \"renegade province\u201d embodied a straw man argument. Instead, he considered Taiwan as having always remained historically independent, under the observation of the [[Treaty of San Francisco|San-Francisco Treaty.]] Such a radical stance worried China to the extent in which military sanctions were used, prompting the outbreak of the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]].\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nDue to being regarded as the pioneer of the liberalization ofTaiwanese politics, many internal policies under Lee's presidency did not follow the conservative political line traditional to KMT. During his rule, he actively promoted democracy by removing permanent members of the Legislative Yuan - namely the Mainlanders in power since 1949, as well as holding free elections afterwards to include more Taiwanese members. He emphasized his ethnically Taiwanese identity in his rule, crafting a stronger sense of [[Taiwanization|Taiwanese nationalism]] following his predecessor Chiang Ching-kuo's steps.\n\n==== Economic Policy ====\nDuring the 1990s the Taiwanese government actively pursued monitoring and control over the cross-strait investments. Various regulations were implemented, such as requiring all firms that were investing in the mainland to report the amount and the nature of their investments. If they failed to do so, variety of punishments were awaiting - including denying permissions to travel, cutting off credits and exchange operations, denying future investment applications.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|jstor=10.7249/mg507osd.11|title=Chinese Economic Coercion Against Taiwan|journal=Chinese Economic Coercion Against Taiwan|date=2007|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833039699|editor-last=Tanner|editor-first=Murray Scot|edition=1|series=A Tricky Weapon to Use|pages=33\u201372|last1=Tanner|first1=Murray Scot}}</ref> Regulations also prescribed that new investments over US$1 million would require advance approval, further strengthening the government's ability to oversee the mainland related economic activities.\n\nThis period was also marked by a major shift in the Taiwanese investments - from-small scale manufacturing and mostly labor-intensive industries, such as apparel, footwear, food processing, to higher technology production and infrastructure projects. As a result, the value of investments increased greatly, bringing up the government's fears of Taiwan's growing reliance on the mainland. In response, President [[Lee Teng-hui]] asserted that the country's excessive dependence upon overseas investment, particularly in the PRC, was diverting capital and attention from revitalizing the domestic economy, and the government might have to put a lid on it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher Matthew|first=Eyton Laurence|date=August 1996|title=A Sharp Change of Course: President Lee and Big Business Spar Over China|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> One of the new strategies to diversify Taiwanese investments in other less hostile markets, was the \u201cGo South\u201d policy that encouraged outsourcing production in [[Southeast Asia]]. This policy however didn't produce the needed results and reduce the investments to the mainland.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSeeing the weaknesses of the \u201cGo South\u201d strategy, the government took another approach introducing the \u201cNo Haste, Be Patient\u201d policy. It required case-by-case approvals of Taiwanese investments in high-technology and infrastructure in the mainland. Also, it imposed limits on investments in the [[China|PRC]] - with a maximum investment level of 20 to 40 percent of a firm's total net worth and a ceiling of US$50 million on individual investments.<ref name=\":2\" /> A following regulation also banned Taiwanese investment in most large-scale infrastructure and energy projects. It was argued that the policy's objective was not to stop entirely the movement towards the mainland, but to slow and manage the outflow of high-tech firms and give them the opportunity to develop at home. Lee also claimed that as long as Beijing was being hostile towards Taiwan, such unrestrained investments and excessive reliance on the mainland would undermine the national security.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLee's policies were met with strong opposition - both from the business levels and the general electorate, which supported closer economic ties with the mainland, in spite of concerns over security threats and pressure from Beijing.\n\n=== Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016) ===\n{{Main|Ma Ying-jeou}}\n[[File:Ma Ying-jeou official cropped.jpg|thumb|287x287px|President Ma Ying-jeou]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nUnder the presidency of [[Ma Ying-jeou]], the 1992 consensus carried on, allowing Taiwan to silently maintain its representation of One-China. In the context of this stalemate, Ma then turned towards bolstering Taiwan's security and international position by implementing flexible diplomacy. As such, Ma's main vision was to slowly restore the ''[[modus vivendi]]'' in regard to the growing power and influence of the ROC by scaling down the hostile relationship which had greatly escalated during Lee Teng-hui's and [[Chen Shui-bian]]\u2019s presidencies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/03/16/former-taiwan-president-ma-on-one-china-the-1992-consensus-and-taiwans-future/|title=Former Taiwan president Ma on One China, the 1992 consensus, and Taiwan's future|last=Whelan-Wuest|first=Maeve|date=2017-03-16|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}</ref> According to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] during Ma\u2019s presidency, the consensus represented the ROC\u2019s principles of \u201cdignity, autonomy, pragmatism, and flexibility\u201d in foreign affairs.

Following the growing desires and the increasing pressure from the business community, a few weeks after Ma's inauguration he initiated talks between Taiwan and the mainland regarding the issue of the [[Three Links|Three Direct Links]]. These are the three main paths of communication between Taiwan and PRC - via mail, transportation and commerce, which were banned between the two sides for almost six decades. The absence of the three links has been a huge barrier for Taiwanese businesses, increasing shipment costs and obstructing access to a potentially large market, low labor costs and talent pool in the mainland. It also prevented investment and development of multinational companies back in Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eai.nus.edu.sg/publications/files/BB415.pdf|title=The Economics of Taiwan's Three Direct Links with Mainland China|last=Chen|first=Chien-Hsun|date=27 November 2008|website=National University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\nFinally, on November 4, 2008 the two sides signed series of agreements regarding each link and Three Direct Links were established.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/china/09063001.html|title=China in Transition\u300cImproved Cross-Straits Relations under the Ma Ying-jeou Administration - A path to peaceful reunification -\u300d|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}</ref> The successful talks mark a historic moment signifying that cross-Strait relations have moved past hostility towards negotiation and cooperation. The opposition has been sceptical, repeatedly claiming that while such move might be economically beneficial for Taiwan, it is compromising the national security with Taiwanese airports being open to PRC aircraft. In reality however, because of this development, cross-strait relations have increasingly become oriented towards rapprochement rather than confrontation.\n\nAnother economic policy of Ma's government is the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]]. Signed in 2010, the Agreement aims to reduce tariffs and commercial barriers between the two-sides, with the hope for much-needed boost to Taiwan's economy. Yet, it was not received well by the public, giving start of protests and a fierce public debate over the effects of the agreement. Opponents have expressed concerns for the future of  the local economy, as Taiwanese workers and small businesses would have to compete with  increasing imports of cheaper Chinese goods. At the heart of the protests however, has been the fear that the ECFA might be led to reunification with Beijing, which sees the island as a Chinese province.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/27/world/la-fg-taiwan-protests-20100627|title=Taiwan trade pact with China fires up protesters|last=Sui|first=Cindy|date=2010-06-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The President has asserted that the deal is about economics, not politics, and has affirmed his confidence over Taiwanese democracy and its ability to fend off undue pressure from the PRC.\n\n== Conservatives in Taiwan ==\n\n=== Political Parties ===\n{{Main|Pan-Blue Coalition}}\nThe Conservative parties in Taiwan or the so-called \u201c[[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]]\u201d includes the Kuomintang (KMT), the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party (PFP)]] and the [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party (NP)]].\n\nKuomintang is the main conservative party and currently it is the largest opposition party in the Legislative Yuan with 35 seats.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/01/17/2003637386|title=ELECTIONS: DPP secures absolute majority in Legislative Yuan - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\nPeople's First Party is a liberal conservative party, founded by former KMT General Secretary and Taiwan Provincial Governor [[James Soong]] after the 2000 presidential elections. It is the main contender with the KMT for the conservative votes.

The NP has been a vanishing force in the political landscape, not having won any seats in the Legislative Yuan since the 2008 elections.\n\n=== Supporter Base ===\nInitially, the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]] and the [[Pan-Green Coalition|pan-green camp]] reflected the ideological differences within society over national identity. Those ideological differences were manifested through the different stances on cross-strait policy - with the blue-camp being pro-unification and the green-camp - pro-independence. Therefore, determining party affiliation was based on ethnicity and the attitude towards the relationship with the mainland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jamestown.org/program/taiwans-election-results-reflect-shift-in-attitudes/|title=Taiwan's Election Results Reflect Shift in Attitudes - Jamestown|work=Jamestown|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}</ref> As a result, the pan-blue camp supporter base traditionally consisted of people mainly having Chinese identities and pro-unification attitudes.\n\nRecently however, it has been observed that the alignment with a party has grown beyond these traditional dichotomies. This has been influenced by the growth of a distinct Taiwanese identity, rooted not in ethno-cultural aspect, but in the historical, economic and political development of the island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/course/news.php?Sn=166#|title=\u516c\u544a\uff1a\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u81fa\u7063\u4eba/\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\u8a8d\u540c\u8da8\u52e2\u5206\u4f48(1992\u5e7406\u6708~2017\u5e7406\u6708\uff09 - \u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78 \u9078\u8209\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3|website=esc.nccu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The change has affected people's preferences, with a growing concern over each party's capability and will to maintain what is being considered Taiwanese identity. As a result of this tendency and in attempt to appeal to the growing group of people who identify as Taiwanese, the KMT has lost its idealistic pan-Chinese passion. To avoid marginalization, it has focused rather on practical steps of Sino-Taiwanese cooperation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Gunter|date=2004|title=Taiwan's Political Parties and National Identity: The Rise of an Overarching Consensus|jstor=10.1525/as.2004.44.4.534|journal=Asian Survey|volume=44|issue=4|pages=534\u2013554|doi=10.1525/as.2004.44.4.534}}</ref>\n\nAnother major concern for the citizens has become the parties capacity to retain the peace and stability across the Strait, with the majority of people preferring the status quo over unification or independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/course/news.php?Sn=167#|title=\u516c\u544a\uff1a\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u7d71\u7368\u7acb\u5834\u8da8\u52e2\u5206\u4f48(1994\u5e7412\u6708~2017\u5e7406\u6708) - \u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78 \u9078\u8209\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3|website=esc.nccu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> This has discouraged politicians from pursuing outright unification or independence, but rather moderate their stance towards maintain status quo.

The rise of a [[Taiwan independence movement|pan-Taiwanese independence movement]] with mainly of younger members, that does not acknowledge that existence of the 1992 consensus and hence claims that Taiwan is already independent, has challenged the status quo and called for greater ROC sovereignty in multilateral politics and economics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/11/taiwan-independence-china-republic-huadu-taidu/|title='Taiwan Independence' Doesn't Mean What You Think|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> As a result, the return of the KMT into power will likely be predicated on a more careful maintenance of pragmatic diplomacy which foreseeably involves drawing Taiwan closer to the PROC through a variety of methods, such as sharing social spaces in international institutions, making diplomatic visits, signing economic deals. In each case, the KMT must promise to keep a safe distance in order to reflect the beliefs of a vigilant populace. To further exacerbating this tension, the KMT has also suffered from undemocratic perceptions, after its evasion of a clause by clause review of the [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement]], which prompted the [[Sunflower Student Movement]] to damage the party's credibility. In the future, the KMT must improve transparency to rebuild trust between it and the Taiwanese populace.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/the-sunflower-movement-and-the-2016-taiwan-presidential-elections/|title=The 'Sunflower Movement' and the 2016 Taiwan presidential elections|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Deteriorating Relationship with the PRC ===\nIn recent years, the KMT has been gradually falling out of China's favor. Following the [[2016 Taiwan general election|KMT election loss of 2016]], the KMT began to shift its pro-China policy towards the median to better represent the view of the electorate. In short, they began campaigning under the ideal of [[multiculturalism]], which included both \u201cChinese\u201d and \u201cTaiwanese\u201d citizens. However, this change in the party line was criticized by China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccpwatch.org/single-post/2017/10/16/Dwindling-Confidence-Is-the-CCPs-View-of-the-KMT-Changing|title=Party Watch Initiative|website=Party Watch Initiative|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> Beijing's preoccupation with the process of \u201clocalization\u201d stems from concerns over the ROC's move towards \u201cDe-Sinification\u201d which would weaken the PRC's claim that people on both sides of the strait share common bond and heritage. Moreover, China views current DPP president [[Tsai Ing-wen]] as a dangerous player who threatens the 1992 Consensus, blaming the KMT for mismanagement of domestic and international policy which led to their 2016 election loss. In the future, the KMT must also struggle to balance the preferences of the overall electorate while also treading a thin line with Mainland China.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Elections in Taiwan]]\n* [[Kuomintang]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]] \n* [[Politics of the Republic of China|Politics of Taiwan]]\n* [[List of political parties in the Republic of China|List of political parties in Taiwan]]\n* [[Conservatism in South Korea]]\n* [[Conservatism in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Liberalism in Taiwan]]\n* [[KMT retreat to Taiwan in 1949]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Conservatism in Taiwan| ]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Republic of China]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Political ideologies focused on the One-China policy}}\n{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = February 2019}}\n{{unfocused|date=June 2018}}\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->'''Conservatism in Taiwan''' is a broad political philosophy which espouses the [[One-China policy]] as a vital com<nowiki/>ponent for the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (ROC)]]'s international security and economic development, as opposed to [[Taiwanization]] and Taiwanese sovereignty. Fundamental conservative ideas are grounded in [[Confucianism|Confucian values]] and  strands of Chinese philosophy associated with [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s teachings, a large centralized government which intervenes closely in the lives of individuals on both social and economic levels, and the construction of unified [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric national identity]]. Conservative ideology in Taiwan constitutes the character and policies of the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]] party and that of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]].\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Overview: Three spheres of Conservative Policy ==\n\n=== Cross-Strait Policy ===\nThe relationship between the Republic of China (ROC) and the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] is Taiwan's main concern in foreign affairs. In a broad sense, the conservative Cross-Strait stance adheres to the notion of One-China, represented by the Kuomintang (KMT). However, the integration of this [[One-China|One-China philosophy]] into the party line has changed considerably. By the end of [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chiang Kai-shek\u2019]]<nowiki/>s presidency, the agenda of radical pro-unification via military force has slowly devolved into the desire for peaceful and strategic, albeit competitive coexistence rather than outright contention. Over time, the latter strategy has consolidated into the [[One China principle|One-China principle]] as a result of the [[1992 Consensus]], which proposed a unified entity comprising both Taiwan and the Mainland, while leaving the issue of representation open to interpretation. From a comparative standpoint, conservatives derive economic and security benefits from communication with the PRC, while warning against Taiwan's isolation and insecurity implied under [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese sovereignty.]] For Taiwan's political conservatives, the status quo is less than optimal, but at least better than independence from the PROC.\n\n=== Domestic Policy ===\nConservative domestic policy in Taiwan reflects a strong government at the center of policy and decision-making, in which the state takes initiative for individuals and closely intervenes in their daily lives. This runs counter to [[Western conservatism|Western political conservatism]], which supports a [[small government]] that operates on the perimeter of social life in order to respect the liberty of citizens. As such, conservative KMT policies may also be characterized by a focus on maintaining the traditions and doctrine of Confucian thought, namely reinforcing the morals of paternalism and patriarchy in Taiwan's society. Moreover, conservatism focuses on preserving the safety of the status quo under the [[One China principle|One-China principle]], which embodies the traditional political thought of the KMT party, as opposed to the uncertainty of change under the opposition parties' associated pro-independence movement. On a broader level, political conservatism within Taiwan revolves around building and later, preserving a unified Chinese national identity based on [[Sinocentrism]]. Similar to the threat of multiculturalism which governs one primary concern for western conservatives  i.e. United States,  KMT policies are against the integration of [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aboriginal culture]] into the mainstream Chinese identity.\n\n=== Economic Policy ===\nIn terms of [[Economic policy|economic policies]], [[conservatism]] in [[Taiwan]] can be described as highly interventionist. The national economy is centrally planned for the purpose of development and little separation between state and society exists. That opposes the general notion of economic conservatism, where little to no [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] in the economic affairs is desired. This ideological difference stems from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] roots of Taiwanese conservatism. Following the notion of Confucian [[Paternalistic conservatism|paternalism]], where the father is the head of the family, conservatives see the state as the head of society. As such, the state has to ensure the well-being of the population by promoting development and interfering in the economic affairs. Examples of conservative policies include the 1949-1953 Land Reforms, the 1950-1968 Economic Reforms aimed at encouraging production for export, the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]] and the establishment of the [[Three Links|Three Direct Links]] with [[China]].\n\n== Origins and Philosophy  ==\n\n=== Socioreligious tradition of Confucianism ===\nThere are four basic elements of [[Confucianism]] which apply to conservatist governance. The [[Paternalism|Paternalistic State]] entails top-down decision making under the notion that the \u201cFather is the head of the house, and likewise, the state the head of society.\u201d Leaders possess, ''[[Jen (Confucianism)|jen]]'', a supreme virtue representing human qualities at their best which determines their right to rule. The idea of s''ocial order and harmony'' translates into the assumption of the benevolent state - ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren/humaneness]],'' with which civil society works together - ''shu/reciprocity,'' rather than oppose, monitor, and scrutinize.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Chun-chieh|last2=Wu|first2=Kung-ming|date=|title=Taiwan and the Confucius Aspiration: Towards the Twenty-first Century|url=http://huang.cc.ntu.edu.tw/pdf/CCB1306.pdf|journal=NTU Databases|volume=3|pages=72\u201386|via=ntu.edu.tw}}</ref> The [[Patriarchy|Notion of Patriarchy]] positions men as leaders, and women as passive. Confucius and [[Mencius]], in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues|''three obediences'']] depict obedience to the father and elder brothers when young, to the husband when married, and to the sons when widowed. Finally, c''ollectivity'' captures the absence of the tradition of celebrating the individual in contrast to the United States. Instead, hierarchy is respected because it reflects naturally ordained positions in society. Moreover, the fulfilment of individual duties in a given position is necessary for the function of society.\n\n=== Sun Yat-sen's Political Perspectives ===\nMany of the Kuomintang's policies were inspired by its founder [[Sun Yat-sen]]\u2019s vision, and his ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'': nationalism (\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u7fa9), democracy (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9) and people\u2019s livelihood (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9). These [[Three Principles of the People|three principles]] combine to make Taiwan a free, powerful, and prosperous nation, although they are selectively interpreted in a specific context which deviates from Sun Yat-sen's original intent. For example, during Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s rule and much of [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]\u2019s, the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian state]] overshadowed democracy by censoring the people\u2019s voice. However, most of his political ideas which were later adapted by his successors in governing Taiwan included equalization of land ownership, learning Chinese traditional morality through Confucian values, and the regulation of state capital by national corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6996|title=Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Political Philosophy - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=1965-04-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==  Chronology of Kuomintang governments   ==\n\n=== Chiang Kai-shek (1945\u20131975) ===\n{{Main|Chiang Kai-shek}}\n[[File:\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63\u8096\u50cf(\u4e0a\u8272).jpg|thumb|President Chiang Kai-shek]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nChiang Kai-shek`s retreat to Taiwan following the [[Chinese Civil War]], and the subsequent establishment of the ROC in December 1949, marked the beginning of the One-China party line.  In Taiwan, the KMT immediately insisted on its right to maintain the position of the legal representative of all of China. The \u201cgovernment in exile\u201d, a term the ROC under Chiang Kai-shek elected to call itself, remained a status recognized by the international community until October 1971, when Taiwan's seat in the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] was replaced by that of the PRC, and February 1972, which marked [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|Nixon's historical visit to Peking]] which ended in the shocking [[Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9|Shanghai Communique.]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Republic of China under Chiang Kai-Shek: Taiwan Today .|last=Lumley|first=F.A.|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the KMT sought to bide time and strength under US assistance and protection in order to retake the mainland. The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] prompted [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to order the Seventh Fleet to defend Taiwan against the possibility of invasion on June 27, 1950.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Taiwan under Chiang Kai Shek's Era: 1945-1976|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/Sinologie/repository/uePRDemokrUIdentTaiwanSeit1980/Cheng_TaiwanUnderChiangKai-shek_sEra1945-1976.pdf|journal=Asian Profile|volume= 16| issue =  4|pages=299\u2013315|via=}}</ref> Although the US overall goal was not to aid Chiang's return to the mainland, but to build Taiwan into a fortress against communism, it allowed Chiang to pursue his military vision of reunification.\n\nAs a staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], Chiang pushed his doctrine of pro-reunification under the ideology of liberating the mainland from the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] using force. Hence, the army of civilians, legal specialists, troops, and other skilled workers that came with him viewed Taiwan as a temporary base for building industrial and military strength towards the level necessary to retake the mainland. In August 1955, and later in 1958, Chiang demonstrated his commitment for settling KMT-[[Communist Party of China|Communist Party of China (CCP)]] representative rivalry with military force by instigating conflict along the Tachen, Kinmen and Matsu islands in the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jinghua|date=November 2011|title=Taiwan's Role in the Breakout of the Taiwan Strait Crises: A Historical Perspective|url=http://isdp.eu/content/uploads/publications/2011_lu_taiwans-role-in-the-breakout.pdf|journal=Institute for Security and Development Policy|volume=|pages=6\u201315|via=}}</ref> The PROC began shelling the islands in response to Chiang's deployment of approximately 60,000 armed troops into the area, which prompted the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. In the 1960s smaller skirmishes were accompanied by unconventional strategies aimed at the liberation of China. Chiang Kai-shek deployed planes which dropped leaflets and sent the air force on reconnaissance and espionage missions i.e. blowing up bridges and infrastructure in the mainland. Nevertheless, the 1970s was marked by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], signaling Taiwan's decline in the international community, and with it, the desire to recapture the mainland was replaced by the necessity to survive under the new unstable status quo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/TaiwansFailureattheUN_JPPanda_240908|title=Taiwan's Failure at the UN {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nThe KMT's [[One-China policy]] also influenced its governing policy in Taiwan. Dealing with the island's weakening economy after a long period of prosperity under the Japanese, as well as the residents\u2019 dissatisfaction of KMT's administration, Chiang Kai-shek decided on consolidating his dominance through an authoritarian political system to stabilize Taiwan's internal affairs, opening path for reunification with Mainland.\n\nStructure-wise, the government of Chiang imposed on Taiwan was of little difference than the [[Government of the Republic of China|previous form used to administer Mainland China]].

Their goal was to change the Japanese colonial laid rental system which promoted unfair distribution of land and contributed to the gap between rich and poor. The reforms aimed at making all farmers the owners of their own fields.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,23,45,10&post=15716|title=Land-to-the-tiller program transformed Taiwan - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2009-08-28|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The reforms consisted of three stages. First, compulsory reduction of land rent, which limited farm rents to a maximum of 37,5 percent of the annual yield of the main crops. The second stage - sale of public land, that was previously owned and confiscated from Japanese colonists, to actual tenants at a price significantly below market value. The final third stage - the \u201cLand-to-the-Tiller Act\u201d, under which land owned by landlords in excess of 2,9 hectares was compulsorily sold to the government, which in turn resold it to tenants.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Samuel P.S.|date=1987|title=Economics, Economic Bureaucracy, and Taiwan's Economic Development|jstor=2758133|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=60|issue=2|pages=226\u2013247|doi=10.2307/2758133}}</ref> These reforms touched a vast majority of the Taiwanese agricultural population, with 70% of tenant households having their rents reduced in the first stage. The second and third stages also contributed to reducing the land farmed by tenants from 44% in 1949 to 17% in 1953.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1582258/land-reform-in-taiwan|title=Land Reform in Taiwan by Chen Cheng, 1961 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\nEconomically, the reforms were important as with the change of ownership, the incentive framework of the cultivator was transformed - promoting an increase of work efforts, production, investment and adoption of new technologies. This rising productivity was necessary for the subsequent transfer of resources - labor and capital, to other sectors of the economy.<ref name=\":0\" /> The reforms also brought an impact to the income distribution, improving the incomes of tenants and new owners. It is argued that such policy of distribution first, and growth later also contributed to the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] growth pattern of the country.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Chiang Ching-kuo (1975\u20131988) ===\n{{Main|Chiang Ching-kuo}}\n[[File:ChiangChingkuo photo.jpg|thumb|255x255px|President Chiang Ching-kuo]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nTaiwan under KMT president Chiang Ching-kuo embodied a move towards more flexible Cross-Strait relationship in an era of official diplomatic isolation, launched by the [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|US recognition of the PRC]] on January 1, 1979.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-announces-that-it-will-recognize-communist-china|title=United States announces that it will recognize communist China - Dec 15, 1978 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>  While Chiang Kai-shek's original One-China philosophy maintained Taiwan as its sole legitimate representative, a stance at the time recognized by the international community, his son, confronted by Taiwan's declining international status and the rise of China's power and relevance, could no longer maintain the same hard stance and openly hostile policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,23,45,10&post=14527|title=Book explores Taiwan's 'pragmatic' approach to foreign policy-making - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2007-07-06|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> Thus, the KMT under Kuo shifted its interpretation of One-China  to the notion of representative rivalry within its current [[Cross-Strait relations]], which expresses Taiwan's necessity to negotiate for its relevance and its concessions made in other foreign arenas in light of the CPP's competing claim of representation.\n\nUnder the One-China line, Chiang Ching-kuo negotiated for its own security in order to compete with the PRC's growing power. As such, he filled the void of formal diplomatic ties to other countries with unofficial ties, sharing the modern paradigm of [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|Taiwan's foreign relations.]] Chiang Ching-kuo's responded bitterly to the severing of official relations in 1979 and the termination of the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty|Mutual Defense Treaty]], causing him to reiterate his five principles with regard to ROC-US relations under the banner of \u201creality, continuity, security, legality, and governmentality.\" As a result, the United States Congress pushed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] on Oct. 10 the same year. The act was an unofficial brokerage which allowed the US to deal with external threats to Taiwan and to sell arms for the purpose of defense building.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yeh|first=Chung-lu|date=April 2014|title=Policy Brief III: Taiwan Relations Act: Time For A Change?|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/TRAPolicyBrief.Lu__0.pdf|journal=Policy Brief Series: Wilson Center|volume=Three|pages=2\u20138|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the \u201c[[Three Noes]]\u201d: no contact, no compromise, no negotiation, with the PROC was adopted in response to the ROC's \u201cThree Links\u201d and maintained by president Kuo.

Due to China's complaints regarding the term Chinese Taiwan, and the registering of athletes as Chinese athletes, Taiwan adopted \"Chinese Taipei\"  - a term that silently endorsed the One-China principle, and resembled a compromise of representation to which both parties were satisfied.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/the-curious-case-of-taiwan-and-chinese-taipei/1128282|title=The curious case of Taiwan and Chinese Taipei|work=outlookindia.com/|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> This was a pragmatic move toward regaining international space for the ROC, one which embodied a move toward reunification.\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nIn light of growing domestic pro-democracy sentiment, abandonment by the international community - starting from the United States\u2019 decision to not recognize the ROC diplomatically, and China's rising power and international status, Chiang Ching-kuo initiated various strategic, limited democratic concessions in order to consolidate KMT authority against internal and external pressures. Doing so would allow the KMT to strategically continue as a strong state under the semblance of democracy, while also enabling the ROC securely allocate attention abroad in negotiating its One-China policy. Ultimately, human rights issues still remained a major controversy in this era, given that Chiang Ching-kuo kept the main policies of his father's reign alive. However, the [[Martial law in Taiwan|Martial Law]], the product of his father's security concerns of a communist rebellion was eventually lifted in 1987.\n\nChiang Ching-kuo's gradual switch from ethnic Chinese conservatism to Taiwanese conservatism began with reshuffling the cabinet to include more ethnically Taiwanese members, albeit on a small scale.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Taiwan: A New History|last=Rubinstein|first=Murray A.|publisher=M.E.

While Chiang Ching-kuo began slowly relaxing restraints on political opposition, \u201cTang-wai\u201d was already earning large support from local elections in the end of the 1970s; much to the extent that after [[Kaohsiung Incident]] in 1979, the KMT initiated stricter surveillance, and capture, of opposition members.<ref name=\":6\" /> As political activism in the 1980s attracted more and more Taiwanese, the KMT government started carrying out open policies to encourage participation of the remaining population, such as including new  talents and religious people.<ref name=\":6\" /> A prominent example would be Chiang's decision to pick [[Lee Teng-hui]], an original Taiwanese, to be the country's vice-president in 1982.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite thesis |last=Hansson |first=Ulf |date=2007 |title=Chiang Ching-Kuo A Motive Analysis |type=Bachelor |publisher=Lund University |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1319621}}</ref> In, 1986, Chiang Ching-kuo did the unthinkable: he flouted the KMT by allowing the illegal formation of the [[Democratic Progressive Party|Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)]]. These policies demonstrate that Chiang Ching-kuo sought to gain international support in order to strengthen his regime, by taking the moral high ground of democratic legitimacy against the rising threat of China. In doing so, he also sought to appease the United States for finance and security reasons.\n\nAnother element of Chiang Ching-kuo's era represented the continued exclusion of [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal people of Taiwan]] for fear of polluting Sinocentric national identity. Although the DPP was formed, it was never based on the intention of restoring rights of Aboriginals, but rather as a front to dissipate anger and satisfaction. Furthermore, there were no policies set in motion to return land stolen under Chiang Kai-shek, lift the ban addressing Aboriginal languages, or provide education in schools to continue Aboriginal culture. Only after democratic consolidation occurred after Chiang Ching-kuo, were aboriginal rights restored. In tandem with maintaining a strict Sino-centric identity, as Chiang Ching-kuo and his men were attempting to introduce a new brand of conservatism to the party structure, on the nationwide scale the government was still labeled authoritarian conservative.\n\n==== Economic Policy ====\nThe 1970s was period of rapid economic development for the Taiwanese economy. The government realized that the existing infrastructure was reaching its maximum capacity and was no longer able to accommodate the economy's needs. Chiang Ching-kuo became the driving force behind the proposal of the first post war large-scale infrastructure construction, namely the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]]. They included six projects covering highway, rail, sea and air transportation infrastructure, and others - shipbuilding, oil refining, steel manufacturing and nuclear power generation. The work on the projects started in the early 1970s while Chiang was still a Premier and most of the projects were completed by the end of the decade.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=13964|title=Building the Economy of the Future - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2011-06-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The construction significantly contributed to mitigating the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, such as spiking unemployment resulting from factory closures.

Thus, his contributions to Conservatism must be carefully limited to the economy sphere. Indeed, throughout his presidency, Lee rejected the \u201c1992\u201d Consensus\" under the claim that China's characterization of Taiwan as a \"renegade province\u201d embodied a straw man argument. Instead, he considered Taiwan as having always remained historically independent, under the observation of the [[Treaty of San Francisco|San-Francisco Treaty.]] Such a radical stance worried China to the extent in which military sanctions were used, prompting the outbreak of the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]].\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nDue to being regarded as the pioneer of the liberalization ofTaiwanese politics, many internal policies under Lee's presidency did not follow the conservative political line traditional to KMT. During his rule, he actively promoted democracy by removing permanent members of the Legislative Yuan - namely the Mainlanders in power since 1949, as well as holding free elections afterwards to include more Taiwanese members. He emphasized his ethnically Taiwanese identity in his rule, crafting a stronger sense of [[Taiwanization|Taiwanese nationalism]] following his predecessor Chiang Ching-kuo's steps.\n\n==== Economic Policy ====\nDuring the 1990s the Taiwanese government actively pursued monitoring and control over the cross-strait investments. Various regulations were implemented, such as requiring all firms that were investing in the mainland to report the amount and the nature of their investments. If they failed to do so, variety of punishments were awaiting - including denying permissions to travel, cutting off credits and exchange operations, denying future investment applications.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|jstor=10.7249/mg507osd.11|title=Chinese Economic Coercion Against Taiwan|journal=Chinese Economic Coercion Against Taiwan|date=2007|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833039699|editor-last=Tanner|editor-first=Murray Scot|edition=1|series=A Tricky Weapon to Use|pages=33\u201372|last1=Tanner|first1=Murray Scot}}</ref> Regulations also prescribed that new investments over 1 million USD would require advance approval, further strengthening the government's ability to oversee the mainland related economic activities.\n\nThis period was also marked by a major shift in the Taiwanese investments - from-small scale manufacturing and mostly labor-intensive industries, such as apparel, footwear, food processing, to higher technology production and infrastructure projects. As a result, the value of investments increased greatly, bringing up the government's fears of Taiwan's growing reliance on the mainland. In response, President [[Lee Teng-hui]] asserted that the country's excessive dependence upon overseas investment, particularly in the PRC, was diverting capital and attention from revitalizing the domestic economy, and the government might have to put a lid on it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher Matthew|first=Eyton Laurence|date=August 1996|title=A Sharp Change of Course: President Lee and Big Business Spar Over China|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> One of the new strategies to diversify Taiwanese investments in other less hostile markets, was the \u201cGo South\u201d policy that encouraged outsourcing production in [[Southeast Asia]]. This policy however didn\u2019t produce the needed results and reduce the investments to the mainland.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSeeing the weaknesses of the \u201cGo South\u201d strategy, the government took another approach introducing the \u201cNo Haste, Be Patient\u201d policy. It required case-by-case approvals of Taiwanese investments in high-technology and infrastructure in the mainland. Also, it imposed limits on investments in the [[China|PRC]] - with a maximum investment level of 20 to 40 percent of a firm's total net worth and a ceiling of 50 million USD on individual investments.<ref name=\":2\" /> A following regulation also banned Taiwanese investment in most large-scale infrastructure and energy projects. It was argued that the policy's objective was not to stop entirely the movement towards the mainland, but to slow and manage the outflow of high-tech firms and give them the opportunity to develop at home. Lee also claimed that as long as Beijing was being hostile towards Taiwan, such unrestrained investments and excessive reliance on the mainland would undermine the national security.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLee's policies were met with strong opposition - both from the business levels and the general electorate, which supported closer economic ties with the mainland, in spite of concerns over security threats and pressure from Beijing.\n\n=== Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016) ===\n{{Main|Ma Ying-jeou}}\n[[File:Ma Ying-jeou official cropped.jpg|thumb|287x287px|President Ma Ying-jeou]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nUnder the presidency of [[Ma Ying-jeou]], the 1992 consensus carried on, allowing Taiwan to silently maintain its representation of One-China. In the context of this stalemate, Ma then turned towards bolstering Taiwan's security and international position by implementing flexible diplomacy. As such, Ma's main vision was to slowly restore the ''[[modus vivendi]]'' in regard to the growing power and influence of the ROC by scaling down the hostile relationship which had greatly escalated during Lee Teng-hui's and [[Chen Shui-bian]]\u2019s presidencies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/03/16/former-taiwan-president-ma-on-one-china-the-1992-consensus-and-taiwans-future/|title=Former Taiwan president Ma on One China, the 1992 consensus, and Taiwan's future|last=Whelan-Wuest|first=Maeve|date=2017-03-16|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}</ref> According to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] during Ma\u2019s presidency, the consensus represented the ROC\u2019s principles of \u201cdignity, autonomy, pragmatism, and flexibility\u201d in foreign affairs.

Following the growing desires and the increasing pressure from the business community, a few weeks after Ma's inauguration he initiated talks between Taiwan and the mainland regarding the issue of the [[Three Links|Three Direct Links]]. These are the three main paths of communication between Taiwan and PRC - via mail, transportation and commerce, which were banned between the two sides for almost six decades. The absence of the three links has been a huge barrier for Taiwanese businesses, increasing shipment costs and obstructing access to a potentially large market, low labor costs and talent pool in the mainland. It also prevented investment and development of multinational companies back in Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eai.nus.edu.sg/publications/files/BB415.pdf|title=The Economics of Taiwan's Three Direct Links with Mainland China|last=Chen|first=Chien-Hsun|date=27 November 2008|website=National University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\nFinally, on November 4, 2008 the two sides signed series of agreements regarding each link and Three Direct Links were established.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/china/09063001.html|title=China in Transition\u300cImproved Cross-Straits Relations under the Ma Ying-jeou Administration - A path to peaceful reunification -\u300d|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}</ref> The successful talks mark a historic moment signifying that cross-Strait relations have moved past hostility towards negotiation and cooperation. The opposition has been sceptical, repeatedly claiming that while such move might be economically beneficial for Taiwan, it is compromising the national security with Taiwanese airports being open to PRC aircraft. In reality however, because of this development, cross-strait relations have increasingly become oriented towards rapprochement rather than confrontation.\n\nAnother economic policy of Ma's government is the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]]. Signed in 2010, the Agreement aims to reduce tariffs and commercial barriers between the two-sides, with the hope for much-needed boost to Taiwan's economy. Yet, it was not received well by the public, giving start of protests and a fierce public debate over the effects of the agreement. Opponents have expressed concerns for the future of  the local economy, as Taiwanese workers and small businesses would have to compete with  increasing imports of cheaper Chinese goods. At the heart of the protests however, has been the fear that the ECFA might be led to reunification with Beijing, which sees the island as a Chinese province.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/27/world/la-fg-taiwan-protests-20100627|title=Taiwan trade pact with China fires up protesters|last=Sui|first=Cindy|date=2010-06-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The President has asserted that the deal is about economics, not politics, and has affirmed his confidence over Taiwanese democracy and its ability to fend off undue pressure from the PRC.\n\n== Conservatives in Taiwan ==\n\n=== Political Parties ===\n{{Main|Pan-Blue Coalition}}\nThe Conservative parties in Taiwan or the so-called \u201c[[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]]\u201d includes the Kuomintang (KMT), the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party (PFP)]] and the [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party (NP)]].\n\nKuomintang is the main conservative party and currently it is the largest opposition party in the Legislative Yuan with 35 seats.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/01/17/2003637386|title=ELECTIONS: DPP secures absolute majority in Legislative Yuan - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\nPeople's First Party is a liberal conservative party, founded by former KMT General Secretary and Taiwan Provincial Governor [[James Soong]] after the 2000 presidential elections. It is the main contender with the KMT for the conservative votes. Currently, it holds 3 seats in the Legislative Yuan.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]] was also established as a split from the KMT in 1993, after growing dissatisfaction with President Lee's policies of distancing the party from unification with the mainland. The NP has been a vanishing force in the political landscape, not having won any seats in the Legislative Yuan since the 2008 elections.\n\n=== Supporter Base ===\nInitially, the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]] and the [[Pan-Green Coalition|pan-green camp]] reflected the ideological differences within society over national identity. Those ideological differences were manifested through the different stances on cross-strait policy - with the blue-camp being pro-unification and the green-camp - pro-independence. Therefore, determining party affiliation was based on ethnicity and the attitude towards the relationship with the mainland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jamestown.org/program/taiwans-election-results-reflect-shift-in-attitudes/|title=Taiwan's Election Results Reflect Shift in Attitudes - Jamestown|work=Jamestown|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}</ref> As a result, the pan-blue camp supporter base traditionally consisted of people mainly having Chinese identities and pro-unification attitudes.\n\nRecently however, it has been observed that the alignment with a party has grown beyond these traditional dichotomies. This has been influenced by the growth of a distinct Taiwanese identity, rooted not in ethno-cultural aspect, but in the historical, economic and political development of the island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/course/news.php?Sn=166#|title=\u516c\u544a\uff1a\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u81fa\u7063\u4eba/\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\u8a8d\u540c\u8da8\u52e2\u5206\u4f48(1992\u5e7406\u6708~2017\u5e7406\u6708\uff09 - \u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78 \u9078\u8209\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3|website=esc.nccu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The change has affected people's preferences, with a growing concern over each party's capability and will to maintain what is being considered Taiwanese identity. As a result of this tendency and in attempt to appeal to the growing group of people who identify as Taiwanese, the KMT has lost its idealistic pan-Chinese passion. To avoid marginalization, it has focused rather on practical steps of Sino-Taiwanese cooperation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Gunter|date=2004|title=Taiwan's Political Parties and National Identity: The Rise of an Overarching Consensus|jstor=10.1525/as.2004.44.4.534|journal=Asian Survey|volume=44|issue=4|pages=534\u2013554|doi=10.1525/as.2004.44.4.534}}</ref>\n\nAnother major concern for the citizens has become the parties capacity to retain the peace and stability across the Strait, with the majority of people preferring the status quo over unification or independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/course/news.php?Sn=167#|title=\u516c\u544a\uff1a\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u7d71\u7368\u7acb\u5834\u8da8\u52e2\u5206\u4f48(1994\u5e7412\u6708~2017\u5e7406\u6708) - \u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78 \u9078\u8209\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3|website=esc.nccu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> This has discouraged politicians from pursuing outright unification or independence, but rather moderate their stance towards maintain status quo. In the 2008 presidential campaign for example, KMT used status quo as a campaign tactics, eventually leading to its candidate Ma Ying-jeou being elected. However, in 2016 elections, the failure to do so, combined with [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] utilizing the same \u201cstatus quo strategy\u201d cost the KMT the presidency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-centrality-of-maintaining-the-status-quo-in-taiwan-elections/|title=The centrality of maintaining the status quo in Taiwan elections|last=Yu|first=Ching-hsin|date=2017-03-15|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, from those two tendencies - the growing Taiwanese identity and the steady preference over the maintaining the status quo with the mainland, the characteristics of the supporter base of the conservatives have become less clear cut than before.\n\n== Current Status ==\n\n=== Party Instability and Regaining Trust ===\nDomestically, conservatism within the KMT treads a thin line. The rise of a [[Taiwan independence movement|pan-Taiwanese independence movement]] with mainly of younger members, that does not acknowledge that existence of the 1992 consensus and hence claims that Taiwan is already independent, has challenged the status quo and called for greater ROC sovereignty in multilateral politics and economics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/11/taiwan-independence-china-republic-huadu-taidu/|title='Taiwan Independence' Doesn't Mean What You Think|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> As a result, the return of the KMT into power will likely be predicated on a more careful maintenance of pragmatic diplomacy which foreseeably involves drawing Taiwan closer to the PROC through a variety of methods, such as sharing social spaces in international institutions, making diplomatic visits, signing economic deals. In each case, the KMT must promise to keep a safe distance in order to reflect the beliefs of a vigilant populace. To further exacerbating this tension, the KMT has also suffered from undemocratic perceptions, after its evasion of a clause by clause review of the [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement]], which prompted the [[Sunflower Student Movement]] to damage the party's credibility. In the future, the KMT must improve transparency to rebuild trust between it and the Taiwanese populace.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/the-sunflower-movement-and-the-2016-taiwan-presidential-elections/|title=The 'Sunflower Movement' and the 2016 Taiwan presidential elections|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Deteriorating Relationship with the PRC ===\nIn recent years, the KMT has been gradually falling out of China's favor. Following the [[2016 Taiwan general election|KMT election loss of 2016]], the KMT began to shift its pro-China policy towards the median to better represent the view of the electorate. In short, they began campaigning under the ideal of [[multiculturalism]], which included both \u201cChinese\u201d and \u201cTaiwanese\u201d citizens. However, this change in the party line was criticized by China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccpwatch.org/single-post/2017/10/16/Dwindling-Confidence-Is-the-CCPs-View-of-the-KMT-Changing|title=Party Watch Initiative|website=Party Watch Initiative|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> Beijing's preoccupation with the process of \u201clocalization\u201d stems from concerns over the ROC's move towards \u201cDe-Sinification\u201d which would weaken the PRC's claim that people on both sides of the strait share common bond and heritage. Moreover, China views current DPP president [[Tsai Ing-wen]] as a dangerous player who threatens the 1992 Consensus, blaming the KMT for mismanagement of domestic and international policy which led to their 2016 election loss. In the future, the KMT must also struggle to balance the preferences of the overall electorate while also treading a thin line with Mainland China.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Elections in Taiwan]]\n* [[Kuomintang]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]] \n* [[Politics of the Republic of China|Politics of Taiwan]]\n* [[List of political parties in the Republic of China|List of political parties in Taiwan]]\n* [[Conservatism in South Korea]]\n* [[Conservatism in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Liberalism in Taiwan]]\n* [[KMT retreat to Taiwan in 1949]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Conservatism in Taiwan| ]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Republic of China]]\n", "name_user": "Lakun.patra", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: didn\u2019t \u2192 didn't,  1 million USD \u2192  US$1 million (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_Taiwan"}

The last Batak king who fought valiantly against Dutch imperialists until 1905 was an Indonesian Shaivite king. The Batak may be mentioned in [[Zhao Rugua]]'s 13th-century ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi|Description of the Barbarous Peoples]]'' (''Zhu Fan Zhi'' {{lang|zh|\u8af8\u8543\u5fd7}}), which refers to a 'Ba-ta' dependency of [[Srivijaya]]. The ''[[Suma Oriental]]'', of the 15th century, also refers to the kingdom of Bata, bounded by [[Pasai]] and the [[Sultanate of Deli|Aru kingdom]].\n\nBased on this evidence, the Batak may have been involved in procuring important commodities for trade with [[China]], perhaps from the 8th or 9th centuries and continuing for the next thousand years, with Batak men carrying the products on their backs for sale at ports.\n\nIt has been suggested that the important port of [[Barus]] in [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] was populated by Batak people.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Malay Frontier: Unity and Duality in a Sumatran Kingdom |last=Drakard |first=Jane |publisher=SEAP Publications |year=1990 |isbn=08-772-7706-0}}</ref> A [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription has been found in Barus which is dated to 1088, while contact with Chinese and Tamil traders took place at [[Kota Cina]], a trading town located in what is now northern [[Medan]] that was established in the 11th century, and comprising 10,000 people by the 12th century. Tamil remains have been found on key trade routes to the Batak lands.\n\nThese trading opportunities may have caused migration of Batak from Pakpak and Toba to the present-day Karo and Simalungun 'frontier' lands, where they were exposed to greater influence from visiting Tamil traders, while the migration of Batak to the Angkola-Mandailing lands may have been prompted by 8th-century Srivijayan demand for [[camphor]].\n\nThe [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo ''marga'' or tribe]] ''Sembiring'' \"black one\" is believed to originate from their ties with Tamil traders, with specific Sembiring sub-marga, namely Brahmana, Colia, Pandia, Depari, Meliala, Muham, Pelawi, and Tekan all of Indian origin. Tamil influence on Karo religious practices are also noted, with the pekualuh secondary cremation ritual being specific to the Karo and Dairi people. Moreover the Pustaka Kembaren, an origin story of the Sembiring Kembaren suggests linkages with [[Pagarruyung]] in [[Minangkabau Highlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Mengenal suku Karo |last=Bangun |first=Roberto |date=2006 |publisher=Yayasan Pendidikan Bangun}}</ref> \n\nFrom the 16th century onward, [[Aceh]] increased the production of [[Black pepper|pepper]], an important export commodity, in exchange for rice, which grew well in the Batak wetlands. Batak people in different areas cultivated either ''sawah'' (wet rice fields) or ''ladang'' (dry rice), and the Toba Batak, most expert in agriculture, must have migrated to meet demand in new areas. The increasing importance of rice had religious significance, which increased the power of the Batak high priests, who had responsibility for ensuring agricultural success.\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Image from page 129 of \"Handbook to the ethnographical collections\" (1910) (14783317945).jpg|thumb|right|Bark book with charms written in native [[Batak script]], 1910.]]\n{{main|Batak languages}}\n{{see also|Batak script}}\nThe Batak speak a variety of closely related languages, all members of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. There are two major branches, a northern branch comprising the [[Batak Dairi language|Pakpak-Dairi]], [[Batak Alas-Kluet language|Alas-Kluet]] and [[Batak Karo language|Karo]] languages, which are similar to each other, and a distinct southern branch, comprising three mutually intelligible dialects: [[Batak Toba language|Toba]], [[Batak Angkola language|Angkola]] and [[Batak Mandailing language|Mandailing]]. [[Batak Simalungun language|Simalungun]] is an early offspring of the southern branch. Some Simalungun dialects can be understood by speakers of Batak Karo, whereas other dialects of Simalungun can be understood by speakers of Toba. This is due to the existence of a linguistic continuum that often blurs the lines between the Batak dialects. Batak dialect still influences the dialects in [[Medan]] city today.\n\nThe Batak possess their own script known as the [[Batak script|''Surat Batak'']].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0834803496 Kozok, Uli, \"Bark, Bones and Bamboo: Batak traditions of Sumatra,\" in ''Illuminations: The Writing Traditions of Indonesia,'' Ann Kumar and John McGlynn, eds., Lontar and Weatherhill, Jakarta (1237).]</ref> The writing has chiefly ceremonial importance within traditional religious ceremonies, and was subject to little change for this reason. It is likely that the Batak people originally received their writing system from southern Sumatra.\n\n==Profession==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Toba Batak prauw met houtsnijwerk op de voorsteven TMnr 60011149.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional boat (circa 1870), photograph by [[Kristen Feilberg]].]]\nThe traditional occupation of the Batak was [[agriculture]], hunting and farming. The great lake of [[Lake Toba|Toba]] provided vast opportunity for freshwater aquaculture since ancient times. Interior rural Batak communities relied heavily on rice farming, horticulture and other plant and commercial crops, and to some extent, acquiring forest products, such as hard wood, plant resin, and wild animals. \n\nThe port of [[Barus]] on the western coast of Batak lands has become famous as the source of ''kapur barus'' ([[camphor]]). In ancient times, Batak warriors were often recruited by neighboring Malay courts as mercenaries. In the colonial era, the Dutch introduced commercial cash crops, such as coffee, ''sawit'' [[palm oil]], and [[rubber]], converting some parts of the Batak land into plantations.\n\nThroughout the history of modern Indonesia, the Batak community has been a significant contributor. Batak people have filled a wide range of occupations, from running modest tire service workshops to serving as state ministers. The modern Batak have gravitated towards professions such as attorneys, bus and taxi drivers, mechanics, engineers, singers and musicians, writers and journalists, teachers, economists, scientists, and military officers.\n\nEven though the Batak are a minority among the Indonesian population (3.58 %; only 8-9 million Batak people out of 236 million according 2010's census), there have been a number of notable Batak that have risen to distinguished positions and careers. Especially in the field of law Bataks have been well represented.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/31491/batak-make-good-lawyers-is-it-true/ |title=Batak Make Good Lawyers, Is It True? |last=Tjahjono |first=Tenissa |date=31 October 2017 |website=Global Indonesian Voices}}</ref> Among others, lawyers like [[Ruhut Sitompul]] and [[Hotman Paris Hutapea]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/world/asia/24hotman.html |title=A Top Indonesian Lawyer May Be Honest to a Fault |last=Onishi |first=Norimitsu |date=24 April 2010 |website=The New York Times}}</ref> are widely known beyond the circle of their legal colleagues, since they have gained star lawyer reputations by handling high-profile cases closely reported by the media.

National heroes such as [[Sisingamangaraja XII]], two Indonesian prime ministers ([[Amir Sjarifuddin|Amir Syarifuddin Harahap]] and [[Burhanuddin Harahap]]), speakers of the parliament ([[Zainul Arifin|Zainul Arifin Pohan]]), one vice president ([[Adam Malik|Adam Malik Batubara]]), governor of the central bank ([[Darmin Nasution]]), one attorney general ([[Marsillam Simanjuntak]]), and many cabinet ministers (such as [[Malam Sambat Kaban|M.S.

Today the Batak are mostly Christian with a Muslim minority. Currently the largest Christian congregation in Indonesia is the [[HKBP]] (''Huria Kristen Batak Protestan'') Christian church. The dominant Christian [[theology]] was brought by [[Lutheran]] [[German people|German]] missionaries in the 19th century, including the well-known missionary [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]]. Christianity was introduced to the Karo by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Calvinist]] missionaries, and their largest church is the GBKP (''Gereja Batak Karo Protestan'').

His description parallels that of Marsden in some important respects, however von Kessel states that cannibalism was regarded by the Batak as a judicial act and its application was restricted to very narrowly defined infringements of the law including theft, [[adultery]], spying or treason. Salt, red pepper and lemons had to be provided by the relatives of the victim as a sign that they accepted the [[verdict]] of the community and were not thinking of [[revenge]].<ref>Von Kessel, O., \"Erinnerungen an Sumatra,\" ''Das Ausland,'' Stuttgart (1854) 27:905-08.</ref>\n\n[[Ida Laura Pfeiffer]] visited the Batak in August 1852 and although she did not observe any cannibalism, she was told that: \n:\"[[Prisoners of war]] are tied to a tree and beheaded at once; but the blood is carefully preserved for drinking, and sometimes made into a kind of pudding with boiled rice.

These contacts took place many centuries ago and it is impossible to reconstruct just how far the religious ideas of these foreigners were adopted and reworked by the Batak.

These were formerly passed down through oral tradition but have now been written down in the local languages. There are also large collections of Batak tales collected by European scholars since the mid-19th century and recorded in European languages, mostly Dutch.<ref>Much of this section is derived from Stohr, W. & Zoeta Jadider, P. (1965) \"Die Religionen Indonesiens.\" ''Die Religionen der Menschheit,'' vol. 5:1, Stuttgart.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld [[dragon]] ''Naga Padoha''. The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. All the surviving [[myths]] record that at the beginning of creation stands the god ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon''. His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the \"beginning of becoming\". The creation of everything that exists can be traced back to him. ''Mula Jadi'' lives in the upper world which is usually thought of as divided into seven levels. His three sons, ''Batara Guru'', ''Mangalabulan'' and ''Soripada'' were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by ''Mula Jadi''. Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to ''Mula Jadi'' in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. ''Mula Jadi'' begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of ''Mula Jadi'' there is another god, ''Asiasi'', whose place and function in the world of the gods remains largely unclear. There is some evidence that ''Asiasi'' can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods.\n\nThe ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon ''Naga Padoha''. He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of ''Mula Jadi''. As ruler of the underworld ''Naga Padoha'' also has an important function in the creation of the earth.\n\nWhat all the six gods so far mentioned have in common is that they play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive any sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of [[sacrifice]] are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.<ref>Leertouwer, L.\n(1977) ''Her beeld van de ziel bij drie Sumatraanse votken.'' Doctoral dissertation in Theology. Groningen, p. 177.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of ''Batara Guru'', ''Sideak Parujar'', who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband,\nthe lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world which at that time was still just a watery waste. She refuses to go back but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion ''Mula Jadi'' sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. ''Sideak Parudjar'' was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of ''Naga Padoha'', the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and threatened to be utterly destroyed. With the help of ''Mula Jadi'' and by her own cunning ''Sideak Parudjar'' was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of ''Naga Padoha'' up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever ''Naga Padoha'' twists in the fetters an earthquake occurs.\n\nAfter the lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, ''Sideak Parujar'' marries him. ''Sideak Parujar'' becomes the mother of twins of different sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their [[incestuous]] union.\nThe couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of [[Lake Toba]], and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, ''Si Raja Batak'' is one of their grandchildren.<ref>Sibeth, p. 65.</ref>\n\n===The ''tendi'' cult===\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Carved bone calendar and almanac.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A 20th century carved bone of a [[Porhalaan]] Batak calendar.]]\nIn the religious world of the Toba and Karo Batak the gods and the creation of mankind are far less significant than the complex concepts connected with the ''tendi'' (Karo) or ''tondi'' (Toba) and the ''begu''. Probably the most useful translations of these terms are \"life-soul\" and \"death-soul\". A person receives his \"life-soul\" (''tendi'') from ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon'' before he is born. The [[destiny]] of the individual ''tendi'' is decided by the ''tendi'' itself before birth. Various myths are woven around manner in which the ''tendi'' choose their destiny from ''Mula Jadi''. Warneck, a missionary and for a long time superintendent (''ephorus'') of the Batak Church, recorded two particularly expressive myths in his major work on Batak religion.<ref>Adapted from Warneck, J. (1977) ''Tcba-Batak: Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch.'' The Hague.</ref> What is significant is that the ''tendi'' themselves are responsible for their idiocy:\n\n:\"''Mula Jadi'' presents him with all kinds of things to choose from. If the ''tendi'' asks for ripe eggs, then the person whom he animates will be a poor fellow; if he asks for flowers, then he will live only a short time; if he asks for a hen, the person will be restless; rags indicate poverty; an old mat, lack of fame; a gold piece, wealth; plate, spear, medicine pot indicate that he will become a great chief or understand magic arts.\"\n\n:\"With ''Mula Jadi'' in the upper world is a mighty tree called ''Djambubarus''. ''Mula Jadi'' has written on all its leaves. On one leaf is written 'many children', on others 'wealth' or 'respect' and so on. 'Contemptible life', 'poverty', 'wretchedness' are also written on the leaves. All the possible different fates of the person are entered on the leaves. Every ''tendi'' that wishes to descend to the middle world must first ask ''Mula Jadi'' for one of the leaves. Whatever is written on the leaf chosen by him will be his destiny in the middle world.\"\n\nAmong the Karo and the Toba there are sometimes widely diverging versions of where the ''tendi'' dwells and how many ''tendi'' there are. According to the Toba a person has seven ''tendi''. The second ''tendi'' is found in the [[placenta]] and [[amniotic fluid]] of the new-born baby, and accordingly the afterbirth is given special attention after the birth of a child. It is usually buried under the house, is called ''saudara'' (brother) and is regarded as the person's guardian spirit. Similar ideas about the afterbirth are also found among the Karo, who also bury the placenta and amniotic fluid under the house and regard them as two guardian spirits (''kaka'' and ''agi'') who always remain close to the person.<ref>Westenberg CJ, (1982) ''Aanteekeningen omtrent de godsdienstige begrippen der Karo-Bataks.'' BK141:208-53</ref>\n\nAll Batak regard the loss of ''tendi'' as signifying a great danger for \"body and soul\". ''Tendi'' can be separated from their owners through inattentiveness, or as a result of black magic by a ''datu'' with evil intentions. In other words, the ''tendi'' is not tied to the body; it can also live for a time outside the body. The final loss of the ''tendi'' inevitably results in death. There are a variety of ideas about where exactly in the body the ''tendi'' dwells. It is present to a particularly high degree in certain parts of the body, especially the blood, the liver, the head and the heart. Sweat too is described as rich in ''tendi''. It is believed that illnesses are connected with the absence of ''tendi'', and the bringing back of the ''tendi'' is a main method of healing. The Karo, for instance, have gifts, called ''upah tendi'' (''upah'' = wage, payment, gift), which they give to their ''tendi'' so that their ''tendi'' stay with them. These gifts may consist of a knife, a gong, a particular piece of clothing, a water buffalo or a small holy place. The gifts are carefully cared for in order to keep the ''tendi'' satisfied.<ref>Kipp, RS,\n1974 \"Karo Batak Religion and Social Structure.\" ''Berita Kajian Sumatra''(Sumatra Research Bulletin), University of Hull 3,2:4-11.</ref>\n\n''Tendi'' love the sound of the ''surdam'' (a bamboo flute). If a ''tendi'' has abandoned the body of a patient, the playing of the ''surdam'' in the ''raleng tendi'' ritual can contribute to the ''tendi'' returning to the body of the sick person. It must be emphasized that only the ''datuk'' are in a position to interpret and influence people's ''tendi'' correctly. If their endeavors are unsuccessful, then clearly the ''tendi'' has chosen another destiny for itself.<ref>Sibeth, P. 87.</ref>\n\n===Death cult===\n[[File:Batak totem 09N9443.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Batak [[Totem pole]].]]\n\nAt death the ''tendi'' leaves the human body through the fontanelle and the \"death-soul\" (''begu'') is set free. It is thought that the ''tendi'' vanishes and after the death of any human being only the ''begu'' continues to exist. The Batak believe that the ''begu'' continue to live near their previous dwelling (in a village of the dead which is thought to be situated not far from the\ncemetery) and that they may contact their descendants. Bad dreams, particular misfortune and such like may be signs that the ''begu'' of an ancestor is not satisfied with the behavior of its descendants. Any individual can attempt to pacify an enraged ''begu'' by means of food and drink offerings and prayers. If this does not work, a ''datu'' or a ''guru'' must be called in.<ref>Kipp, 1974, p. 11.</ref> The ''begu'' are not immortal, since death also rules in the land of the dead: a ''begu'' dies seven times before it is changed into a straw and finally becomes earth.<ref>Sibeth, p. 69.</ref>\n\nThe Batak believe that three categories of ''begu'' exist.<ref>Westenberg, p. 221.</ref> The ''bicara guru'' are the ''begu'' of stillborn babies or of babies who have died before teething. It is possible to turn ''bicara guru'' into guardian spirits if misfortune has befallen the family of the child shortly after its death. With the help of a ''guru sibaso'', the ''bicara guru'' can be made the family's guardian spirit for which a shrine is provided and to which sacrifices are regularly made. Once a year the ''bicara guru'' is accorded a special feast, preceded by ritual hair washing.\n\nThe ''begu'' of members of the family who have had a sudden death (''mate sada-uari'') can also act as guardian spirits for the family. They include the victims of accidents, suicides, murder victims, or people struck by lightning. A shrine is built where they are venerated and where sacrifices are made. A third category consists of the ''begu'' of dead virgins (''tungkup''). Their graves, called ''bata-bata'' or ''ingan tungkup'', are maintained for a long time by their relatives.\n\n===Burial traditions===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een stenen sarcofaag in een Toba Batak dorp TMnr 60045329.jpg|thumb|left|A stone sarcophagus in a Toba Batak village.]]\n\nBatak [[burial]] traditions are very rich and complex. Immediately after death various ritual actions are performed to make the ''begu'' understand that from now on its world is separate from that of its kin. Symbolically this is done by reversing the mat on which the corpse is laid out so that the body lies with its head at the foot of the mat. Thumbs and toes respectively are tied together and the body is rubbed all over with [[camphor]] and its orifices stopped with [[camphor]], then it is wrapped in a white cotton cloth. During this ''perumah begu'' ceremony a ''guru sibaso'' declares to the ''begu'' of the deceased that it is definitely dead and must take leave of its relatives.\n\nWealthier families have their coffins (Karo: ''[[pelangkah]]'') made of the wood of the ''[[kemiri]]'' tree (''[[Aleurites moluccanus]]''), carved in the shape of a boat, its bow decorated with the carved head of a [[hornbill]], or a horse, or a [[mythical beast]] known as a [[Singa (mythology)|singa]]. The lid is then sealed with [[resin]] and the coffin may be placed in a special location near the family's house until a reburial ceremony can take place. Families that are not wealthy use simple wooden coffins or wrap the body in a straw mat.\n\nThe corpse is carried a few times round the house, usually by women, and then to the [[cemetery]] with musical accompaniment from the ''[[gondang]]'' orchestra and the continual firing of guns. At any crossroads the corpse is put down and eleven people go around it four times to confuse the ''begu''. It is hoped that the ''begu'' will then be unable to find its way back to the village. When the funeral procession arrives at the cemetery the grave is dug and the corpse laid in it, flat on its back. Care is taken that the head lies towards the village so that, in the unexpected event that the body should get up, he or she will not be looking in the direction of the village. The bodies of ''datuk'' and those who have died from lightning are buried sitting up with their hands tied together. The palms of the hand are tied together and [[betel]] placed between them.<ref>Kipp, 1974, p. 9</ref>\n\n===Reburial===\n[[File:Batak Tombs.JPG|right|thumb|Batak ''tugu'' on the island of [[Samosir]], Lake Toba, December 1984.]]\n\nThe burial tradition includes a reburial ceremony in which the bones of one's ancestors are reinterred several years after death. This secondary burial is known among the Toba Batak as ''mangongkal holi'', among the Karo as ''nurun-nurun''. In a ceremony lasting several days the bones of a particularly honored ancestor and those of his descendants are exhumed, cleaned, mourned and finally laid to rest again in a bone house known as a ''tugu'' or ''tambak'':\n:\"On the morning of the first day of the festival the graves in the cemetery are opened and the bones of the ancestors that are still there are removed. The unearthing of the skulls is presented as especially moving. The bones are collected in baskets lined with white cloth and then ritually cleaned by the women using the juice of various [[citrus]] fruits. The exhumation and cleaning of the bones is accompanied by the singing of laments. The bones are kept in the baskets in the ''tugu'' until the next morning, when the remains are wrapped in traditional cloths (''[[ulos]]'') and transferred from the baskets to small wooden coffins. After long speeches and a communal prayer the coffins are nailed down and placed in the chambers of the ''tugu''. A feast consisting of meat and rice follows and traditional dances are performed.<ref>Simon, A. (1982) \"Altreligiose und soziale Zeremonien der Batak.\" ''ZjE'' 107:177-206.</ref>\"\n\nIn ancient times these [[sarcophagi]] were carved from stone or constructed from wood and later brick. Nowadays they are made of cement or concrete. Large and very ornate ''tugu'' can be seen around Lake Toba and on the island of [[Samosir]].\n\nOne motive for the reburial ceremony appears to be to raise the status of the ''begu'' of the deceased. Traditional Batak beliefs hold that the dead occupy a hierarchical status similar to the social position they held in life. This means that a rich and powerful individual remains influential after death, and this status can be elevated if the family holds a reburial ceremony. A rich descendant can advance a ''begu'' to the status of a ''sumangot'' by means of a great ceremony and a ''horja'' feast which can last up to seven days. In antiquity a vast number of pigs, cattle or even buffalo were slaughtered at such festivals, and the ''gondang'' orchestra provided an accompaniment.\n\nThe next level up from the ''sumangot'' is the ''sombaon'', who are the spirits of important ancestors who lived ten to twelve generations ago. To raise a ''sumangot'' to a ''sombaon'' requires another great festival, a ''santi rea'', often lasting several months, during which the inhabitants of the whole district come together. These powerful ancestor spirits offer protection and good fortune to their descendants, but the ceremony also serves to establish new [[kinship]] groups descended from the ancestor thus honored.<ref>Stohr, p. 197.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Batak medicine===\n[[File:Mme Sitorus Dukun.jpg|thumb|left|Madame Sitorus, a well-known Toba ''guru sibaso'' who practiced in [[:id:Laguboti|Laguboti]] in 1984. She is consulting a paperback edition of the [[New Testament]] in lieu of a ''[[pustaha]]''. On the shelf are components of herbal remedies. In front of her is a [[kaffir lime]] in a bowl of water, a form of divination used to locate lost items or people.]]\n\nIn traditional Batak society ''datuk'' (animist priests) as well as ''[[gurus]]'' practiced [[traditional medicine]], although the former were exclusively male. Both professions were attributed with supernatural powers and the ability to predict the future. Treatments and healing rituals bear some resemblance to those practiced by [[dukun]]s in other parts of Indonesia. Following the Christianization of the Toba and Karo Batak in the late 19th century, missionaries discouraged traditional healing and divination and they became largely [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] activities.<ref>Sibeth, p. 98</ref>\n\nBoth ''datu'' and ''guru'' healers also practiced [[divination]] by consulting a ''[[pustaha]]'', a handwritten book made of wood and bark in which were inscribed recipes for healing remedies, incantations and songs, predictive calendars, and other notes on magic, healing and divination written in ''poda,'' an archaic [[Batak script|Batak shorthand]]. According to Winkler,<ref>J. Winkler, ''Die Toba-Batak auf Sumatra in gesunden und kranken Tagen,'' [The Toba Bataks of Sumatra in Sickness and in Health] (1925), pp. 79-224.</ref> there were three categories of ''[[Pustaha]]'' based on the purpose of their usage:\n:1. '''Protective Magic''', which includes diagnosis, therapy, medicinal mixes which have magical properties, such as [[amulets]], ''parmanisan'' (love charms), etc.\n:2. '''Destructive Magic''', which encompasses the art of making poison, the art of controlling or utilizing the power of certain spirits, calling the ''pangulubalang'', and the art of making ''dorma'' (magical formulas for causing a person to fall in love).\n:3. '''Divination''', which involves [[oracles]] (words of the gods), the wishes of the spirits, commands from the gods and from the spirits of the ancestors, and an [[almanac]] or calendrical system (''porhalaan''), and [[astrology]] to determine auspicious days and months to accomplish certain actions or goals.<ref name=\"V7177\">Voorma, pp. 71-77.</ref>\n\nThe ''datu'' or ''guru'' consulted the ''[[pustaha]]'' when presented with a difficult problem, and in time this became in itself a ritual. When missionaries began to discourage traditional healing and [[augury]] the [[Bible]] may have been adopted by some ''gurus'' in place of the ''[[pustaha]]''.<ref name=\"V7177\"/>\n\nAmong the most important healing ceremonies performed in Toba and Karo communities is that of recalling the ''jinujung,'' or personal guardian spirit. According to Toba and Karo [[cosmology]], each person receives a ''jinujung'' in childhood or at [[puberty]] and they keep it for life unless they are unfortunate enough to lose it, in which case they will fall ill. In order to call the ''jinujung'' back, a female ''guru'' (''guru sibaso'' in Karo) goes into a [[trance]] and  the ''jinujung'' will enter into her and speak through her mouth. At this time the sick person or the family can negotiate ritual payment to entice it to return.<ref>Sibeth, p. 68.</ref>\n\nTraditional healers are not powerful enough to cure illness due to the loss of a person's ''tendi'' (this falls under the jurisdiction of the ''datuk''), however they do play a role in communicating with ''begu'' and influencing their behavior.<ref>Sibeth, p. 67.</ref>\n\n===Malim===\n[[File:Book of Wizards Batak Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|A magic book or ''[[Pustaha]]'' used by ''datu'' or ''guru'' (wizards) of the [[Toba Batak people]], [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] as seen in the [[State Museum of Ethnology]], [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].]]\n{{Main|Parmalim}}\n{{Other uses|Pemena}}\nMalim is the modern form of the Batak Toba religion.

Over time Mandailing Islam, has been brought closer to the predominant Southeastern [[Shafi`i]] school of Islam as a result of Mandailing discourse with other Islamic practitioners and the practice of [[hajj]], although traditional elements remain, such as dividing inheritance among all children, a Mandailing rather than Islamic practice. Islam caused the decline in importance of marga, with many Mandailing abandoning their marga in favour of Muslim names, much less so among the Angkola to their North.\n\nThe advent of Islam also caused the relegation of the datuk to a medicine man, with traditional rice-planting ceremonies and other such remnants of traditional culture deemed incompatible with Islam. The 'pasusur begu', a ceremony invoking ancestors to aid the community, was also suppressed. Other aspects of adat were however tolerated, with the Mandailing Islamic ideology placing adat on the same level as Islamic law, as in contrast with the Minang practice of placing Islamic law above adat. In more recent times, learned Islamic scholars (ulama) studying abroad, have suggested that many traditional Mandailing practices, such as the 'Raja' hereditary leaders, were in conflict with Islam, being indicative of 'pele begu'. The Islamist ulama were in conflict for authority with the Namora-Natora, the traditional village legal practitioners, who were influenced by adat as much as Islam.\n\nChristian missionaries had been active among the northern Mandailing from 1834 onwards, but their progress was restricted by the Dutch government, who feared conflict between newly converted Christians and Muslims. In addition, the lingua franca of the government was Malay, associated with Muslims, as were government civil servants, creating the perception that Islam was the religion of modernity and progress. Missionaries determined that resistance among the Muslim Mandailing to Christianity was strong, and the missionaries abandoned them as 'unreachable people', moving north to evangelize the Toba.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, nearly all Mandailing and Angkola were Muslims. Despite this, the Dutch administration marked them as part of the Bataklanden, and therefore heathen or Christian. This perception was an inaccurate one, and many Mandailing strongly rejected the 'Batak' label.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html |title=The Mandailings in their own terms |website=Mandailing.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725172658/http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html |archive-date=2011-07-25 |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-10-09}}</ref> Abdullah Lubis, writing in the 1920s, claimed that while the Mandailing followed Batak marga practice, they had never followed the Batak religion, and that the Mandailing people pre-dated the Toba, having acquired marga directly from 'Hindu' visitors. In the Dutch census, the Mandailing objected strongly to being listed in the census as 'Batak Mandailing'. Mandailing in Malaysia (who migrated in the years following the Padri war), had no such objection to their being deemed 'Malays', and indeed Malaysian Mandailing retain little of their distinct identity, partly due to a British colonial policy of rice-land ownership restrictions for all but Malay-speaking Muslims, and the disapproval of 'Batak' Muslim practices by the existing Malay Muslim population.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:AHNasution1951.jpg|thumb|upright|right|150px|[[Abdul Haris Nasution]], General of the 2) Fransiska Sinaga, the Sales Executive in Informal Batam branch [[Indonesian Army]]]]\n{{Main|List of Batak people}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n*[[Batak architecture]]\n*[[Batak cuisine]]\n*[[Malays in Singapore#The Batak|Batak in Singapore]]\n*[[Marga (Batak)]]\n*[[Museum Huta Balon Simanindo]]\n*[[Proto-Malay]]\n*[[Tunggal panaluan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Batak}}\n{{NIE Poster|Battaks}}\n*[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1485-16 The family tree of the Batak languages, from Ethnologue.com]\n*[http://www.silaban.net/category/artikel-batak/ Many articles about Batak in Indonesian language, from Silaban Brotherhood]\n*[http://www.technocraft.org/tuansihubil/tarombo.htm Tarombo Tuan Sihubil.

The last Batak king who fought valiantly against Dutch imperialists until 1905 was an Indonesian Shaivite king. The Batak may be mentioned in [[Zhao Rugua]]'s 13th-century ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi|Description of the Barbarous Peoples]]'' (''Zhu Fan Zhi'' {{lang|zh|\u8af8\u8543\u5fd7}}), which refers to a 'Ba-ta' dependency of [[Srivijaya]]. The ''[[Suma Oriental]]'', of the 15th century, also refers to the kingdom of Bata, bounded by [[Pasai]] and the [[Sultanate of Deli|Aru kingdom]].\n\nBased on this evidence, the Batak may have been involved in procuring important commodities for trade with [[China]], perhaps from the 8th or 9th centuries and continuing for the next thousand years, with Batak men carrying the products on their backs for sale at ports.\n\nIt has been suggested that the important port of [[Barus]] in [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] was populated by Batak people.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Malay Frontier: Unity and Duality in a Sumatran Kingdom |last=Drakard |first=Jane |publisher=SEAP Publications |year=1990 |isbn=08-772-7706-0}}</ref> A [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription has been found in Barus which is dated to 1088, while contact with Chinese and Tamil traders took place at [[Kota Cina]], a trading town located in what is now northern [[Medan]] that was established in the 11th century, and comprising 10,000 people by the 12th century. Tamil remains have been found on key trade routes to the Batak lands.\n\nThese trading opportunities may have caused migration of Batak from Pakpak and Toba to the present-day Karo and Simalungun 'frontier' lands, where they were exposed to greater influence from visiting Tamil traders, while the migration of Batak to the Angkola-Mandailing lands may have been prompted by 8th-century Srivijayan demand for [[camphor]].\n\nThe [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo ''marga'' or tribe]] ''Sembiring'' \"black one\" is believed to originate from their ties with Tamil traders, with specific Sembiring sub-marga, namely Brahmana, Colia, Pandia, Depari, Meliala, Muham, Pelawi, and Tekan all of Indian origin. Tamil influence on Karo religious practices are also noted, with the pekualuh secondary cremation ritual being specific to the Karo and Dairi people. Moreover the Pustaka Kembaren, an origin story of the Sembiring Kembaren suggests linkages with [[Pagarruyung]] in [[Minangkabau Highlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Mengenal suku Karo |last=Bangun |first=Roberto |date=2006 |publisher=Yayasan Pendidikan Bangun}}</ref> \n\nFrom the 16th century onward, [[Aceh]] increased the production of [[Black pepper|pepper]], an important export commodity, in exchange for rice, which grew well in the Batak wetlands. Batak people in different areas cultivated either ''sawah'' (wet rice fields) or ''ladang'' (dry rice), and the Toba Batak, most expert in agriculture, must have migrated to meet demand in new areas. The increasing importance of rice had religious significance, which increased the power of the Batak high priests, who had responsibility for ensuring agricultural success.\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Image from page 129 of \"Handbook to the ethnographical collections\" (1910) (14783317945).jpg|thumb|right|Bark book with charms written in native [[Batak script]], 1910.]]\n{{main|Batak languages}}\n{{see also|Batak script}}\nThe Batak speak a variety of closely related languages, all members of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. There are two major branches, a northern branch comprising the [[Batak Dairi language|Pakpak-Dairi]], [[Batak Alas-Kluet language|Alas-Kluet]] and [[Batak Karo language|Karo]] languages, which are similar to each other, and a distinct southern branch, comprising three mutually intelligible dialects: [[Batak Toba language|Toba]], [[Batak Angkola language|Angkola]] and [[Batak Mandailing language|Mandailing]]. [[Batak Simalungun language|Simalungun]] is an early offspring of the southern branch. Some Simalungun dialects can be understood by speakers of Batak Karo, whereas other dialects of Simalungun can be understood by speakers of Toba. This is due to the existence of a linguistic continuum that often blurs the lines between the Batak dialects. Batak dialect still influences the dialects in [[Medan]] city today.\n\nThe Batak possess their own script known as the [[Batak script|''Surat Batak'']].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0834803496 Kozok, Uli, \"Bark, Bones and Bamboo: Batak traditions of Sumatra,\" in ''Illuminations: The Writing Traditions of Indonesia,'' Ann Kumar and John McGlynn, eds., Lontar and Weatherhill, Jakarta (1237).]</ref> The writing has chiefly ceremonial importance within traditional religious ceremonies, and was subject to little change for this reason. It is likely that the Batak people originally received their writing system from southern Sumatra.\n\n==Profession==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Toba Batak prauw met houtsnijwerk op de voorsteven TMnr 60011149.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional boat (circa 1870), photograph by [[Kristen Feilberg]].]]\nThe traditional occupation of the Batak was [[agriculture]], hunting and farming. The great lake of [[Lake Toba|Toba]] provided vast opportunity for freshwater aquaculture since ancient times. Interior rural Batak communities relied heavily on rice farming, horticulture and other plant and commercial crops, and to some extent, acquiring forest products, such as hard wood, plant resin, and wild animals. \n\nThe port of [[Barus]] on the western coast of Batak lands has become famous as the source of ''kapur barus'' ([[camphor]]). In ancient times, Batak warriors were often recruited by neighboring Malay courts as mercenaries. In the colonial era, the Dutch introduced commercial cash crops, such as coffee, ''sawit'' [[palm oil]], and [[rubber]], converting some parts of the Batak land into plantations.\n\nThroughout the history of modern Indonesia, the Batak community has been a significant contributor. Batak people have filled a wide range of occupations, from running modest tire service workshops to serving as state ministers. The modern Batak have gravitated towards professions such as attorneys, bus and taxi drivers, mechanics, engineers, singers and musicians, writers and journalists, teachers, economists, scientists, and military officers.\n\nEven though the Batak are a minority among the Indonesian population (3.58 %; only 8-9 million Batak people out of 236 million according 2010's census), there have been a number of notable Batak that have risen to distinguished positions and careers. Especially in the field of law Bataks have been well represented.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/31491/batak-make-good-lawyers-is-it-true/ |title=Batak Make Good Lawyers, Is It True? |last=Tjahjono |first=Tenissa |date=31 October 2017 |website=Global Indonesian Voices}}</ref> Among others, lawyers like [[Ruhut Sitompul]] and [[Hotman Paris Hutapea]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/world/asia/24hotman.html |title=A Top Indonesian Lawyer May Be Honest to a Fault |last=Onishi |first=Norimitsu |date=24 April 2010 |website=The New York Times}}</ref> are widely known beyond the circle of their legal colleagues, since they have gained star lawyer reputations by handling high-profile cases closely reported by the media.

National heroes such as [[Sisingamangaraja XII]], two Indonesian prime ministers ([[Amir Sjarifuddin|Amir Syarifuddin Harahap]] and [[Burhanuddin Harahap]]), speakers of the parliament ([[Zainul Arifin|Zainul Arifin Pohan]]), one vice president ([[Adam Malik|Adam Malik Batubara]]), governor of the central bank ([[Darmin Nasution]]), one attorney general ([[Marsillam Simanjuntak]]), and many cabinet ministers (such as [[Malam Sambat Kaban|M.S. Kaban]], [[Tifatul Sembiring]], [[Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan]]), as well as leading military generals and officers ([[Abdul Harris Nasution]], [[T. B.

A traditional belief among the Toba Batak is that they originate from one ancestor \"Si Raja Batak\", with all ''Margas'' descended from him. A family tree that defines the father-son relationship among Batak people is called ''[[tarombo]]''. In contemporary Indonesia, the Batak people have a strong focus on education and a prominent position in the professions, particularly as teachers, engineers, doctors and lawyers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Kinship and Family Organization |last=Farber |first=Bernard |date=1966 |publisher=Wiley}}</ref> Toba Batak are known traditionally for their [[weaving]], [[wood carving]] and especially ornate stone tombs.\n\nBefore they became subjects of the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] government, the Batak had a reputation for being fierce warriors. Today the Batak are mostly Christian with a Muslim minority. Currently the largest Christian congregation in Indonesia is the [[HKBP]] (''Huria Kristen Batak Protestan'') Christian church. The dominant Christian [[theology]] was brought by [[Lutheran]] [[German people|German]] missionaries in the 19th century, including the well-known missionary [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]]. Christianity was introduced to the Karo by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Calvinist]] missionaries, and their largest church is the GBKP (''Gereja Batak Karo Protestan''). The [[Mandailing]] and Angkola Batak were converted to Islam in the early 19th century during the reign of Minangkabaus [[Padri War|Padri]].<ref>Luckman Sinar (Tengku), The History of Medan in the Olden Times, 1996</ref> A significant minority of Batak people do not adhere to either Christianity or Islam, however, and follow traditional practices known as the ''agama si dekah'', the old religion, which is also called ''perbegu'' or ''pemena''.<ref>Sibeth, p. 86.</ref>\n\n=== Dalihan Na Tolu ===\n''Dalihan Na Tolu'' (three-legged furnace) is the philosophy of life of the Batak people.

His description parallels that of Marsden in some important respects, however von Kessel states that cannibalism was regarded by the Batak as a judicial act and its application was restricted to very narrowly defined infringements of the law including theft, [[adultery]], spying or treason. Salt, red pepper and lemons had to be provided by the relatives of the victim as a sign that they accepted the [[verdict]] of the community and were not thinking of [[revenge]].<ref>Von Kessel, O., \"Erinnerungen an Sumatra,\" ''Das Ausland,'' Stuttgart (1854) 27:905-08.</ref>\n\n[[Ida Laura Pfeiffer]] visited the Batak in August 1852 and although she did not observe any cannibalism, she was told that: \n:\"[[Prisoners of war]] are tied to a tree and beheaded at once; but the blood is carefully preserved for drinking, and sometimes made into a kind of pudding with boiled rice.

For those who do not know the lineage will be considered as a strayed (''nalilu'') Batak. Batak people are required to know their lineage or at least the ancestors of which the family name ([[Marga (Batak)]]) and the related clans (''dongan tubu'') came from. This is necessary in order to determine the relation of a kinship (''partuturanna'') within a clan or simply the surname ([[Marga (Batak)]]) itself.\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = \n| align     = right\n| image   = \n| width   = 250\n| caption   = \n| image1    = Sumatra Ethnic Groups Map en.svg\n| width1    = 220\n| caption1  = Location ethnic groups of Sumatra, the Batak tribes located around Lake Toba in North Sumatra.\n}}\nThe Batak lands consist of [[North Sumatra]] province, excluding [[Nias]] island, the historically Malay kingdoms of the east coast and the western coast of [[Minangkabau people]].<ref>Daniel Perret, Kolonialisme dan Etnisitas: Batak dan Melayu di Sumatra Timur Laut, Gramedia, 2010</ref> In addition, part of the Karo lands extend into modern-day [[East Aceh Regency]] in [[Aceh]] province, while parts of the Mandailing lands lie in [[Rokan Hulu]] Regency in [[Riau]].

Information about the old religious ideas of the [[Mandailing]] and Angkola in southern Batakland is incomplete, and  very little is known about the religion of the [[Pakpak people|Pakpak]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]] Batak. For the [[Toba people|Toba]] and [[Karo people|Karo]] on the other hand the evidence in the writings of missionaries and colonial administrators is relatively abundant. Information on the traditional forms of Batak religion is derived mainly from the writings of [[Germans|German]] and Dutch missionaries who became increasingly concerned with Batak beliefs towards the end of the 19th century.<ref>Sibeth, p. 64.</ref>\n\nVarious influences affected the Batak through their contact with Tamil and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] traders and settlers in southern Batakland, and the east and west coast near Barus and [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]], in particular the large [[Padang Lawas temple complex]] in Tapanuli. These contacts took place many centuries ago and it is impossible to reconstruct just how far the religious ideas of these foreigners were adopted and reworked by the Batak. It is suggested that the Batak adopted aspects of these religions, specifically Mahayana Buddhist, [[Shaivism|Shaivist]], and [[Tantra|Tantrist]] practices<ref name=tradebatak /> within their own customs.<ref>H. Parkin, ''The Extent and Areas of Indian/Hindu Influence on the Ideas and Development of Toba-Batak Religion and Its Implications for the Christianization of the Toba-Batak People of North Sumatra.''

Traditional religions are not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional religions are increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak religion are still practised alongside Christianity.\n\n===Creation myths===\n[[File:Batak Puppenspieler.jpg|thumb|right|Puppeteers of [[Toba Batak people]] with a [[Sigale Gale]] puppet, [[Sumatra]].]]\n\nThere are many different versions in circulation. These were formerly passed down through oral tradition but have now been written down in the local languages. There are also large collections of Batak tales collected by European scholars since the mid-19th century and recorded in European languages, mostly Dutch.<ref>Much of this section is derived from Stohr, W. & Zoeta Jadider, P. (1965) \"Die Religionen Indonesiens.\" ''Die Religionen der Menschheit,'' vol. 5:1, Stuttgart.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld [[dragon]] ''Naga Padoha''. The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. All the surviving [[myths]] record that at the beginning of creation stands the god ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon''. His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the \"beginning of becoming\". The creation of everything that exists can be traced back to him. ''Mula Jadi'' lives in the upper world which is usually thought of as divided into seven levels. His three sons, ''Batara Guru'', ''Mangalabulan'' and ''Soripada'' were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by ''Mula Jadi''. Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to ''Mula Jadi'' in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. ''Mula Jadi'' begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of ''Mula Jadi'' there is another god, ''Asiasi'', whose place and function in the world of the gods remains largely unclear. There is some evidence that ''Asiasi'' can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods.\n\nThe ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon ''Naga Padoha''. He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of ''Mula Jadi''. As ruler of the underworld ''Naga Padoha'' also has an important function in the creation of the earth.\n\nWhat all the six gods so far mentioned have in common is that they play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive any sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of [[sacrifice]] are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.<ref>Leertouwer, L.\n(1977) ''Her beeld van de ziel bij drie Sumatraanse votken.'' Doctoral dissertation in Theology. Groningen, p. 177.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of ''Batara Guru'', ''Sideak Parujar'', who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband,\nthe lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world which at that time was still just a watery waste. She refuses to go back but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion ''Mula Jadi'' sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. ''Sideak Parudjar'' was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of ''Naga Padoha'', the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and threatened to be utterly destroyed. With the help of ''Mula Jadi'' and by her own cunning ''Sideak Parudjar'' was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of ''Naga Padoha'' up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever ''Naga Padoha'' twists in the fetters an earthquake occurs.\n\nAfter the lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, ''Sideak Parujar'' marries him. ''Sideak Parujar'' becomes the mother of twins of different sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their [[incestuous]] union.\nThe couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of [[Lake Toba]], and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, ''Si Raja Batak'' is one of their grandchildren.<ref>Sibeth, p. 65.</ref>\n\n===The ''tendi'' cult===\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Carved bone calendar and almanac.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A 20th century carved bone of a [[Porhalaan]] Batak calendar.]]\nIn the religious world of the Toba and Karo Batak the gods and the creation of mankind are far less significant than the complex concepts connected with the ''tendi'' (Karo) or ''tondi'' (Toba) and the ''begu''. Probably the most useful translations of these terms are \"life-soul\" and \"death-soul\". A person receives his \"life-soul\" (''tendi'') from ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon'' before he is born. The [[destiny]] of the individual ''tendi'' is decided by the ''tendi'' itself before birth. Various myths are woven around manner in which the ''tendi'' choose their destiny from ''Mula Jadi''. Warneck, a missionary and for a long time superintendent (''ephorus'') of the Batak Church, recorded two particularly expressive myths in his major work on Batak religion.<ref>Adapted from Warneck, J. (1977) ''Tcba-Batak: Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch.'' The Hague.</ref> What is significant is that the ''tendi'' themselves are responsible for their idiocy:\n\n:\"''Mula Jadi'' presents him with all kinds of things to choose from. If the ''tendi'' asks for ripe eggs, then the person whom he animates will be a poor fellow; if he asks for flowers, then he will live only a short time; if he asks for a hen, the person will be restless; rags indicate poverty; an old mat, lack of fame; a gold piece, wealth; plate, spear, medicine pot indicate that he will become a great chief or understand magic arts.\"\n\n:\"With ''Mula Jadi'' in the upper world is a mighty tree called ''Djambubarus''. ''Mula Jadi'' has written on all its leaves. On one leaf is written 'many children', on others 'wealth' or 'respect' and so on. 'Contemptible life', 'poverty', 'wretchedness' are also written on the leaves. All the possible different fates of the person are entered on the leaves. Every ''tendi'' that wishes to descend to the middle world must first ask ''Mula Jadi'' for one of the leaves. Whatever is written on the leaf chosen by him will be his destiny in the middle world.\"\n\nAmong the Karo and the Toba there are sometimes widely diverging versions of where the ''tendi'' dwells and how many ''tendi'' there are. According to the Toba a person has seven ''tendi''. The second ''tendi'' is found in the [[placenta]] and [[amniotic fluid]] of the new-born baby, and accordingly the afterbirth is given special attention after the birth of a child. It is usually buried under the house, is called ''saudara'' (brother) and is regarded as the person's guardian spirit. Similar ideas about the afterbirth are also found among the Karo, who also bury the placenta and amniotic fluid under the house and regard them as two guardian spirits (''kaka'' and ''agi'') who always remain close to the person.<ref>Westenberg CJ, (1982) ''Aanteekeningen omtrent de godsdienstige begrippen der Karo-Bataks.'' BK141:208-53</ref>\n\nAll Batak regard the loss of ''tendi'' as signifying a great danger for \"body and soul\". ''Tendi'' can be separated from their owners through inattentiveness, or as a result of black magic by a ''datu'' with evil intentions. In other words, the ''tendi'' is not tied to the body; it can also live for a time outside the body. The final loss of the ''tendi'' inevitably results in death. There are a variety of ideas about where exactly in the body the ''tendi'' dwells. It is present to a particularly high degree in certain parts of the body, especially the blood, the liver, the head and the heart. Sweat too is described as rich in ''tendi''. It is believed that illnesses are connected with the absence of ''tendi'', and the bringing back of the ''tendi'' is a main method of healing. The Karo, for instance, have gifts, called ''upah tendi'' (''upah'' = wage, payment, gift), which they give to their ''tendi'' so that their ''tendi'' stay with them. These gifts may consist of a knife, a gong, a particular piece of clothing, a water buffalo or a small holy place. The gifts are carefully cared for in order to keep the ''tendi'' satisfied.<ref>Kipp, RS,\n1974 \"Karo Batak Religion and Social Structure.\" ''Berita Kajian Sumatra''(Sumatra Research Bulletin), University of Hull 3,2:4-11.</ref>\n\n''Tendi'' love the sound of the ''surdam'' (a bamboo flute). If a ''tendi'' has abandoned the body of a patient, the playing of the ''surdam'' in the ''raleng tendi'' ritual can contribute to the ''tendi'' returning to the body of the sick person. It must be emphasized that only the ''datuk'' are in a position to interpret and influence people's ''tendi'' correctly. If their endeavors are unsuccessful, then clearly the ''tendi'' has chosen another destiny for itself.<ref>Sibeth, P. 87.</ref>\n\n===Death cult===\n[[File:Batak totem 09N9443.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Batak [[Totem pole]].]]\n\nAt death the ''tendi'' leaves the human body through the fontanelle and the \"death-soul\" (''begu'') is set free. It is thought that the ''tendi'' vanishes and after the death of any human being only the ''begu'' continues to exist. The Batak believe that the ''begu'' continue to live near their previous dwelling (in a village of the dead which is thought to be situated not far from the\ncemetery) and that they may contact their descendants. Bad dreams, particular misfortune and such like may be signs that the ''begu'' of an ancestor is not satisfied with the behavior of its descendants. Any individual can attempt to pacify an enraged ''begu'' by means of food and drink offerings and prayers. If this does not work, a ''datu'' or a ''guru'' must be called in.<ref>Kipp, 1974, p. 11.</ref> The ''begu'' are not immortal, since death also rules in the land of the dead: a ''begu'' dies seven times before it is changed into a straw and finally becomes earth.<ref>Sibeth, p. 69.</ref>\n\nThe Batak believe that three categories of ''begu'' exist.<ref>Westenberg, p. 221.</ref> The ''bicara guru'' are the ''begu'' of stillborn babies or of babies who have died before teething. It is possible to turn ''bicara guru'' into guardian spirits if misfortune has befallen the family of the child shortly after its death. With the help of a ''guru sibaso'', the ''bicara guru'' can be made the family's guardian spirit for which a shrine is provided and to which sacrifices are regularly made. Once a year the ''bicara guru'' is accorded a special feast, preceded by ritual hair washing.\n\nThe ''begu'' of members of the family who have had a sudden death (''mate sada-uari'') can also act as guardian spirits for the family. They include the victims of accidents, suicides, murder victims, or people struck by lightning. A shrine is built where they are venerated and where sacrifices are made. A third category consists of the ''begu'' of dead virgins (''tungkup''). Their graves, called ''bata-bata'' or ''ingan tungkup'', are maintained for a long time by their relatives.\n\n===Burial traditions===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een stenen sarcofaag in een Toba Batak dorp TMnr 60045329.jpg|thumb|left|A stone sarcophagus in a Toba Batak village.]]\n\nBatak [[burial]] traditions are very rich and complex. Immediately after death various ritual actions are performed to make the ''begu'' understand that from now on its world is separate from that of its kin. Symbolically this is done by reversing the mat on which the corpse is laid out so that the body lies with its head at the foot of the mat. Thumbs and toes respectively are tied together and the body is rubbed all over with [[camphor]] and its orifices stopped with [[camphor]], then it is wrapped in a white cotton cloth. During this ''perumah begu'' ceremony a ''guru sibaso'' declares to the ''begu'' of the deceased that it is definitely dead and must take leave of its relatives.\n\nWealthier families have their coffins (Karo: ''[[pelangkah]]'') made of the wood of the ''[[kemiri]]'' tree (''[[Aleurites moluccanus]]''), carved in the shape of a boat, its bow decorated with the carved head of a [[hornbill]], or a horse, or a [[mythical beast]] known as a [[Singa (mythology)|singa]]. The lid is then sealed with [[resin]] and the coffin may be placed in a special location near the family's house until a reburial ceremony can take place. Families that are not wealthy use simple wooden coffins or wrap the body in a straw mat.\n\nThe corpse is carried a few times round the house, usually by women, and then to the [[cemetery]] with musical accompaniment from the ''[[gondang]]'' orchestra and the continual firing of guns. At any crossroads the corpse is put down and eleven people go around it four times to confuse the ''begu''. It is hoped that the ''begu'' will then be unable to find its way back to the village. When the funeral procession arrives at the cemetery the grave is dug and the corpse laid in it, flat on its back. Care is taken that the head lies towards the village so that, in the unexpected event that the body should get up, he or she will not be looking in the direction of the village. The bodies of ''datuk'' and those who have died from lightning are buried sitting up with their hands tied together. The palms of the hand are tied together and [[betel]] placed between them.<ref>Kipp, 1974, p. 9</ref>\n\n===Reburial===\n[[File:Batak Tombs.JPG|right|thumb|Batak ''tugu'' on the island of [[Samosir]], Lake Toba, December 1984.]]\n\nThe burial tradition includes a reburial ceremony in which the bones of one's ancestors are reinterred several years after death. This secondary burial is known among the Toba Batak as ''mangongkal holi'', among the Karo as ''nurun-nurun''. In a ceremony lasting several days the bones of a particularly honored ancestor and those of his descendants are exhumed, cleaned, mourned and finally laid to rest again in a bone house known as a ''tugu'' or ''tambak'':\n:\"On the morning of the first day of the festival the graves in the cemetery are opened and the bones of the ancestors that are still there are removed. The unearthing of the skulls is presented as especially moving. The bones are collected in baskets lined with white cloth and then ritually cleaned by the women using the juice of various [[citrus]] fruits. The exhumation and cleaning of the bones is accompanied by the singing of laments. The bones are kept in the baskets in the ''tugu'' until the next morning, when the remains are wrapped in traditional cloths (''[[ulos]]'') and transferred from the baskets to small wooden coffins. After long speeches and a communal prayer the coffins are nailed down and placed in the chambers of the ''tugu''. A feast consisting of meat and rice follows and traditional dances are performed.<ref>Simon, A. (1982) \"Altreligiose und soziale Zeremonien der Batak.\" ''ZjE'' 107:177-206.</ref>\"\n\nIn ancient times these [[sarcophagi]] were carved from stone or constructed from wood and later brick. Nowadays they are made of cement or concrete. Large and very ornate ''tugu'' can be seen around Lake Toba and on the island of [[Samosir]].\n\nOne motive for the reburial ceremony appears to be to raise the status of the ''begu'' of the deceased. Traditional Batak beliefs hold that the dead occupy a hierarchical status similar to the social position they held in life. This means that a rich and powerful individual remains influential after death, and this status can be elevated if the family holds a reburial ceremony. A rich descendant can advance a ''begu'' to the status of a ''sumangot'' by means of a great ceremony and a ''horja'' feast which can last up to seven days. In antiquity a vast number of pigs, cattle or even buffalo were slaughtered at such festivals, and the ''gondang'' orchestra provided an accompaniment.\n\nThe next level up from the ''sumangot'' is the ''sombaon'', who are the spirits of important ancestors who lived ten to twelve generations ago. To raise a ''sumangot'' to a ''sombaon'' requires another great festival, a ''santi rea'', often lasting several months, during which the inhabitants of the whole district come together. These powerful ancestor spirits offer protection and good fortune to their descendants, but the ceremony also serves to establish new [[kinship]] groups descended from the ancestor thus honored.<ref>Stohr, p. 197.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Batak medicine===\n[[File:Mme Sitorus Dukun.jpg|thumb|left|Madame Sitorus, a well-known Toba ''guru sibaso'' who practiced in [[:id:Laguboti|Laguboti]] in 1984. She is consulting a paperback edition of the [[New Testament]] in lieu of a ''[[pustaha]]''. On the shelf are components of herbal remedies. In front of her is a [[kaffir lime]] in a bowl of water, a form of divination used to locate lost items or people.]]\n\nIn traditional Batak society ''datuk'' (animist priests) as well as ''[[gurus]]'' practiced [[traditional medicine]], although the former were exclusively male. Both professions were attributed with supernatural powers and the ability to predict the future. Treatments and healing rituals bear some resemblance to those practiced by [[dukun]]s in other parts of Indonesia. Following the Christianization of the Toba and Karo Batak in the late 19th century, missionaries discouraged traditional healing and divination and they became largely [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] activities.<ref>Sibeth, p. 98</ref>\n\nBoth ''datu'' and ''guru'' healers also practiced [[divination]] by consulting a ''[[pustaha]]'', a handwritten book made of wood and bark in which were inscribed recipes for healing remedies, incantations and songs, predictive calendars, and other notes on magic, healing and divination written in ''poda,'' an archaic [[Batak script|Batak shorthand]]. According to Winkler,<ref>J. Winkler, ''Die Toba-Batak auf Sumatra in gesunden und kranken Tagen,'' [The Toba Bataks of Sumatra in Sickness and in Health] (1925), pp. 79-224.</ref> there were three categories of ''[[Pustaha]]'' based on the purpose of their usage:\n:1. '''Protective Magic''', which includes diagnosis, therapy, medicinal mixes which have magical properties, such as [[amulets]], ''parmanisan'' (love charms), etc.\n:2. '''Destructive Magic''', which encompasses the art of making poison, the art of controlling or utilizing the power of certain spirits, calling the ''pangulubalang'', and the art of making ''dorma'' (magical formulas for causing a person to fall in love).\n:3. '''Divination''', which involves [[oracles]] (words of the gods), the wishes of the spirits, commands from the gods and from the spirits of the ancestors, and an [[almanac]] or calendrical system (''porhalaan''), and [[astrology]] to determine auspicious days and months to accomplish certain actions or goals.<ref name=\"V7177\">Voorma, pp. 71-77.</ref>\n\nThe ''datu'' or ''guru'' consulted the ''[[pustaha]]'' when presented with a difficult problem, and in time this became in itself a ritual. When missionaries began to discourage traditional healing and [[augury]] the [[Bible]] may have been adopted by some ''gurus'' in place of the ''[[pustaha]]''.<ref name=\"V7177\"/>\n\nAmong the most important healing ceremonies performed in Toba and Karo communities is that of recalling the ''jinujung,'' or personal guardian spirit. According to Toba and Karo [[cosmology]], each person receives a ''jinujung'' in childhood or at [[puberty]] and they keep it for life unless they are unfortunate enough to lose it, in which case they will fall ill. In order to call the ''jinujung'' back, a female ''guru'' (''guru sibaso'' in Karo) goes into a [[trance]] and  the ''jinujung'' will enter into her and speak through her mouth. At this time the sick person or the family can negotiate ritual payment to entice it to return.<ref>Sibeth, p. 68.</ref>\n\nTraditional healers are not powerful enough to cure illness due to the loss of a person's ''tendi'' (this falls under the jurisdiction of the ''datuk''), however they do play a role in communicating with ''begu'' and influencing their behavior.<ref>Sibeth, p. 67.</ref>\n\n===Malim===\n[[File:Book of Wizards Batak Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|A magic book or ''[[Pustaha]]'' used by ''datu'' or ''guru'' (wizards) of the [[Toba Batak people]], [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] as seen in the [[State Museum of Ethnology]], [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].]]\n{{Main|Parmalim}}\n{{Other uses|Pemena}}\nMalim is the modern form of the Batak Toba religion.

Over time Mandailing Islam, has been brought closer to the predominant Southeastern [[Shafi`i]] school of Islam as a result of Mandailing discourse with other Islamic practitioners and the practice of [[hajj]], although traditional elements remain, such as dividing inheritance among all children, a Mandailing rather than Islamic practice. Islam caused the decline in importance of marga, with many Mandailing abandoning their marga in favour of Muslim names, much less so among the Angkola to their North.\n\nThe advent of Islam also caused the relegation of the datuk to a medicine man, with traditional rice-planting ceremonies and other such remnants of traditional culture deemed incompatible with Islam. The 'pasusur begu', a ceremony invoking ancestors to aid the community, was also suppressed. Other aspects of adat were however tolerated, with the Mandailing Islamic ideology placing adat on the same level as Islamic law, as in contrast with the Minang practice of placing Islamic law above adat. In more recent times, learned Islamic scholars (ulama) studying abroad, have suggested that many traditional Mandailing practices, such as the 'Raja' hereditary leaders, were in conflict with Islam, being indicative of 'pele begu'. The Islamist ulama were in conflict for authority with the Namora-Natora, the traditional village legal practitioners, who were influenced by adat as much as Islam.\n\nChristian missionaries had been active among the northern Mandailing from 1834 onwards, but their progress was restricted by the Dutch government, who feared conflict between newly converted Christians and Muslims. In addition, the lingua franca of the government was Malay, associated with Muslims, as were government civil servants, creating the perception that Islam was the religion of modernity and progress. Missionaries determined that resistance among the Muslim Mandailing to Christianity was strong, and the missionaries abandoned them as 'unreachable people', moving north to evangelize the Toba.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, nearly all Mandailing and Angkola were Muslims. Despite this, the Dutch administration marked them as part of the Bataklanden, and therefore heathen or Christian. This perception was an inaccurate one, and many Mandailing strongly rejected the 'Batak' label.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html |title=The Mandailings in their own terms |website=Mandailing.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725172658/http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html |archive-date=2011-07-25 |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-10-09}}</ref> Abdullah Lubis, writing in the 1920s, claimed that while the Mandailing followed Batak marga practice, they had never followed the Batak religion, and that the Mandailing people pre-dated the Toba, having acquired marga directly from 'Hindu' visitors. In the Dutch census, the Mandailing objected strongly to being listed in the census as 'Batak Mandailing'. Mandailing in Malaysia (who migrated in the years following the Padri war), had no such objection to their being deemed 'Malays', and indeed Malaysian Mandailing retain little of their distinct identity, partly due to a British colonial policy of rice-land ownership restrictions for all but Malay-speaking Muslims, and the disapproval of 'Batak' Muslim practices by the existing Malay Muslim population.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:AHNasution1951.jpg|thumb|upright|right|150px|[[Abdul Haris Nasution]], General of the [[Indonesian Army]]]]\n{{Main|List of Batak people}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n*[[Batak architecture]]\n*[[Batak cuisine]]\n*[[Malays in Singapore#The Batak|Batak in Singapore]]\n*[[Marga (Batak)]]\n*[[Museum Huta Balon Simanindo]]\n*[[Proto-Malay]]\n*[[Tunggal panaluan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Batak}}\n{{NIE Poster|Battaks}}\n*[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1485-16 The family tree of the Batak languages, from Ethnologue.com]\n*[http://www.silaban.net/category/artikel-batak/ Many articles about Batak in Indonesian language, from Silaban Brotherhood]\n*[http://www.technocraft.org/tuansihubil/tarombo.htm Tarombo Tuan Sihubil.
