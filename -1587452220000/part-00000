The ferry departs from [[Takeshiba Pier]], near [[Hamamatsuch\u014d Station]], Tokyo at 22:30 and arrives at Miyakejima at 5:00. Depending on the wind and weather conditions, the ''Tachibana Maru'' will dock at one of three ports; Miike Port Pier (\u4e09\u6c60\u6e2f\u685f\u6a4b), T\u014dkai Kisen Igaya Port (\u6771\u6d77\u6c7d\u8239 \u4f0a\u30f6\u8c37), or Sabigahama Port (\u9306\u30f6\u6d5c\u6e2f). The port where the boat will dock is not predictable and changes on a daily basis. Generally, the boat will arrive at the port that is complimentary with the wind direction.<ref>https://www.tokaikisen.co.jp/en/</ref>  \n\nThere are flights connecting [[Miyakejima Airport]] and [[Haneda Airport]] with an approximate flying time of 50&nbsp;minutes. Flights are also operated from [[Chofu Airport]]. The area is prone to high volume of sulfuric gas and flights were suspended for almost eight years after the July 14, 2000 volcano eruption. Flights resumed during April 2008, after sulfuric gases in the air dropped to levels below 0.2ppm.<ref>[https://archive.is/20080426162442/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20080426-OYT1T00501.htm] </ref> There is a helicopter that arrives via [[Izu \u014cshima]]. There are also two helicopter flights operated by Tokyo Island Shuttle which originate in [[Aogashima]] and [[Izu \u014cshima]] and fly to [[Toshima Island|Toshima]], Miyake-jima, [[Mikura-jima]], [[Hachij\u014d-jima]] and [[Aogashima]].\n\nThere are two bus routes on the island. Both bus routes service the same stops, but one route goes clockwise and the other route goes counter-clockwise around the island. The time between each bus stop arrival can vary greatly from a few minutes to up to 3 hours.<ref>https://www.miyakejima.gr.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/basjikokuhyou20180501.pdf</ref>\n[[File:Miyake-jima Bus Stop.jpg|thumb|Typical bus stop with Izu Thrush bus marker]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Tokyo|Islands}}\n* [[List of volcanoes in Japan]]\n* [[List of islands of Japan]]\n* [[Izu Islands]]\n* [[Devil's Sea]]\n* [[Jack Moyer]] (1929-2004), former resident and marine biologist\n*[[Two Car]] (2017), an animated television series set in Miyake-jima\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Teikoku's Complete Atlas of Japan'', Teikoku-Shoin., Ltd.

As of June 1, 2016, the population of the island was 2451. {{nihongo|[[Miyake, Tokyo|Miyake Village]]|\u4e09\u5b85\u6751|Miyake-mura}} serves as the local government of the island, and also encloses nearby tiny uninhabited [[\u014cnoharajima]] west south-west of Miyake-jima. \n\nMiyake village consists of the five traditional hamlets of Izu, Kamitsuki, Igaya, Ako and Tsubota, with Tsubota on the southeast coast as the administrative center.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nMiyake-jima is home to the rare endemic [[Izu thrush]] (''akakokko'').<ref>[http://www.asahi.com/english/vox/TKY200502030145.html asahi.com : English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nThe island is home to an unusually rich flora and fauna with several rare species of birds and animals, although its natural habitats are constantly under threat from human and volcanic activity. \nUnderwater, the island is valued by divers for its coral reefs and marine fauna (including the dolphin population outside nearby [[Mikura-jima]]).\n\n==Access==\nThe island is accessible by over-night ferry, the ''Sarubia Maru'' or the ''Tachibana Maru'', which is operated by T\u014dkai Kisen. The ferry departs from [[Takeshiba Pier]], near [[Hamamatsuch\u014d Station]], Tokyo at 22:30 and arrives at Miyakejima at 5:00. Depending on the wind and weather conditions, the ''Tachibana Maru'' will dock at one of three ports; Miike Port Pier (\u4e09\u6c60\u6e2f\u685f\u6a4b), T\u014dkai Kisen Igaya Port (\u6771\u6d77\u6c7d\u8239 \u4f0a\u30f6\u8c37), or Sabigahama Port (\u9306\u30f6\u6d5c\u6e2f). The port where the boat will dock is not predictable and changes on a daily basis. Generally, the boat will arrive at the port that is complimentary with the wind direction.<ref>https://www.tokaikisen.co.jp/en/</ref>  \n\nThere are flights connecting [[Miyakejima Airport]] and [[Haneda Airport]] with an approximate flying time of 50&nbsp;minutes. Flights are also operated from [[Chofu Airport]]. The area is prone to high volume of sulfuric gas and flights were suspended for almost eight years after the July 14, 2000 volcano eruption. Flights resumed during April 2008, after sulfuric gases in the air dropped to levels below 0.2ppm.<ref>[https://archive.is/20080426162442/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20080426-OYT1T00501.htm] </ref> There is a helicopter that arrives via [[Izu \u014cshima]]. There are also two helicopter flights operated by Tokyo Island Shuttle which originate in [[Aogashima]] and [[Izu \u014cshima]] and fly to [[Toshima Island|Toshima]], Miyake-jima, [[Mikura-jima]], [[Hachij\u014d-jima]] and [[Aogashima]].\n\nThere are two bus routes on the island. Both bus routes service the same stops, but one route goes clockwise and the other route goes counter-clockwise around the island. The time between each bus stop arrival can vary greatly from a few minutes to up to 3 hours.<ref>https://www.miyakejima.gr.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/basjikokuhyou20180501.pdf</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Tokyo|Islands}}\n* [[List of volcanoes in Japan]]\n* [[List of islands of Japan]]\n* [[Izu Islands]]\n* [[Devil's Sea]]\n* [[Jack Moyer]] (1929-2004), former resident and marine biologist\n*[[Two Car]] (2017), an animated television series set in Miyake-jima\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Teikoku's Complete Atlas of Japan'', Teikoku-Shoin., Ltd.

Joining his father in some of his travels, he was exposed to the lifestyle and the music of the [[gaucho]]s of [[Buenos Aires Province]] from his early days. His maternal great-grandfather, named Lionel, was a British immigrant, and fought against the Pampas tribes in the mid-19th century, being wounded by a spear. From him, Rivero inherited his blond hair and his first name.\n\nIn his teens, Rivero's family moved to the [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] neighborhood, in the days where tango developed as a dancing phenomenon, but also as an ever more complex music form under the \"ABC\" of composers/directors Arolas, Bardi, and Cobi\u00e1n. At the same time, the themes of tango lyrics evolved from light-hearted [[ribaldry]] into more complex stories delving on love and manly honor.\n\nRivero learned classic guitar and also trained as a singer; he had a deep bass-baritone voice that was one of his trademarks,<ref>Valdes-Socin H, De Herder WW, Beckers A. The acromegalic voice of Tango: Don Edmundo Rivero. J Endocrinol Invest. 2015 Jul 11.</ref> together with his huge hands (due to his [[acromegaly]]) that made him the butt of many jokes.\n\n===Singing career===\n[[File:Edmundo rivero guitar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Edmundo Rivero performing.]]\nAfter working as a cover singer in small venues, Rivero got his first radio appearance singing a duet with his sister Eva in Radio Cultura. He spent the early 1930s alternating radio work with dance hall gigs.\n\nAfter singing for bandleader Jos\u00e9 De Caro in 1935, Rivero's qualities attracted Jos\u00e9's more famous brother [[Julio De Caro]], who drafted Rivero into his orchestra, which incorporated non-traditional instruments and was a fixture of the Pueyrred\u00f3n theatre ballroom in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]]. Rivero gained some fame, and the moniker that stayed with him forever: ''el feo'' (the ugly guy).\n\nEven though Rivero was featured in many Argentine films in the 1930s and 1940s, the early forties were a time of uncertainty for him. Even bandleaders who did hire him (such as [[Humberto Canaro]]) would not retain him for long. Later, Rivero would claim that his deep voice was a severe handicap during this time.\n\nIn 1944, Rivero joined [[Horacio Salg\u00e1n]]. His three-year tenure there left no recordings (with his [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] influences, Salg\u00e1n was too \"far out\" for the general tango audience) but earned Rivero the respect of avant-garde and jazz musicians. To make ends meet, Rivero also worked in a duo with fellow singer Carlos Berm\u00fadez that recorded tangos in a more commercial vein for the Colombian market.\n\nIn 1947, Rivero was hired by [[An\u00edbal Troilo]], who was having a stellar run of recordings with new hit songs, many of them in collaboration with lyricist [[Homero Manzi]]. During his three years with Troilo, Rivero shared the limelight with Floreal Ruiz and Aldo Calder\u00f3n, and recorded 22 songs, including the mega-hit ''[[Sur (tango)|Sur]]'', where Troilo's melody frames Manzi's elegy for a young love and also for the old ''barrio''.\n\nHaving found fame and fortune, Rivero left Troilo in 1950 and started a solo career. For accompaniment, he would alternate between guitar quartets and a full orchestral format for the remainder of his career. The most famous musician to follow Rivero was guitarist [[Roberto Grela]], who was also the guitarist of Troilo's quartet.\n\nGuitar-only formations were used by countryside [[Milonga (music)|milonga]] artists, early tango singers, and even [[Carlos Gardel]] in his youth, but Rivero's 1950s recordings, during a period of total dominance by big orchestras, was a bold statement, which forever cemented his identification with the silent masculinity of the countryside, as opposed to the emphasis that \"urban\" tango put on stories of lost love.\n\nIn the sixties, Salg\u00e1n and Rivero had their revenge, and recorded several tunes together. Rivero also collaborated with other artists, who noted his generosity and his devotion to music. In 1966 he appeared in the film ''[[Buenos Aires, verano 1912]]''.\n\n===El Viejo Almac\u00e9n===\n[[File:Ra\u00fal Alfonsin y Edmundo Rivero - 1984.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rivero singing with his guitar while then president of Argentina, [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] (sitting in front of him) and other people laugh (1984).]]\nBy the late 1960s, tango had become mostly \"for export\", since musicians and audiences were aging and making little progress from the orchestral format of the 1940s and 1950s. many tango fans rejected the music of [[\u00c1stor Piazzolla]] and his followers, but Rivero himself admired Piazzolla, and recorded his creations on more than one occasion. Even major artists had trouble finding venues to play.\n\nFearing for tango's viability, in 1969 Rivero opened ''El Viejo Almac\u00e9n'' (\"The old store\"), a tango club in the [[San Telmo]] district. His hospitality was enjoyed by many visitors to Buenos Aires, who went to Rivero's club to savor the tango music and dance in its full intensity. Among the recurring visitors were [[Joan Manuel Serrat]] and [[Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela]].\n\nRivero's place was a venue for tango, where musicians knew they would be respected and paid on time. Famed tango lyricist [[Horacio Ferrer]] wrote a [[Milonga (music)|milonga]] about the ''almac\u00e9n'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928041010/http://www.elportaldeltango.com/indice/coplasde.htm] for which Rivero later composed the music, and took to calling Rivero by his forgotten first name, Leonel, a gesture that many friends would imitate.\n\nRivero was an icon in Japanese tango circles. He toured Japan in 1968, and got to know many Japanese musicians and dancers. Rivero composed \"Arigato Jap\u00f3n\" and \"A lo Megata\" (honoring Tsunayoshi \"Tsunami\" Megata, one of the top tango dancers of his age).

Joining his father in some of his travels, he was exposed to the lifestyle and the music of the [[gaucho]]s of [[Buenos Aires Province]] from his early days. His maternal great-grandfather, named Lionel, was a British immigrant, and fought against the Pampas tribes in the mid-19th century, being wounded by a spear. From him, Rivero inherited his blond hair and his first name.\n\nIn his teens, Rivero's family moved to the [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] neighborhood, in the days where tango developed as a dancing phenomenon, but also as an ever more complex music form under the \"ABC\" of composers/directors Arolas, Bardi, and Cobi\u00e1n. At the same time, the themes of tango lyrics evolved from light-hearted [[ribaldry]] into more complex stories delving on love and manly honor.\n\nRivero learned classic guitar and also trained as a singer; he had a deep bass-baritone voice that was one of his trademarks,<ref>Valdes-Socin H, De Herder WW, Beckers A. The acromegalic voice of Tango: Don Edmundo Rivero. J Endocrinol Invest. 2015 Jul 11.</ref> together with his huge hands (due to his [[acromegaly]]) that made him the butt of many jokes.\n\n===Singing career===\n[[File:Edmundo rivero guitar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Edmundo Rivero performing.]]\nAfter working as a cover singer in small venues, Rivero got his first radio appearance singing a duet with his sister Eva in Radio Cultura. He spent the early 1930s alternating radio work with dance hall gigs.\n\nAfter singing for bandleader Jos\u00e9 De Caro in 1935, Rivero's qualities attracted Jos\u00e9's more famous brother [[Julio De Caro]], who drafted Rivero into his orchestra, which incorporated non-traditional instruments and was a fixture of the Pueyrred\u00f3n theatre ballroom in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]]. Rivero gained some fame, and the moniker that stayed with him forever: ''el feo'' (the ugly guy).\n\nEven though Rivero was featured in many Argentine films in the 1930s and 1940s, the early forties were a time of uncertainty for him. Even bandleaders who did hire him (such as [[Humberto Canaro]]) would not retain him for long. Later, Rivero would claim that his deep voice was a severe handicap during this time.\n\nIn 1944, Rivero joined [[Horacio Salg\u00e1n]]. His three-year tenure there left no recordings (with his [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] influences, Salg\u00e1n was too \"far out\" for the general tango audience) but earned Rivero the respect of avant-garde and jazz musicians. To make ends meet, Rivero also worked in a duo with fellow singer Carlos Berm\u00fadez that recorded tangos in a more commercial vein for the Colombian market.\n\nIn 1947, Rivero was hired by [[An\u00edbal Troilo]], who was having a stellar run of recordings with new hit songs, many of them in collaboration with lyricist [[Homero Manzi]]. During his three years with Troilo, Rivero shared the limelight with Floreal Ruiz and Aldo Calder\u00f3n, and recorded 22 songs, including the mega-hit ''[[Sur (tango)|Sur]]'', where Troilo's melody frames Manzi's elegy for a young love and also for the old ''barrio''.\n\nHaving found fame and fortune, Rivero left Troilo in 1950 and started a solo career. For accompaniment, he would alternate between guitar quartets and a full orchestral format for the remainder of his career. The most famous musician to follow Rivero was guitarist [[Roberto Grela]], who was also the guitarist of Troilo's quartet.\n\nGuitar-only formations were used by countryside [[Milonga (music)|milonga]] artists, early tango singers, and even [[Carlos Gardel]] in his youth, but Rivero's 1950s recordings, during a period of total dominance by big orchestras, was a bold statement, which forever cemented his identification with the silent masculinity of the countryside, as opposed to the emphasis that \"urban\" tango put on stories of lost love.\n\nIn the sixties, Salg\u00e1n and Rivero had their revenge, and recorded several tunes together. Rivero also collaborated with other artists, who noted his generosity and his devotion to music. In 1966 he appeared in the film ''[[Buenos Aires, verano 1912]]''.\n\n===El Viejo Almac\u00e9n===\n[[File:Ra\u00fal Alfonsin y Edmundo Rivero - 1984.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rivero singing with his guitar while then president of Argentina, [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] (sitting in front of him) and other people laugh (1984).]]\nBy the late 1960s, tango had become mostly \"for export\", since musicians and audiences were aging and making little progress from the orchestral format of the 1940s and 1950s. many tango fans rejected the music of [[\u00c1stor Piazzolla]] and his followers, but Rivero himself admired Piazzolla, and recorded his creations on more than one occasion. Even major artists had trouble finding venues to play.\n\nFearing for tango's viability, in 1969 Rivero opened ''El Viejo Almac\u00e9n'' (\"The old store\"), a tango club in the [[San Telmo]] district. His hospitality was enjoyed by many visitors to Buenos Aires, who went to Rivero's club to savor the tango music and dance in its full intensity. Among the recurring visitors were [[Joan Manuel Serrat]] and [[Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela]].\n\nRivero's place was a venue for tango, where musicians knew they'd be respected and paid on time. Famed tango lyricist [[Horacio Ferrer]] wrote a [[Milonga (music)|milonga]] about the ''almac\u00e9n'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928041010/http://www.elportaldeltango.com/indice/coplasde.htm] for which Rivero later composed the music, and took to calling Rivero by his forgotten first name, Leonel, a gesture that many friends would imitate.\n\nRivero was an icon in Japanese tango circles. He toured Japan in 1968, and got to know many Japanese musicians and dancers. Rivero composed \"Arigato Jap\u00f3n\" and \"A lo Megata\" (honoring Tsunayoshi \"Tsunami\" Megata, one of the top tango dancers of his age). Japanese tourists were a constant presence in Rivero's place.\n\nRivero hosted a TV show in the early seventies, which featured artists from the club (such as [[Beba Bidart]]), as well as lively dialog sprinkled with [[lunfardo]]. Some of his 1960s and 1970s reunions with Troilo and Grela were televised. In 1980, Rivero took part in [[Osvaldo Pugliese]]'s 75th birthday concert. In his later years, he delegated the day-to-day operation of the club to his son Edmundo (\"Muni\").\n\nRivero was hospitalized in late 1985, and died from heart failure on January 18, 1986, in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn February 2011 it was reported that many artifacts germane to Rivero's legacy were stolen from a warehouse in [[Ramos Mej\u00eda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/sucesos/robaron-herencia-cultural-edmundo-rivero|title=lavoz.com.ar|website=lavoz.com.ar|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Selected recordings==\n\n* ''Sur'' (perhaps the most popular tango in Argentina)\n* ''El ciruja'' (an underworld saga sprinkled with heavy doses of lunfardo)\n* ''Amablemente'' (a [[sonnet]] sung as a [[Milonga (music)|milonga]]\u2014the lyrics lead to a dramatic ending)\n* ''Pucherito de gallina''\n* ''No te enga\u00f1es coraz\u00f3n''\n* ''Mal\u00f3n de ausencia''\n* ''Yo te bendigo''\n* ''Fals\u00eda''\n* ''El \u00faltimo organito''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n{{Commonscat}}\n* {{Find a Grave|7007692}}\n* [http://www.todotango.com/english/creadores/erivero.asp Edmundo Rivero] on todotango.com\n* [https://tango.info/0000000080291995 Edmundo Rivero] on tango.info\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rivero, Edmundo}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1986 deaths]]\n[[Category:Argentine male singers]]\n[[Category:Argentine people of British descent]]\n[[Category:Tango singers]]\n[[Category:People from Buenos Aires Province]]\n[[Category:Burials at La Chacarita Cemetery]]\n[[Category:20th-century Argentine singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "name_user": "Strickesel", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed contractions found byWikipedia:Typo Team/moss\u2013 you can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmundo_Rivero"}

(British game show)|same-titled British program]] and developed for the United States by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program endured as one of the longest-running and most successful international variants in the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' franchise, running continuously in some form since 1999.\n\nThe original U.S. version premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 16, 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched on January 18, 2000 and ran until June 27, 2002. Philbin hosted the entire run of the original network series as well as three additional special event series that aired on ABC in 2004 and 2009. \n\nA daily version of ''Millionaire'' produced for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] began airing on September 16, 2002, and was initially hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. [[Cedric the Entertainer]] took over the show in 2013 following Vieira's departure, with [[Terry Crews]] replacing him in 2014. The syndicated series' final host was [[Chris Harrison]], who took over from Crews in 2015 and hosted until the show was ultimately cancelled, with the finale airing on May 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Otterson|first=Joe|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' to End After 17 Years in Syndication (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-canceled-1203217602/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 17, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref> \nOn January 8, 2020, seven months after the cancellation was announced, ABC renewed the show for a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|twenty-first season]] (consisting of eight episodes) that would be hosted by [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and feature celebrity contestants; the twenty-first season premiered on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-host-celebrity-driven-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-abc-1268004|title=Jimmy Kimmel to Host Celebrity-Driven 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' for ABC|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize, the show made television history by becoming one of the highest-rated game shows in the history of American television.

If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/> With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level.

Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if they answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone.

The participants would be confronted with one question and four answers, and they would have to set the four answers in the correct order (ascending, chronological, etc.) in the fastest time. The competitor who did so correctly in the fastest time would play. If nobody got the correct order, the round was played again, and when a tie breaker occurred, the remaining participants answered a second Fastest Finger question. This round was removed when the syndicated version began in 2002, though it returned in 2004 for Super Millionaire and in 2009 for the 10th Anniversary shows, in which it was removed again in the 2020 reboot. The format remained unchanged, except for changes to the money staircase and the addition of a new lifeline, until 2008. In the 2020 reboot, a new lifeline was added called \"Ask The Host\", in which the host, Jimmy Kimmel, gives the player the best possible answer and some advice.\n\n====Clock format (2008\u20132010)====\nIn 2008, the format was altered to include a time limit on each question. The amount of time for each question was as follows:\n* Questions 1\u20135 '''($500-$5,000):''' 15 seconds\n* Questions 6\u201310 '''($7,500-$25,000):''' 30 seconds\n* Questions 11\u201314 '''($50,000-$500,000):''' 45 seconds\n* Question 15 '''($1,000,000 question):''' 45 seconds, plus the total of all unused time from the previous 14 questions\n\nThe timer began to run as soon as the four answer options were revealed, and the contestant had to give a final answer before it reached 0. \n\nIf time ran out, the game ended and the contestant left with whatever money they had won to that point. If this happened while the Double Dip lifeline was in effect, the contestant's winnings were instead reduced to the last safe haven they had reached.\n\nWhile the clock format was in use, the contestant was shown the categories of all 15 questions in the order they would be asked.\n\n====Shuffle format (2010\u20132015)====\nThe format was overhauled in September 2010, splitting the game into two rounds. The first round consisted of 10 questions, each in a different category and worth a different amount from $100 to $25,000. Both the category order and the amounts were randomized at the start of the game, with the latter hidden from the contestant's view. The difficulty level and value of each question were not tied to one another. The value of each question was revealed only after the contestant answered it correctly or chose to \"jump\" (skip) it; a correct answer added the money to the contestant's bank, while a jump put the value out of play. The maximum bank from this round was $68,600. If the contestant missed a question in the first round, they left with $1,000, even if their bank was lower than this total. Choosing to stop allowed the contestant to keep half their bank.\n\nThe second round presented four questions of increasing difficulty in the traditional format, each of which augmented the contestant's total winnings to a set value. A miss in this round reduced their winnings to $25,000. Categories for these questions were not given ahead of time.\n\nFrom 2011\u20132014, some weeks were \"Double Your Money\" weeks, in which one first-round question was randomly designated as being worth double value. The maximum potential bank from this round thus became $93,600.\n\n====Final format (2015\u20132019)====\nWith the hiring of new host Chris Harrison, the format was changed once again to resemble that of the original ''Millionaire''. Each contestant faces 14 general-knowledge questions of increasing difficulty, with no time limit or information about the categories. Beginning in 2017, a contestant who missed any of the first five questions left with $1,000, even if the missed question was of a lower value.\n\n===Payout structure===\nFive different ladders have been used over the course of the series:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"|Question<br>number\n!colspan=\"5\"|Question value\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%\"|1999\u20132004, 2020\u2013\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2004\u201309\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2009\u201310\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2010\u201315<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\"/>\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2015\u201319\n|-\n|1\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100\n|$500\n| rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>Random values</small><br>$100, $500, $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000, $15,000, and $25,000\n|$500\n|-\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$200\n|$1,000\n|$1,000\n|-\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$300\n|$2,000\n|$2,000\n|-\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500\n|$3,000\n|$3,000\n|-\n|5\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|-\n|6\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$2,000\n|$7,500\n|$7,000\n|-\n|7\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4,000\n|$10,000\n|$10,000\n|-\n|8\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$8,000\n|$12,500\n|$20,000\n|-\n|9\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$16,000\n|$15,000\n|$30,000\n|-\n|10\n|'''$32,000'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$25,000'''\n|'''$50,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|$64,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$50,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n|-\n|12\n|$125,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n|-\n|13\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n|-\n|14\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|-\n|15\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|  colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c9cac8;\"|\n|}\n\nThe $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were initially lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication.

Multiple lifelines may be used on a single question, but each one can only be used once per game (unless otherwise noted below). Three lifelines are available from the start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock while the lifelines are played.\n*'''+1''' (2014\u20132019): The contestant may invite a friend onstage from the audience to assist with the current question. After the question result, the friend must return to the audience.\n*'''50:50''' (1999\u20132008, 2015\u20132019; 2020): Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.\n*'''Ask the Audience''' (1999\u20132019): The audience members individually use four-button keypads to register the answer they believe is correct. The percentage of votes for each answer is immediately shown to the host, contestant, and home viewer. Beginning in 2004 and ending a few years later, [[AIM (software)|AIM]] users who added the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and were online were able to receive and register answers they believed to be correct to Ask the Audience questions in real-time; these results were then shown as a separate chart to the contestant.<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/buena-vista-aol-make-millionaire-interactive-74453/</ref> \n*'''Ask the Expert''' (2008\u20132010): Based on Three Wise Men, the lifeline was earned after answering five questions correctly until 2010, when it was given to the contestant immediately following the removal of Phone a Friend. The contestant was connected to an expert via a video call via [[Skype]], and the two could discuss the question with no time limit.\n*'''Ask the Host''' (2020): Introduced during the 2020 season, this lifeline allows the contestant to ask for the host's advice on the current question and give the best possible answer.\n*'''Crystal Ball''' (2012\u20132015): Used occasionally during the \"shuffle\" round, this lifeline allowed the contestant to see the value of the current question before either answering or jumping it (if Jump the Question had not yet been used).\n*'''Double Dip''' (2004, 2008\u20132010): First used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed a contestant to make a second guess at the answer if his/her first one was wrong. The contestant had to invoke the lifeline before making the first guess, and it was removed from play regardless of which guess was correct. In addition, the contestant could not walk away from the question after invoking the lifeline. It was introduced to the main series in 2008, replacing 50:50.\n*'''Jump the Question''' (2010\u20132015): This lifeline allowed the contestant to skip the current question, but the money associated with it was removed from play. It could be used twice per game from 2010\u20132014, but only once from 2014\u20132015.\n*'''Phone a Friend''' (1999\u20132010; 2020): The contestant called a pre-arranged friend (via [[AT&T]] in ABC airings, except for ''Super Millionaire'' airings, until 2009) and was then given 30 seconds to discuss the question with that person. In 2010, this lifeline was eliminated due to an increasing use of search engines by home viewers to look up answers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Matt |title=How Google Killed \"Phone A Friend\" From \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" |url=https://searchengineland.com/how-google-killed-phone-a-friend-52624 |website=Search Engine Land |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Switch/Cut the Question''' (2004\u20132008): Earned after answering 10 questions, this lifeline allowed a contestant to discard the current question and replace it with one of the same value. It has been used occasionally during Whiz Kids Week in the current version and is available from the outset.\n*'''Three Wise Men''' (2004): Used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed the contestant 30 seconds of advice from a panel of three experts, who were sequestered backstage and saw the question only when their help was requested.\n* The 2020 season features a lifeline similar to +1. This lifeline is offered to the contestant after the tenth question and allows them to consult with their accompanying supporter one time during the final five questions. However, in order to obtain this lifeline, the contestant must exchange one of his or her other remaining lifelines. (The contestant has unlimited access to their supporter for the first ten questions.)\n\n===Top prize winners===\nOver the course of the program's history, twelve people answered the final question correctly and walked away with the top prize:  \n*[[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]] \u2013 Became the first winner of the top prize on November 19, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taxman scoops a million|work=BBC News|date=November 21, 1999 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/529186.stm|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=PeopleMillionaires>{{cite magazine |url=http://people.com/archive/millionaire-makeovers-vol-54-no-20/|title=Millionaire Makeovers!|work=People|publisher=Time Inc.|volume=54 |number=20|date=November 13, 2000|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref>\n*Dan Blonsky \u2013 Won on January 18, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Joe Trela \u2013 Won on  March 23, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Bob House \u2013 Won on June 13, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Kim Hunt \u2013 Won on July 6, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*David Goodman \u2013 Won on July 11, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Kevin Olmstead \u2013 Won the top prize on April 10, 2001; however, because of the jackpot having been set to increase by $10,000 each episode, he won $2,180,000 \u2013 making him the biggest winner in television history at the time.<ref name=Jackpot>{{cite news|title=Double jackpot winner on US Millionaire|work=BBC News|date=April 11, 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1271553.stm|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*Bernie Cullen \u2013 Won the top prize just five days after Olmstead's win on April 15, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2001/04/16/improbably-millionaire-strikes-again/ |title=Improbably, ''Millionaire'' Strikes Again|work=[[New York Post]]|last=Kaplan|first=Don|date=April 16, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref>\n*Ed Toutant \u2013 Won on September 7, 2001.

Having earlier created ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]'' for [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'' for [[Comedy Central]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nDavies originally considered reviving [[CBS]]'s long-lost quiz show ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'', with a new home on ABC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Official Book from the Hit TV Show|last1=Davies|first1=Michael|year=2000|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9780786885770|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14}}</ref> However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British ''Millionaire'' was about to make its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight [[FedEx]] packages from different family members, each containing a copy of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host [[Chris Tarrant]]'s intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the ''$64,000 Question'' revival in favor of introducing ''Millionaire'' to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on ''Millionaire''{{'}}s production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. ''Millionaire'' during its development, including [[Peter Jennings]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> [[Bob Costas]], [[Phil Donahue]], and [[Montel Williams]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msDfDRx6OK4C&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=Bob+Costas,+Phil+Donahue,+and+Montel+Williams,&source=bl&ots=vhUiVfMMVj&sig=ZbvvC89-UDTTvoO46tsqQS3lq98&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje_J3qgffYAhWNyVMKHQl9AIEQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Costas%2C%20Phil%20Donahue%2C%20and%20Montel%20Williams%2C&f=false|title=Regis!: The Unauthorized Biography|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|publisher=ECW Press|page=147|isbn=9781550224399|year=2000}}</ref> but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British ''Millionaire'' and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show.<ref name=\"Furman & Furman\"/> When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Audition process===\nWith few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who was 18 years of age or older had the potential of becoming a contestant through ''Millionaire''{{'}}s audition process. Those ineligible included employees, immediate family or household members, and close acquaintances of SPE, Disney, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production, administration, or judging of the show. Also ineligible were candidates for political office and individuals who had appeared on a different game show outside of cable that had been broadcast within the past year, was intended to be broadcast within the next year, or had played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of ''Millionaire'' itself.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nPotential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method.{{refn|To qualify for 2004's ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off, potential contestants were required to answer five questions. Each person who successfully answered all five questions chose one tape date, and the contestants for that tape date were drawn from that pool.|group=note}} Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.\n\nThe syndicated version's potential contestants, depending on tryouts, were required to pass an electronically scored test<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |title=Be a Contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire |last=Grosvenor |first=Carrie |publisher=about.com |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113020940/http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> comprising a set of thirty questions which had to be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who failed the test were eliminated, while those who passed were interviewed for an audition by the production staff,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/television/2003638513_tvgameshowaudition28.html|title=Who wants to be a game-show contestant?|first=Claudia|last=Perry|date=March 28, 2007|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> and those who impressed the staff the most were then notified by postal mail that they had been placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool were selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants were given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they met all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they were given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version did not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants were instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nThe syndicated ''Millionaire'' also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants. These are held in late spring or early summer, with all dates and locations posted on the show's official website. The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue;<ref name=\"About.com\"/> however, the show will not test any more than 2,500 individuals per audition day.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nIn cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team, auditions for these episodes' contestants are announced on the show's website. Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection. If only one member of the team passes, he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed.<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n===Music===\nOriginally, the U.S. ''Millionaire'' carried over the musical score from the British version, composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. Unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] took some inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'',<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and their question cues from the $2,000 to the $32,000/$25,000 level, and then from the $64,000/$50,000 to $500,000 level, took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> On GSN's ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder, the music was \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nThe original ''Millionaire'' musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], as the Strachans were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s basic set was a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by [[Andy Walmsley]]. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' required that the show's set design, along with all other elements of the show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's ''Millionaire'' set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> The original version of the U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set cost $200,000 to construct.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Production designer|production design]] was handled at different times by David Weller, Jim Fenhagen and George Allison.<ref name=\"Production credits\"/>\n\nUnlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage, known as \"Hot Seats\"; these measured {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, were modeled after chairs typically found in [[hair salon]]s,<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to ''Millionaire'', Vieira stated in an interview with her ''Millionaire'' predecessor on [[Live with Kelly and Michael|his morning talk show]] that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\">{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|airdate=September 15, 2010|network=Syndicated|credits=Disney-ABC Domestic Television}}</ref>\n\nThe lighting system was programmed to darken the set as the contestant progressed further into the game. There were also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoomed down on the contestant when they answered a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil was vaporized, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the shuffle format was introduced, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium, so that the contestant and host stood throughout the game and were also able to walk around the stage.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\"/> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displayed the current question in play, and another that displayed the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year.

Despite the ratings struggles of the network edition, there was still enough interest in ''Millionaire'' as a series that enough stations signed on for a fall 2002 launch; the original idea for the syndicated series to serve as an accompaniment to the network series did not come to fruition, as intended, due to ABC's decision to cancel ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"weekday millionaire\"/><ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> \n\nOn September 16, 2002, nearly three months after the network ''Millionaire'' ended its run, the syndicated series premiered. Right away, it found itself having similar ratings issues. Some stations began to look for other options to place in the slots where they had initially plugged ''Millionaire''; this included several larger market stations, especially their largest market affiliate, and thus ''Millionaire'' was looking at a second cancellation notice in less than a year. As fate would have it, though, this turn of events happened to coincide with a significant one going on at two of BVT's corporate siblings.\n\nWhen BVT initially sold ''Millionaire'' into syndication, the largest market station to come on board was [[WCBS-TV]] in New York, the flagship of the [[CBS]] network. Looking to bolster its offerings in the two hours between the end of CBS' daytime schedule and its first evening newscast of the day, which had been an ongoing problem for the station for years, ''Millionaire'' was one of two major additions to WCBS' lineup for the 2002\u20132003 season. The station gave it the 4 pm weekday timeslot that had housed ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/20/arts/tv-notes-games-to-clash-on-syndication.html|title=TV Notes: Games to Clash on Syndication|work=The New York Times|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-hoagtest01/dr-phil-millionaire-john-walsh-arrive-heat-factor-lacking/52202/|title='Dr. Phil,' 'Millionaire,' 'John Walsh' arrive, but heat factor is lacking|magazine=Advertising Age|last=Pendleton|first=Jennifer|date=May 13, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> a syndicated version of another network primetime quiz show (in this case, produced by NBC) that had launched in January 2002.\n\nThe timeslot, at the time, was a fairly competitive one. [[WABC-TV]] had been airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which had consistently been the most popular daytime talk show, there since September 1986. [[WNBC]] at the time carried ''[[Judge Judy]]'', which was the second-highest rated program in daytime syndication behind ''Oprah''. ''Millionaire'' was unable to cut into the audience for either program, despite having the other major WCBS acquisition, the talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', as its lead in. WCBS again decided to switch its lineup.\n\nIn April 2003, with the season in its final weeks, WCBS announced its addition of ''[[The People's Court]]'' to its lineup for fall 2003 after the revived series had aired since its 1997 debut on WNBC.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> WCBS announced that ''The People's Court'' would be airing at 4:00 pm once it joined the station's lineup, which meant that ''Millionaire'' would be forced out of the timeslot after one year. BVT tried to negotiate with WCBS for another timeslot but the station had other obligations and thus could not accommodate them. There was not much in the way of open time slots on any of the other New York stations either, as they had other obligations in daytime and nighttime fringe slots, and BVT was in a position that could have seen ''Millionaire'' be reduced to airing in a post-midnight period or another non-traditional time that syndicators try to avoid.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\">{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042435/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2014|title=''Millionaire'' poorer in N.Y.|url-access=subscription |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Highbeam Business|date=December 2, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, ABC was about to shake up its daytime schedule in a move made shortly after ''Millionaire'' concluded its season. The network had long programmed a thirty-minute serial at 12:30 pm, and since 1997 that time slot had belonged to ''[[Port Charles]]''. In July 2003, however, the network decided that it would be discontinuing the program after its contract to air it expired in October and, once that happened, the timeslot ''Port Charles'' had occupied would be given back to the affiliates to program as they wished. BVT decided to go to its parent company's flagship station and offered ''Millionaire'' to WABC as the replacement for ''Port Charles'', and the two sides agreed. Beginning in September 2003, ''Millionaire'' joined WABC's lineup and remained part of the station's lineup for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|title=''Millionaire'' nabs key slots in syndication|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 2, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907080505/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|archivedate=September 7, 2003}}</ref> ABC was impressed enough with the ratings improvement that the network, with one or two exceptions ([[WLS-TV]] in Chicago and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, though the latter would eventually add the series) picked up ''Millionaire'' for the other stations it owned.\n\nFollowing the 2014\u201315 season, ''Millionaire'' nearly was cancelled after a disagreement with BVT's successor, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], the owner of the  format rights through its subsidiary [[2waytraffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/local-listings/|title=Local Listings|publisher=Millionaire TV|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> According to e-mails released in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]], ''Millionaire'''s declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The two sides eventually agreed on terms for renewal, which included a return to the original question format (but with fourteen questions) and cuts to the production budget, which resulted in the series leaving New York for [[Stamford, Connecticut]] (although this had been done in 2014) and later moving to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anotado|first=Cory|url=http://www.buzzerblog.com/2015/06/29/millionaire-re-introduces-ladder-format-for-2015-season/|title=Millionaire re-introduces ladder format for 2015 season|work=Buzzerblog|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Had the show not been renewed, SPE was going to place the show on extended hiatus for three years, after which it would reclaim full rights to the show and be free to shop the revived show to another network or syndicator.

Various celebrities also made special guest appearances at the end of every episode; each guest played one question for a chance at $50,000 for a charity of their choice, being allowed to use any one of the four lifelines in place at the time (Phone-a-Friend, Ask the Audience, Double Dip, and Ask the Expert), but still earned a minimum of $25,000 for the charity if they answered the question incorrectly.<ref name=\"accesshollywood.com\"/>\n\nOn August 18, 2009, New York City resident [[Nik Bonaddio]] appeared on the program, winning $100,000 with the help of the audience and later, [[Gwen Ifill]] as his lifelines.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 10th Anniversary Celebration|network=ABC|date=August 18, 2009|number=6}}</ref> Bonaddio then used the proceeds to start the sports analytics firm [[numberFire]],<ref name=\"fastcompany.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1824128/numberfire-moneyball-fantasy-leagues|title=numberFire: ''Moneyball'' for Fantasy Football Leagues|publisher=FastCompany.com|accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref> which was sold in September 2015 to [[FanDuel]], a fantasy sports platform.\n{{WWTBAM question\n| float    = right\n| value    = $1,000,000 (15 of 15) \u2013 4:39 time limit\n| question = For ordering his favorite beverages on demand, LBJ had four buttons installed in the Oval Office labeled \"coffee\", \"tea\", \"Coke\" and what?\n| a        = Fresca\n| b        = V8\n| c        = Yoo-hoo\n| d        = A&W\n| astyle   = correct\n| bstyle   = \n| cstyle   = chosen\n| dstyle   = \n| caption  = Ken Basin's million-dollar question\n}}\nThe finale of the tenth anniversary special, which aired on August 23, 2009, featured Ken Basin, an entertainment lawyer from Los Angeles, California, who went on to become the first contestant to play a $1,000,000 question in the \"clock format\". With a time of 4:39 (45 seconds + 3:54 banked time), Basin was given a question involving President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]]'s fondness for [[Fresca]]. Using his one remaining lifeline, Basin asked the audience, which supported his own hunch of [[Yoo-hoo]] rather than the correct answer. He decided to answer the question and lost $475,000, becoming the first contestant in the U.S. version to answer a $1,000,000 question incorrectly.

Deciding that six-plus years had been too long since someone had won the top prize, producers conducted a tournament to find a third million dollar winner.<ref>{{Cite episode|season=8|number=1|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|network=Syndicated|date=September 7, 2009}}</ref> For the first nine weeks of the 2009\u201310 season, each episode saw contestants attempt to qualify for what was referred to as the \"Tournament of Ten\". Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.<ref name=\"Tournament\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Tournament of Ten |publisher=about.com |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113062329/http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe tournament began on the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nEach contestant had the same decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nThe first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the [[Blorenge]], cited as \"a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange\". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in [[Wales]]. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.<ref name=\"Murray millionaire\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSince its introduction to the United States, GSN credited ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the highest-rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history, and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the primetime reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=\"Far from\"/>\n\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire'' also made catchphrases out of various lines used on the show. In particular, ''\"Is that your final answer?\"'', asked by ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hosts whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified, was popularized by Philbin during his tenure as host,<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> and was also included on [[TV Land]]'s special \"100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases\", which aired in 2006.<ref>The Star Ledger.

This game featured an altered version of the shuffle format, condensing the number of questions to twelve\u2014eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire now on Facebook: Compete with others for virtual riches|url=https://www.aol.com/article/2011/04/07/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-now-on-facebook-compete-with-othe/19906686/|last=Shaul|first=Brandy|publisher=AOL|date=April 7, 2011|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043122/https://www.aol.com/article/2011/04/07/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-now-on-facebook-compete-with-othe/19906686/|archivedate=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Album===\nWho Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Album (Celador Records), by [[Keith Strachan]], [[Matthew Strachan]], and various artists, was released August 1, 2000 and features songs based on the show.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keith Strachan & Matthew Strachan \u2013 Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (The Album) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Keith-Strachan-Matthew-Strachan-Who-Wants-To-Be-A-Millionaire-The-Album/release/3958022 |website=Discogs |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!}}\n[[File:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Play It!

Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a Fastest Finger question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help.

(British game show)|same-titled British program]] and developed for the United States by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program endured as one of the longest-running and most successful international variants in the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' franchise, running continuously in some form since 1999.\n\nThe original U.S. version premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 16, 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched on January 18, 2000 and ran until June 27, 2002. Philbin hosted the entire run of the original network series as well as three additional special event series that aired on ABC in 2004 and 2009. \n\nA daily version of ''Millionaire'' produced for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] began airing on September 16, 2002, and was initially hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. [[Cedric the Entertainer]] took over the show in 2013 following Vieira's departure, with [[Terry Crews]] replacing him in 2014. The syndicated series' final host was [[Chris Harrison]], who took over from Crews in 2015 and hosted until the show was ultimately cancelled, with the finale airing on May 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Otterson|first=Joe|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' to End After 17 Years in Syndication (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-canceled-1203217602/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 17, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref> \nOn January 8, 2020, seven months after the cancellation was announced, ABC renewed the show for a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|twenty-first season]] (consisting of eight episodes) that would be hosted by [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and feature celebrity contestants; the twenty-first season premiered on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-host-celebrity-driven-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-abc-1268004|title=Jimmy Kimmel to Host Celebrity-Driven 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' for ABC|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize, the show made television history by becoming one of the highest-rated game shows in the history of American television.

If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/> With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if they answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In the shuffle format, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite press release|url= https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/syndicated-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-premieres-new-season-september-13/|title=Syndicated ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Premieres New Season September 13|author= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Format history ===\n==== Original format (1999\u20132008; since 2020) ====\nFrom 1999 to 2002, 10 contestants played a round of Fastest Finger to determine who would play in the hot seat. The participants would be confronted with one question and four answers, and they would have to set the four answers in the correct order (ascending, chronological, etc.) in the fastest time. The competitor who did so correctly in the fastest time would play. If nobody got the correct order, the round was played again, and when a tie breaker occurred, the remaining participants answered a second Fastest Finger question. This round was removed when the syndicated version began in 2002, though it returned in 2004 for Super Millionaire and in 2009 for the 10th Anniversary shows, in which it was removed again in the 2020 reboot. The format remained unchanged, except for changes to the money staircase and the addition of a new lifeline, until 2008. In the 2020 reboot, a new lifeline was added called \"Ask The Host\", in which the host, Jimmy Kimmel, gives the player the best possible answer and some advice.\n\n====Clock format (2008\u20132010)====\nIn 2008, the format was altered to include a time limit on each question. The amount of time for each question was as follows:\n* Questions 1\u20135 '''($500-$5,000):''' 15 seconds\n* Questions 6\u201310 '''($7,500-$25,000):''' 30 seconds\n* Questions 11\u201314 '''($50,000-$500,000):''' 45 seconds\n* Question 15 '''($1,000,000 question):''' 45 seconds, plus the total of all unused time from the previous 14 questions\n\nThe timer began to run as soon as the four answer options were revealed, and the contestant had to give a final answer before it reached 0. \n\nIf time ran out, the game ended and the contestant left with whatever money they had won to that point. If this happened while the Double Dip lifeline was in effect, the contestant's winnings were instead reduced to the last safe haven they had reached.\n\nWhile the clock format was in use, the contestant was shown the categories of all 15 questions in the order they would be asked.\n\n====Shuffle format (2010\u20132015)====\nThe format was overhauled in September 2010, splitting the game into two rounds. The first round consisted of 10 questions, each in a different category and worth a different amount from $100 to $25,000. Both the category order and the amounts were randomized at the start of the game, with the latter hidden from the contestant's view. The difficulty level and value of each question were not tied to one another. The value of each question was revealed only after the contestant answered it correctly or chose to \"jump\" (skip) it; a correct answer added the money to the contestant's bank, while a jump put the value out of play. The maximum bank from this round was $68,600. If the contestant missed a question in the first round, they left with $1,000, even if their bank was lower than this total. Choosing to stop allowed the contestant to keep half their bank.\n\nThe second round presented four questions of increasing difficulty in the traditional format, each of which augmented the contestant's total winnings to a set value. A miss in this round reduced their winnings to $25,000. Categories for these questions were not given ahead of time.\n\nFrom 2011\u20132014, some weeks were \"Double Your Money\" weeks, in which one first-round question was randomly designated as being worth double value. The maximum potential bank from this round thus became $93,600.\n\n====Final format (2015\u20132019)====\nWith the hiring of new host Chris Harrison, the format was changed once again to resemble that of the original ''Millionaire''. Each contestant faces 14 general-knowledge questions of increasing difficulty, with no time limit or information about the categories. Beginning in 2017, a contestant who missed any of the first five questions left with $1,000, even if the missed question was of a lower value.\n\n===Payout structure===\nFive different ladders have been used over the course of the series:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"|Question<br>number\n!colspan=\"5\"|Question value\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%\"|1999\u20132004, 2020\u2013\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2004\u201309\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2009\u201310\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2010\u201315<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\"/>\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2015\u201319\n|-\n|1\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100\n|$500\n| rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>Random values</small><br>$100, $500, $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000, $15,000, and $25,000\n|$500\n|-\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$200\n|$1,000\n|$1,000\n|-\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$300\n|$2,000\n|$2,000\n|-\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500\n|$3,000\n|$3,000\n|-\n|5\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|-\n|6\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$2,000\n|$7,500\n|$7,000\n|-\n|7\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4,000\n|$10,000\n|$10,000\n|-\n|8\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$8,000\n|$12,500\n|$20,000\n|-\n|9\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$16,000\n|$15,000\n|$30,000\n|-\n|10\n|'''$32,000'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$25,000'''\n|'''$50,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|$64,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$50,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n|-\n|12\n|$125,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n|-\n|13\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n|-\n|14\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|-\n|15\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|  colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c9cac8;\"|\n|}\n\nThe $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were initially lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication. Contestants winning either of these prizes receive $250,000 thirty days after their show broadcasts and the remainder paid in equal annual payments. The $500,000 prize consists of $25,000 per year for 10 years, while the $1,000,000 prize consists of $37,500 per year for 20 years, all less taxes.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nFrom 2017\u20132019, contestants who answered one of the first five questions incorrectly received a $1,000 consolation prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Official Rules (Archive)|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|accessdate=24 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629022556/http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|archivedate=June 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On the original primetime version and in earlier seasons of the syndicated version prior to 2010, contestants who missed one of the first five questions left with no winnings.\n\n===Lifelines===\nForms of assistance known as \"lifelines\" are available for a contestant to use if a question proves difficult. Multiple lifelines may be used on a single question, but each one can only be used once per game (unless otherwise noted below). Three lifelines are available from the start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock while the lifelines are played.\n*'''+1''' (2014\u20132019): The contestant may invite a friend onstage from the audience to assist with the current question. After the question result, the friend must return to the audience.\n*'''50:50''' (1999\u20132008, 2015\u20132019; 2020): Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.\n*'''Ask the Audience''' (1999\u20132019): The audience members individually use four-button keypads to register the answer they believe is correct. The percentage of votes for each answer is immediately shown to the host, contestant, and home viewer. Beginning in 2004 and ending a few years later, [[AIM (software)|AIM]] users who added the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and were online were able to receive and register answers they believed to be correct to Ask the Audience questions in real-time; these results were then shown as a separate chart to the contestant.<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/buena-vista-aol-make-millionaire-interactive-74453/</ref> \n*'''Ask the Expert''' (2008\u20132010): Based on Three Wise Men, the lifeline was earned after answering five questions correctly until 2010, when it was given to the contestant immediately following the removal of Phone a Friend. The contestant was connected to an expert via a video call via [[Skype]], and the two could discuss the question with no time limit.\n*'''Ask the Host''' (2020): Introduced during the 2020 season, this lifeline allows the contestant to ask for the host's advice on the current question and give the best possible answer.\n*'''Crystal Ball''' (2012\u20132015): Used occasionally during the \"shuffle\" round, this lifeline allowed the contestant to see the value of the current question before either answering or jumping it (if Jump the Question had not yet been used).\n*'''Double Dip''' (2004, 2008\u20132010): First used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed a contestant to make a second guess at the answer if his/her first one was wrong. The contestant had to invoke the lifeline before making the first guess, and it was removed from play regardless of which guess was correct. In addition, the contestant could not walk away from the question after invoking the lifeline. It was introduced to the main series in 2008, replacing 50:50.\n*'''Jump the Question''' (2010\u20132015): This lifeline allowed the contestant to skip the current question, but the money associated with it was removed from play. It could be used twice per game from 2010\u20132014, but only once from 2014\u20132015.\n*'''Phone a Friend''' (1999\u20132010; 2020): The contestant called a pre-arranged friend (via [[AT&T]] in ABC airings, except for ''Super Millionaire'' airings, until 2009) and was then given 30 seconds to discuss the question with that person. In 2010, this lifeline was eliminated due to an increasing use of search engines by home viewers to look up answers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Matt |title=How Google Killed \"Phone A Friend\" From \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" |url=https://searchengineland.com/how-google-killed-phone-a-friend-52624 |website=Search Engine Land |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Switch/Cut the Question''' (2004\u20132008): Earned after answering 10 questions, this lifeline allowed a contestant to discard the current question and replace it with one of the same value. It has been used occasionally during Whiz Kids Week in the current version and is available from the outset.\n*'''Three Wise Men''' (2004): Used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed the contestant 30 seconds of advice from a panel of three experts, who were sequestered backstage and saw the question only when their help was requested.\n* The 2020 season features a lifeline similar to +1.

Having earlier created ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]'' for [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'' for [[Comedy Central]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nDavies originally considered reviving [[CBS]]'s long-lost quiz show ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'', with a new home on ABC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Official Book from the Hit TV Show|last1=Davies|first1=Michael|year=2000|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9780786885770|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14}}</ref> However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British ''Millionaire'' was about to make its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight [[FedEx]] packages from different family members, each containing a copy of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host [[Chris Tarrant]]'s intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the ''$64,000 Question'' revival in favor of introducing ''Millionaire'' to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on ''Millionaire''{{'}}s production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. ''Millionaire'' during its development, including [[Peter Jennings]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> [[Bob Costas]], [[Phil Donahue]], and [[Montel Williams]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msDfDRx6OK4C&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=Bob+Costas,+Phil+Donahue,+and+Montel+Williams,&source=bl&ots=vhUiVfMMVj&sig=ZbvvC89-UDTTvoO46tsqQS3lq98&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje_J3qgffYAhWNyVMKHQl9AIEQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Costas%2C%20Phil%20Donahue%2C%20and%20Montel%20Williams%2C&f=false|title=Regis!: The Unauthorized Biography|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|publisher=ECW Press|page=147|isbn=9781550224399|year=2000}}</ref> but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British ''Millionaire'' and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show.<ref name=\"Furman & Furman\"/> When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Audition process===\nWith few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who was 18 years of age or older had the potential of becoming a contestant through ''Millionaire''{{'}}s audition process. Those ineligible included employees, immediate family or household members, and close acquaintances of SPE, Disney, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production, administration, or judging of the show. Also ineligible were candidates for political office and individuals who had appeared on a different game show outside of cable that had been broadcast within the past year, was intended to be broadcast within the next year, or had played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of ''Millionaire'' itself.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nPotential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method.{{refn|To qualify for 2004's ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off, potential contestants were required to answer five questions. Each person who successfully answered all five questions chose one tape date, and the contestants for that tape date were drawn from that pool.|group=note}} Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.\n\nThe syndicated version's potential contestants, depending on tryouts, were required to pass an electronically scored test<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |title=Be a Contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire |last=Grosvenor |first=Carrie |publisher=about.com |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113020940/http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> comprising a set of thirty questions which had to be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who failed the test were eliminated, while those who passed were interviewed for an audition by the production staff,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/television/2003638513_tvgameshowaudition28.html|title=Who wants to be a game-show contestant?|first=Claudia|last=Perry|date=March 28, 2007|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> and those who impressed the staff the most were then notified by postal mail that they had been placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool were selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants were given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they met all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they were given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version did not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants were instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nThe syndicated ''Millionaire'' also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants. These are held in late spring or early summer, with all dates and locations posted on the show's official website. The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue;<ref name=\"About.com\"/> however, the show will not test any more than 2,500 individuals per audition day.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nIn cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team, auditions for these episodes' contestants are announced on the show's website. Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection. If only one member of the team passes, he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed.<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n===Music===\nOriginally, the U.S. ''Millionaire'' carried over the musical score from the British version, composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. Unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] took some inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'',<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and their question cues from the $2,000 to the $32,000/$25,000 level, and then from the $64,000/$50,000 to $500,000 level, took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> On GSN's ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder, the music was \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nThe original ''Millionaire'' musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], as the Strachans were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s basic set was a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by [[Andy Walmsley]]. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' required that the show's set design, along with all other elements of the show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's ''Millionaire'' set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> The original version of the U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set cost $200,000 to construct.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Production designer|production design]] was handled at different times by David Weller, Jim Fenhagen and George Allison.<ref name=\"Production credits\"/>\n\nUnlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage, known as \"Hot Seats\"; these measured {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, were modeled after chairs typically found in [[hair salon]]s,<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to ''Millionaire'', Vieira stated in an interview with her ''Millionaire'' predecessor on [[Live with Kelly and Michael|his morning talk show]] that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\">{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|airdate=September 15, 2010|network=Syndicated|credits=Disney-ABC Domestic Television}}</ref>\n\nThe lighting system was programmed to darken the set as the contestant progressed further into the game. There were also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoomed down on the contestant when they answered a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil was vaporized, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the shuffle format was introduced, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium, so that the contestant and host stood throughout the game and were also able to walk around the stage.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\"/> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displayed the current question in play, and another that displayed the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref name=\"New set\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 10, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\n===ABC===\nThe U.S. version of ''Millionaire'' was launched by ABC as a half-hour primetime program on August 16, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/broadcast/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-for-ten-year-anniversary/24432/|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Returns for its Ten Year Anniversary|work=[[TV By the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> When it premiered, it became the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize to contestants.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers by the end of the show's first week on the air, the program expanded to an hour-long format when it returned in November.<ref name=\"Far from\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/arts/television/09cart.html?pagewanted=all|title=''Millionaire'' Far From Its Final Answer|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref> The series, of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping, was promoted to regular status on January 18, 2000<ref>{{citation|title=Disney Factbook 2000 \u2013 Year in Review|author=Walt Disney Company|date=February 5, 2001|page=7}}</ref> and, at the height of its popularity, was airing on ABC five nights a week.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |title=\"ABC Hopes \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" Lightning Can Strike Twice\" |last=Bauder |first=David |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132904/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', ''[[Twenty One (game show)#2000|Twenty One]]'', etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as ''[[Winning Lines (American game show)|Winning Lines]]'', ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', and ''[[It's Your Chance of a Lifetime]]'').\n\nThe nighttime version initially drew in up to 30 million viewers a day three times a week, an unheard-of number in modern network television. In the 1999\u20132000 season, it averaged No. 1 in the ratings against all other television shows,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/recent_data/1999-00.html|title=TV Ratings 1999\u20132000|publisher=fbibler.chez.com|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> with 28,848,000 viewers.

Despite the ratings struggles of the network edition, there was still enough interest in ''Millionaire'' as a series that enough stations signed on for a fall 2002 launch; the original idea for the syndicated series to serve as an accompaniment to the network series did not come to fruition, as intended, due to ABC's decision to cancel ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"weekday millionaire\"/><ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> \n\nOn September 16, 2002, nearly three months after the network ''Millionaire'' ended its run, the syndicated series premiered. Right away, it found itself having similar ratings issues. Some stations began to look for other options to place in the slots where they had initially plugged ''Millionaire''; this included several larger market stations, especially their largest market affiliate, and thus ''Millionaire'' was looking at a second cancellation notice in less than a year. As fate would have it, though, this turn of events happened to coincide with a significant one going on at two of BVT's corporate siblings.\n\nWhen BVT initially sold ''Millionaire'' into syndication, the largest market station to come on board was [[WCBS-TV]] in New York, the flagship of the [[CBS]] network. Looking to bolster its offerings in the two hours between the end of CBS' daytime schedule and its first evening newscast of the day, which had been an ongoing problem for the station for years, ''Millionaire'' was one of two major additions to WCBS' lineup for the 2002\u20132003 season. The station gave it the 4 pm weekday timeslot that had housed ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/20/arts/tv-notes-games-to-clash-on-syndication.html|title=TV Notes: Games to Clash on Syndication|work=The New York Times|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-hoagtest01/dr-phil-millionaire-john-walsh-arrive-heat-factor-lacking/52202/|title='Dr. Phil,' 'Millionaire,' 'John Walsh' arrive, but heat factor is lacking|magazine=Advertising Age|last=Pendleton|first=Jennifer|date=May 13, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> a syndicated version of another network primetime quiz show (in this case, produced by NBC) that had launched in January 2002.\n\nThe timeslot, at the time, was a fairly competitive one. [[WABC-TV]] had been airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which had consistently been the most popular daytime talk show, there since September 1986. [[WNBC]] at the time carried ''[[Judge Judy]]'', which was the second-highest rated program in daytime syndication behind ''Oprah''. ''Millionaire'' was unable to cut into the audience for either program, despite having the other major WCBS acquisition, the talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', as its lead in. WCBS again decided to switch its lineup.\n\nIn April 2003, with the season in its final weeks, WCBS announced its addition of ''[[The People's Court]]'' to its lineup for fall 2003 after the revived series had aired since its 1997 debut on WNBC.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> WCBS announced that ''The People's Court'' would be airing at 4:00 pm once it joined the station's lineup, which meant that ''Millionaire'' would be forced out of the timeslot after one year. BVT tried to negotiate with WCBS for another timeslot but the station had other obligations and thus could not accommodate them. There was not much in the way of open time slots on any of the other New York stations either, as they had other obligations in daytime and nighttime fringe slots, and BVT was in a position that could have seen ''Millionaire'' be reduced to airing in a post-midnight period or another non-traditional time that syndicators try to avoid.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\">{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042435/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2014|title=''Millionaire'' poorer in N.Y.|url-access=subscription |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Highbeam Business|date=December 2, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, ABC was about to shake up its daytime schedule in a move made shortly after ''Millionaire'' concluded its season. The network had long programmed a thirty-minute serial at 12:30 pm, and since 1997 that time slot had belonged to ''[[Port Charles]]''. In July 2003, however, the network decided that it would be discontinuing the program after its contract to air it expired in October and, once that happened, the timeslot ''Port Charles'' had occupied would be given back to the affiliates to program as they wished. BVT decided to go to its parent company's flagship station and offered ''Millionaire'' to WABC as the replacement for ''Port Charles'', and the two sides agreed. Beginning in September 2003, ''Millionaire'' joined WABC's lineup and remained part of the station's lineup for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|title=''Millionaire'' nabs key slots in syndication|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 2, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907080505/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|archivedate=September 7, 2003}}</ref> ABC was impressed enough with the ratings improvement that the network, with one or two exceptions ([[WLS-TV]] in Chicago and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, though the latter would eventually add the series) picked up ''Millionaire'' for the other stations it owned.\n\nFollowing the 2014\u201315 season, ''Millionaire'' nearly was cancelled after a disagreement with BVT's successor, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], the owner of the  format rights through its subsidiary [[2waytraffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/local-listings/|title=Local Listings|publisher=Millionaire TV|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> According to e-mails released in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]], ''Millionaire'''s declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The two sides eventually agreed on terms for renewal, which included a return to the original question format (but with fourteen questions) and cuts to the production budget, which resulted in the series leaving New York for [[Stamford, Connecticut]] (although this had been done in 2014) and later moving to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anotado|first=Cory|url=http://www.buzzerblog.com/2015/06/29/millionaire-re-introduces-ladder-format-for-2015-season/|title=Millionaire re-introduces ladder format for 2015 season|work=Buzzerblog|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Had the show not been renewed, SPE was going to place the show on extended hiatus for three years, after which it would reclaim full rights to the show and be free to shop the revived show to another network or syndicator.

When ''FABlife'' failed to gain an audience and was cancelled at midseason, ''Millionaire'' was able to return to many of its former airing tines for 2016; beginning that year, ''Millionaire'' and the viral video show ''[[RightThisMinute]]'' began being sold as a package to ABC stations. \n\nOn January 17, 2017, it was announced that ''Millionaire'' has been renewed through 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lincoln|first1=Ross|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' & ''RightThisMinute'' Renewed For Syndication On ABC Stations Through 2018|url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/millionaire-rightthisminute-renewed-through-2018-on-abc-channels-1201884820/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=PMC|date=January 17, 2017|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref> Millionaire was subsequently renewed through the 2018\u201319 season on January 17, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/abc-renews-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-17th-season-1075368|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Renewed for 17th Season on ABC Stations|last=Sandberg|first=Bryn Elise|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 17, 2018|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs the seventeenth season progressed, the future of ''Millionaire'' became uncertain.

As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The questions for ''Super Millionaire'' were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and '''$10,000,000'''.\n\nContestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip.<ref name=SuperMillionaire/> The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts, one of whom was always a former ''Millionaire'' contestant and at least one of whom was female. When this lifeline was used, the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped. Double Dip gave a contestant two chances to answer a question. Once used, the contestant must answer the question without using any further lifelines; moreover, if the \"first final answer\" was incorrect, the contestant could ''not'' walk away. If the \"second final answer\" was also wrong, the contestant left with $100,000.\n\n===''10th Anniversary Celebration''===\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of ''Millionaire''{{'}}s U.S. debut, the show returned to ABC primetime for an eleven-night event hosted by Philbin, which aired from August 9 to 23, 2009.<ref name=\"accesshollywood.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-with-a-hollywood-makeover-74474/|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Returns With A Hollywood Makeover|publisher=AccessHollywood.com|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref> The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning movie ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 economic crisis]] helped boost interest of renewal of the game show.<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/>\n\nThe episodes featured game play based on the previous rule set of the syndicated version (including the rule changes implemented in season seven) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants.

Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.<ref name=\"Tournament\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Tournament of Ten |publisher=about.com |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113062329/http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe tournament began on the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nEach contestant had the same decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nThe first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the [[Blorenge]], cited as \"a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange\". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in [[Wales]]. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.<ref name=\"Murray millionaire\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSince its introduction to the United States, GSN credited ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set.

Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly.

Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a Fastest Finger question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a ''Millionaire'' CD game, to a 3-night [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney Cruise]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Winner?

Programming languages are used in [[computer programming]] to implement [[algorithm]]s.\n\nMost programming languages consist of [[Machine instruction|instructions]] for [[computer]]s. There are programmable machines that use a set of [[domain-specific language|specific instructions]], rather than [[General-purpose language|general programming languages]]. Early ones preceded the [[History of computing hardware|invention of the digital computer]], the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101|brothers Musa]] in [[Baghdad]], during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Koetsier | first = Teun | title = On the prehistory of programmable machines; musical automata, looms, calculators |journal= Mechanism and Machine Theory |volume=36 |issue=5 |date=May 2001 | pages = 589\u2013603 |doi=10.1016/S0094-114X(01)00005-2}}</ref> Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as [[Jacquard loom]]s, [[music box]]es and [[player piano]]s.<ref>Ettinger, James (2004) ''Jacquard's Web'', Oxford University Press</ref> The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.\n\nThousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an [[imperative programming|imperative]] form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the [[declarative programming|declarative]] form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).\n\nThe description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] (form) and [[semantics (computer science)|semantics]] (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language is specified by an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard) while other languages (such as [[Perl]]) have a dominant [[Programming language implementation|implementation]] that is treated as a [[reference implementation|reference]].

For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers: an \"opcode\" that selects the \"add\" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from [[punched card]]s, paper tape, [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] or toggled in on switches on the [[front panel]] of the computer.  Machine languages were later termed ''[[first-generation programming language]]s'' (1GL).\n\nThe next step was development of so-called ''[[second-generation programming language]]s'' (2GL) or [[assembly language]]s, which were still closely tied to the [[instruction set architecture]] of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.\n\nThe first ''[[high-level programming language]]s'', or ''[[third-generation programming language]]s'' (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was [[Plankalk\u00fcl]], developed for the German [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] by [[Konrad Zuse]] between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.<ref>\n[[Ra\u00fal Rojas|Rojas, Ra\u00fal]], et al. (2000). \"Plankalk\u00fcl: The First High-Level Programming Language and its Implementation\".

[[C++]] combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], a systems programming language derived from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called [[Fifth-generation programming language|\"fifth-generation\" languages]] that incorporated logic programming constructs.<ref>Tetsuro Fujise, Takashi Chikayama, Kazuaki Rokusawa, Akihiko Nakase (December 1994). \"KLIC: A Portable Implementation of KL1\" ''Proc. of FGCS '94, ICOT'' Tokyo, December 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925132105/http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |archivedate=25 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }} KLIC is a portable implementation of a concurrent logic programming language [[KL1]].</ref> The functional languages community moved to standardize [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.\n\nOne important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of ''modules'' or large-scale organizational units of code. [[Modula-2]], Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to [[generic programming]] constructs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Bender|url=http://readscheme.org/modules/|title=Mini-Bibliography on Modules for Functional Programming Languages|work=ReadScheme.org|accessdate=27 September 2006|date=15 March 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924085057/http://readscheme.org/modules/|archivedate=24 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rapid growth of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages. [[Perl]], originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic [[website]]s. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of \"[[Write once, run anywhere]]\" ([[UCSD Pascal]] had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel; rather, they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).\n\nProgramming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity ([[mixin]]s, [[Delegation (programming)|delegates]], [[aspect-oriented programming|aspects]]), and database integration such as Microsoft's [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]].\n\n''[[Fourth-generation programming language]]s'' (4GL) are computer programming languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs. ''[[Fifth-generation programming language]]s'' (5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an [[algorithm]] written by a programmer.\n\n==Elements==\nAll programming languages have some [[language primitive|primitive]] building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.\n\n===Syntax===\n{{Main|Syntax (programming languages)}}\n[[File:Python add5 parse.png|thumb|367px|[[Parse tree]] of [[Python (programming language)|Python code]] with inset tokenization]]\n[[File:Python add5 syntax.svg|thumb|292px|[[Syntax highlighting]] is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code. The language above is [[Python (programming language)|Python]].]]\nA programming language's surface form is known as its [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more [[visual programming language|graphical]] in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.\n\nThe syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either [[Formal semantics of programming languages|formal]] or hard-coded in a [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference implementation]]). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.\n\nProgramming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of [[regular expression]]s (for [[lexical analysis|lexical]] structure) and [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] (for [[context-free grammar|grammatical]] structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:\n<source lang=\"bnf\">\nexpression ::= atom | list\natom       ::= number | symbol\nnumber     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+\nsymbol     ::= ['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].*\nlist       ::= '(' expression* ')'\n</source>\n\nThis grammar specifies the following:\n* an ''expression'' is either an ''atom'' or a ''list'';\n* an ''atom'' is either a ''number'' or a ''symbol'';\n* a ''number'' is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;\n* a ''symbol'' is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and\n* a ''list'' is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more ''expressions'' inside it.\n\nThe following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: <code>12345</code>, <code>()</code> and <code>(a b c232 (1))</code>.\n\nNot all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit [[undefined behavior]]. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.\n\nUsing [[natural language]] as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:\n* \"[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]].\" is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.\n* \"John is a married bachelor.\" is grammatically [[well-formedness|well-formed]] but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.\n\nThe following [[C (programming language)|C language]] fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation <code>*p >> 4</code> has no meaning for a value having a complex type and <code>p->im</code> is not defined because the value of <code>p</code> is the [[null pointer]]):\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\ncomplex *p = NULL;\ncomplex abs_p = sqrt(*p >> 4 + p->im);\n</source>\n\nIf the [[type declaration]] on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable \"p\" during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.\n\nThe grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]]. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are [[context-free grammar]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Sipser|year=1996|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|publisher=PWS Publishing|isbn=978-0-534-94728-6 |authorlink=Michael Sipser|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}} Section 2.2: Pushdown Automata, pp.101\u2013114.</ref> Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase.

Examples include checking that every [[identifier]] is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a [[case statement]] are distinct.<ref>Michael Lee Scott, ''Programming language pragmatics'', Edition 2, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006, {{ISBN|0-12-633951-1}}, p. 18\u201319</ref> Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that [[subroutine]] calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a [[logic]] called a [[type system]]. Other forms of [[static code analysis|static analyses]] like [[data flow analysis]] may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have [[definite assignment analysis]], a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.\n\n====Dynamic semantics====\n{{main|Semantics of programming languages}}\nOnce data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the [[evaluation strategy|strategy]] by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which [[control flow|control structures]] conditionally execute [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. The ''dynamic semantics'' (also known as ''execution semantics'') of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into [[formal semantics of programming languages]], which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.\n\n===Type system===\n{{Main|Data type|Type system|Type safety}}\n\nA type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into ''types'', how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have ''type loopholes'', usually unchecked [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casts]] that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to [[type checking|type check]] programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, [[type inference|infer types]], relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as ''[[type theory]]''.\n\n====Typed versus untyped languages====\nA language is ''typed'' if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable.<ref name=\"typing\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|author=Andrew Cooke|title=Introduction To Computer Languages|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815140215/http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, the data represented by <code>\"this text between the quotes\"</code> is a [[String literal|string]], and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled (\"static\" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running (\"dynamic\" type checking), resulting in a run-time [[Exception handling|exception]]. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return \"-1\" as the result.\n\nA special case of typed languages are the ''single-typed'' languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as [[REXX]] or [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]], and have only one data type{{dubious|date=March 2018}}\u2013\u2014most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.\n\nIn contrast, an ''untyped language'', such as most [[assembly language]]s, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths.<ref name=\"typing\"/> High-level untyped languages include [[BCPL]], [[Tcl]], and some varieties of [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].\n\nIn practice, while few languages are considered typed from the [[type theory]] (verifying or rejecting all operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.<ref name=\"typing\"/> Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution (see [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casting]]).\n\n====Static versus dynamic typing====\nIn ''[[Type system|static typing]]'', all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.<ref name=\"typing\"/>\n\nStatically typed languages can be either ''[[Manifest typing|manifestly typed]]'' or ''[[Type inference|type-inferred]]''. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable [[declaration (computer science)|declarations]]). In the second case, the compiler ''infers'' the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] all infer types in certain limited cases.<ref>Specifically, instantiations of [[generic programming|generic]] types are inferred for certain expression forms. Type inference in Generic Java\u2014the research language that provided the basis for Java 1.5's bounded [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|parametric polymorphism]] extensions\u2014is discussed in two informal manuscripts from the Types mailing list: [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html Generic Java type inference is unsound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073839/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Alan Jeffrey]], 17 December 2001) and [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html Sound Generic Java type inference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073849/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Martin Odersky]], 15 January 2002). C#'s type system is similar to Java's, and uses a similar partial type inference scheme.</ref> Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.\n\n''[[Type system|Dynamic typing]]'', also called ''latent typing'', determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with ''run-time values'' rather than ''textual expressions''.<ref name=\"typing\"/> As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type [[Software bug|errors]] cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making [[debugging]] more difficult. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] are all examples of dynamically typed languages.\n\n====Weak and strong typing====\n''[[Weak typing]]'' allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a [[String (computer science)|string]] as a number.<ref name=\"typing\"/> This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at [[compile time]] and even at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].\n\n''[[Strongly typed programming language|Strong typing]]'' prevents these program faults. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error.<ref name=\"typing\"/> Strongly typed languages are often termed ''type-safe'' or ''[[type safety|safe]]''.\n\nAn alternative definition for \"weakly typed\" refers to languages, such as [[Perl]] and [[JavaScript]], which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression <code>2 * x</code> implicitly converts <code>x</code> to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if <code>x</code> is <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, an <code>Array</code>, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.\n''Strong'' and ''static'' are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term ''strongly typed'' to mean ''strongly, statically typed'', or, even more confusingly, to mean simply ''statically typed''. Thus [[C (programming language)|C]] has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|title=Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme|date=20 February 1998|accessdate=9 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714212928/http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|title=On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism|author=[[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Peter Wegner]]|work=Manuscript (1985)|accessdate=9 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619072646/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|archivedate=19 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be \"weakly, statically typed\". However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the '''void*''' pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as <code>(int)</code> or <code>(char)</code>.\n\n===Standard library and run-time system===\n{{main|Standard library}}\n\nMost programming languages have an associated core [[Library (computing)|library]] (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.\n\nThe line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a string literal is defined as an instance of the <code>java.lang.String</code> class; similarly, in [[Smalltalk]], an [[anonymous function]] expression (a \"block\") constructs an instance of the library's <code>BlockContext</code> class. Conversely, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.\n\n==Design and implementation==\nProgramming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing ''language families'' of related languages branching one from another.<ref name=\"Fischer\">Steven R.

While [[constructed languages]] are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.\n\nMany programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one \"universal\" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role.<ref>IBM in first publishing PL/I, for example, rather ambitiously titled its manual ''The universal programming language PL/I'' (IBM Library; 1966). The title reflected IBM's goals for unlimited subsetting capability: \"PL/I is designed in such a way that one can isolate subsets from it satisfying the requirements of particular applications.\" ({{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL/I&oldid=19175|title=PL/I|work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=29 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010947/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL%2FI&oldid=19175|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}). [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[UNCOL]] had similar early goals.</ref> The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:\n* Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of [[programmer]]s.\n* Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.\n* Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.\n* Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.\n* Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.\n\nOne common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit.<ref>Frederick P.

While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in [[natural language]] (e.g., as in the [[C (programming language)|C language]]), or a [[formal semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]] (e.g., as in [[Standard ML]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Milner|first=R.|authorlink=Robin Milner |author2=[[Mads Tofte|M.

The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.\n\n===Implementation===\n{{Main|Programming language implementation}}\n\nAn ''implementation'' of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: ''[[compiler|compilation]]'' and ''[[interpreter (computing)|interpretation]]''. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.\n\nThe output of a [[compiler]] may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of [[BASIC]] compile and then execute the source a line at a time.\n\nPrograms that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Code complete|last=Steve|first=McConnell|isbn=0735619670|edition=Second|location=Redmond, Washington|oclc=54974573|pages=[https://archive.org/details/codecomplete0000mcco/page/590 590, 600]|url=https://archive.org/details/codecomplete0000mcco/page/590}}</ref>{{better source|date=March 2019}}\n\nOne technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is [[just-in-time compilation]]. Here the [[virtual machine]], just before execution, translates the blocks of [[bytecode]] which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware.\n\n==Proprietary languages==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n\nAlthough most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly [[domain specific language]]s or internal [[scripting language]]s for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.\n\nSome programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, [[Oracle Corporation]] asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the [[Java programming language]],<ref>See: [[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]</ref> and [[Microsoft]]'s [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR) as a closed environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerscience.org/resources/computer-programming-languages/|title=Guide to Programming Languages {{!}} ComputerScience.org|work=ComputerScience.org|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMany proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include [[MATLAB]], [[VBScript]], and [[Wolfram Language]].

When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers \"do exactly what they are told to do\", and cannot \"understand\" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using [[pseudocode]], which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.\n\nA programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A [[programmer]] uses the [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called [[language primitive|primitives]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|title=Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|author=Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman|accessdate=3 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050622/http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|archivedate=26 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[Computer Programming|Programming]]'' is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.\n\nPrograms for a computer might be [[Execution (computing)|executed]] in a [[Batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction, or a user might type [[Command (computing)|commands]] in an [[Session (computer science)|interactive session]] of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

With languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new [[dialect]]. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a [[domain-specific language]], often a subset. In the [[Common Lisp|Lisp]] world, most languages that use basic [[S-expression]] syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] and [[Clojure]]. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The [[BASIC programming language]] has [[List of BASIC dialects|many dialects]].\n\nThe explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying \"If you've seen one Forth... you've seen ''one'' Forth.\"\n\n==Taxonomies==\n{{details|Categorical list of programming languages}}\nThere is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.\n\nThe task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] in parallel). [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is an object-oriented [[scripting language]].\n\nIn broad strokes, programming languages divide into ''[[programming paradigm]]s'' and a classification by ''intended domain of use,'' with [[general-purpose programming language]]s distinguished from [[domain-specific programming language]]s. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called [[imperative programming]] languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of [[declarative programming]].<ref>Carl A.

Many programming languages are written in an [[imperative programming|imperative]] form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the [[declarative programming|declarative]] form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).\n\nThe description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] (form) and [[semantics (computer science)|semantics]] (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language is specified by an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard) while other languages (such as [[Perl]]) have a dominant [[Programming language implementation|implementation]] that is treated as a [[reference implementation|reference]].

For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers: an \"opcode\" that selects the \"add\" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from [[punched card]]s, paper tape, [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] or toggled in on switches on the [[front panel]] of the computer.  Machine languages were later termed ''[[first-generation programming language]]s'' (1GL).\n\nThe next step was development of so-called ''[[second-generation programming language]]s'' (2GL) or [[assembly language]]s, which were still closely tied to the [[instruction set architecture]] of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.\n\nThe first ''[[high-level programming language]]s'', or ''[[third-generation programming language]]s'' (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was [[Plankalk\u00fcl]], developed for the German [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] by [[Konrad Zuse]] between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.<ref>\n[[Ra\u00fal Rojas|Rojas, Ra\u00fal]], et al. (2000). \"Plankalk\u00fcl: The First High-Level Programming Language and its Implementation\".

A. Brooker]] in 1954 and was called the \"Mark 1 Autocode\". Brooker also developed an autocode for the [[Ferranti Mercury]] in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the [[EDSAC|EDSAC 2]] was devised by [[David Hartley (computer scientist)|D. F. Hartley]] of [[University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory]] in 1961.

It was developed for the [[UNIVAC I]] at [[Remington Rand]] during the period from 1955 until 1959.

These are only a few of the thousands of programming languages and dialects that have been designed in history.]]\n\nThe 1980s were years of relative consolidation. [[C++]] combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], a systems programming language derived from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called [[Fifth-generation programming language|\"fifth-generation\" languages]] that incorporated logic programming constructs.<ref>Tetsuro Fujise, Takashi Chikayama, Kazuaki Rokusawa, Akihiko Nakase (December 1994). \"KLIC: A Portable Implementation of KL1\" ''Proc. of FGCS '94, ICOT'' Tokyo, December 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925132105/http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |archivedate=25 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }} KLIC is a portable implementation of a concurrent logic programming language [[KL1]].</ref> The functional languages community moved to standardize [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.\n\nOne important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of ''modules'' or large-scale organizational units of code. [[Modula-2]], Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to [[generic programming]] constructs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Bender|url=http://readscheme.org/modules/|title=Mini-Bibliography on Modules for Functional Programming Languages|work=ReadScheme.org|accessdate=27 September 2006|date=15 March 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924085057/http://readscheme.org/modules/|archivedate=24 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rapid growth of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages. [[Perl]], originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic [[website]]s. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of \"[[Write once, run anywhere]]\" ([[UCSD Pascal]] had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel; rather, they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).\n\nProgramming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity ([[mixin]]s, [[Delegation (programming)|delegates]], [[aspect-oriented programming|aspects]]), and database integration such as Microsoft's [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]].\n\n''[[Fourth-generation programming language]]s'' (4GL) are computer programming languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs. ''[[Fifth-generation programming language]]s'' (5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an [[algorithm]] written by a programmer.\n\n==Elements==\nAll programming languages have some [[language primitive|primitive]] building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.\n\n===Syntax===\n{{Main|Syntax (programming languages)}}\n[[File:Python add5 parse.png|thumb|367px|[[Parse tree]] of [[Python (programming language)|Python code]] with inset tokenization]]\n[[File:Python add5 syntax.svg|thumb|292px|[[Syntax highlighting]] is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code. The language above is [[Python (programming language)|Python]].]]\nA programming language's surface form is known as its [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more [[visual programming language|graphical]] in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.\n\nThe syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either [[Formal semantics of programming languages|formal]] or hard-coded in a [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference implementation]]). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.\n\nProgramming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of [[regular expression]]s (for [[lexical analysis|lexical]] structure) and [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] (for [[context-free grammar|grammatical]] structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:\n<source lang=\"bnf\">\nexpression ::= atom | list\natom       ::= number | symbol\nnumber     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+\nsymbol     ::= ['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].*\nlist       ::= '(' expression* ')'\n</source>\n\nThis grammar specifies the following:\n* an ''expression'' is either an ''atom'' or a ''list'';\n* an ''atom'' is either a ''number'' or a ''symbol'';\n* a ''number'' is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;\n* a ''symbol'' is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and\n* a ''list'' is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more ''expressions'' inside it.\n\nThe following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: <code>12345</code>, <code>()</code> and <code>(a b c232 (1))</code>.\n\nNot all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit [[undefined behavior]]. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.\n\nUsing [[natural language]] as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:\n* \"[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]].\" is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.\n* \"John is a married bachelor.\" is grammatically [[well-formedness|well-formed]] but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.\n\nThe following [[C (programming language)|C language]] fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation <code>*p >> 4</code> has no meaning for a value having a complex type and <code>p->im</code> is not defined because the value of <code>p</code> is the [[null pointer]]):\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\ncomplex *p = NULL;\ncomplex abs_p = sqrt(*p >> 4 + p->im);\n</source>\n\nIf the [[type declaration]] on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable \"p\" during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.\n\nThe grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]]. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are [[context-free grammar]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Sipser|year=1996|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|publisher=PWS Publishing|isbn=978-0-534-94728-6 |authorlink=Michael Sipser|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}} Section 2.2: Pushdown Automata, pp.101\u2013114.</ref> Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase.

Examples include checking that every [[identifier]] is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a [[case statement]] are distinct.<ref>Michael Lee Scott, ''Programming language pragmatics'', Edition 2, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006, {{ISBN|0-12-633951-1}}, p. 18\u201319</ref> Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that [[subroutine]] calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a [[logic]] called a [[type system]]. Other forms of [[static code analysis|static analyses]] like [[data flow analysis]] may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have [[definite assignment analysis]], a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.\n\n====Dynamic semantics====\n{{main|Semantics of programming languages}}\nOnce data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the [[evaluation strategy|strategy]] by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which [[control flow|control structures]] conditionally execute [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. The ''dynamic semantics'' (also known as ''execution semantics'') of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into [[formal semantics of programming languages]], which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.\n\n===Type system===\n{{Main|Data type|Type system|Type safety}}\n\nA type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into ''types'', how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have ''type loopholes'', usually unchecked [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casts]] that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to [[type checking|type check]] programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, [[type inference|infer types]], relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as ''[[type theory]]''.\n\n====Typed versus untyped languages====\nA language is ''typed'' if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable.<ref name=\"typing\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|author=Andrew Cooke|title=Introduction To Computer Languages|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815140215/http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, the data represented by <code>\"this text between the quotes\"</code> is a [[String literal|string]], and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled (\"static\" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running (\"dynamic\" type checking), resulting in a run-time [[Exception handling|exception]]. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return \"-1\" as the result.\n\nA special case of typed languages are the ''single-typed'' languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as [[REXX]] or [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]], and have only one data type{{dubious|date=March 2018}}\u2013\u2014most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.\n\nIn contrast, an ''untyped language'', such as most [[assembly language]]s, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths.<ref name=\"typing\"/> High-level untyped languages include [[BCPL]], [[Tcl]], and some varieties of [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].\n\nIn practice, while few languages are considered typed from the [[type theory]] (verifying or rejecting all operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.<ref name=\"typing\"/> Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution (see [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casting]]).\n\n====Static versus dynamic typing====\nIn ''[[Type system|static typing]]'', all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.<ref name=\"typing\"/>\n\nStatically typed languages can be either ''[[Manifest typing|manifestly typed]]'' or ''[[Type inference|type-inferred]]''. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable [[declaration (computer science)|declarations]]). In the second case, the compiler ''infers'' the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] all infer types in certain limited cases.<ref>Specifically, instantiations of [[generic programming|generic]] types are inferred for certain expression forms. Type inference in Generic Java\u2014the research language that provided the basis for Java 1.5's bounded [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|parametric polymorphism]] extensions\u2014is discussed in two informal manuscripts from the Types mailing list: [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html Generic Java type inference is unsound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073839/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Alan Jeffrey]], 17 December 2001) and [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html Sound Generic Java type inference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073849/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Martin Odersky]], 15 January 2002). C#'s type system is similar to Java's, and uses a similar partial type inference scheme.</ref> Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.\n\n''[[Type system|Dynamic typing]]'', also called ''latent typing'', determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with ''run-time values'' rather than ''textual expressions''.<ref name=\"typing\"/> As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type [[Software bug|errors]] cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making [[debugging]] more difficult. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] are all examples of dynamically typed languages.\n\n====Weak and strong typing====\n''[[Weak typing]]'' allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a [[String (computer science)|string]] as a number.<ref name=\"typing\"/> This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at [[compile time]] and even at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].\n\n''[[Strongly typed programming language|Strong typing]]'' prevents these program faults. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error.<ref name=\"typing\"/> Strongly typed languages are often termed ''type-safe'' or ''[[type safety|safe]]''.\n\nAn alternative definition for \"weakly typed\" refers to languages, such as [[Perl]] and [[JavaScript]], which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression <code>2 * x</code> implicitly converts <code>x</code> to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if <code>x</code> is <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, an <code>Array</code>, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.\n''Strong'' and ''static'' are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term ''strongly typed'' to mean ''strongly, statically typed'', or, even more confusingly, to mean simply ''statically typed''. Thus [[C (programming language)|C]] has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|title=Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme|date=20 February 1998|accessdate=9 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714212928/http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|title=On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism|author=[[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Peter Wegner]]|work=Manuscript (1985)|accessdate=9 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619072646/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|archivedate=19 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be \"weakly, statically typed\". However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the '''void*''' pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as <code>(int)</code> or <code>(char)</code>.\n\n===Standard library and run-time system===\n{{main|Standard library}}\n\nMost programming languages have an associated core [[Library (computing)|library]] (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.\n\nThe line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a string literal is defined as an instance of the <code>java.lang.String</code> class; similarly, in [[Smalltalk]], an [[anonymous function]] expression (a \"block\") constructs an instance of the library's <code>BlockContext</code> class. Conversely, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.\n\n==Design and implementation==\nProgramming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing ''language families'' of related languages branching one from another.<ref name=\"Fischer\">Steven R.

While [[constructed languages]] are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.\n\nMany programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one \"universal\" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role.<ref>IBM in first publishing PL/I, for example, rather ambitiously titled its manual ''The universal programming language PL/I'' (IBM Library; 1966). The title reflected IBM's goals for unlimited subsetting capability: \"PL/I is designed in such a way that one can isolate subsets from it satisfying the requirements of particular applications.\" ({{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL/I&oldid=19175|title=PL/I|work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=29 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010947/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL%2FI&oldid=19175|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}). [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[UNCOL]] had similar early goals.</ref> The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:\n* Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of [[programmer]]s.\n* Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.\n* Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.\n* Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.\n* Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.\n\nOne common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit.<ref>Frederick P.

While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in [[natural language]] (e.g., as in the [[C (programming language)|C language]]), or a [[formal semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]] (e.g., as in [[Standard ML]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Milner|first=R.|authorlink=Robin Milner |author2=[[Mads Tofte|M.

The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or a formal language.\n* A [[reference implementation|''reference'' or ''model'' implementation]], sometimes [[Meta-circular evaluator|written in the language being specified]] (e.g., [[Prolog]] or [[REXX|ANSI REXX]]<ref>[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] \u2013 Programming Language Rexx, X3-274.1996</ref>). The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.\n\n===Implementation===\n{{Main|Programming language implementation}}\n\nAn ''implementation'' of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: ''[[compiler|compilation]]'' and ''[[interpreter (computing)|interpretation]]''. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.\n\nThe output of a [[compiler]] may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of [[BASIC]] compile and then execute the source a line at a time.\n\nPrograms that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Code complete|last=Steve|first=McConnell|isbn=0735619670|edition=Second|location=Redmond, Washington|oclc=54974573|pages=[https://archive.org/details/codecomplete0000mcco/page/590 590, 600]|url=https://archive.org/details/codecomplete0000mcco/page/590}}</ref>{{better source|date=March 2019}}\n\nOne technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is [[just-in-time compilation]]. Here the [[virtual machine]], just before execution, translates the blocks of [[bytecode]] which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware.\n\n==Proprietary languages==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n\nAlthough most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly [[domain specific language]]s or internal [[scripting language]]s for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.\n\nSome programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, [[Oracle Corporation]] asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the [[Java programming language]],<ref>See: [[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]</ref> and [[Microsoft]]'s [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR) as a closed environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerscience.org/resources/computer-programming-languages/|title=Guide to Programming Languages {{!}} ComputerScience.org|work=ComputerScience.org|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMany proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include [[MATLAB]], [[VBScript]], and [[Wolfram Language]].

When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers \"do exactly what they are told to do\", and cannot \"understand\" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using [[pseudocode]], which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.\n\nA programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A [[programmer]] uses the [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called [[language primitive|primitives]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|title=Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|author=Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman|accessdate=3 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050622/http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|archivedate=26 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[Computer Programming|Programming]]'' is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.\n\nPrograms for a computer might be [[Execution (computing)|executed]] in a [[Batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction, or a user might type [[Command (computing)|commands]] in an [[Session (computer science)|interactive session]] of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a [[Unix shell]] or other [[command-line interface]]), without compiling, it is called a [[scripting language]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.15/15.09/ScriptingLanguages/index.html\n |title       = Scripting Languages\n |year        = 1999\n |accessdate  = November 17, 2014\n |author      = Brown Vicki\n |website     = mactech.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171202235828/http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.15/15.09/ScriptingLanguages/index.html\n |archivedate = 2 December 2017\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Measuring language usage===\n{{Main|Measuring programming language popularity}}\n\nDetermining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context.

With languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new [[dialect]]. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a [[domain-specific language]], often a subset. In the [[Common Lisp|Lisp]] world, most languages that use basic [[S-expression]] syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] and [[Clojure]]. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The [[BASIC programming language]] has [[List of BASIC dialects|many dialects]].\n\nThe explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying \"If you've seen one Forth... you've seen ''one'' Forth.\"\n\n==Taxonomies==\n{{details|Categorical list of programming languages}}\nThere is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.\n\nThe task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] in parallel). [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is an object-oriented [[scripting language]].\n\nIn broad strokes, programming languages divide into ''[[programming paradigm]]s'' and a classification by ''intended domain of use,'' with [[general-purpose programming language]]s distinguished from [[domain-specific programming language]]s. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called [[imperative programming]] languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of [[declarative programming]].<ref>Carl A. Gunter, ''Semantics of Programming Languages: Structures and Techniques'', MIT Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-262-57095-5}}, p. 1</ref> More refined paradigms include [[procedural programming]], [[object-oriented programming]], [[functional programming]], and [[logic programming]]; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An [[assembly language]] is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, [[system programming language]]s, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|title=TUNES: Programming Languages|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020203251/http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wirth|first=Niklaus|authorlink=Niklaus Wirth|title=Recollections about the development of Pascal|journal=Proc. 2nd ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages|volume=28|issue=3|pages=333\u2013342|year=1993|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155378|accessdate=30 June 2006|doi=10.1145/154766.155378|isbn=978-0-89791-570-0|citeseerx=10.1.1.475.6989}}</ref>\n\nA programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm.
