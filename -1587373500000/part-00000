Georg Simmel. Sociological Theory. 7th ed. New York: The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2008. 158\u201388. Print.</ref> Probably considered Simmel's greatest work, Simmel saw [[money]] as a [[structure|structuring]] agent that helps us understand the totality of life.<ref name=\"Sociological Theory 158\"/>\n\n==Money and value==\nSimmel believed people created [[economic value|value]] by making objects, then separating themselves from those objects and then trying to overcome that distance. He found that objects that were too close were not considered valuable and objects that were too far away for people to obtain were also not considered valuable. What was also considered in determining value was the [[scarcity]], time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting objects. In the pre-modern era, beginning with [[bartering]], different systems of exchange for [[goods]] and services allowed for the existence of incomparable systems of value (land, food, honor, love, etc.). With the advent of a universal [[currency]] as an intermediary, these systems became reconcilable, as everything tended to become expressible in a single quantifiable metric: its [[monetary cost]].\n\n==Money and freedom==\nA fundamental point of ''The Philosophy of Money'' is that money brings about [[personal freedom]]. The effect of freedom can be appreciated by considering the evolution of economic [[obligation]]s. When someone is a [[slave]], their whole person is subject to the master. The [[peasant]] has more freedom, but if they are to provide the lord with payments in kind, such as wheat or cattle, they must produce exactly the item required, or [[barter]] it at a great loss or inconvenience. But when the obligation takes a monetary form, the peasant is free as to whether to grow wheat, or keep cattle, or engage in other activities, as long as they pay the required tax.\n\nFreedom also arises because money enables an economic system of increasing complexity in which any single relation becomes less important and thus more impersonal. As a result, the individual experiences a sense of [[independence]] and [[self-sufficiency]]. There is another sense in which money is conducive to freedom, and it originates from the observation that the owner is truly entitled to its possessions only if he takes care of its upkeep and of making it bear fruits. Money is more flexible than land or other assets, and thus it frees the owner from those activities that are specific to real entities. Since monetary possessions no longer ties the owner to a specific type of work, money leads to increased freedom. Consequently, monetary ownership enables the position of a purely intellectual worker and, by the same line of reasoning, it also implies that a wealthy man can lead a modest life. As for workers and managers, they only contribute work for wages and only deal with an impersonal market, and thus their personality is separated from specific work activities. In the case of civil servants, they are paid a fixed salary that is largely independent of any specific work performance, and see their personality freed from work activities. The same hold for artists, such as a musician who is paid the same fee regardless of how well he plays.\n   \nAlthough the monetary system enhances individual freedom, it can also lead to consequences that are questionable. An employee does not necessarily have better living conditions than a slave does, as a precise amount of money corresponds imprecisely to its effective purchasing power.  In a money economy, individuals will tend to put their financial interests above the goals of society or of the state. If a peasant sells his land even for a fair price, monetary freedom differs from the personal activity afforded by possession of the land.  More generally, freedom from something does not necessarily equate with the freedom to do something else because money is \"empty\" and flexible, and does not direct the owner toward any specific activity.  Although monetary payments can free from the obligations of specific in-kind contributions, it has also the effect of removing the involvement of the individual from a broader context. For example, when the Athenian vassal states had to contribute with ships and troops, the tributaries were directly involved in [[Athens]]'s foreign and military policy, at least to the extent that drafted soldiers could not effectively be deployed against their home states. Once the military contribution was replaced by a monetary tribute, no such constraint could be placed on Athens's policy. The natural evolution of this state of affairs is that despotic regimes tend to favor a monetary economy.\n\n==Personal values==\n[[Personal values]] can be quantified in terms of equivalent money amounts. An example is the [[weregild]], the monetary value that must be paid to a family if one of his members is killed. The weregild was truly a reflection of personal values, in this case of a lost life, rather than the [[compensation]] for the income stream that the deceased would have provided to the family. Similarly, personal values are also quantified by the practice of [[marriage]] by purchase and of [[prostitution]]. However, the historical trend has been toward an increased awareness of individual distinctions whereas money is intrinsically [[fungible]]. As a result, money has been progressively considered as an inappropriate equivalent to personal values, and most of these practices have fallen into disuse. When these practices survive, the amount of money is so large that it introduces an affective element in the transaction. A wife purchased for an exorbitant amount is especially dear to the heart.\n\nMoney is fungible and, as such, it stands in sharp contrast with the idea of ''distinction'', according to which an entity is set apart from and incomparable with a majority. Distinction is a property of [[nobility]], or of some works of art, for example. Simmel takes as a case in point the [[House of Lords]], which functions as the sole judge of its members and at the same time refuses to sit in judgment of any other individual. In this sense, the Lords value distinction to the extent that even the exercise of authority on other people would be seen as a degradation. The quantitative aspects of money has the potential to threaten and debase the qualitative notion of distinction.\n\n==Style of life==\nAs values can be quantified in monetary terms, our relationship with objects has lost most of its emotional character and has become more [[intellect]]ual. On the one hand, our [[rationality|rational]] attitude can lead us to become [[individualistic]], to an atomization of society, and even to disregard respect and kindness. On the other hand, there are often clear advantages in relying on intellect rather than on emotions. At any rate, Simmel maintains that intellect is a tool and, as such, it lacks an intrinsic sense of direction and can be put to use for different purposes. Rationality originates from the objective, purely arithmetic nature of money, and is mirrored by the tenet that law is equal for everyone and that in a [[democracy]] all votes are equal. \nThe ability of fitting in an increasingly intellectual environment is reinforced by education, which in turn is mostly accessible to those who can afford it. As a result, money can lead to the creation of a de facto [[aristocracy]] of the affluent. The converse is that [[egalitarian]] tendencies typically reject the money system.\n\nThe objective nature of money ultimately arises from the [[division of labor]], in which the product is divorced from the worker's personality and work is treated as a [[commodity]]. Similarly, products are no longer tailored to the specific customer and do not reflect his personality, production tools are specialized to the point that the worker has little leeway in the way he operates the machines, and fashion changes so rapidly that nobody gets personally or socially attached to it. This state of affairs stands in contrast with the arts, which reflects the individuality of the author. Money can increase the distance between individuals to the point that it allows them to fit in crowded cities and to liberate individuals from the yoke of working on a family business. (Incidentally, financial activities are concentrated in major cities, and the concentration of money increases the pace and variety of life.) Humankind has become progressively more independent of the rhythms of nature and more dependent on the business cycle. \n\"Objects and people have become separated from one another\" declares Simmel, and was to compare this phenomenon with [[Marx's theory of alienation]].<ref name=\"SimmelOnRodin\">{{cite book |last1=Simmel |first1=Georg |last2=Frisby |first2=David |last3=Featherstone |first3=Mike |title=Simmel on Culture |date=23 January 1998 |publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd. |isbn=978-0803986527 |page=70 |edition=First |ref=SimmelOnRodin}}</ref>\n\nMoney rises above individual conflicts while being an essential participant of the conflict.\nIt has transcended its characteristics of a tool when it has become the center around which the economic system rotates, at which point it also takes the role of an all-encompassing teleological circle. Simmel was to compare this phenomenon with Marx's [[commodity fetishism]].<ref name=\"SimmelOnRodin\"/>\n\nYet, division of labor makes it possible to construct intellectual and scientific contents that surpass the ability of the individual mind. Even in these cases, though, it may be essential that a synthesis be accomplished by a single mind. Similarly, as material concerns become impersonal, what is left can become more personal. For example, as the typewriter has relieved the writer from the cumbersome mechanics of writing, he can devote more attention to the original contents of his work. It really depends on humankind whether money will lead to increase distinctiveness and refinement or not.\n\n==Social effects of money==\nSimmel's outlook, while gloomy, is not wholly negative. As money and transactions increase, the independence of an individual decreases as he or she is drawn into a holistic network of exchange governed by quantifiable monetary value. Paradoxically, this results in greater potential freedom of choice for the individual, as money can be deployed toward any possible goal, even if most people's sheer lack of money renders that potential quite low much of the time. Money's homogenizing nature encourages greater liberty and equality and melts away forms of feudalism and patronage, even as it minimizes exceptional, incommensurable achievements in art and love.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Society}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Philosophy of Money}}\n[[Category:1900 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:German non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Economic sociology]]\n[[Category:Finance books]]\n[[Category:Social philosophy literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''The Philosophy of Money''''' (1900) is a book on [[economic sociology]] by the German [[sociologist]] and [[social philosopher]], [[Georg Simmel]].<ref name=\"Sociological Theory 158\">Simmel, George.

It is often modeled after East Javanese temples, and functions as a shrine to a certain deity. To the Balinese, a ''candi'' is not necessarily ancient, since ''candis'' continue to be (re-)built within these puras, such as the reconstructed temple in [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]], [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Kedaulatan Rakyat|title=Peninggalan Majapahit Yang Tersembunyi di Alas Purwo |author=Tomi Sujatmiko | date=9 June 2013 | language=Indonesian|url=http://krjogja.com/read/175829/peninggalan-majapahit-yang-tersembunyi-di-alas-purwo.kr}}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] perspective, ''candi'' also refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary ''[[vihara]]s'' in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of [[Pawon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Replika Candi Pawon|work=Vih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya|url=http://www.dhammacakka.org/?channel=tentangkami&mode=detailfasilitas&id=93}}</ref> and [[Plaosan]]'s ''perwara'' (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a ''candi'' as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a [[stupa]], a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. [[Borobudur]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Batujaya]] for example are actually elaborate stupas.\n\nIn modern [[Indonesian language]], the term ''candi'' can be translated as \"temple\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Thus temples of [[Cambodia]] (such as the [[Angkor Wat]]), Champa (Central and Southern [[Vietnam]]), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and [[India]] are also called ''candi'' in Indonesian.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prambanan]] temple compound.

However, the term also applied to many non-religious structures dated from the same period, such as ''gapura'' (gates),'' petirtaan'' (pools) and some of habitation complexes. Examples of non-temple candis are the Bajang Ratu and Wringin Lawang gates of [[Majapahit]]. The \"Candi Tikus bathing pool\" in [[Trowulan]] and Jalatunda in Penanggungan slopes, as well as the remnants of non-religious habitation and urban structures such as [[Ratu Boko]] and some of Trowulan city ruins, are also considered ''candi''.\n\nIn ancient Java, a temple was probably originally called ''{{IAST|pr\u0101s\u0101da}}'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0926}}), as evidence in the [[Manjusrigrha inscription]] (dated from 792 CE), that mentioned   \"Prasada Vajrasana Manjusrigrha\" to refer to the [[Sewu]] temple.<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coed\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George Coed\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

The association of the name \"candi\", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in [[India]] and other parts of Southeast Asia outside of Indonesia, such as [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], or [[Burma]].\n\nAnother theory from Buddhist perspective, suggested that the term \"candi\" might be a localized form of the [[Pali]] word ''cedi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''caitya'') \u2014 which related to [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''chedi'' which refer to a [[stupa]], or it might be related to the [[Cundi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva Cand\u012b]] (also known as Cund\u012b or Cand\u0101).<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Women in Buddhism - Indonesia: Part 10  | work = Shakyadita: Awakening Buddhist Women | url = http://awakeningbuddhistwomen.blogspot.co.id/2015/06/history-of-women-in-buddhism-indonesia_29.html}}</ref>\n\nHistorians suggest that the temples of ancient Java were also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalty. This is in line with Buddhist concept of [[stupas]] as structures to store Buddhist relics, including the ashes and remains of holy Buddhist priests or the Buddhist king, patrons of Buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the [[garbhagriha]] (main chamber) of the temple is often modeled after the deceased king and considered to be the deified person of the king portrayed as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] according to the concept of [[devaraja]]. The example is the statue of king [[Airlangga]] from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding [[Garuda]].\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|upright|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nThe candi architecture follows the typical [[Hindu architecture]] traditions based on [[Vastu Shastra]]. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated [[mandala]] temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. The candi was designed to mimic [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]], the holy mountain the abode of gods. The whole temple is a model of Hindu universe according to [[Hindu cosmology]] and the layers of [[Loka]].<ref name=\"SEDYAWATIp4\">{{harvp|Sedyawati|2013|p=4}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure elements ===\n[[File:Prambanan Cross Section Shiva.svg|thumb|upright|The Shiva temple Candi Prambanan consist of three ascending realms, temple's base (Bhurloka), body (Bhurvaloka) and roof (Svarloka).]]\nThe candi structure and layout recognize the hierarchy of the zones, spanned from the less holy to the holiest realms. The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (center), and head (roof). The three zones is arranged according to a sacred hierarchy. Each Hindu and Buddhist concepts has their own terms, but the concept's essentials is identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:<ref>[http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11 Konservasi Borobudur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234819/http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11# |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>\n* [[Bhuloka|Bhurloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]''), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons.

The outer courtyard and the foot (base) part of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''bhurloka''.\n* [[Bhuvarloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Rupajhana|Rupadhatu]]''), the middle realm of holy people, [[rishi]]s, ascetics, and lesser gods. People here began to see the light of truth. The middle courtyard and the body of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''bhuvarloka''.\n* [[Svarloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Arupajhana|Arupadhatu]]''), the highest and holiest realm of gods, also known as ''[[svarga]]loka''. The inner courtyard and the roof of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''svarloka''. The roof of Hindu structure usually crowned with ''[[Gemstone|ratna]]'' ([[sanskrit]]: jewel) or [[vajra]], or in eastern Java period, crowned by cube structure. While ''[[stupa]]'' or dagoba cylindrical structure served as the pinnacle of Buddhist ones.\n\n=== Style ===\n[[Soekmono]], an Indonesian archaeologist, has classified the ''candi'' styles into two main groups: a central Java style, which predominantly date from before 1,000 CE, and an eastern Java style, which date from after 1,000 CE.

It was one of the earliest temple in Java.]]\nThere are material, form, and location exceptions to these general design traits. While the Penataran, Jawi, Jago, Kidal and Singhasari temples, for example, belong to the eastern Java group, they use andesite stone similar to the central Java temple material. Temple ruins in [[Trowulan]], such as Brahu, Jabung and Pari temples use red brick. Also the Prambanan temple is tall and slender similar to the east Java style, yet the roof design is central Javan in style. The location also do not always correlate with the temple styles, for example Candi Badut is located in Malang, East Java, yet the period and style belongs to older 8th century central Javanese style.\n\nThe earlier northern central Java complexes, such as the [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng temples]], are smaller and contain only several temples which exhibit simpler carving, whereas the later southern complexes, such as [[Sewu|Sewu temple]], are grander, with a richer elaboration of carving, and concentric layout of the temple complex.\n\nThe Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian megalithic design elements, such stepped pyramids (''punden berundak''). These design cues are seen in the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples in [[Mount Lawu]] in eastern Central Java, and in stepped sanctuary structures on the [[Mount Penanggungan]] slopes that are similar to meso-American stepped pyramids.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Billbeee-borob.jpg|thumb|upright|Interlocking [[andesite]] stone blocks forming a [[Corbel arch|corbeling arch]] in Borobudur.]]\nMost of well-preserved ''candi'' in Indonesia are made from [[andesite]] stone. This is mainly owed to the stone's durability, compared to bricks, against tropical weathers and torrential rains. Nevertheless, certain periods, especially the Majapahit era, saw the extensive use of [[red brick]] as temple and building materials. The materials commonly used in temple construction in Indonesia are:\n\n*[[Andesite]] is an extrusive igneous [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition]], with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Its colour ranges from light to dark grey. Andesite is especially abundant in the volcanic island of Java, mined from a certain cliffs or stone quarry with andesite deposit formed from compressed ancient magma chamber or cooled down lava spill. Each andesite stone is custom made into blocks with interlocking technique, to construct temple walls, floors and building. Andesite stones are easily formed and carved with iron [[chisel]], making it a suitable material for temple walls and decorations carved as [[bas-relief]]s. The walls of andesite was then carved with exquisite narrative bas-reliefs, which can be observed in many temples, especially in Borobudur and Prambanan. Andesite rocks are also used as the material for carved statues: the images of deities and Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|Red [[brick]] [[Jabung]] temple, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n*[[Brick]] is also used to construct temples. The oldest brick temple structure is the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in [[Karawang]], West Java, dated from 2nd to 12th century CE. Although brick had been used in the ''candi'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was [[Majapahit]] architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|last=Schoppert |first=P. |last2=Damais |first2=S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in [[Trowulan]], Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo. Temples of Sumatra, such as [[Bahal temple]], [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], and [[Muara Takus]] are made from bricks. However, compared to lava andesite stone, clay red bricks are less durable, especially if exposed to hot and humid tropical elements and torrential monsoon rain. As a result, many red brick structures were crumbling down over centuries, and reconstruction efforts require recasting and replacing the damaged structure with new bricks.\n*[[Tuff]] is a volcanic rock that is quite abundant near Javanese volcanoes or limestone formations. In Indonesian and Javanese languages, tuff is called ''batu putih'' (white stone), which corresponds to its light color. The chalky characteristic of this stone, however, has made it unsuitable to be carved into bas-reliefs of building ornaments. Compared to andesite, tuff is considered as an inferior quality building material. In Javanese temples, tuff usually are used as stone fillings \u2014 forming the inner structure of the temple \u2014 while the outer layer employed andesite that is more suitable to be carved. The tuff quarries can be found in Sewu limestone ranges near Ratu Boko hill. The tuff fillings in the temple can be examined in [[Ratu Boko]] crematorium temple. Tuff was used as building material of outer walls of temple compound, such as te walls found buried around Sewu and Sambisari temple.\n*[[Stucco]] is materials similar to modern [[concrete]], made from the mixture of sand, stone, water, and sometimes ground clamshell. The stucco as temple building material is observable in the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in West Java.\n[[File:Relief on Sari Temple wall, 2014-04-10 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Traces of worn off ''vajralepa'' plaster on [[Sari Temple|Sari]]'s relief.]]\n*[[Plaster]] called ''vajralepa'' (Sanskrit: diamond plaster) is used to coat the temple walls. The white-yellowish plaster is made from the mixture of ground [[limestone]], tuff or white earth ([[kaolin]]), with plant substances such as gums or resins as binder. The ''varjalepa'' white plaster was applied upon the andesite walls, and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\">{{cite web |title =The Greatest Sacred Buildings |publisher =Museum of World Religions, Taipei |url =http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx |accessdate =4 May 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170207105433/http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx# |archive-date =2017-02-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref> The traces of worn-off ''vajralepa'' plaster can be observed in Borobudur, [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temple walls.\n*[[Wood]] is believed to be used in some of ''candi'' construction or at least as parts of temple building material. Sari and [[Plaosan]] temples, for example, are known to have traces of stone indentions to support wooden beams and floors in its second floor, as well as traces of wooden stairs. [[Ratu Boko]] compound  has building bases and stone ''umpak'' column base, which suggests that the wooden capitals once stood there to support wooden roof structure made of organic materials. Traces of holes to install wooden window railings and wooden doors are observable in many of the ''perwara'' (complementary smaller) temples. Of course, wooden materials are easily decayed in a humid tropical climate, leaving no traces after centuries.\n\n== Motif and decoration ==\n\n=== Kala-Makara ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpg|thumb|upright|Kala-makara on the portal of Borobudur gates, Kala's head on top of the portal and makaras flanking either sides.]]\nThe candis of ancient Java are notable with the application of [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] as both decorative and symbolic elements of the temple architecture. [[kala (time)|Kala]] is the giant symbolizing [[time]], by making kala's head as temple portals element, it symbolizes that time consumes everything. Kala is also a protective figure, with fierce giant face it scares away malevolent spirits. [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] is a mythical sea monster, the vahana of sea-god [[Varuna]]. It has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with the head of an [[elephant]]. It is also shown with head and jaws of a [[crocodile]], an elephant trunk, the tusks and ears of a wild [[boar]], the darting eyes of a [[monkey]], the scales and the flexible body of a [[fish]], and the swirling tailing feathers of a [[peacock]]. Both kala and makara are applied as the protective figures of the temple's entrance.\n\nKala is the giant head, often takes place on top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head, flanking the portal or projecting on the top corner as antefixes. The kala-makara theme also can be found on stair railings on either sides. On the upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs, with its curved bodies forming the stair's railings. Other than makaras, kala's head might also project its tongue as stair's railings. These types of stair-decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling [[gold]] ornaments or spouting [[Gemstone|jewels]], while in its mouth often projected [[Gana]] dwarf figures or animals such as [[lion]]s or [[parrot]]s.\n\n=== Linga-Yoni ===\n[[File:KITLV 87800 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sculpture of a yoni with lingga at Yogyakarta - Before 1900.tif|thumb|upright|left|Central Javanese linga-yoni with spout decorated and supported by ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' serpent, Yogyakarta 9th century.]]\nIn ancient Javanese ''candi'', the linga-yoni symbolism was only found in Hindu temples, more precisely those of Shivaist faith. Therefore, they are absent in Buddhist temples. The [[linga]] is a [[phallic]] post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power. Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]]. The lingas that survive from the Javanese classical period are generally made of polished stone of this shape.\n\nLingas are implanted in a flat square base with a hole in it, called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb and also represents [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort. A yoni usually has a kind of spout, usually decorated with ''[[n\u0101ga]]'', to help channeled and collects the liquids poured upon linga-yoni during Hindu ritual. As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual. Oldest remains of linga-yoni can be found in [[Dieng temples]] from earlier period circa 7th century. Originally each temples might have a complete pair of linga-yoni unity. However, most of the times, the linga is missing.\n\nIn the tradition of Javanese kingship, certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself or his dynasty, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Shiva. The example is the linga-yoni of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, according to [[Canggal inscription]] is connected to King [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] from the [[Mataram Kingdom]], in 654 [[Saka era|Saka]] (732 CE).<ref name=\"SEAKingdoms\">{{cite web|title =Candi Gunung Wukir | work= Southeast Asian Kingdoms |url =https://southeastasiankingdoms.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/candi-gunung-wukir/ |accessdate =22 October 2015}}</ref> Other temples that contains complete linga-yoni include [[Sambisari]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo temples]]. Eastern Javanese temples that contains linga-yoni are [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] and [[Jawi temple]], although the linga is missing.\n\n=== Bas-reliefs ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016185.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rama]] killing evil giant, bas-relief of [[Ramayana]] on Prambanan temple, Central Java style.]]\n\nThe walls of ''candi'' often displayed [[bas-reliefs]], either serves as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. The first four terrace of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=58,6456,0,0,1,0\n| title = Temple of enlightenment\n| accessdate = 11 November 2011\n| first=Tom |last=Cockrem |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 18, 2008\n| via= The Buddhist Channel.tv\n}}\n</ref> The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as ''Karmavibhangga'' (the law of karma), ''[[Lalitavistara S\u016btra|Lalitavistara]]'' (the birth of Buddha), ''[[Jataka]]'', ''Avadana'' and ''[[Gandavyuha]]''. While in [[Prambanan]] the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (popularly known as ''Krishnayana'').\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].\n\n[[File:Candi Panataran Ramayana Relief, Java 1302.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hanuman]] battling enemy, bas-relief of Ramayana on [[Penataran]] temple, East Java style.]]\nThere are significant distinction of bas-reliefs' style and aesthetics between the Central Javanese period (prior of 1000 CE) and East Javanese period (after 1000 CE). The earlier Central Javanese style, as observable in Borobudur and Prambanan, are more exquisite and naturalistic in style. The reliefs is projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style with proper ideal body proportion. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs of Eastern Javanese style is projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stiffer pose and stylized style, similar to currently Balinese wayang images. The East Javanese style is currently preserved in Balinese art, style and aesthetics in temple bas-reliefs, also [[wayang]] shadow puppet imagery, as well as the [[Kamasan]] [[Balinese art|painting]].\n\n=== Deities ===\n\n====Kalpataru and Kinnaras ====\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|''[[Kinnara]]'' (male), ''Kinnari'' (female), ''[[Apsara]]'', and ''[[Devata]]'' guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'', the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\nThe images of coupled ''[[Kinnara]]'' and ''Kinnari'' can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of ''Kinnara'' and ''Kinnari'' usually is depicted guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'' ([[Kalpavriksha]]), the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure. There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous ''kinnari'', [[Manohara]].\n\nThe lower outer wall of [[Prambanan]] temples were adorned with row of small niche containing image of ''simha'' (lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) tree. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees according to Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, is flanked on either side by [[kinnara]]s or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called as \"Prambanan panel\".\n\n==== Boddhisattva and Tara ====\n[[File:Sewu09 43.jpg|thumb|upright|A Bodhisattva flanked by two Taras in Sewu temple.]]\nIn Buddhist temples, the panels of bas-reliefs usually adorned with exquisite images of male figure of ''[[Bodhisattva]]s'' and female figure of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]s'', along with ''[[Gandarva]]s'' heavenly musicians, and sometimes the flock of ''[[Gana]]'' dwarfs. These are the deities and divinities in Buddhist beliefs, which resides in the [[Tushita|Tushita heaven]] in Buddhism cosmology. The notable images of ''boddhisattvas'' could be found adorning outer walls of [[Plaosan]], Sari, Kalasan, Pawon and of course Borobudur temple.\n\n==== Devata and Apsara ====\n[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 05.jpg|thumb|upright|A Devata flanked by two apsaras in Prambanan temple.]]\nIn Hindu temples, the celestial couple; male ''[[Devata]]s'' and female ''[[Apsara]]s'' are usually found adorns the panels of temple's walls. They are the Hindu counterpart of Buddhist ''Bodhisattva-Tara'' celestial beings. On the other side of narrative panels in Prambanan, the temple wall along the gallery were adorned with the statues and reliefs of ''[[devata]]s'' and ''brahmin'' sages. The figure of ''[[lokapala]]s'', the celestial guardians of directions can be found in Shiva temple. The Brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of a male deities ''[[devata]]s'' flanked by two ''[[apsara]]s''. The depiction of celestial beings of lesser gods and goddesses \u2014 ''devatas'' and ''apsaras'', describes the Hindu concept of sacred realm of ''[[Svarga]]loka''. This is corresponds to the concept of the towering Hindu temple as the epitome of [[Mount Meru]] in Hindu cosmology.\n\n=== Guardians ===\n\n==== Dvarapala ====\n[[File:Java - Candi Sewu - 003 (8697399678).jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of dvarapala statues guarding [[Sewu]] temple.]]\nMost of larger temple compound in ancient Java were guarded by a pair of [[Dvarapala]] statues, as gate guardians. The twin giants usually placed flanked the entrance in front of the temple, or in four cardinal points. Dvarapala took form of two fierce giants or demons that ward off evil and malevolent spirits from entering the sacred temple compounds. In Central Javanese art, Dvarapala is mostly portrayed as a stout and rather chubby giant, with fierce face of glaring round goggle eyes, protruding fangs, curly hairs and moustaches, with fat and round belly. The giant usually depicted as holding [[Gada (mace)|gada]] and sometimes knives as weapon.\n\nIn East Javanese art and Balinese version however, the dvarapala usually depicted rather slender, with the exception of gigantic dvarapala of [[Singhasari]] near Malang, East Java that measures 3.7 metres tall. The most notable dvarapala statues are those of candi [[Sewu]], each pair guarding four cardinal points of the grand temple complex, making them a total eight large dvarapala statues in perfect condition. The dvarapalas of Sewu temple has become the prototype of ''[[Gupolo]]'' guardian in later Javanese art, copied as guardians in Javanese [[keraton]]s of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Another fine example is two pairs of dvarapala guarding the twin temples of [[Plaosan]].\n\n==== Lion ====\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]].]]\nThe statues of a pair of [[Cultural depictions of lions|lions]] (Sanskrit: ''Si\u1e41ha'', Indonesian and Javanese: ''Singa'') flanking the portal, are often placed as the guardians of ''candi'' entrance. Lions were never native to Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lions in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from the naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the depictions were all based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lions as the noble and powerful beasts in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture especially through [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism.\n\nStatues of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardians. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], andesite stone statues of lions guard four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephants, lions, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]. The statue of winged lion also found in [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]] temple [[East Java]].\n\n=== Stupa and Ratna pinnacles ===\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudu-13.jpg|thumb|left|Bell-shaped perforated stupas of Borobudur.]]\nThe religions dedicated in the temples of ancient Java can be easily distinguished mainly from its pinnacles on top of the roof. Bell-shaped [[stupa]] can be found on the Buddhist temples' roof, while ratna, the pinnacle ornaments symbolize gem, mostly founds in Hindu temples.\n\nThe typical stupas in Javanese classical temple architecture is best described as those of [[Borobudur]] style; the bell-shaped stupa. The stupa in Borobudur upper round terrace of ''Arupadhatu'' consist of round lotus pedestal, gently sloped bell-shaped dome, rectangular shape on top of the dome serves as the base of hexagonal pinnacle. \n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111351.jpg|thumb|An opened stupa reveals an [[Buddharupa|image of Buddha]] on Arupadatu rounded terrace of Borobudur.]]\nEach stupa is  pierced by numerous decorative openings, either in the shape of rectangular or rhombus. Statues of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced stupa enclosures. Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple. A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship.\n\nRatna pinnacle took form of a curved obtuse pyramidal shape or sometimes cylindrical, completed with several base structure or pedestals took form as some ornamental seams (Javanese:''pelipit''). It can be found as the pinnacle of both Hindu and Buddhist temples. Nevertheless, it is most prevalent in Hindu temples. The example of temple with ratna pinnacle is [[Sambisari]] and Ijo temple. In Prambanan, the stylized [[vajra]] replaced ratna as the temple's pinnacles. In later periods, the false lingga-yoni, or cube can be found in Hindu temple's roof, while cylindrical dagoba on top of Buddhist counterparts.\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Candi Indonesia id.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the main sites of the so-called \"[[Indonesian classical period]]\" or Hindu-Buddhist period. Black dots represent Hindu sites and red dots Buddhist sites.]]\nThe high concentration of candi can be found especially dense in [[Sleman Regency]] in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], also [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] in [[Central Java]]; which corresponds to the historical region of [[Kedu Plain]] ([[Progo River]] valley, Temanggung-Magelang-Muntilan area) and [[Kewu Plain]] ([[Opak River]] valley, around Prambanan), the cradle of Javanese civilization. Other important sites with notable temple compounds includes [[Malang]], [[Blitar]] and [[Trowulan]] areas in [[East Java]]. [[West Java]] also contains a small number of temples such as Batujaya and Cangkuang. Outside of Java, the candi type of temple can be found in [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and Southern [[Kalimantan]], although they are quite scarce. In Sumatra, two exceptional sites are notable for its temple density; the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in Jambi and [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padang Lawas or Bahal complex]] in North Sumatra.\n\nThe candis might be built on plain or uneven terrain. [[Prambanan]] and [[Sewu]] temples for example, are built on even flat low-lying terrain, while the temples of [[Gedong Songo]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo]] are built on hill terraces on higher grounds or mountain slopes. Borobudur on the other hand is built upon a bedrock hill. The position, orientation and spatial organization of the temples within the landscape, and also their architectural designs, were determined by socio-cultural, religious and economic factors of the people, polity or the civilization that built and support them.<ref name=\"DEGROOTp2\">{{harvp|Degroot|2009|p=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Java ===\n\n==== West Java ====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cangkuang, [[Garut]] West Java]]\n* [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]], a compound of Buddhist [[Stupa]] made from red brick and mortar located at Batu Jaya, [[Karawang]], [[West Java]].

It is often modeled after East Javanese temples, and functions as a shrine to a certain deity. To the Balinese, a ''candi'' is not necessarily ancient, since ''candis'' continue to be (re-)built within these puras, such as the reconstructed temple in [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]], [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Kedaulatan Rakyat|title=Peninggalan Majapahit Yang Tersembunyi di Alas Purwo |author=Tomi Sujatmiko | date=9 June 2013 | language=Indonesian|url=http://krjogja.com/read/175829/peninggalan-majapahit-yang-tersembunyi-di-alas-purwo.kr}}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] perspective, ''candi'' also refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary ''[[vihara]]s'' in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of [[Pawon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Replika Candi Pawon|work=Vih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya|url=http://www.dhammacakka.org/?channel=tentangkami&mode=detailfasilitas&id=93}}</ref> and [[Plaosan]]'s ''perwara'' (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a ''candi'' as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a [[stupa]], a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. [[Borobudur]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Batujaya]] for example are actually elaborate stupas.\n\nIn modern [[Indonesian language]], the term ''candi'' can be translated as \"temple\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Thus temples of [[Cambodia]] (such as the [[Angkor Wat]]), Champa (Central and Southern [[Vietnam]]), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and [[India]] are also called ''candi'' in Indonesian.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prambanan]] temple compound.

However, the term also applied to many non-religious structures dated from the same period, such as ''gapura'' (gates),'' petirtaan'' (pools) and some of habitation complexes. Examples of non-temple candis are the Bajang Ratu and Wringin Lawang gates of [[Majapahit]]. The \"Candi Tikus bathing pool\" in [[Trowulan]] and Jalatunda in Penanggungan slopes, as well as the remnants of non-religious habitation and urban structures such as [[Ratu Boko]] and some of Trowulan city ruins, are also considered ''candi''.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"Between the 7th and 15th centuries, hundred of religious structures were constructed of brick and stone in Java, Sumatra and Bali.

The association of the name \"candi\", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in [[India]] and other parts of Southeast Asia outside of Indonesia, such as [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], or [[Burma]].\n\nAnother theory from Buddhist perspective, suggested that the term \"candi\" might be a localized form of the [[Pali]] word ''cedi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''caitya'') \u2014 which related to [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''chedi'' which refer to a [[stupa]], or it might be related to the [[Cundi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva Cand\u012b]] (also known as Cund\u012b or Cand\u0101).<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Women in Buddhism - Indonesia: Part 10  | work = Shakyadita: Awakening Buddhist Women | url = http://awakeningbuddhistwomen.blogspot.co.id/2015/06/history-of-women-in-buddhism-indonesia_29.html}}</ref>\n\nHistorians suggest that the temples of ancient Java were also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalty. This is in line with Buddhist concept of [[stupas]] as structures to store Buddhist relics, including the ashes and remains of holy Buddhist priests or the Buddhist king, patrons of Buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the [[garbhagriha]] (main chamber) of the temple is often modeled after the deceased king and considered to be the deified person of the king portrayed as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] according to the concept of [[devaraja]]. The example is the statue of king [[Airlangga]] from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding [[Garuda]].\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|upright|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nThe candi architecture follows the typical [[Hindu architecture]] traditions based on [[Vastu Shastra]]. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated [[mandala]] temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. The candi was designed to mimic [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]], the holy mountain the abode of gods.

The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (center), and head (roof). The three zones is arranged according to a sacred hierarchy. Each Hindu and Buddhist concepts has their own terms, but the concept's essentials is identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:<ref>[http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11 Konservasi Borobudur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234819/http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11# |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>\n* [[Bhuloka|Bhurloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]''), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons.

The outer courtyard and the foot (base) part of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''bhurloka''.\n* [[Bhuvarloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Rupajhana|Rupadhatu]]''), the middle realm of holy people, [[rishi]]s, ascetics, and lesser gods. People here began to see the light of truth. The middle courtyard and the body of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''bhuvarloka''.\n* [[Svarloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Arupajhana|Arupadhatu]]''), the highest and holiest realm of gods, also known as ''[[svarga]]loka''. The inner courtyard and the roof of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''svarloka''. The roof of Hindu structure usually crowned with ''[[Gemstone|ratna]]'' ([[sanskrit]]: jewel) or [[vajra]], or in eastern Java period, crowned by cube structure. While ''[[stupa]]'' or dagoba cylindrical structure served as the pinnacle of Buddhist ones.\n\n=== Style ===\n[[Soekmono]], an Indonesian archaeologist, has classified the ''candi'' styles into two main groups: a central Java style, which predominantly date from before 1,000 CE, and an eastern Java style, which date from after 1,000 CE.

It was one of the earliest temple in Java.]]\nThere are material, form, and location exceptions to these general design traits. While the Penataran, Jawi, Jago, Kidal and Singhasari temples, for example, belong to the eastern Java group, they use andesite stone similar to the central Java temple material. Temple ruins in [[Trowulan]], such as Brahu, Jabung and Pari temples use red brick. Also the Prambanan temple is tall and slender similar to the east Java style, yet the roof design is central Javan in style. The location also do not always correlate with the temple styles, for example Candi Badut is located in Malang, East Java, yet the period and style belongs to older 8th century central Javanese style.\n\nThe earlier northern central Java complexes, such as the [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng temples]], are smaller and contain only several temples which exhibit simpler carving, whereas the later southern complexes, such as [[Sewu|Sewu temple]], are grander, with a richer elaboration of carving, and concentric layout of the temple complex.\n\nThe Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian megalithic design elements, such stepped pyramids (''punden berundak''). These design cues are seen in the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples in [[Mount Lawu]] in eastern Central Java, and in stepped sanctuary structures on the [[Mount Penanggungan]] slopes that are similar to meso-American stepped pyramids.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Billbeee-borob.jpg|thumb|upright|Interlocking [[andesite]] stone blocks forming a [[Corbel arch|corbeling arch]] in Borobudur.]]\nMost of well-preserved ''candi'' in Indonesia are made from [[andesite]] stone. This is mainly owed to the stone's durability, compared to bricks, against tropical weathers and torrential rains. Nevertheless, certain periods, especially the Majapahit era, saw the extensive use of [[red brick]] as temple and building materials. The materials commonly used in temple construction in Indonesia are:\n\n*[[Andesite]] is an extrusive igneous [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition]], with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Its colour ranges from light to dark grey. Andesite is especially abundant in the volcanic island of Java, mined from a certain cliffs or stone quarry with andesite deposit formed from compressed ancient magma chamber or cooled down lava spill. Each andesite stone is custom made into blocks with interlocking technique, to construct temple walls, floors and building. Andesite stones are easily formed and carved with iron [[chisel]], making it a suitable material for temple walls and decorations carved as [[bas-relief]]s. The walls of andesite was then carved with exquisite narrative bas-reliefs, which can be observed in many temples, especially in Borobudur and Prambanan. Andesite rocks are also used as the material for carved statues: the images of deities and Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|Red [[brick]] [[Jabung]] temple, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n*[[Brick]] is also used to construct temples. The oldest brick temple structure is the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in [[Karawang]], West Java, dated from 2nd to 12th century CE. Although brick had been used in the ''candi'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was [[Majapahit]] architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|last=Schoppert |first=P. |last2=Damais |first2=S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in [[Trowulan]], Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo. Temples of Sumatra, such as [[Bahal temple]], [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], and [[Muara Takus]] are made from bricks. However, compared to lava andesite stone, clay red bricks are less durable, especially if exposed to hot and humid tropical elements and torrential monsoon rain. As a result, many red brick structures were crumbling down over centuries, and reconstruction efforts require recasting and replacing the damaged structure with new bricks.\n*[[Tuff]] is a volcanic rock that is quite abundant near Javanese volcanoes or limestone formations. In Indonesian and Javanese languages, tuff is called ''batu putih'' (white stone), which corresponds to its light color. The chalky characteristic of this stone, however, has made it unsuitable to be carved into bas-reliefs of building ornaments. Compared to andesite, tuff is considered as an inferior quality building material. In Javanese temples, tuff usually are used as stone fillings \u2014 forming the inner structure of the temple \u2014 while the outer layer employed andesite that is more suitable to be carved. The tuff quarries can be found in Sewu limestone ranges near Ratu Boko hill. The tuff fillings in the temple can be examined in [[Ratu Boko]] crematorium temple. Tuff was used as building material of outer walls of temple compound, such as te walls found buried around Sewu and Sambisari temple.\n*[[Stucco]] is materials similar to modern [[concrete]], made from the mixture of sand, stone, water, and sometimes ground clamshell. The stucco as temple building material is observable in the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in West Java.\n[[File:Relief on Sari Temple wall, 2014-04-10 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Traces of worn off ''vajralepa'' plaster on [[Sari Temple|Sari]]'s relief.]]\n*[[Plaster]] called ''vajralepa'' (Sanskrit: diamond plaster) is used to coat the temple walls. The white-yellowish plaster is made from the mixture of ground [[limestone]], tuff or white earth ([[kaolin]]), with plant substances such as gums or resins as binder. The ''varjalepa'' white plaster was applied upon the andesite walls, and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\">{{cite web |title =The Greatest Sacred Buildings |publisher =Museum of World Religions, Taipei |url =http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx |accessdate =4 May 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170207105433/http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx# |archive-date =2017-02-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref> The traces of worn-off ''vajralepa'' plaster can be observed in Borobudur, [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temple walls.\n*[[Wood]] is believed to be used in some of ''candi'' construction or at least as parts of temple building material. Sari and [[Plaosan]] temples, for example, are known to have traces of stone indentions to support wooden beams and floors in its second floor, as well as traces of wooden stairs. [[Ratu Boko]] compound  has building bases and stone ''umpak'' column base, which suggests that the wooden capitals once stood there to support wooden roof structure made of organic materials. Traces of holes to install wooden window railings and wooden doors are observable in many of the ''perwara'' (complementary smaller) temples. Of course, wooden materials are easily decayed in a humid tropical climate, leaving no traces after centuries.\n\n== Motif and decoration ==\n\n=== Kala-Makara ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpg|thumb|upright|Kala-makara on the portal of Borobudur gates, Kala's head on top of the portal and makaras flanking either sides.]]\nThe candis of ancient Java are notable with the application of [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] as both decorative and symbolic elements of the temple architecture. [[kala (time)|Kala]] is the giant symbolizing [[time]], by making kala's head as temple portals element, it symbolizes that time consumes everything. Kala is also a protective figure, with fierce giant face it scares away malevolent spirits. [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] is a mythical sea monster, the vahana of sea-god [[Varuna]]. It has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with the head of an [[elephant]]. It is also shown with head and jaws of a [[crocodile]], an elephant trunk, the tusks and ears of a wild [[boar]], the darting eyes of a [[monkey]], the scales and the flexible body of a [[fish]], and the swirling tailing feathers of a [[peacock]]. Both kala and makara are applied as the protective figures of the temple's entrance.\n\nKala is the giant head, often takes place on top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head, flanking the portal or projecting on the top corner as antefixes. The kala-makara theme also can be found on stair railings on either sides. On the upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs, with its curved bodies forming the stair's railings. Other than makaras, kala's head might also project its tongue as stair's railings. These types of stair-decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling [[gold]] ornaments or spouting [[Gemstone|jewels]], while in its mouth often projected [[Gana]] dwarf figures or animals such as [[lion]]s or [[parrot]]s.\n\n=== Linga-Yoni ===\n[[File:KITLV 87800 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sculpture of a yoni with lingga at Yogyakarta - Before 1900.tif|thumb|upright|left|Central Javanese linga-yoni with spout decorated and supported by ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' serpent, Yogyakarta 9th century.]]\nIn ancient Javanese ''candi'', the linga-yoni symbolism was only found in Hindu temples, more precisely those of Shivaist faith. Therefore, they are absent in Buddhist temples. The [[linga]] is a [[phallic]] post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power. Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]]. The lingas that survive from the Javanese classical period are generally made of polished stone of this shape.\n\nLingas are implanted in a flat square base with a hole in it, called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb and also represents [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort. A yoni usually has a kind of spout, usually decorated with ''[[n\u0101ga]]'', to help channeled and collects the liquids poured upon linga-yoni during Hindu ritual. As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual. Oldest remains of linga-yoni can be found in [[Dieng temples]] from earlier period circa 7th century. Originally each temples might have a complete pair of linga-yoni unity. However, most of the times, the linga is missing.\n\nIn the tradition of Javanese kingship, certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself or his dynasty, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Shiva. The example is the linga-yoni of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, according to [[Canggal inscription]] is connected to King [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] from the [[Mataram Kingdom]], in 654 [[Saka era|Saka]] (732 CE).<ref name=\"SEAKingdoms\">{{cite web|title =Candi Gunung Wukir | work= Southeast Asian Kingdoms |url =https://southeastasiankingdoms.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/candi-gunung-wukir/ |accessdate =22 October 2015}}</ref> Other temples that contains complete linga-yoni include [[Sambisari]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo temples]]. Eastern Javanese temples that contains linga-yoni are [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] and [[Jawi temple]], although the linga is missing.\n\n=== Bas-reliefs ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016185.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rama]] killing evil giant, bas-relief of [[Ramayana]] on Prambanan temple, Central Java style.]]\n\nThe walls of ''candi'' often displayed [[bas-reliefs]], either serves as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. The first four terrace of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=58,6456,0,0,1,0\n| title = Temple of enlightenment\n| accessdate = 11 November 2011\n| first=Tom |last=Cockrem |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 18, 2008\n| via= The Buddhist Channel.tv\n}}\n</ref> The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as ''Karmavibhangga'' (the law of karma), ''[[Lalitavistara S\u016btra|Lalitavistara]]'' (the birth of Buddha), ''[[Jataka]]'', ''Avadana'' and ''[[Gandavyuha]]''. While in [[Prambanan]] the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (popularly known as ''Krishnayana'').\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].\n\n[[File:Candi Panataran Ramayana Relief, Java 1302.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hanuman]] battling enemy, bas-relief of Ramayana on [[Penataran]] temple, East Java style.]]\nThere are significant distinction of bas-reliefs' style and aesthetics between the Central Javanese period (prior of 1000 CE) and East Javanese period (after 1000 CE). The earlier Central Javanese style, as observable in Borobudur and Prambanan, are more exquisite and naturalistic in style. The reliefs is projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style with proper ideal body proportion. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs of Eastern Javanese style is projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stiffer pose and stylized style, similar to currently Balinese wayang images. The East Javanese style is currently preserved in Balinese art, style and aesthetics in temple bas-reliefs, also [[wayang]] shadow puppet imagery, as well as the [[Kamasan]] [[Balinese art|painting]].\n\n=== Deities ===\n\n====Kalpataru and Kinnaras ====\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|''[[Kinnara]]'' (male), ''Kinnari'' (female), ''[[Apsara]]'', and ''[[Devata]]'' guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'', the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\nThe images of coupled ''[[Kinnara]]'' and ''Kinnari'' can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of ''Kinnara'' and ''Kinnari'' usually is depicted guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'' ([[Kalpavriksha]]), the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure. There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous ''kinnari'', [[Manohara]].\n\nThe lower outer wall of [[Prambanan]] temples were adorned with row of small niche containing image of ''simha'' (lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) tree. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees according to Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, is flanked on either side by [[kinnara]]s or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called as \"Prambanan panel\".\n\n==== Boddhisattva and Tara ====\n[[File:Sewu09 43.jpg|thumb|upright|A Bodhisattva flanked by two Taras in Sewu temple.]]\nIn Buddhist temples, the panels of bas-reliefs usually adorned with exquisite images of male figure of ''[[Bodhisattva]]s'' and female figure of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]s'', along with ''[[Gandarva]]s'' heavenly musicians, and sometimes the flock of ''[[Gana]]'' dwarfs. These are the deities and divinities in Buddhist beliefs, which resides in the [[Tushita|Tushita heaven]] in Buddhism cosmology. The notable images of ''boddhisattvas'' could be found adorning outer walls of [[Plaosan]], Sari, Kalasan, Pawon and of course Borobudur temple.\n\n==== Devata and Apsara ====\n[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 05.jpg|thumb|upright|A Devata flanked by two apsaras in Prambanan temple.]]\nIn Hindu temples, the celestial couple; male ''[[Devata]]s'' and female ''[[Apsara]]s'' are usually found adorns the panels of temple's walls. They are the Hindu counterpart of Buddhist ''Bodhisattva-Tara'' celestial beings. On the other side of narrative panels in Prambanan, the temple wall along the gallery were adorned with the statues and reliefs of ''[[devata]]s'' and ''brahmin'' sages. The figure of ''[[lokapala]]s'', the celestial guardians of directions can be found in Shiva temple. The Brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of a male deities ''[[devata]]s'' flanked by two ''[[apsara]]s''. The depiction of celestial beings of lesser gods and goddesses \u2014 ''devatas'' and ''apsaras'', describes the Hindu concept of sacred realm of ''[[Svarga]]loka''. This is corresponds to the concept of the towering Hindu temple as the epitome of [[Mount Meru]] in Hindu cosmology.\n\n=== Guardians ===\n\n==== Dvarapala ====\n[[File:Java - Candi Sewu - 003 (8697399678).jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of dvarapala statues guarding [[Sewu]] temple.]]\nMost of larger temple compound in ancient Java were guarded by a pair of [[Dvarapala]] statues, as gate guardians. The twin giants usually placed flanked the entrance in front of the temple, or in four cardinal points. Dvarapala took form of two fierce giants or demons that ward off evil and malevolent spirits from entering the sacred temple compounds. In Central Javanese art, Dvarapala is mostly portrayed as a stout and rather chubby giant, with fierce face of glaring round goggle eyes, protruding fangs, curly hairs and moustaches, with fat and round belly. The giant usually depicted as holding [[Gada (mace)|gada]] and sometimes knives as weapon.\n\nIn East Javanese art and Balinese version however, the dvarapala usually depicted rather slender, with the exception of gigantic dvarapala of [[Singhasari]] near Malang, East Java that measures 3.7 metres tall. The most notable dvarapala statues are those of candi [[Sewu]], each pair guarding four cardinal points of the grand temple complex, making them a total eight large dvarapala statues in perfect condition. The dvarapalas of Sewu temple has become the prototype of ''[[Gupolo]]'' guardian in later Javanese art, copied as guardians in Javanese [[keraton]]s of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Another fine example is two pairs of dvarapala guarding the twin temples of [[Plaosan]].\n\n==== Lion ====\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]].]]\nThe statues of a pair of [[Cultural depictions of lions|lions]] (Sanskrit: ''Si\u1e41ha'', Indonesian and Javanese: ''Singa'') flanking the portal, are often placed as the guardians of ''candi'' entrance. Lions were never native to Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lions in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from the naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the depictions were all based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lions as the noble and powerful beasts in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture especially through [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism.\n\nStatues of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardians. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], andesite stone statues of lions guard four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephants, lions, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]. The statue of winged lion also found in [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]] temple [[East Java]].\n\n=== Stupa and Ratna pinnacles ===\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudu-13.jpg|thumb|left|Bell-shaped perforated stupas of Borobudur.]]\nThe religions dedicated in the temples of ancient Java can be easily distinguished mainly from its pinnacles on top of the roof. Bell-shaped [[stupa]] can be found on the Buddhist temples' roof, while ratna, the pinnacle ornaments symbolize gem, mostly founds in Hindu temples.\n\nThe typical stupas in Javanese classical temple architecture is best described as those of [[Borobudur]] style; the bell-shaped stupa. The stupa in Borobudur upper round terrace of ''Arupadhatu'' consist of round lotus pedestal, gently sloped bell-shaped dome, rectangular shape on top of the dome serves as the base of hexagonal pinnacle. \n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111351.jpg|thumb|An opened stupa reveals an [[Buddharupa|image of Buddha]] on Arupadatu rounded terrace of Borobudur.]]\nEach stupa is  pierced by numerous decorative openings, either in the shape of rectangular or rhombus. Statues of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced stupa enclosures. Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple. A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship.\n\nRatna pinnacle took form of a curved obtuse pyramidal shape or sometimes cylindrical, completed with several base structure or pedestals took form as some ornamental seams (Javanese:''pelipit''). It can be found as the pinnacle of both Hindu and Buddhist temples. Nevertheless, it is most prevalent in Hindu temples. The example of temple with ratna pinnacle is [[Sambisari]] and Ijo temple. In Prambanan, the stylized [[vajra]] replaced ratna as the temple's pinnacles. In later periods, the false lingga-yoni, or cube can be found in Hindu temple's roof, while cylindrical dagoba on top of Buddhist counterparts.\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Candi Indonesia id.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the main sites of the so-called \"[[Indonesian classical period]]\" or Hindu-Buddhist period. Black dots represent Hindu sites and red dots Buddhist sites.]]\nThe high concentration of candi can be found especially dense in [[Sleman Regency]] in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], also [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] in [[Central Java]]; which corresponds to the historical region of [[Kedu Plain]] ([[Progo River]] valley, Temanggung-Magelang-Muntilan area) and [[Kewu Plain]] ([[Opak River]] valley, around Prambanan), the cradle of Javanese civilization. Other important sites with notable temple compounds includes [[Malang]], [[Blitar]] and [[Trowulan]] areas in [[East Java]]. [[West Java]] also contains a small number of temples such as Batujaya and Cangkuang. Outside of Java, the candi type of temple can be found in [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and Southern [[Kalimantan]], although they are quite scarce. In Sumatra, two exceptional sites are notable for its temple density; the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in Jambi and [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padang Lawas or Bahal complex]] in North Sumatra.\n\nThe candis might be built on plain or uneven terrain. [[Prambanan]] and [[Sewu]] temples for example, are built on even flat low-lying terrain, while the temples of [[Gedong Songo]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo]] are built on hill terraces on higher grounds or mountain slopes. Borobudur on the other hand is built upon a bedrock hill. The position, orientation and spatial organization of the temples within the landscape, and also their architectural designs, were determined by socio-cultural, religious and economic factors of the people, polity or the civilization that built and support them.<ref name=\"DEGROOTp2\">{{harvp|Degroot|2009|p=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Java ===\n\n==== West Java ====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cangkuang, [[Garut]] West Java]]\n* [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]], a compound of Buddhist [[Stupa]] made from red brick and mortar located at Batu Jaya, [[Karawang]], [[West Java]].

It belongs to [[Kilakarai]] [[Taluk]] and [[town panchayat]]. The village is the location of the grave and shrine of Qutbus Sultan Syed Ibrahim [[Shahid|Shaheed]] Badusha, the previous ruler of [[Madinah Al Munawwara]]. Erwadi also belongs to [[Kadaladi]] assembly constituency, which is a part of [[Ramanathapuram (Lok Sabha constituency)]]. However, after the delimitations in 2009, Erwadi has been joined to the [[Ramanathapuram]] assembly constituency. Although a small town, Erwadi is the second largest contributor for the revenue of Ramanthapuram District.\n\n==Erwadi gaining importance in Tamil Nadu==\n[[File:Shaheed Coins.JPG|right|thumb|220px|The coin published by Syed Ibrahim Shaheed in Ervadi during his rule]]\nAl Qutbul Hamid wal Gausul Majid Badhusha Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed is an 18th generation descendant of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. He was the king of [[Madinah]] when he began his journey to India in the early 12th century to spread Islam according to Muhammad's wish. At the time, he had millions of followers from all over the Islamic world.<ref>Edition 3, page 24 of ''Erwadi Shaheed Nayagam varalaaru'', authored by Moulvi.Haji.Marhoom.S.Amjad Ibrahim Levvai Aalim Saahib and published by Ameer Aalim Publications, Erwadi Durgah, Ramanathapuram District, India</ref> Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed first came to the [[Sindh]] province in [[Pakistan]] and spread the message of Islam before returning to Madinah. Again in obligation to [[Muhammad]]'s command, Shaheed Badusha departed from Madinah with his entire family, leaving the throne behind. He wished to be a martyr and told Muhammad about his wish before leaving Medinah, receiving a promise from the Prophet that his prayer would be answered. He encountered many difficulties while travelling by sea and through forests on his way to India, without proper food and shelter or potable water to drink; he finally entered Kannanur in [[Kerala]]<nowiki/>with the goal of spreading Islam. He travelled via [[Kayalpattinam]], [[Vaippar]] and finally entered Bouthiramanickapattinam, now called '''Erwadi'''. Considering the religious importance of the place, the Tamil national daily Dinamalar has published [http://www.dinamalar.com/360view_detail_eng.asp?id=417#top 360<sup>o</sup> travel view of the dargah].\n\n===The war===\n[[File:Pandicoins1.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Coins used by the Muslim rulers and Pandiya rulers in Ervadi and Ramanathapuram provinces]]\nSultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed sent Sikandar Badusha to offer Islamic teachings to the [[Pandiya]] ruler, Thiru Pandiyan, in [[Madurai]] but he refused to accept them and waged war. Shaheed's troops won and Sultan Sikandar Badusha was throned in Madurai. Shaheed's troops marched towards Bouthramanickapattinam. Shaheed Badusha offered Islam to King Vikrama Pandiyan, who vehemently refused and asked Shaheed to leave the kingdom. Shaheed refused to leave without converting them to Islam. Vikrama Pandiyan declared war. A very violent war consisting of about 10 battles, each lasting around 3\u20134 days, was waged. All of the family members of Shaheed Badusha were killed, including his only son Syed Abutahir, his brother Syed Ismail, his brother-in-law Zainul Aabideen and many of Shaheed Badusha's martyrs and ministers, including Amir Abbas of Rome, Abdul Qadir Mujahid, Muhaiyaddeen, Aboobakkar Abdul Hakkim, Abdullah, Shamsuddin of [[Makkah]], Qamaruddin, Nooruddeen, Muhammadh Yusuf, Jafar Sadiq, Rome Syed Ahmad, Zulfaqar Ali, Chanthana Peer of [[Turkey]], Abdul Qadir Gilani, Abdul Qadir Samadaani, Pathan Sahib, Hamza Basheer, and Uvaisul Hasan Ridwanullahi Ta'ala Alaihim Ajmaeen.<ref>Vol.1 Edition 6, Mathan 4 Page 42 of Failul Majid Fi manaaqibi Shaheed written by Syed Ibrahim Levvai Aalim and published by Ameer Batcha Aalim Publications, Erwadi Dargah, Ramanathapuram District.</ref>\nFinally, King Vikrama [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandiyan]] and his sons Indra Pandiyan and Chandra Pandiyan were killed and Shaheed won the war, claiming the throne of Bouthiramanickapattinam. He ruled the province for twelve years and spread Islam all over south Tamil Nadu. Coins struck during the rule of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed have been found by archeologists.<ref>Sethu Sulthaniyar varalaru written by Dr.S.M.A.Kather, published by Nargees publications, Trichy.</ref> \n\n===The peace===\n[[File:muslimscoin.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Reverse view of the coins]]\nThe rivalry between King Vikrama Pandiyan's and Shaheed's supporters slowly fizzled, due to the huge loss of life sustained in the war, including King Pandiyan, as well as the capture of Bouthiramanickapattinam. All citizens, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or family, were treated equally; hence, citizens were happier and there was no war.\n\n====The royal wedding of the crown prince====\nDuring Shaheed Badusha's rule in Bouthiramanickapattinam Province, the neighbouring rulers came together under the leadership of Shaheed Badusha. During the end of his rule, Shaheed solemnized the marriage of the crown prince Badusha Syed Ishaq, his brother's son, with Sayyida Zainab, the daughter of his sister Rabiaa Amma. The wedding was a spectacular event. Thousands of elephants, Arabian horses, and camels came in procession. The royal fort was illuminated grandly. Lights were lit all over the Bouthramanickapattinam Province for a week. All citizens of the province were treated with complete feasts for 3 days. Thousands of sheep were slaughtered for the grand feasts. \n\n====Separation of provinces====\nTwelve years later, King Tiru Pandiyan came from Madurai with a larger army and assassinated Shaheed Badusha in order to recapture the throne. The king Tiru Pandiyan  was killed in the war. Badusha Syed Is'haq (Shaheed Badusha's brother Syed Ismail Badusha's son) and Pandiyan prince Jamara Kolakalap Pandiyan split the kingdom. The rivalry between the [[Arabs]] and Pandiyans came to an end when both signed a pact, stating that Arabs (descendants of Shaheed Badusha) would rule Bouthiramanickapattinam Province and the Pandiyans would rule [[Ramanathapuram]] Province. Syed Is'haq, Syed Ibrahim, Syed Baqir, Syed Qasim, Syed Tahir Ridwanullahi Ta'ala Alaihim Ajmaeen and other descendants of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed have ruled the Bouthiramanickapattinam Province, while Regunatha Sethupathi, Kilavan (Kizhavan) Sethupathi, Vijaya Regunatha Sethupathi, Muthu Regunatha Sethupathi, [[Muthuramalinga Sethupathi II|Muthuramalinga Sethupathi]], [[Bhaskara Sethupathi]], Kumaran Sethupathi and other descendants of Sethupathi have ruled Ramanathapuram Province. This arrangement continued to be implemented until the 17th century, when the British East India Company started occupying India.\n\n==Shuhadaas and Waliyatullahs in Erwadi==\n[[File:Erwadimasjid.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Erwadi Masjid with huge minaret]]\nThe graves of Emperor Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed Badusha along with his kith and kin is found in the main dargah campus. The holy graves of other important Shuhadaas and in laws of Badusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed are also found on the premises. A very big mosque which can accommodate 10,000 pilgrims for every prayer-service is also found on the Main dargha campus. The single mammoth [[minaret]] which is around {{convert|250|ft|m}} adds to the impressive appearance of Erwadi. It can be viewed from any of the shores of Ramanathapuram District and this acts as a virtual [[lighthouse]] to the fishermen in Ervadi and the adjacent villages.\n\n===Shuhadaas in the main dargah===\nThe main shrine ([[dargah]]) in Erwadi is the holiest place in Tamil Nadu because it is mixed with the soil of Madinah. Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and most of his family members, close relatives and other shuhadaas' graves are found in the main dargah. The big hall of the shrine of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shahid was constructed by Eiatibar Khan, during the time of the [[Nawab]] of [[Arcot]]. There is a flag  throne to the south of the main entrance of the dargah. The flag throne is built surrounding the grave of Begum, wife of Eaitibar khan who constructed the dargah. The main Dargah has three entrances. It is fully open except for the dargahs. Thousands of pilgrims come here to take the dust of this mixture of Madinah's soil which is said to cure all kinds of fatal diseases with the blessings of Shaheed Badusha.\n\n====Qutb Syed Abutahir Madani Shaheed====\nQutb Syed Aboothahir Madhani Shaheed was the elder son of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and Seyyida Zainab . Qutb Syed Abutahir was born in Madinah al Munawwara while his father Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed was the emperor of Madinah. Syed Abuthahir Shaheed spent his childhood in Madinah for his education. Syed Abootahir Shaheed felt very ecstatic and proud to be brought up on the soil of Madinah, the home of Muhammad, their ancestral forefather. When Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed left the Empire of Madinah to spread Islam in the South Asian countries including India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, he took his family through stringent hardships. Qutb Syed Abootahir was around 16 years old during this journey. Qutb Syed Abootahir Madhani Shaheed spent his entire life in the quest to spread Islam. Qutb Abbas of Rome trained Qutb Abutahir in the war fare before taking part in the war with the Pandiyas. He participated in a violent war with the Pandiya kings of Bouthiramanickapattinam at the age of 18, as his forefathers Imam [[Ali al-Akbar ibn Husayn|Ali Akbar]] and Imam [[Qasim ibn Hasan]] did in the battle of [[Karbala]]. Qutb Syed Abutahir presided over a flank in the war without any hesitation. In the war many ministers of King Vikrama Pandiyan and finally the only prince of Pandiya Kingdom, Indra Pandiyan, was killed by Syed Abootahir Shaheed, leading to a cessation of the war for a while. King Vikrama Pandiyan, after discussions with sages, recommenced the war, in which Qutb Syed Abutahir was martyred at the age of 18. As Allah says in the Quran, \"Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord; Al-Qur'aan 3:169\". Syed Abootahir Shaheed is alive, blessing thousands of pilgrims daily. As Khlaifa Haroon Rasheed Levvai a Huqdhar (Share Holder) says in his [[Tamil poetry]], \"Um vaasal munnaley mannum marundhu aagudhayya!!!\", which means, \"(Even) the soil (of Madinah) turns to medicine on your campus, [[lakh]]s of people who come to seek refuge from magical maladies and other incurable illness find their remedy from the soil of Erwadi Dargah.\"\n\n====Seyyida Fatimatul Barqa Umma====\nFathima Al Barqa, was born in Madinah and spent her life there. She was married to King Syed Ahamad the then emperor of Madinah. She was very much God fearing. King Syed Ahmad and Syeida Fathima Barqa had two sons, Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and Syed Ismail Shaheed, as well as a daughter, Seyyida Rabi'aa. When Muhammad ordered her son Sulthan Syed Ibrahimh to travel to India to spread Islam, Bibi Seyyida Fathimathul Barqa also showed keen interest in leaving the country for the sake of Islam. She also advised all her children, grand children and other Muslim women to start their journey for the sake of Islam. She was the head of the troops of women of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahid Badusha. Fatimatul Barqa Amma consoled and gave words of courage whenever her son Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shahid Badusha felt discouraged. She encouraged the spreading of Islam and bringing people to Islam and taking part in [[Jihad]] for the sake of Islam. Her entire life was spent for the sake of Islam, leaving the throne of Madinah al Munawwara and travelling to India in spite of overwhelming difficulties.\n\n====Seyyida Rabi'aa Amma====\n[[File:Raabiyaamma1.jpg|thumb|left|140px|The tomb of Seyyida Rabiaa Amma]]\nSeyyidha Rabiaa was the sister of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibraheem Shaheed and the daughter of Badhusha Syed Ahmad who came along with him all the way from Madinah. Raabiyaa Amma was in her pregnancy when her brother Sulthan Syed Ebraaheem began his journey to India, leaving the throne of Madinah. At the time, all the members of the family advised Rabiya Amma not to leave Madinah. But she flatly refused to stay in Madhina and started along with her brother Shaheed and her new born infant zainab amma. Rabiyaa Amma is also called Jacha Bibi Amma by [[Urdu]] speaking people for her travelling to India immediately after delivering baby Zainab amma. During 12 years of Shaheed badusha's rule at Bouthiramanikkapattinam province, once on a Friday after [[Jumu'ah|Jumma prayers]] Shaheed Badusha the ruler was busy distributing food to the poor. A small troop of pandiyan soldiers waged a battle in the women area near by valinokkam. Seyyida Rabiaa amma covered her with veil fully and wore the war costume of her brother Badusha Nayagam, took sword in her hands and fought vigorously against those pandiyas. Looking at the dress, the pandiya soldiers believed that the king himself what fighting. But in fact it was his sister Seyyida Rabiaa amma who fought. Unable to withstand the attack of Rabiya amma a few soldiers were killed and a few escaped and the battle came to an end. Ever in the Islamic history, Rabiya amma was the first women to lead a battle and win it. The dharga of Raabiyaa Amma is located at the extreme eastern end of Ervadi's main dhargha campus. People entering Dhurgha campus from the eastern entrance can find the Durgha of Rabiya Amma nearby. It is one of the oldest Dhurgas in Ervadi Shariff. Men are not allowed inside the dhargah and females are allowed to stay. People afflicted with mental and magical illness throng the dargah in large numbers and find themselves cured mostly within forty days and nights.\n\n====Seyyida Zainab Syed Ali Fathima Amma====\n[[File:Zainabsyedalifathimaamma1.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The tomb of Seyyida Zainab Syed Ali Fathima Amma]]\nSeyyida Zainab was the wife of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, and the mother of Qutb Syed Aboothaahir Madni Shaheed. Shaheed Badhusha married Seyyida Zainab (Syed Ali Fathima as being referred now) being from a very illustrious and God fearing family in Madinah. Right from childhood, Seyyida Zainab was very God fearing and she was ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of [[Allah]]. She gave birth to two children, Badhusha Syed Aboothahir and Seyyidina Zainul Aabideen with the marriage of Badusha Naayagam. She brought up her children with the same degree of love for Islam as their parents and forefathers had had. When Qutb Syed Ebraahim Shaheed started for India, the two children were just entering youth, but still their [[Taqwa]], taught to them by their Holy mother, Seyyida Zainab @ Syed Ali Fatima, gave them sustenance. Zainab Syed Ali Fathima also insisted that their child recognize the importance of supporting their Holy father in spreading Islam. So, Zainab Syed Ali Fathima Amma's children also travelled with enthusiasm and reached India. In the war with the [[Pandiya]]s, Syed Aboothahir Shaheed was martyred, and when the Holy body of Qutb Aboothahir Madhni was brought before Seyyida Zainab, she was shocked to see more than 72 cuts from arrows on the face of her son who was just 17 years old, for no sake but for the sake of Allah. Since her son lost his life in this world, and the atrocities which he faced were only for the sake of Allah, Zainab  was very long-suffering, as her grandmother [[Zaynab bint Ali]] had been when seeing the atrocities of [[Karbala]]. This is the greatest Amal (good deed) of all, a seventeen-year-old son being killed by enemies before the eyes of a mother for no sake but Islam, this is the most devout deed toward Allah and this act of patience is incomparable. But still, when the Pandiyas were defeated and Badhusha Nayagam Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed captured the throne, Zainab Syed 'Ali Fathima Amma was enthroned as Empress. Having nothing more to live for in this world after the Shahadat of Qutb Abutahir, Zainab Syed A'li Fatima amma refused the throne, but still was made to do so, accepting it as the fate of Allah. Zainab Syed Alee Fathimaa Amma was the empress of Bouthiramanickapattinam province for more than twelve years. She attained [[wafat]] and was interred very close to the grave of her husband Sulthaan Syed Ibraaheem Shahidh Rali. Zainab Syed 'Alee Faathimaa Ammaa's Dhurgha can be found second from the western entrance of Erwadi's main dargha. Thousands of pilgrims daily and lakhs during festival time visit the grave of Zainab Syed A'lee Fathimah in faith that all their wishes will come true with [[Tawassul|waseela]]. Unmarried girls, childless women and ladies with fatal illnesses who are brought to the grave of Zainab Amma are said to have their wishes fulfilled in a very short time.\n\n====Syed Zainul Aabideen Shaheed====\nSyed Zainul aabideen Shahid is the brother in law of Qutb Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, the emperor. Zainul Aabideen shaheed was a stubborn supporter of Qutb Sultan Syed Ibraheem Shahid during his voyage and his war with pandiyas. He is the brother of Seyyida Zainab @ Syed Ali Fatima and uncle of the Prince Qutb Syed Abutahir madani Shahid. Bbadhusha Naayagam was very much comfortable during the war because of the presence of his brother in law Zainul Aabideen Shaheedh who withstanding the oppose from the enemies used different war tactics and gave useful suggestions regarding the war plan that fortified Shaheed badusha after the passing away of his holy son Syed Aboothair Shaheedh. The relationship between Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheedh and Zainul Aabidheen Shaheed was very much closely bonded. people who knew the history of Erwadi war will give the example of Shaheed badusha and Zainul Aabidheen shaheedh if two brothers in law are closely associated. Zainul Aabidheen was also killed in the war finally and attained martyrdom which was the final desire of everyone who travelled with Badusha nayagam. He was funered very closely to Janaab Shaheedh, and his Holy grave is found to the right of the Holy Grave of Shaheedh Badusha Nayagam in Erwadi Dargha main campus.\n\n====Syed Shamsuddin Makki Shaheed====\n[[File:Shamsuddinshahid.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Shamsuddin Shaheed Durga, Ervadi.]]\nShamsuddin Shahid was the Emperor of [[Makkah al-Mukarramah]], the holiest place of Muslims where the [[Ka'aba]]tullah shariff is located, during the time when Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shahid was ruling madinah and started towards India. Shamsuddin shaheed was one among the few who renounced their empire and their throne for the sake of Islam. Shamsuddeen Shahed gave up the throne of Makkah to join Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed to travel to South Asia to spread Islam. During his regime, people were very much calm and quiet performing the rituals of [[Hajj]] and the Empire Shamsudhdheen Shaheedh was fully involved in the service of Allah's home. Though Shamsuddeen was very much comfortable with the throne, his mind was fully surrounded by the thoughts of spreading Islam. So, when Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed wrote letter about his travel to India Shamsuddeen shaheedh whole heartedly accepted the offer and joined the group of Shahid Badushah with large number of his troops. During the voyage Shamsuddheen Shahid was fully along with Sahid badusha helping him all the way.\nAfter reaching India and during the course of war between the Arabs and Pandiyans Shamsuddeen Shahid's role was very vital. Being a king, Shamsuddeen Shaheed helped Badhushaah Nayagam a lot in strategising the course of the war. His suggestions worked many a time which finally gave victory to the Shaheed badhusha's troop. Shamsuddeen shahid was also killed by the Pandiya's in war and was funered very closely to the right side of Basha nayagam. As per Hazarat Shamsuddeen's order through dream, his grave is kept open to sunlight and rain to fall on it. The Holy grave of Shamsuddin shaheed is found adjacent on the left side of the Northern end of the main dargha and close to the Dargha shariff of his neighbours Syed Qamaruddin Shaheedh and Syed Nooruddin Shahidh who also came along with Shaamsuddeen Shaheed and Baasha Naayagam and died in the war with pandiyas.\n\n====Mujavir Muhammad Ibrahim - Nalla Ibrahim====\n[[File:Nallaibrahimvaliyullah..jpg|thumb|140px|left|Dargah of Mujavir Nalla Ibrahim Razi Erwadi.]]\nMujavir Muhammadh Ibrahim Waliyullah who is very well known as Mujavir Nalla Ibrahim is the 12th hereditary grandson of Badusha Sulthan syed ibrahim Shaheedh. He is the son of Seyyidina Mursal Ibrahim Shaheed whose grave is found in [[Thachu oorani]] in the [[East Coast Road]] between [[Keelakarai]] and [[ervadi]]. Descendants of Badusha Shaheedh nayagam were ruling the Bouthiramanikapattinam (now Ervadi) province for generations together according to the peace treaty with king Jamara kolakala pandiyan. A few centuries later again when they felt the odour of Islam is slowly vanishing from the Tamil soil, they decided to leave the throne and begin the Islamic campaign as their ancestor Badusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed did. They slowly started moving from one place to another in spreading Islam and bringing people in the daily duties of Islam. Badhusha Varushai Syed Ibrahim whose grave is found in [[Melakkal Kanavai]] in [[Madurai]] district is the Great grand father of Nalla Ibraheem waliyullah and his grandson Mursal Ibrahim Shaheedh's grave is found in Ramanathapuram District as mentioned above.\n\n=====In the service of his ancestor as a Mujavir=====\nNalla Ibrahim waliyullah was living peacefully in Kiliyur, [[Paramakudi]] [[Taluk]] of Ramanathapuram District doing Islamic campaign as all his forefathers did. Once, Nallaa Ibraahim waliyullah had a dream in which his forefather Badhusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahedh appeared and asked him to come to Erwadi to serve the people coming for [[Ziyarat]] to Erwadi. Waking up Suddenly, Nalla Ibraaheem waliyullah could realize his grandfather's wish and informed his wife about the journey. His wife who had settled in Kiliyoor was reluctant to start towards Erwadi. Nalla Ibrahim waliyullah persuaded and finally started alone to Erwadi to the service of his forefather. Lot of people started thronging Erwadi for Ziarat who all were ecstatic to see Shahedh badusha's heir Nalla Ibrahim bava in the service of Dharghah as a Mujawir.\n\n=====Wife refusing to come \u2013 A miracle of Badhusha Nayagam=====\nFollowing the order given by Sulthan Syed Ibrahim shaheedh to leave Kiliyoor and stay at Ervaadi to serve pilgrims, Mujavir Nallla Ibraheem bava planned to start from Kiliyur with family. But his wife was reluctant to join with Naalla Ibrahim for her love towards the current village Kiliyur. Baadusha nayagam was bit anger towards this attitude of his granddaughter and offered a different miracle to happen in the heirs of Mujavir Nalla Ibrahim and his spouse till [[Qiyamah]]. A few children will be born with reddish skin and golden hair to look as if like an English. Erwaadi, being an arid place people are fully black and it's even very rare to see folks with yellowish complexion. But till today in one can see people with British complexion in Erwadi who are from the heirs of Nalla Ibrahim Waliyullah happening because of the miracle of Shahid badusha. Shocked to hear this, Nalla Ibrahim waliyullah's wife accepted and joined with her husband to aervadi and served the people who came for Zi'arat. Had she not refused the first invitation, could have avoided her children with British complexion. But anyhow still this stands as evidence to the powers of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahid.\n\n=====Sethupathy's child and 6666 acres of land=====\nAfter Mujavir Mohamed Ibrahim nalla Ibrahim bava settled in Erwadi, lot of pilgrims started thronging Ervadi shariff. The [[karaamaat]] of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Sahid was getting reached to people from various parts of India and people who came with different wishes to Erwadi saw it answered with the duaa of Shaheed nayagam. During the period of Nalla Ibrahim waliyullah the Ramnad province (called as Sethu Empire) was ruled by King Regunatha Sethupathy, who like the other sethupathy raja's had a close association with the Arabs (descendants of badhusha Nayagam) who ruled Bavithiramanickapattanam province. Sethupathy was longing for an offspring. Hearing about the miracles happening at Earvaadi dargha, the king along with his close associates visited the Holy Erwadi Dharga. Qutb Nala Ibrahim Waliyullah who was seated at Aerwadi received the king with greater enthusiasm and made him to stay there. Daily in the day on night Nalla Ibrahim bava offered oil from the lamp placed in the Ervadi dargah and some water taken from the pond near dargah and kept in the Rouza (Grave) of Syed ibraheem shahid. The Queen got conceived a son. The king was taken to the extreme of joy for the birth of Prince else his Empire would go into the hands of others. As a token of thanks and gratitude, the king donated 6666 acres of land (from Ithampadal to Thachan oorani) as Inam to Ervadi dargah. A portion of it is still maintained by the Dargha Huqdar Management Committee of Erwadi Dhargah.\n\n===Kattupalli Shuhadaas===\nKattupalli is one of the main places where the war between Pandyas and Arabs was held. It is also the graveyard of Arabs where the Dargahs of all important ministers of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed badhusha are found. It is in the northern side of the main dargah within 0.5&nbsp;km. Kattupalli is very spacious and it accommodates millions of people who gather during the Sandanakoodu urus festival.\n\n====Ameer Abbas Manthiri Shahid====\n[[File:Abbasshahid.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Abbas manthiri Shaheed Durga in Kattupalli, Erwadi.]]\nAmeer Abbas Razi was a minister in the then Islamic Government of Rome<ref>Page 132, of Then Pandi cheemai'iley authored by M.R.M.Abdur Raheem, and published by Kajiyar Publications [[Thanjavur]].</ref> while Sulthan Syed Ibrahim, the emperor of [[Medina]] wrote a letter to the Ruler of Rome, explaining the plan of travel to [[Hindustan]] obliging the order from grandfatherly ancestor Muhammad to spread Islam. The Roman ruler Sulthan Mahmood Badusha expressed his situation and sent a big troop of 1 lakh soldiers in the leadership of Ameer Abbas Manthiri Razi and they travelled to Madinah and joined Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed.\nIn the Bouthiramanickapattinam war which held between the Arabs and the pandiyas, Ameer Abbas Mandhiri and his troop killed a lot of pandiyans. In the Third war, Ameer Abbas manthiri was assassinated and attained martyrdom. Today, a highly sophisticated and well built Dargah of Ameer Abbas manthiri Shaheed is situated at the western entrance of kattupalli, with the separate Ziyarat khana for men and women.\n\n====Aboobakkar Abdul Hakim Doctor Shahid====\n[[File:hakimdrshahid.jpg|left|120px|thumb|Dargah of Hakeem Doctor Shahid.]]\nAboobakkar Abdul Hakeem Doctor [[Shahid|Shaheed]] is popularly known as Hakkeem Doctor Shaheed. He is the chief of the team of physicians for Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed badusha's troop which consisted Syed Ahmad Doctor from Rome, Yusuf Doctor Shaheed and Gailani Doctor Shaheed. Though a physician by profession, hakkim doctor was very strong in and brave to fight against the enemies of Islam. He was also killed in the battle of Bouthiramanickapattinam. Hakkem doctor allegedly exhibited many [[karaamaat]] (Miracles) after his shahaadat. A young lady by name Khatija from [[Malappuram]] district of Kerala who was suffering from [[brain tumor]] was left hopeless by the doctors since the surgery is risky and may lead to death. Frustrated to live, she came with an intention to spend her rest part of life in Ervadi dargah and stayed in Hakkem doctor Durgha. The 40th night, she had a dream in which Abubakkar Hakkim Doctor Shaheed appeared and performed a surgery on her brain. Morning when she woke up, she could see her head dressed with medications and some blood stains on it. Thousands of people gathered to see this [[miracle]] and it was published in the state level ''Tamil Daily'' newspaper and seeing this thousands of more diseased people started thronging Erwadi, Hakkeem Doctor Durgah.\n\n====Abdul Qadir Mujahid Shahid and Gazanfar Muhaiddin Shaheed====\n[[File:Kanakkedukkummandhirigal.jpg|right|120px|thumb|Kanakkedukkum Mandhririgal Dargah Kattupalli.]]\nThese two Shaheeds are important ministers in the ministry of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed Badusha in Madinah. They played a very vital role in the war between the pandiyas and the Arabs and killed a few hundreds of [[pandiya]]s. The second important minister from Shaheed Badhushaa's troop to be killed in the war was Abdul Qadir Shahid. He fought against the enemies even when his abdomen was torn and all its content was out. Still he tied it back and fought against the pandiya soldiers. That fetched him a respect to him in the war and after his death. Later Muhaidden shaheed stood with Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahhed for a long time and he too attained [[martyrdom]]. These two shuhadaas' Qabr are found close to each other. They played a very main role in Erwadi durgah becoming a curing hub for supernatural diseases and diseases caused by [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Devil]]s and mental disorder caused due to it. Hence these two shuhadaas are called as '''''Kanakkedukkum Manthirigal'''''. It means that Ministers who take care of curing magical and devilish diseases. People who come to '''Ervadi dargah''' with the above complaints, write a ready written petition kept in the dargah and offer it to the Mujavir.\n\n====Veerar Abdullah Shahid====\n[[File:Veerarabdullah.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Dargah of Veerar Abdullah Shahid.]]\nAbdullah Shaheed is believed to be from [[Makkah Al Mukarramah]] and was a wonderful fighter in the troop of Shaheed badusha. He served under Shahid badusha through the course of the war till its end. veerar Abdulla Shahid was the one, who entered the throne of King Vickrama Pandiyan during the final phase of war and dismounted the pandiya's flag with a fish symbol and hoisted the Muslims' flag declaring to the world the defeat of [[pandiya]]s in the war. So, Abdullah Shaheed is called as ''Vetrik kodi nattiya veerar Abdullah Shaheed''. This act of capturing the throne is the utmost important deed during the course of the war. Since capturing the other's throne is considered as the real victory over the rivals during the war rituals those days. This was possible only by the Braveness and Smart war techniques of Shaji Abdullah Shaheed. The [[dargah]] of veerar Abdullah Shaheed is located at the centre of the kattupalli and is managed by the Mujavirs.\n\n====Zulfiqar Ali @ Chanthanapeer Shaheedh====\n[[File:Sandhanapeershaheed.jpg|120px|right|thumb|Zulfaqar Ali @ Sandhanapeer Shaheed Dhargah.]]\nZulfiqar Ali was a minister in the then Islamic Government of [[Istanbul]] while Sulthan Syed Ibrahim, the emperor of Madinah wrote to the Ruler of [[Turkey]], regarding the travel to Hindustan obliging the order from grandfatherly ancestor Muhammad to spread Islam there. Though the Turkish ruler was not able to join Shaheed Badusha, he sent a troop headed by Zulfiqar Ali and they travelled to Madinah and joined the troops of Shaheed badusha. In the bouthiramanickapattinam war against the pandiyans, Zulfiqaar Ali as the very name reflects fought very bravely and finally was killed by the pandiyas. He took part with Badusha nayagam in the earlier War of Sind and was made the Governor of sind after the victory by the troop of Badusha nayagam. He later joined with Badusha Nayagam to his travel to south India in the next phase and was martyred there in the war.\n\n=====Reason for the name sandanapeer=====\nThough the actual name being Zulfiqar Ali, he was very well known by the name Santhanapeer Shahid waliyullah. Zulfiqar Ali belonged to Turkey, which is a very cold country. He could not bear the heat of South India, and to overcome this, Zulfiqar Shaheed used to apply [[sandalwood]] paste in his entire body for chillness. Daily morning he used to apply and for this reason he was called by the local Tamil people at that time as '''''Sandanapeer''''' which means '''''The saint of Sandal'''''. Till today, Zulfaqar Shaheed is called by the name Santhanapeer Shaheed and even the dargah where his grave is found, in the kattupalli, is named as Chandanapeer Shahid dargah.\n\n====Syed Is'haq Shaheed-Sara Amma Safura Amma Durgah====\n[[File:Saraamma.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Sara Amma Safura Amma Dargah]]\nThis durgah is located outside the Kaattupalli dargah campus. This is located parallel to the southern entrance of kattuppalli and to the east of Main Durgah. The graves of the family members of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim shaheed and all his descendants, who ruled the Erwadi province are found here. Shaheed badusha's brother Badusha Syed Ismail's son, Badhusha Syed Is'haq the crowned prince who ruled Ervadi after the death (Shahadat)of badhusha nayagam is found here along with the graves of Badusha Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, Badusha Syed Baaqir Shaheed, Badusha Syed Qasim Shaheed and Badhushah Syed Tahir Shaheed Ridwanullahi Ta'ala alaihim. Also the graves of waliyatullas Seyyida Sara Amma, Seyyida Safura Amma and Seyyida Zainab Amma are also found in this Dargah. For this reason, this dargah is called as ''Sara Amma Safura Amma Palli''.

He encountered many difficulties while travelling by sea and through forests on his way to India, without proper food and shelter or potable water to drink; he finally entered Kannanur in [[Kerala]]<nowiki/>with the goal of spreading Islam. He travelled via [[Kayalpattinam]], [[Vaippar]] and finally entered Bouthiramanickapattinam, now called '''Erwadi'''. Considering the religious importance of the place, the Tamil national daily Dinamalar has published [http://www.dinamalar.com/360view_detail_eng.asp?id=417#top 360<sup>o</sup> travel view of the dargah].\n\n===The war===\n[[File:Pandicoins1.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Coins used by the Muslim rulers and Pandiya rulers in Ervadi and Ramanathapuram provinces]]\nSultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed sent Sikandar Badusha to offer Islamic teachings to the [[Pandiya]] ruler, Thiru Pandiyan, in [[Madurai]] but he refused to accept them and waged war. Shaheed's troops won and Sultan Sikandar Badusha was throned in Madurai. Shaheed's troops marched towards Bouthramanickapattinam. Shaheed Badusha offered Islam to King Vikrama Pandiyan, who vehemently refused and asked Shaheed to leave the kingdom. Shaheed refused to leave without converting them to Islam. Vikrama Pandiyan declared war. A very violent war consisting of about 10 battles, each lasting around 3\u20134 days, was waged. All of the family members of Shaheed Badusha were killed, including his only son Syed Abutahir, his brother Syed Ismail, his brother-in-law Zainul Aabideen and many of Shaheed Badusha's martyrs and ministers, including Amir Abbas of Rome, Abdul Qadir Mujahid, Muhaiyaddeen, Aboobakkar Abdul Hakkim, Abdullah, Shamsuddin of [[Makkah]], Qamaruddin, Nooruddeen, Muhammadh Yusuf, Jafar Sadiq, Rome Syed Ahmad, Zulfaqar Ali, Chanthana Peer of [[Turkey]], Abdul Qadir Gilani, Abdul Qadir Samadaani, Pathan Sahib, Hamza Basheer, and Uvaisul Hasan Ridwanullahi Ta'ala Alaihim Ajmaeen.<ref>Vol.1 Edition 6, Mathan 4 Page 42 of Failul Majid Fi manaaqibi Shaheed written by Syed Ibrahim Levvai Aalim and published by Ameer Batcha Aalim Publications, Erwadi Dargah, Ramanathapuram District.</ref>\nFinally, King Vikrama [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandiyan]] and his sons Indra Pandiyan and Chandra Pandiyan were killed and Shaheed won the war, claiming the throne of Bouthiramanickapattinam. He ruled the province for twelve years and spread Islam all over south Tamil Nadu. Coins struck during the rule of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed have been found by archeologists.<ref>Sethu Sulthaniyar varalaru written by Dr.S.M.A.Kather, published by Nargees publications, Trichy.</ref> \n\n===The peace===\n[[File:muslimscoin.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Reverse view of the coins]]\nThe rivalry between King Vikrama Pandiyan's and Shaheed's supporters slowly fizzled, due to the huge loss of life sustained in the war, including King Pandiyan, as well as the capture of Bouthiramanickapattinam. All citizens, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or family, were treated equally; hence, citizens were happier and there was no war.\n\n====The royal wedding of the crown prince====\nDuring Shaheed Badusha's rule in Bouthiramanickapattinam Province, the neighbouring rulers came together under the leadership of Shaheed Badusha. During the end of his rule, Shaheed solemnized the marriage of the crown prince Badusha Syed Ishaq, his brother's son, with Sayyida Zainab, the daughter of his sister Rabiaa Amma. The wedding was a spectacular event. Thousands of elephants, Arabian horses, and camels came in procession. The royal fort was illuminated grandly. Lights were lit all over the Bouthramanickapattinam Province for a week. All citizens of the province were treated with complete feasts for 3 days. Thousands of sheep were slaughtered for the grand feasts. \n\n====Separation of provinces====\nTwelve years later, King Tiru Pandiyan came from Madurai with a larger army and assassinated Shaheed Badusha in order to recapture the throne. The king Tiru Pandiyan  was killed in the war. Badusha Syed Is'haq (Shaheed Badusha's brother Syed Ismail Badusha's son) and Pandiyan prince Jamara Kolakalap Pandiyan split the kingdom. The rivalry between the [[Arabs]] and Pandiyans came to an end when both signed a pact, stating that Arabs (descendants of Shaheed Badusha) would rule Bouthiramanickapattinam Province and the Pandiyans would rule [[Ramanathapuram]] Province. Syed Is'haq, Syed Ibrahim, Syed Baqir, Syed Qasim, Syed Tahir Ridwanullahi Ta'ala Alaihim Ajmaeen and other descendants of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed have ruled the Bouthiramanickapattinam Province, while Regunatha Sethupathi, Kilavan (Kizhavan) Sethupathi, Vijaya Regunatha Sethupathi, Muthu Regunatha Sethupathi, [[Muthuramalinga Sethupathi II|Muthuramalinga Sethupathi]], [[Bhaskara Sethupathi]], Kumaran Sethupathi and other descendants of Sethupathi have ruled Ramanathapuram Province. This arrangement continued to be implemented until the 17th century, when the British East India Company started occupying India.\n\n==Shuhadaas and Waliyatullahs in Erwadi==\n[[File:Erwadimasjid.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Erwadi Masjid with huge minaret]]\nThe graves of Emperor Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed Badusha along with his kith and kin is found in the main dargah campus. The holy graves of other important Shuhadaas and in laws of Badusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed are also found on the premises. A very big mosque which can accommodate 10,000 pilgrims for every prayer-service is also found on the Main dargha campus. The single mammoth [[minaret]] which is around {{convert|250|ft|m}} adds to the impressive appearance of Erwadi. It can be viewed from any of the shores of Ramanathapuram District and this acts as a virtual [[lighthouse]] to the fishermen in Ervadi and the adjacent villages.\n\n===Shuhadaas in the main dargah===\nThe main shrine ([[dargah]]) in Erwadi is the holiest place in Tamil Nadu because it is mixed with the soil of Madinah. Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and most of his family members, close relatives and other shuhadaas' graves are found in the main dargah. The big hall of the shrine of Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shahid was constructed by Eiatibar Khan, during the time of the [[Nawab]] of [[Arcot]]. There is a flag  throne to the south of the main entrance of the dargah. The flag throne is built surrounding the grave of Begum, wife of Eaitibar khan who constructed the dargah. The main Dargah has three entrances. It is fully open except for the dargahs. Thousands of pilgrims come here to take the dust of this mixture of Madinah's soil which is said to cure all kinds of fatal diseases with the blessings of Shaheed Badusha.\n\n====Qutb Syed Abutahir Madani Shaheed====\nQutb Syed Aboothahir Madhani Shaheed was the elder son of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and Seyyida Zainab . Qutb Syed Abutahir was born in Madinah al Munawwara while his father Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed was the emperor of Madinah. Syed Abuthahir Shaheed spent his childhood in Madinah for his education. Syed Abootahir Shaheed felt very ecstatic and proud to be brought up on the soil of Madinah, the home of Muhammad, their ancestral forefather. When Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed left the Empire of Madinah to spread Islam in the South Asian countries including India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, he took his family through stringent hardships. Qutb Syed Abootahir was around 16 years old during this journey. Qutb Syed Abootahir Madhani Shaheed spent his entire life in the quest to spread Islam. Qutb Abbas of Rome trained Qutb Abutahir in the war fare before taking part in the war with the Pandiyas. He participated in a violent war with the Pandiya kings of Bouthiramanickapattinam at the age of 18, as his forefathers Imam [[Ali al-Akbar ibn Husayn|Ali Akbar]] and Imam [[Qasim ibn Hasan]] did in the battle of [[Karbala]]. Qutb Syed Abutahir presided over a flank in the war without any hesitation. In the war many ministers of King Vikrama Pandiyan and finally the only prince of Pandiya Kingdom, Indra Pandiyan, was killed by Syed Abootahir Shaheed, leading to a cessation of the war for a while. King Vikrama Pandiyan, after discussions with sages, recommenced the war, in which Qutb Syed Abutahir was martyred at the age of 18. As Allah says in the Quran, \"Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord; Al-Qur'aan 3:169\". Syed Abootahir Shaheed is alive, blessing thousands of pilgrims daily. As Khlaifa Haroon Rasheed Levvai a Huqdhar (Share Holder) says in his [[Tamil poetry]], \"Um vaasal munnaley mannum marundhu aagudhayya!!!\", which means, \"(Even) the soil (of Madinah) turns to medicine on your campus, [[lakh]]s of people who come to seek refuge from magical maladies and other incurable illness find their remedy from the soil of Erwadi Dargah.\"\n\n====Seyyida Fatimatul Barqa Umma====\nFathima Al Barqa, was born in Madinah and spent her life there. She was married to King Syed Ahamad the then emperor of Madinah. She was very much God fearing. King Syed Ahmad and Syeida Fathima Barqa had two sons, Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and Syed Ismail Shaheed, as well as a daughter, Seyyida Rabi'aa. When Muhammad ordered her son Sulthan Syed Ibrahimh to travel to India to spread Islam, Bibi Seyyida Fathimathul Barqa also showed keen interest in leaving the country for the sake of Islam. She also advised all her children, grand children and other Muslim women to start their journey for the sake of Islam. She was the head of the troops of women of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahid Badusha. Fatimatul Barqa Amma consoled and gave words of courage whenever her son Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shahid Badusha felt discouraged. She encouraged the spreading of Islam and bringing people to Islam and taking part in [[Jihad]] for the sake of Islam. Her entire life was spent for the sake of Islam, leaving the throne of Madinah al Munawwara and travelling to India in spite of overwhelming difficulties.\n\n====Seyyida Rabi'aa Amma====\n[[File:Raabiyaamma1.jpg|thumb|left|140px|The tomb of Seyyida Rabiaa Amma]]\nSeyyidha Rabiaa was the sister of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibraheem Shaheed and the daughter of Badhusha Syed Ahmad who came along with him all the way from Madinah. Raabiyaa Amma was in her pregnancy when her brother Sulthan Syed Ebraaheem began his journey to India, leaving the throne of Madinah. At the time, all the members of the family advised Rabiya Amma not to leave Madinah. But she flatly refused to stay in Madhina and started along with her brother Shaheed and her new born infant zainab amma. Rabiyaa Amma is also called Jacha Bibi Amma by [[Urdu]] speaking people for her travelling to India immediately after delivering baby Zainab amma. During 12 years of Shaheed badusha's rule at Bouthiramanikkapattinam province, once on a Friday after [[Jumu'ah|Jumma prayers]] Shaheed Badusha the ruler was busy distributing food to the poor. A small troop of pandiyan soldiers waged a battle in the women area near by valinokkam. Seyyida Rabiaa amma covered her with veil fully and wore the war costume of her brother Badusha Nayagam, took sword in her hands and fought vigorously against those pandiyas. Looking at the dress, the pandiya soldiers believed that the king himself what fighting. But in fact it was his sister Seyyida Rabiaa amma who fought. Unable to withstand the attack of Rabiya amma a few soldiers were killed and a few escaped and the battle came to an end. Ever in the Islamic history, Rabiya amma was the first women to lead a battle and win it. The dharga of Raabiyaa Amma is located at the extreme eastern end of Ervadi's main dhargha campus. People entering Dhurgha campus from the eastern entrance can find the Durgha of Rabiya Amma nearby. It is one of the oldest Dhurgas in Ervadi Shariff. Men are not allowed inside the dhargah and females are allowed to stay. People afflicted with mental and magical illness throng the dargah in large numbers and find themselves cured mostly within forty days and nights.\n\n====Seyyida Zainab Syed Ali Fathima Amma====\n[[File:Zainabsyedalifathimaamma1.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The tomb of Seyyida Zainab Syed Ali Fathima Amma]]\nSeyyida Zainab was the wife of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, and the mother of Qutb Syed Aboothaahir Madni Shaheed. Shaheed Badhusha married Seyyida Zainab (Syed Ali Fathima as being referred now) being from a very illustrious and God fearing family in Madinah. Right from childhood, Seyyida Zainab was very God fearing and she was ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of [[Allah]]. She gave birth to two children, Badhusha Syed Aboothahir and Seyyidina Zainul Aabideen with the marriage of Badusha Naayagam. She brought up her children with the same degree of love for Islam as their parents and forefathers had had. When Qutb Syed Ebraahim Shaheed started for India, the two children were just entering youth, but still their [[Taqwa]], taught to them by their Holy mother, Seyyida Zainab @ Syed Ali Fatima, gave them sustenance. Zainab Syed Ali Fathima also insisted that their child recognize the importance of supporting their Holy father in spreading Islam. So, Zainab Syed Ali Fathima Amma's children also travelled with enthusiasm and reached India. In the war with the [[Pandiya]]s, Syed Aboothahir Shaheed was martyred, and when the Holy body of Qutb Aboothahir Madhni was brought before Seyyida Zainab, she was shocked to see more than 72 cuts from arrows on the face of her son who was just 17 years old, for no sake but for the sake of Allah. Since her son lost his life in this world, and the atrocities which he faced were only for the sake of Allah, Zainab  was very long-suffering, as her grandmother [[Zaynab bint Ali]] had been when seeing the atrocities of [[Karbala]]. This is the greatest Amal (good deed) of all, a seventeen-year-old son being killed by enemies before the eyes of a mother for no sake but Islam, this is the most devout deed toward Allah and this act of patience is incomparable. But still, when the Pandiyas were defeated and Badhusha Nayagam Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed captured the throne, Zainab Syed 'Ali Fathima Amma was enthroned as Empress. Having nothing more to live for in this world after the Shahadat of Qutb Abutahir, Zainab Syed A'li Fatima amma refused the throne, but still was made to do so, accepting it as the fate of Allah. Zainab Syed Alee Fathimaa Amma was the empress of Bouthiramanickapattinam province for more than twelve years. She attained [[wafat]] and was interred very close to the grave of her husband Sulthaan Syed Ibraaheem Shahidh Rali. Zainab Syed 'Alee Faathimaa Ammaa's Dhurgha can be found second from the western entrance of Erwadi's main dargha. Thousands of pilgrims daily and lakhs during festival time visit the grave of Zainab Syed A'lee Fathimah in faith that all their wishes will come true with [[Tawassul|waseela]]. Unmarried girls, childless women and ladies with fatal illnesses who are brought to the grave of Zainab Amma are said to have their wishes fulfilled in a very short time.\n\n====Syed Zainul Aabideen Shaheed====\nSyed Zainul aabideen Shahid is the brother in law of Qutb Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, the emperor. Zainul Aabideen shaheed was a stubborn supporter of Qutb Sultan Syed Ibraheem Shahid during his voyage and his war with pandiyas. He is the brother of Seyyida Zainab @ Syed Ali Fatima and uncle of the Prince Qutb Syed Abutahir madani Shahid. Bbadhusha Naayagam was very much comfortable during the war because of the presence of his brother in law Zainul Aabideen Shaheedh who withstanding the oppose from the enemies used different war tactics and gave useful suggestions regarding the war plan that fortified Shaheed badusha after the passing away of his holy son Syed Aboothair Shaheedh. The relationship between Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shaheedh and Zainul Aabidheen Shaheed was very much closely bonded. people who knew the history of Erwadi war will give the example of Shaheed badusha and Zainul Aabidheen shaheedh if two brothers in law are closely associated. Zainul Aabidheen was also killed in the war finally and attained martyrdom which was the final desire of everyone who travelled with Badusha nayagam. He was funered very closely to Janaab Shaheedh, and his Holy grave is found to the right of the Holy Grave of Shaheedh Badusha Nayagam in Erwadi Dargha main campus.\n\n====Syed Shamsuddin Makki Shaheed====\n[[File:Shamsuddinshahid.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Shamsuddin Shaheed Durga, Ervadi.]]\nShamsuddin Shahid was the Emperor of [[Makkah al-Mukarramah]], the holiest place of Muslims where the [[Ka'aba]]tullah shariff is located, during the time when Sultan Syed Ibrahim Shahid was ruling madinah and started towards India. Shamsuddin shaheed was one among the few who renounced their empire and their throne for the sake of Islam. Shamsuddeen Shahed gave up the throne of Makkah to join Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed to travel to South Asia to spread Islam. During his regime, people were very much calm and quiet performing the rituals of [[Hajj]] and the Empire Shamsudhdheen Shaheedh was fully involved in the service of Allah's home. Though Shamsuddeen was very much comfortable with the throne, his mind was fully surrounded by the thoughts of spreading Islam. So, when Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed wrote letter about his travel to India Shamsuddeen shaheedh whole heartedly accepted the offer and joined the group of Shahid Badushah with large number of his troops. During the voyage Shamsuddheen Shahid was fully along with Sahid badusha helping him all the way.\nAfter reaching India and during the course of war between the Arabs and Pandiyans Shamsuddeen Shahid's role was very vital. Being a king, Shamsuddeen Shaheed helped Badhushaah Nayagam a lot in strategising the course of the war. His suggestions worked many a time which finally gave victory to the Shaheed badhusha's troop. Shamsuddeen shahid was also killed by the Pandiya's in war and was funered very closely to the right side of Basha nayagam. As per Hazarat Shamsuddeen's order through dream, his grave is kept open to sunlight and rain to fall on it. The Holy grave of Shamsuddin shaheed is found adjacent on the left side of the Northern end of the main dargha and close to the Dargha shariff of his neighbours Syed Qamaruddin Shaheedh and Syed Nooruddin Shahidh who also came along with Shaamsuddeen Shaheed and Baasha Naayagam and died in the war with pandiyas.\n\n====Mujavir Muhammad Ibrahim - Nalla Ibrahim====\n[[File:Nallaibrahimvaliyullah..jpg|thumb|140px|left|Dargah of Mujavir Nalla Ibrahim Razi Erwadi.]]\nMujavir Muhammadh Ibrahim Waliyullah who is very well known as Mujavir Nalla Ibrahim is the 12th hereditary grandson of Badusha Sulthan syed ibrahim Shaheedh. He is the son of Seyyidina Mursal Ibrahim Shaheed whose grave is found in [[Thachu oorani]] in the [[East Coast Road]] between [[Keelakarai]] and [[ervadi]]. Descendants of Badusha Shaheedh nayagam were ruling the Bouthiramanikapattinam (now Ervadi) province for generations together according to the peace treaty with king Jamara kolakala pandiyan. A few centuries later again when they felt the odour of Islam is slowly vanishing from the Tamil soil, they decided to leave the throne and begin the Islamic campaign as their ancestor Badusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed did. They slowly started moving from one place to another in spreading Islam and bringing people in the daily duties of Islam. Badhusha Varushai Syed Ibrahim whose grave is found in [[Melakkal Kanavai]] in [[Madurai]] district is the Great grand father of Nalla Ibraheem waliyullah and his grandson Mursal Ibrahim Shaheedh's grave is found in Ramanathapuram District as mentioned above.\n\n=====In the service of his ancestor as a Mujavir=====\nNalla Ibrahim waliyullah was living peacefully in Kiliyur, [[Paramakudi]] [[Taluk]] of Ramanathapuram District doing Islamic campaign as all his forefathers did. Once, Nallaa Ibraahim waliyullah had a dream in which his forefather Badhusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahedh appeared and asked him to come to Erwadi to serve the people coming for [[Ziyarat]] to Erwadi. Waking up Suddenly, Nalla Ibraaheem waliyullah could realize his grandfather's wish and informed his wife about the journey. His wife who had settled in Kiliyoor was reluctant to start towards Erwadi. Nalla Ibrahim waliyullah persuaded and finally started alone to Erwadi to the service of his forefather. Lot of people started thronging Erwadi for Ziarat who all were ecstatic to see Shahedh badusha's heir Nalla Ibrahim bava in the service of Dharghah as a Mujawir.\n\n=====Wife refusing to come \u2013 A miracle of Badhusha Nayagam=====\nFollowing the order given by Sulthan Syed Ibrahim shaheedh to leave Kiliyoor and stay at Ervaadi to serve pilgrims, Mujavir Nallla Ibraheem bava planned to start from Kiliyur with family. But his wife was reluctant to join with Naalla Ibrahim for her love towards the current village Kiliyur. Baadusha nayagam was bit anger towards this attitude of his granddaughter and offered a different miracle to happen in the heirs of Mujavir Nalla Ibrahim and his spouse till [[Qiyamah]]. A few children will be born with reddish skin and golden hair to look as if like an English. Erwaadi, being an arid place people are fully black and it's even very rare to see folks with yellowish complexion. But till today in one can see people with British complexion in Erwadi who are from the heirs of Nalla Ibrahim Waliyullah happening because of the miracle of Shahid badusha. Shocked to hear this, Nalla Ibrahim waliyullah's wife accepted and joined with her husband to aervadi and served the people who came for Zi'arat. Had she not refused the first invitation, could have avoided her children with British complexion. But anyhow still this stands as evidence to the powers of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahid.\n\n=====Sethupathy's child and 6666 acres of land=====\nAfter Mujavir Mohamed Ibrahim nalla Ibrahim bava settled in Erwadi, lot of pilgrims started thronging Ervadi shariff. The [[karaamaat]] of Qutb Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Sahid was getting reached to people from various parts of India and people who came with different wishes to Erwadi saw it answered with the duaa of Shaheed nayagam. During the period of Nalla Ibrahim waliyullah the Ramnad province (called as Sethu Empire) was ruled by King Regunatha Sethupathy, who like the other sethupathy raja's had a close association with the Arabs (descendants of badhusha Nayagam) who ruled Bavithiramanickapattanam province. Sethupathy was longing for an offspring. Hearing about the miracles happening at Earvaadi dargha, the king along with his close associates visited the Holy Erwadi Dharga. Qutb Nala Ibrahim Waliyullah who was seated at Aerwadi received the king with greater enthusiasm and made him to stay there. Daily in the day on night Nalla Ibrahim bava offered oil from the lamp placed in the Ervadi dargah and some water taken from the pond near dargah and kept in the Rouza (Grave) of Syed ibraheem shahid. The Queen got conceived a son. The king was taken to the extreme of joy for the birth of Prince else his Empire would go into the hands of others. As a token of thanks and gratitude, the king donated 6666 acres of land (from Ithampadal to Thachan oorani) as Inam to Ervadi dargah. A portion of it is still maintained by the Dargha Huqdar Management Committee of Erwadi Dhargah.\n\n===Kattupalli Shuhadaas===\nKattupalli is one of the main places where the war between Pandyas and Arabs was held. It is also the graveyard of Arabs where the Dargahs of all important ministers of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed badhusha are found. It is in the northern side of the main dargah within 0.5&nbsp;km. Kattupalli is very spacious and it accommodates millions of people who gather during the Sandanakoodu urus festival.\n\n====Ameer Abbas Manthiri Shahid====\n[[File:Abbasshahid.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Abbas manthiri Shaheed Durga in Kattupalli, Erwadi.]]\nAmeer Abbas Razi was a minister in the then Islamic Government of Rome<ref>Page 132, of Then Pandi cheemai'iley authored by M.R.M.Abdur Raheem, and published by Kajiyar Publications [[Thanjavur]].</ref> while Sulthan Syed Ibrahim, the emperor of [[Medina]] wrote a letter to the Ruler of Rome, explaining the plan of travel to [[Hindustan]] obliging the order from grandfatherly ancestor Muhammad to spread Islam. The Roman ruler Sulthan Mahmood Badusha expressed his situation and sent a big troop of 1 lakh soldiers in the leadership of Ameer Abbas Manthiri Razi and they travelled to Madinah and joined Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed.\nIn the Bouthiramanickapattinam war which held between the Arabs and the pandiyas, Ameer Abbas Mandhiri and his troop killed a lot of pandiyans. In the Third war, Ameer Abbas manthiri was assassinated and attained martyrdom. Today, a highly sophisticated and well built Dargah of Ameer Abbas manthiri Shaheed is situated at the western entrance of kattupalli, with the separate Ziyarat khana for men and women.\n\n====Aboobakkar Abdul Hakim Doctor Shahid====\n[[File:hakimdrshahid.jpg|left|120px|thumb|Dargah of Hakeem Doctor Shahid.]]\nAboobakkar Abdul Hakeem Doctor [[Shahid|Shaheed]] is popularly known as Hakkeem Doctor Shaheed. He is the chief of the team of physicians for Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed badusha's troop which consisted Syed Ahmad Doctor from Rome, Yusuf Doctor Shaheed and Gailani Doctor Shaheed. Though a physician by profession, hakkim doctor was very strong in and brave to fight against the enemies of Islam. He was also killed in the battle of Bouthiramanickapattinam. Hakkem doctor allegedly exhibited many [[karaamaat]] (Miracles) after his shahaadat. A young lady by name Khatija from [[Malappuram]] district of Kerala who was suffering from [[brain tumor]] was left hopeless by the doctors since the surgery is risky and may lead to death. Frustrated to live, she came with an intention to spend her rest part of life in Ervadi dargah and stayed in Hakkem doctor Durgha. The 40th night, she had a dream in which Abubakkar Hakkim Doctor Shaheed appeared and performed a surgery on her brain. Morning when she woke up, she could see her head dressed with medications and some blood stains on it. Thousands of people gathered to see this [[miracle]] and it was published in the state level ''Tamil Daily'' newspaper and seeing this thousands of more diseased people started thronging Erwadi, Hakkeem Doctor Durgah.\n\n====Abdul Qadir Mujahid Shahid and Gazanfar Muhaiddin Shaheed====\n[[File:Kanakkedukkummandhirigal.jpg|right|120px|thumb|Kanakkedukkum Mandhririgal Dargah Kattupalli.]]\nThese two Shaheeds are important ministers in the ministry of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed Badusha in Madinah. They played a very vital role in the war between the pandiyas and the Arabs and killed a few hundreds of [[pandiya]]s. The second important minister from Shaheed Badhushaa's troop to be killed in the war was Abdul Qadir Shahid. He fought against the enemies even when his abdomen was torn and all its content was out. Still he tied it back and fought against the pandiya soldiers. That fetched him a respect to him in the war and after his death. Later Muhaidden shaheed stood with Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shahhed for a long time and he too attained [[martyrdom]]. These two shuhadaas' Qabr are found close to each other. They played a very main role in Erwadi durgah becoming a curing hub for supernatural diseases and diseases caused by [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Devil]]s and mental disorder caused due to it. Hence these two shuhadaas are called as '''''Kanakkedukkum Manthirigal'''''. It means that Ministers who take care of curing magical and devilish diseases. People who come to '''Ervadi dargah''' with the above complaints, write a ready written petition kept in the dargah and offer it to the Mujavir.\n\n====Veerar Abdullah Shahid====\n[[File:Veerarabdullah.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Dargah of Veerar Abdullah Shahid.]]\nAbdullah Shaheed is believed to be from [[Makkah Al Mukarramah]] and was a wonderful fighter in the troop of Shaheed badusha. He served under Shahid badusha through the course of the war till its end. veerar Abdulla Shahid was the one, who entered the throne of King Vickrama Pandiyan during the final phase of war and dismounted the pandiya's flag with a fish symbol and hoisted the Muslims' flag declaring to the world the defeat of [[pandiya]]s in the war. So, Abdullah Shaheed is called as ''Vetrik kodi nattiya veerar Abdullah Shaheed''. This act of capturing the throne is the utmost important deed during the course of the war. Since capturing the other's throne is considered as the real victory over the rivals during the war rituals those days. This was possible only by the Braveness and Smart war techniques of Shaji Abdullah Shaheed. The [[dargah]] of veerar Abdullah Shaheed is located at the centre of the kattupalli and is managed by the Mujavirs.\n\n====Zulfiqar Ali @ Chanthanapeer Shaheedh====\n[[File:Sandhanapeershaheed.jpg|120px|right|thumb|Zulfaqar Ali @ Sandhanapeer Shaheed Dhargah.]]\nZulfiqar Ali was a minister in the then Islamic Government of [[Istanbul]] while Sulthan Syed Ibrahim, the emperor of Madinah wrote to the Ruler of [[Turkey]], regarding the travel to Hindustan obliging the order from grandfatherly ancestor Muhammad to spread Islam there. Though the Turkish ruler was not able to join Shaheed Badusha, he sent a troop headed by Zulfiqar Ali and they travelled to Madinah and joined the troops of Shaheed badusha. In the bouthiramanickapattinam war against the pandiyans, Zulfiqaar Ali as the very name reflects fought very bravely and finally was killed by the pandiyas. He took part with Badusha nayagam in the earlier War of Sind and was made the Governor of sind after the victory by the troop of Badusha nayagam. He later joined with Badusha Nayagam to his travel to south India in the next phase and was martyred there in the war.\n\n=====Reason for the name sandanapeer=====\nThough the actual name being Zulfiqar Ali, he was very well known by the name Santhanapeer Shahid waliyullah. Zulfiqar Ali belonged to Turkey, which is a very cold country. He could not bear the heat of South India, and to overcome this, Zulfiqar Shaheed used to apply [[sandalwood]] paste in his entire body for chillness. Daily morning he used to apply and for this reason he was called by the local Tamil people at that time as '''''Sandanapeer''''' which means '''''The saint of Sandal'''''. Till today, Zulfaqar Shaheed is called by the name Santhanapeer Shaheed and even the dargah where his grave is found, in the kattupalli, is named as Chandanapeer Shahid dargah.\n\n====Syed Is'haq Shaheed-Sara Amma Safura Amma Durgah====\n[[File:Saraamma.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Sara Amma Safura Amma Dargah]]\nThis durgah is located outside the Kaattupalli dargah campus. This is located parallel to the southern entrance of kattuppalli and to the east of Main Durgah.

Reappointed after the Conservative success in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], she became the longest-serving Home Secretary in over 60 years.

Reappointed after the Conservative success in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], she became the longest-serving Home Secretary in over 60 years. During her tenure she pursued reform of the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]], implemented a harder line on drugs policy including the banning of [[khat]], oversaw the introduction of elected [[Police and Crime Commissioners]], the deportation of [[Abu Qatada]], the creation of the [[National Crime Agency]], and brought in [[Home Office hostile environment policy|additional restrictions on immigration]].<ref name=\"rentoul\">{{cite news |last=Rentoul |first=John |author-link=John Rentoul |date=1 July 2016 |title=Boring and competent Theresa May is what the nation needs after the shock of the Brexit vote |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |url-status=live |department=Voices |work=[[The Independent]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701191546/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |archivedate=1 July 2016 |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[David Cameron]] resigned, May was elected Conservative Party leader and became the UK's second female prime minister.

May survived a [[Next Conservative Party (UK) leadership election#12 December confidence vote|vote of no confidence from Conservative MPs]] in December 2018 and a [[2019 vote of confidence in the May ministry|Parliamentary vote of no confidence]] in January 2019.

In the 4th century BC, Cyprus was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and then ruled by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] until 58 BC, when it was incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]]. In the division of the Roman Empire [[Byzantine Empire#Christianization and partition of the Empire|around the 4th century AD]], the island was assigned to the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nRoman rule in Cyprus was interrupted in 649, when the Arab armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] invaded the island. Fighting over the island between the Muslims and Romans continued for several years, until in 668 the belligerents agreed to make Cyprus a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. This arrangement persisted for nearly 300 years, until a Byzantine army conquered the island in around 965. Cyprus would become a [[Cyprus (theme)|theme]] of the Byzantine Empire until the late 12th century.\n\nAfter an occupation by the [[Knights Templar]] and the rule of [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], the island in 1192 came under the rule of the [[Lusignans|Lusignan family]], who established the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]]. In February 1489 it was seized by the [[Republic of Venice]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Between September 1570 and August 1571 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} starting three centuries of Turkish rule over Cyprus.\n\nStarting in the early 19th century, ethnic Greeks of the island sought to bring about an end to almost 300 years of Ottoman rule and unite Cyprus with [[Greece]]. The United Kingdom took administrative control of the island in 1878, to prevent Ottoman possessions from falling under Russian control following the [[Cyprus Convention]], which led to the call for union with Greece (''[[enosis]]'') to grow louder.

From the beginning, and throughout their relationship, Grivas resented having to share leadership with the archbishop. Makarios, concerned about Grivas's extremism from their very first meeting, preferred to continue diplomatic efforts, particularly efforts to get the United Nations involved.

This resulted in the deaths of 387 British servicemen and personnel<ref>[http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org/roll UK casualties of war] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725102127/http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org/roll |date=25 July 2011 }} UK army personnel killed by Greek Cypriot EOKA militant organisation</ref> and some Greek Cypriots suspected of collaboration; in 2009, a memorial for the British soldiers killed by Greek Cypriot EOKA during 1955\u20131959 Cyprus Emergency was erected in [[Kyrenia]], Northern Cyprus.<ref>[http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org ]</ref> As a result of this a number of Greek Cypriots began to leave the police. This however did not affect the Colonial police force as they had already created the solely Turkish Cypriot (Epicourical) reserve force to fight EOKA paramilitaries. At the same time, it led to tensions between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. In 1957 the Turkish Resistance Organisation (''T\u00fcrk Mukavemet'' ''Te\u015fkilat\u0131'' [[Turkish Resistance Organisation|TMT]]), which had already been formed to protect the Turkish Cypriots from EOKA, took action. In response to the growing demand for ''enosis'', a number of Turkish Cypriots became convinced that the only way to protect their interests and identity of the Turkish Cypriot population in the event of ''enosis'' would be to divide the island \u2013 a policy known as ''taksim'' (\"partition\" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] borrowed from (\u062a\u0642\u0633\u06cc\u0645)\"Taqs\u012bm\" in [[Arabic Language|Arabic]]) \u2013 into a Greek sector in the south and a Turkish sector in the north.\n\n===Establishment of the constitution===\nBy now the island was on the verge of civil war. Several attempts to present a compromise settlement had failed. Therefore, beginning in December 1958, representatives of Greece and Turkey, the so-called \"mother lands\" opened discussions of the Cyprus issue. Participants for the first time discussed the concept of an independent Cyprus, i.e., neither ''enosis'' nor ''taksim''. Subsequent talks always headed by the British yielded a so-called compromise agreement supporting independence, laying the foundations of the Republic of Cyprus. The scene then naturally shifted to London, where the Greek and Turkish representatives were joined by representatives of the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots (represented by Arch. Makarios and [[Dr Fazil Kucuk]] with no significant decision making power), and the British. The Z\u00fcrich-London agreements that became the basis for the Cyprus constitution of 1960 were supplemented with three treaties \u2013 the Treaty of Establishment, the Treaty of Guarantee, and the Treaty of Alliance. The general tone of the agreements was one of keeping the British sovereign bases and military and monitoring facilities intact. Some Greek Cypriots, especially members of organisations such as [[EOKA]], expressed disappointment because ''enosis'' had not been attained. In a similar way some Turkish Cypriots especially members of organisations such as TMT expressed their disappointment as they had to postpone their target for ''taksim'', however most Cypriots that were not influenced by the three so called guarantor powers (Greece, Turkey, and Britain), welcomed the agreements and set aside their demand for ''enosis'' and ''taksim''. According to the Treaty of Establishment, Britain retained sovereignty over 256 square kilometres, which became the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area]], to the northeast of [[Larnaca]], and the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area]] to the southwest of [[Limassol]].\n\nCyprus achieved independence on 16 August 1960.\n\n==Independence, constitutional breakdown, and intercommunal talks, 1960\u20131974==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Makarios III and Robert F.

General executive authority was vested in a [[Cabinet (government)|council of ministers]] with a ratio of seven Greeks to three Turks. (The Greek Cypriots represented 78% of the population and the Turkish Cypriots 18%. The remaining 4% was made up by the three minority communities: the Latins, [[Maronite]]s and [[Armenians]].) A [[House of Representatives]] of fifty members, also with a seven-to-three ratio, were to be separately elected by communal balloting on a [[universal suffrage]] basis. In addition, separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot Communal Chambers were provided to exercise control in matters of religion, culture, and education. According to Article 78(2) \"any law imposing duties or taxes shall require a simple majority of the representatives elected by the Greek and Turkish communities respectively taking part in the vote\". Legislation on other subjects was to take place by simple majority but again the President and the Vice-President had the same right of veto\u2014absolute on foreign affairs, defence and internal security, delaying on other matters\u2014as in the Council of Ministers. The judicial system would be headed by a Supreme [[Constitutional Court]], composed of one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot and presided over by a contracted judge from a neutral country. The Constitution of Cyprus, whilst establishing an Independent and sovereign Republic, was, in the words of [[Stanley Alexander de Smith|de Smith]], an authority on Constitutional Law, \"Unique in its tortuous complexity and in the multiplicity of the safeguards that it provides for the principal minority; the Constitution of Cyprus stands alone among the constitutions of the world\".<ref name=\"Humanrights.coe.int\">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrights.coe.int/minorities/eng/FrameworkConvention/StateReports/1999/cyprus/B.htm |title=Report Submitted By Cyprus \u2013 Recent Political History And Developments |publisher=Humanrights.coe.int |accessdate=22 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125115646/http://www.humanrights.coe.int/minorities/eng/FrameworkConvention/StateReports/1999/cyprus/B.htm |archive-date=25 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nWithin a short period of time the first disputes started to arise between the two communities. Issues of contention included taxation and the creation of separate municipalities. Because of the legislative veto system, this resulted in a lockdown in communal and state politics in many cases.\n\n===Crisis of 1963\u20131964===\n{{Main|Cyprus crisis of 1963\u201364}}\nRepeated attempts to solve the disputes failed. Eventually, on 30 November 1963, [[Makarios III|Makarios]] put forward to the three guarantors a [[13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|thirteen-point proposal]] designed, in his view, to eliminate impediments to the functioning of the government. The [[13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|thirteen points]] involved constitutional revisions, including the abandonment of the veto power by both the president and the vice president. Turkey initially rejected it (although later in future discussed the proposal). A few days later, on [[Bloody Christmas (1963)]] 21 December 1963 fighting erupted between the communities in [[Nicosia]]. In the days that followed it spread across the rest of the island. At the same time, the power-sharing government collapsed. How this happened is one of the most contentious issues in modern Cypriot history. The Greek Cypriots argue that the Turkish Cypriots withdrew in order to form their own administration. The Turkish Cypriots maintain that they were forced out. Many Turkish Cypriots chose to withdraw from the government. However, in many cases those who wished to stay in their jobs were prevented from doing so by the Greek Cypriots. Also, many of the Turkish Cypriots refused to attend because they feared for their lives after the recent violence that had erupted. There was even some pressure from the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation|TMT]] as well. In any event, in the days that followed the fighting a frantic effort was made to calm tensions. In the end, on 27 December 1963, an interim peacekeeping force, the Joint Truce Force, was put together by Britain, Greece and Turkey. After the partnership government collapsed, the Greek Cypriot led administration was recognized as the legitimate government of the Republic of Cyprus at the stage of the debates in New York in February 1964.<ref>[http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/03/09/unficyp-a-living-fossil-of-the-cold-war Cyprus-Mail, 09.03.2014] UNFICYP: a living fossil of the Cold War</ref> The Joint Truce Force held the line until a [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force, [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UNFICYP]], was formed following [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186]], passed on 4 March 1964.\n\n===Peacemaking efforts, 1964\u20131974===\nAt the same time as it established a peacekeeping force, the Security Council also recommended that the Secretary-General, in consultation with the parties and the Guarantor Powers, designate a mediator to take charge of formal peacemaking efforts. [[U Thant]], then the UN Secretary-General, appointed [[Sakari Tuomioja]], a Finnish diplomat. While Tuomioja viewed the problem as essentially international in nature and saw ''[[enosis]]'' as the most logical course for a settlement, he rejected union on the grounds that it would be inappropriate for a UN official to propose a solution that would lead to the dissolution of a UN member state. The United States held a differing view. In early June, following another Turkish threat to intervene, Washington launched an independent initiative under [[Dean Acheson]], a former Secretary of State. In July he presented a plan to unite Cyprus with Greece. In return for accepting this, Turkey would receive a sovereign military base on the island. The Turkish Cypriots would also be given minority rights, which would be overseen by a resident international commissioner. [[Makarios III|Makarios]] rejected the proposal, arguing that giving Turkey territory would be a limitation on ''enosis'' and would give Ankara too strong a say in the island's affairs. A second version of the plan was presented that offered Turkey a 50-year lease on a base. This offer was rejected by the Greek Cypriots and by Turkey. After several further attempts to reach an agreement, the United States was eventually forced to give up its effort.\n\nFollowing the sudden death of Ambassador Tuomioja in August, [[Galo Plaza]] was appointed Mediator. He viewed the problem in communal terms. In March 1965 he presented a report criticising both sides for their lack of commitment to reaching a settlement. While he understood the Greek Cypriot aspiration of ''enosis'', he believed that any attempt at union should be held in voluntary abeyance. Similarly, he considered that the Turkish Cypriots should refrain from demanding a federal solution to the problem. Although the Greek Cypriots eventually accepted the report, despite its opposition to immediate ''enosis'', Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots rejected the plan, calling on Plaza to resign on the grounds that he had exceeded his mandate by advancing specific proposals. He was simply meant to broker an agreement. But the Greek Cypriots made it clear that if Galo Plaza resigned they would refuse to accept a replacement. U Thant was left with no choice but to abandon the mediation effort. Instead he decided to make his Good Offices available to the two sides via resolution 186 of 4 March 1964 and a Mediator was appointed. In his Report (S/6253, A/6017, 26 March 1965), the Mediator, Dr Gala Plaza, criticised the 1960 legal framework, and proposed necessary amendments which were rejected by Turkey, a fact which resulted in serious deterioration of the situation with constant threats by Turkey against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus, necessitating a series of UN Resolutions calling, inter alia, for respect of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.<ref name=\"Humanrights.coe.int\" />\n\nThe end of the mediation effort was effectively confirmed when, at the end of the year, Plaza resigned and was not replaced.\n\nIn March 1966, a more modest attempt at peacemaking was initiated under the auspices of Carlos Bernades, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Cyprus. Instead of trying to develop formal proposals for the parties to bargain over, he aimed to encourage the two sides agree to settlement through direct dialogue. However, ongoing political chaos in Greece prevented any substantive discussions from developing. The situation changed the following year.\n\nOn 21 April 1967, a [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|coup d'\u00e9tat in Greece brought to power a military administration]]. Just months later, in November 1967, Cyprus witnessed its most severe bout of intercommunal fighting since 1964. Responding to a major attack on Turkish Cypriot villages in the south of the island, which left 27 dead, Turkey bombed Greek Cypriot forces and appeared to be readying itself for an intervention. Greece was forced to capitulate. Following international intervention, Greece agreed to recall General [[George Grivas]], the Commander of the Greek [[Cypriot National Guard]] and former EOKA leader, and reduce its forces on the island. Capitalising on the weakness of the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own provisional administration on 28 December 1967. Makarios immediately declared the new administration illegal. Nevertheless, a major change had occurred. The Archbishop, along with most other Greek Cypriots, began to accept that the Turkish Cypriots would have to have some degree of political autonomy. It was also realised that unification of Greece and Cyprus was unachievable under the prevailing circumstances.\n\nIn May 1968, intercommunal talks began between the two sides under the auspices of the Good Offices of the UN Secretary-General. Unusually, the talks were not held between President Makarios and Vice-President Kucuk. Instead they were conducted by the presidents of the communal chambers, [[Glafcos Clerides]] and [[Rauf Denkta\u015f]]. Again, little progress was made. During the first round of talks, which lasted until August 1968, the Turkish Cypriots were prepared to make several concessions regarding constitutional matters, but Makarios refused to grant them greater autonomy in return. The second round of talks, which focused on local government, was equally unsuccessful. In December 1969 a third round of discussion started. This time they focused on constitutional issues. Yet again there was little progress and when they ended in September 1970 the Secretary-General blamed both sides for the lack of movement. A fourth and final round of intercommunal talks also focused on constitutional issues, but again failed to make much headway before they were forced to a halt in 1974.\n\n==1974 Greek coup d'etat and Turkish invasion==\n\n{{Main|Timeline of events in Cyprus, 1974|1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Military operations during the Invasion of Cyprus (1974)}}\n\nIntercommunal strife was also overshadowed during this period by a serious rift on the Greek side, between Makarios and the [[enosis]]t National Front supported by the Greek military junta. Makarios had now become an obstacle to enosis. An attempt was made on his life, and Grivas returned in 1971 to head a new organisation, [[EOKA-B]], with Makarios, rather than the Turkish-Cypriots, in its sight. Makarios was told from Athens to dismiss his foreign minister and to regard Athens as the National Centre. Makarios rallied supporters successfully against attempts to remove him. He was still popular in Cyprus.\n\nMatters became worse when a new junta came to power in September 1973, and there was less relief from rightist pressure than might have been expected when Grivas died suddenly in January 1974. The pressure mounted until a peace operation in July 1974 allegedly led by a 'hammer of the Turks' [[Nikos Sampson]], overthrew Makarios, who managed to flee the country via a British base. For Turkey this raised the spectre of Greek control of Cyprus.\n\nThe Turkish government therefore now demanded that Greece should dismiss Sampson, withdraw all Greek officers from the island and respect the island's independence. The Greek military government refused. For the United States, Kissinger did not seem to be greatly disturbed by the Sampson coup and looked as if he could accept enosis. Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit's assertiveness in foreign policy, reinforced by his junior coalition partner strongly inclined the Turks to intervene. The British were invited to participate in military operations, under the Treaty of Guarantee, but declined. The American envoy Joseph Sisco tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Greek military government to accept Ecevit's conditions for a Cyprus settlement, which included Turkish-Cypriot control of a coastal region in the north and negotiations for a federal solution. The Soviet Union stood aside not wanting to see enosis, which would strengthen NATO and weaken the left in Cyprus.\n\nAfter failing to secure British support for a joint intervention under the Treaty of Guarantee, [[B\u00fclent Ecevit]], the Turkish prime minister, decided to act unilaterally. On 20 July Turkey ordered a [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|military invasion of the island]]. Within two days, Turkish forces had established a narrow corridor linking the north coast with Nicosia. The intervention led to turmoil in Greece. On 23 July, the military junta collapsed.\n\nLaunched with relatively few troops, the Turkish landing had limited success at first, and resulted everywhere on the island in the occupation of Turkish-Cypriot enclaves by the Greek forces. After securing a more or less satisfactory bridgehead Turkish forces agreed to a cease-fire on 23 July 1974. The same day civilian government under Karamanlis took office in Athens, the day the Sampson coup collapsed. Glafcos Clerides became the Acting President in absence still of Makarios.\n\nTwo days later formal peace talks were convened in [[Geneva]] between Greece, Turkey and Britain. Over the course of the following five days Turkey agreed to halt its advance on the condition that it would remain on the island until a political settlement was reached between the two sides. Meanwhile, Turkish troops did not refrain from extending their positions, as more Turkish-Cypriot enclaves were occupied by Greek forces. A new cease-fire line was agreed. On 30 July the powers agreed that the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island should be linked to a 'just and lasting settlement acceptable to all parties concerned'. The declaration also spoke of 'two autonomous administrations -that of Greek-Cypriot community and that of the Turkish-Cypriot community'. On 8 August another round of discussion was held in Geneva, Switzerland. Unlike before, this time the talks involved the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. During the discussions the Turkish Cypriots, supported by Turkey, insisted on some form of geographical separation between the two communities. [[Makarios III|Makarios]] refused to accept the demand, insisting that Cyprus must remain a unitary state. Despite efforts to break the deadlock, the two sides refused to budge. On 14 August, Turkey demanded from Clerides acceptance of a proposal for a [[federation|federal state]], in which the Turkish Cypriot community (who, at that time, comprised about 18% of the population and owned about 10% of the land) would have received 34% of the island. Clerides asked for 36 to 48 hours to consult with the Cypriot and Greek governments, but Turkey refused to grant any consultation time, effectively ending the talks. Within hours, Turkey had resumed its second offensive. By the time a new, and permanent, ceasefire was called 36 per cent of the island was under the control of the Turkish military. The partition was marked by the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus]] or \"green line\" running east to west across the island.\n\nThe effect of the division was catastrophic for all concerned. Thousands of Greek and Turkish Cypriots had been killed, wounded or missing. A further two hundred thousand Greek and Turkish Cypriots had been displaced. In addition to the entire north coast (Kerynia, Morfou) and the Karpas peninsula, the Greek Cypriots were also forced to flee the eastern port city of [[Famagusta]]. The vast majority of the Turkish occupied area was predominantly populated and owned by Greek Cypriots prior to 1974.\nIn the process about 160,000<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www02.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa.nsf/FEB4D72828085695C2256FD50031BF1E/$FILE/MEMOResponse10.3.05.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614123038/http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa.nsf/FEB4D72828085695C2256FD50031BF1E/$FILE/MEMOResponse10.3.05.doc |archive-date=14 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \u2013 200,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/32.htm |title=Cyprus \u2013 Refugees and Social Reconstruction |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=22 March 2009}}</ref> Greek Cypriots who made up 82% of the population in the north became [[refugee]]s; many of them fleeing at the word of the approaching Turkish army. Since 1974, the ceasefire line separates the two communities on the island, and is commonly referred to as the Green Line<ref>{{Citation|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|title=Introduction: Becoming a Man in a Post-conflict Society|date=2019|work=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|volume=|pages=17|publisher=Springer International Publishing|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-14702-0_1|isbn=978-3-030-14701-3}}</ref>. The United Nations consented to the transfer of the remainder of the 51,000 Turkish Cypriots that were trapped in the south to settle in the north, if they wished to do so. Many of them had previously moved to the areas under UK sovereign control awaiting permission to be transferred to the areas under Turkish control.\n\n==The divided island 1974\u20131997==\n[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|Control of the island by different parties, super-imposed upon the claimed administrative boundaries of the Republic of Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus claims sovereignty of all the areas except the British bases (in green), but the dark pink areas are controlled by Northern Cyprus, and the blue buffer zone is administered by the United Nations.]]\nAt the second Geneva Conference on 9 August, Turkey pressed for a federal solution to the problem against stiffening Greek resistance. Whilst Turkish Cypriots wanted a bi-zonal federation, Turkey, under American advice, submitted a cantonal plan involving separation of Turkish-Cypriot areas from one another. For security reasons Turkish-Cypriots did not favour cantons. Each plan embraced about thirty-four per cent of the territory.\n\nThese plans were presented to the conference on 13 August by the Turkish Foreign Minister, [[Turan G\u00fcne\u015f]]. Clerides wanted thirty-six to forty-eight hours to consider the plans, but G\u00fcne\u015f demanded an immediate response. This was regarded as unreasonable by the Greeks, the British, and the Americans, who were in close consultation. Nevertheless, the next day, the Turkish forces extended their control to some 36 per cent of the island, afraid that delay would turn international opinion strongly against them.\n\nTurkey's international reputation suffered as a result of the precipitate move of the Turkish military to extend control to a third of the island. The British prime minister regarded the Turkish ultimatum as unreasonable since it was presented without allowing adequate time for study. In Greek eyes, the Turkish proposals were submitted in the full awareness that the Greek side could not accept them, and reflected the Turkish desire for a military base in Cyprus. The Greek side has gone some way in their proposals by recognising Turkish 'groups' of villages and Turkish administrative 'areas'. But they stressed that the constitutional order of Cyprus should retain its bi-communal character based on the co-existence of the Greek and Turkish communities within the framework of a sovereign, independent and integral republic. Essentially the Turkish side's proposals were for geographic consolidation and separation and for a much larger measure of autonomy for that area, or those areas, than the Greek side could envisage.\n\n===1975\u20131979===\nOn 28 April 1975, [[Kurt Waldheim]], the UN Secretary-General, launched a new mission of [[good offices]]. Starting in Vienna, over the course of the following ten months Clerides and Denkta\u015f discussed a range of humanitarian issues relating to the events of the previous year. However, attempts to make progress on the substantive issues \u2013 such as territory and the nature of the central government \u2013 failed to produce any results. After five rounds the talks fell apart in February 1976. In January 1977, the UN managed to organise a meeting in Nicosia between [[Makarios III|Makarios]] and [[Rauf Denkta\u015f|Denkta\u015f]]. This led to a major breakthrough. On 12 February, the two leaders signed a four-point agreement confirming that a future Cyprus settlement would be based on a federation. The size of the states would be determined by economic viability and land ownership. The central government would be given powers to ensure the unity of the state. Various other issues, such as freedom of settlement and freedom of movement, would be settled through discussion. Just months later, in August 1977, [[Makarios III|Makarios]] died. He was replaced by [[Spyros Kyprianou]], the foreign minister.\n\nIn 1979 the [[ABC plan (Cyprus)|ABC plan]] was presented by the USA, as a proposal for a permanent solution of the Cyprus problem. It projected a Bicommunal Bizonal Federation with a strong central government. It was first rejected by the Greek Cypriot leader Spyros Kyprianou and later by Turkey.{{sfn|Kordoni|2016|p=28}}{{sfn|Michael|2015|p=229}}\n\nIn May 1979, Waldheim visited Cyprus and secured a further ten-point set of proposals from the two sides. In addition to re-affirming the 1977 High-Level Agreement, the ten points also included provisions for the demilitarisation of the island and a commitment to refrain from destabilising activities and actions. Shortly afterwards a new round of discussions began in Nicosia. Again, they were short-lived. For a start, the Turkish Cypriots did not want to discuss [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], a resort quarter of Famagusta that had been vacated by Greek Cypriots when it was overrun by Turkish troops. This was a key issue for the Greek Cypriots. Second, the two sides failed to agree on the concept of 'bicommunality'. The Turkish Cypriots believed that the Turkish Cypriot federal state would be exclusively Turkish Cypriot and the Greek Cypriot state would be exclusively Greek Cypriot. The Greek Cypriots believed that the two states should be predominantly, but not exclusively, made up of a particular community.\n\n===Turkish Cypriots' declaration of independence===\n{{Politics of Northern Cyprus}}\nIn May 1983, an effort by [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]], then UN Secretary-General, foundered after the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of all occupation forces from Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriots were furious at the resolution, threatening to declare independence in retaliation. Despite this, in August, P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar gave the two sides a set of proposals for consideration that called for a rotating presidency, the establishment of a bicameral assembly along the same lines as previously suggested, and 60:40 representation in the central executive. In return for increased representation in the central government, the Turkish Cypriots would surrender 8\u201313 per cent of the land in their possession. Both Kyprianou and Denkta\u015f accepted the proposals. However, on 15 November 1983, the Turkish Cypriots took advantage of the post-election political instability in Turkey and [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|unilaterally declared independence]]. Within days the [[Security Council]] passed a resolution, no.541 (13\u20131 vote: only [[Pakistan]] opposed) making it clear that it would not accept the new state and that the decision disrupted efforts to reach a settlement. Denkta\u015f denied this. In a letter addressed to the Secretary-General informing him of the decision, he insisted that the move guaranteed that any future settlement would be truly federal in nature. Although the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' (TRNC) was soon recognised by [[Turkey]], the rest of the international community condemned the move. The [[Security Council]] passed another resolution, no.550<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.int/cyprus/scr550.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506115414/http://www.un.int/cyprus/scr550.htm |archivedate=6 May 2012  }}</ref> (13\u20131 vote: again only [[Pakistan]] opposed) condemning the \"purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership\".\n\nIn September 1984, talks resumed. After three rounds of discussions it was again agreed that Cyprus would become a bi-zonal, bi-communal, non-aligned federation. The Turkish Cypriots would retain 29 per cent for their federal state and all foreign troops would leave the island. In January 1985, the two leaders met for their first face-to-face talks since the 1979 agreement. However, while the general belief was that the meeting was being held to agree to a final settlement, Kyprianou insisted that it was a chance for further negotiations. The talks collapsed. In the aftermath, the Greek Cypriot leaders came in for heavy criticism, both at home and abroad. After that Denkta\u015f announced that he would not make so many concessions again. Undeterred, in March 1986, de Cu\u00e9llar presented the two sides with a [http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/draft%20agreement%201986.htm/ Draft Framework Agreement]. Again, the plan envisaged the creation of an independent, non-aligned, bi-communal, bi-zonal state in Cyprus. However, the Greek Cypriots were unhappy with the proposals. They argued that the questions of removing Turkish forces from Cyprus was not addressed, nor was the repatriation of the increasing number of Turkish settlers on the island. Moreover, there were no guarantees that the full three freedoms would be respected. Finally, they saw the proposed state structure as being confederal in nature. Further efforts to produce an agreement failed as the two sides remained steadfastly attached to their positions.\n\n===The \"Set of Ideas\"===\nIn August 1988, P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar called upon the two sides to meet with him in Geneva in August. There the two leaders \u2013 [[George Vasiliou]] and [[Rauf Denkta\u015f]] \u2013 agreed to abandon the Draft Framework Agreement and return to the 1977 and 1979 High Level Agreements. However, the talks faltered when the Greek Cypriots announced their intention to apply for membership of the [[European Community]] (EC, subsequently EU), a move strongly opposed by the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey. Nevertheless, in June 1989, de Cuellar presented the two communities with the \"Set of Ideas\". Denkta\u015f quickly rejected them as he not only opposed the provisions, he also argued that the UN Secretary-General had no right to present formal proposals to the two sides. The two sides met again, in New York, in February 1990. However, the talks were again short lived. This time Denkta\u015f demanded that the Greek Cypriots recognise the existence of two peoples in Cyprus and the basic right of the Turkish Cypriots to self-determination.\n\nOn 4 July 1990, Cyprus formally applied to join the EC. The Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which had applied for membership in 1987, were outraged. Denkta\u015f claimed that Cyprus could only join the Community at the same time as Turkey and called off all talks with UN officials. Nevertheless, in September 1990, the EC member states unanimously agreed to refer the Cypriot application to the Commission for formal consideration. In retaliation, Turkey and the TRNC signed a joint declaration abolishing passport controls and introducing a customs union just weeks later. Undeterred, [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] continued his search for a solution throughout 1991. He made no progress. In his last report to the Security Council, presented in October 1991 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 716]], he blamed the failure of the talks on Denkta\u015f, noting the Turkish Cypriot leader's demand that the two communities should have equal sovereignty and a right to secession.\n\nOn 3 April 1992, [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], the new UN Secretary-General, presented the Security Council with the outline plan for the creation of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation that would prohibit any form of partition, secession or union with another state. While the Greek Cypriots accepted the Set of Ideas as a basis for negotiation, Denkta\u015f again criticised the UN Secretary-General for exceeding his authority. When he did eventually return to the table, the Turkish Cypriot leader complained that the proposals failed to recognise his community. In November, Ghali brought the talks to a halt. He now decided to take a different approach and tried to encourage the two sides to show goodwill by accepting eight [[confidence building measures]] (CBMs). These included reducing military forces on the island, transferring [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]] to direct UN control, reducing restrictions on contacts between the two sides, undertaking an island-wide census and conducting feasibility studies regarding a solution. The Security Council endorsed the approach.\n\nOn 24 May 1993, the Secretary-General formally presented the two sides with his CBMs. Denkta\u015f, while accepting some of the proposals, was not prepared to agree to the package as a whole. Meanwhile, on 30 June, the European Commission returned its opinion on the Cypriot application for membership. While the decision provided a ringing endorsement of the case for Cypriot membership, it refrained from opening the way for immediate negotiations. The Commission stated that it felt that the issue should be reconsidered in January 1995, taking into account \"the positions adopted by each party in the talks\". A few months later, in December 1993, [[Glafcos Clerides]] proposed the demilitarisation of Cyprus. Denkta\u015f dismissed the idea, but the next month he announced that he would be willing to accept the CBMs in principle. [[Proximity talks]] started soon afterwards. In March 1994, the UN presented the two sides with a draft document outlining the proposed measures in greater detail. Clerides said that he would be willing to accept the document if Denkta\u015f did, but the Turkish Cypriot leader refused on the grounds that it would upset the balance of forces on the island. Once again, Ghali had little choice but to pin the blame for another breakdown of talks on the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas would be willing to accept mutually agreed changes, but Clerides refused to negotiate any further changes to the March proposals. Further proposals put forward by the Secretary-General in an attempt to break the deadlock were rejected by both sides.\n\n===Deadlock and legal battles, 1994\u20131997===\nAt the [[Corfu]] [[European Council]], held on 24\u201325 June 1994, the EU officially confirmed that Cyprus would be included in the Union's next phase of enlargement. Two weeks later, on 5 July, the [[European Court of Justice]] imposed restrictions on the export of goods from Northern Cyprus into the [[European Union]]. Soon afterwards, in December, relations between the EU and Turkey were further damaged when Greece blocked the final implementation of a customs union. As a result, talks remained completely blocked throughout 1995 and 1996.\n\nIn December 1996, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) delivered a landmark ruling that declared that Turkey was an occupying power in Cyprus. The case \u2013 [[Loizidou v. Turkey]] \u2013 centred on Titina Loizidou, a refugee from [[Kyrenia]], who was judged to have been unlawfully denied the control of her property by Turkey. The case also had severe financial implications as the Court later ruled that Turkey should pay Mrs Loizidou US$825,000 in compensation for the loss of use of her property. Ankara rejected the ruling as politically motivated.\n\nAfter twenty years of talks, a settlement seemed as far off as ever. However, the basic parameters of a settlement were by now internationally agreed. Cyprus would be a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. A solution would also be expected to address the following issues:\n* Constitutional framework\n* Territorial adjustments\n* Return of property to pre-1974 owners and/or compensation payments\n* Return of displaced persons\n* Demilitarisation of Cyprus\n* Residency rights/repatriation of Turkish settlers\n* Future peacekeeping arrangements\n\n====August 1996 incidents====\nIn August 1996, Greek [[Cypriot refugees]] demonstrated with a motorcycle protest in [[Deryneia]] against the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Turkish occupation]] of Cyprus.

The crisis effectively ended in December 1998 with the decision of the Cypriot government to transfer the S-300s to [[Crete]], in exchange for alternative weapons from [[Greece]].\n\n==EU accession and the settlement process, 1997\u2013present==\n[[File:Map of Cyprus, Greece and Turkey.svg|thumb|{{legend|#07ef00|Under the control of the [[Republic of Cyprus]]}}\n{{legend|#f7991c|The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]}}\n{{legend|#ff0000|[[Turkey]]}}\n{{legend|#007efc|[[Greece]]}}]]\nIn 1997 the basic parameters of the Cyprus Dispute changed. A decision by the [[European Union]] to open up accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus created a new catalyst for a settlement. Among those who supported the move, the argument was made that Turkey could not have a veto on Cypriot accession and that the negotiations would encourage all sides to be more moderate. However, opponents of the move argued that the decision would remove the incentive of the Greek Cypriots to reach a settlement. They would instead wait until they became a member and then use this strength to push for a settlement on their terms. In response to the decision, Rauf Denkta\u015f announced that he would no longer accept federation as a basis for a settlement. In the future he would only be prepared to negotiate on the basis of a confederal solution. In December 1999 tensions between Turkey and the European Union eased somewhat after the EU decided to declare Turkey a candidate for EU membership, a decision taken at the Helsinki European Council. At the same time a new round of talks started in New York. These were short lived. By the following summer they had broken down. Tensions started to rise again as a showdown between Turkey and the European Union loomed over the island's accession.\n\nPerhaps realising the gravity of the situation, and in a move that took observers by surprise, [[Rauf Denkta\u015f]] wrote to [[Glafcos Clerides]] on 8 November 2001 to propose a face-to-face meeting. The offer was accepted. Following several informal meetings between the two men in November and December 2001 a new peace process started under UN auspices on 14 January 2002. At the outset the stated aim of the two leaders was to try to reach an agreement by the start of June that year. However, the talks soon became deadlocked. In an attempt to break the impasse, [[Kofi Annan]], the UN Secretary-General visited the island in May that year. Despite this no deal was reached. After a summer break Annan met with the two leaders again that autumn, first in Paris and then in New York. As a result of the continued failure to reach an agreement, the Security Council agreed that the Secretary-General should present the two sides with a blueprint settlement. This would form the basis of further negotiations. The original version of the UN peace plan was presented to the two sides by Annan on 11 November 2002. A little under a month later, and following modifications submitted by the two sides, it was revised (Annan II). It was hoped that this plan would be agreed by the two sides on the margins of the European Council, which was held in [[Copenhagen]] on 13 December. However, Rauf Denkta\u015f, who was recuperating from major heart surgery, declined to attend. The EU therefore decided to confirm that Cyprus would join the EU on 1 May 2004, along with [[Malta]] and eight other states from [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe.\n\n[[File:Border between nort and south cyprus Nicosia.JPG|thumb|The North-South checkpoint has been open since 2003]]\nAlthough it had been expected that talks would be unable to continue, discussions resumed in early January 2003. Thereafter, a further revision (Annan III) took place in February 2003, when Annan made a second visit to the island. During his stay he also called on the two sides to meet with him again the following month in [[The Hague]], where he would expect their answer on whether they were prepared to put the plan to a referendum. While the Greek Cypriot side, which was now led by [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], agreed to do so, albeit reluctantly, [[Rauf Denkta\u015f]] refused to allow a popular vote. The peace talks collapsed. A month later, on 16 April 2003, Cyprus formally signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2003|EU Treaty of Accession]] at a ceremony in [[Athens]].\n\nThroughout the rest of the year there was no effort to restart talks. Instead, attention turned to the [[Elections in Northern Cyprus|Turkish Cypriot elections]], which were widely expected to see a victory by moderate pro-solution parties. In the end, the assembly was evenly split. A coalition administration was formed that brought together the pro-solution [[Republican Turkish Party|CTP]] and the [[Democratic Party (Northern Cyprus)|Democrat Party]], which had traditionally taken the line adopted by Rauf Denkta\u015f. This opened the way for Turkey to press for new discussions. After a meeting between [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] and [[Kofi Annan]] in Switzerland, the leaders of the two sides were called to New York. There they agreed to start a new negotiation process based on two phases: phase one, which would just involve the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, being held on the island and phase two, which would also include Greece and Turkey, being held elsewhere. After a month of negotiations in Cyprus, the discussions duly moved to Burgenstock, Switzerland. The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denkta\u015f rejected the plan outright and refused to attend these talks. Instead, his son [[Serdar Denkta\u015f]] and [[Mehmet Ali Talat]] attended in his place. There a fourth version of the plan was presented. This was short-lived. After final adjustments, a fifth and final version of the Plan was presented to the two sides on 31 March 2004.\n\n===The UN plan for settlement (Annan Plan)===\n{{Main|Annan Plan for Cyprus}}\n[[File:Proposed flag of the United Cyprus Republic.svg|thumb|left|190px|Proposed flag of the United Republic of Cyprus]]\n[[File:Kofi Annan.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Former UN secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]] was the creator of the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan plan]].]]\nUnder the final proposals, the Republic of Cyprus would become the United Cyprus Republic. It would be a loose federation composed of two component states. The northern [[Turkish Cypriot constituent state]] would encompass about 28.5% of the island, the southern [[Greek Cypriot constituent state]] would be made up of the remaining 71.5%. Each part would have had its own parliament. There would also be a [[Bicameralism|bicameral parliament]] on the federal level. In the [[Chamber of Deputies]], the Turkish Cypriots would have 25% of the seats. (While no accurate figures are currently available, the split between the two communities at independence in 1960 was approximately 80:20 in favour of the Greek Cypriots.) The [[Senate]] would consist of equal parts of members of each ethnic group. Executive power would be vested in a presidential council. The chairmanship of this council would rotate between the communities. Each community would also have the right to veto all legislation.\n\nOne of the most controversial elements of the plan concerned property. During Turkey's military intervention/invasion in 1974, many Greek Cypriots (who owned 90% of the land and property in the north) were forced to abandon their homes. (A few Turkish Cypriots were also forced to abandon their homes in the South.) Since then, the question of restitution of their property has been a central demand of the Greek Cypriot side. However, the Turkish Cypriots argue that the complete return of all Greek Cypriot properties to their original owners would be incompatible with the functioning of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal settlement. To this extent, they have argued compensation should be offered. The Annan Plan attempted to bridge this divide. In certain areas, such as [[Morphou]] (G\u00fczelyurt) and [[Famagusta]] (Gazima\u011fusa), which would be returned to Greek Cypriot control, Greek Cypriot refugees would have received back all of their property according to a phased timetable. In other areas, such as [[Kyrenia]] (Girne) and the [[Karpass Peninsula]], which would remain under Turkish Cypriot control, they would be given back a proportion of their land (usually one third assuming that it had not been extensively developed) and would receive compensation for the rest. All land and property (that was not used for worship) belonging to businesses and institutions, including the Church the largest property owner on the island, would have been expropriated. While many Greek Cypriots found these provisions unacceptable in themselves, many others resented the fact that the Plan envisaged all compensation claims by a particular community to be met by their own side. This was seen as unfair as Turkey would not be required to contribute any funds towards the compensation.\n\nApart from the property issue, there were many other parts of the plan that sparked controversy. For example, the agreement envisaged the gradual reduction in the number of Greek and [[Turkish Military Forces in Northern Cyprus|Turkish troops]] on the island. After six years, the number of soldiers from each country would be limited to 6,000. This would fall to 600 after 19 years. Thereafter, the aim would be to try to achieve full demilitarisation, a process that many hoped would be made possible by Turkish accession to the European Union. The agreement also kept in place the Treaty of Guarantee \u2013 an integral part of the 1960 constitution that gave Britain, Greece and Turkey a right to intervene militarily in the island's affairs. Many Greek Cypriots were concerned that the continuation of the right of intervention would give Turkey too large a say in the future of the island. However, most Turkish Cypriots felt that a continued Turkish military presence was necessary to ensure their security. Another element of the plan the Greek Cypriots objected to was that it allowed many Turkish citizens who had been brought to the island to remain. (The exact number of these Turkish 'settlers' is highly disputed. Some argue that the figure is as high as 150,000 or as low as 40,000. They are seen as settlers illegally brought to the island in contravention of international law. However, while many accepted Greek Cypriot concerns on this matter, there was a widespread feeling that it would be unrealistic \u2013 and legally and morally problematic \u2013 to forcibly remove every one of these settlers, especially as many of them had been born and raised on the island.)\n\n===Referendums, 24 April 2004===\n{{main|Cypriot Annan Plan referendums, 2004}}\nUnder the terms of the plan, the Annan plan would only come into force if accepted by the two communities in simultaneous [[2004 Cypriot Annan Plan referendums|referendums]]. These were set for 24 April 2004. In the weeks that followed there was intense campaigning in both communities. However, and in spite of opposition from Rauf Denkta\u015f, who had boycotted the talks in [[Switzerland]], it soon became clear that the Turkish Cypriots would vote in favour of the agreement. Among Greek Cypriots opinion was heavily weighted against the plan. [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], the president of Cyprus, in a speech delivered on 7 April called on Greek Cypriots to reject the plan. His position was supported by the centrist Diko party and the socialists of EDEK as well as other smaller parties. His major coalition partner [[AKEL]], one of the largest parties on the island, chose to reject the plan bowing to the wishes of the majority of the party base. Support for the plan was voiced by [[Democratic Rally]] (DISY) leadership, the main right-wing party, despite opposition to the plan from the majority of party followers, and the [[United Democrats]], a small centre-left party led by [[George Vasiliou]], a former president. [[Glafcos Clerides]], now retired from politics, also supported the plan. Prominent members of DISY who did not support the Annan plan split from the party and openly campaigned against it. The Greek Cypriot Church also opposed the plan in line with the views of the majority of public opinion.\n\nThe United Kingdom (a Guarantor Power) and the United States came out in favour of the plan. Turkey signalled its support for the plan. The Greek Government decided to remain neutral. However, Russia was troubled by an attempt by Britain and the US to introduce a resolution in the UN [[Security Council]] supporting the plan and used its veto to block the move. This was done because they believed that the resolution would provide external influence to the internal debate, which they did not view as fair.<ref>UN Security Council Press Release SC / 8066 http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sc8066.doc.htm</ref>\n\nIn 24 April [[referendum]] the Turkish Cypriots endorsed the plan by a margin of almost two to one. However, the Greek Cypriots resoundingly voted against the plan, by a margin of about three to one.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Referendum results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!rowspan=2|Referendum result!!colspan=2| Yes!!colspan=2|No!!rowspan=2|Turnout\n|-\n!

Since then, two Turkish Cypriot representatives of [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] have been elected in the Assembly of [[Northern Cyprus]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PwmeRG9QsUC James Ker-Lindsay (UN SG's Former Special Representative for Cyprus)] The Foreign Policy of Counter Secession: Preventing the Recognition of Contested States, p.149</ref><ref>[https://archive.is/20140226103031/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action;jsessionid=516B38E2EAFF2073525EEB08F7B53903?newsId=105715 Today's Zaman] 2005\u20132007: CTP \u00d6zdil Nami; UBP Huseyin Ozgurgun</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 2004, a week after the [[referendum]], Cyprus joined the [[European Union]]. Under the terms of accession the whole island is considered to be a member of the European Union. However, the terms of the ''[[Acquis|acquis communautaire]]'', the EU's body of laws, have been suspended in [[Northern Cyprus]].\n\nAfter the referendum, in June 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community, despite the objection of the Cypriot government, had its designation at the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], of which it has been an observer since 1979, changed to the \"[[Turkish Cypriot State]]\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PwmeRG9QsUC James Ker-Lindsay (UN SG's Former Special Representative for Cyprus)] The Foreign Policy of Counter Secession: Preventing the Recognition of Contested States, p.141: \"..despite strong objections from Nicosia, this designation was changed to the \"Turkish Cypriot State\"\"</ref>\n\nDespite initial hopes that a new process to modify the rejected plan would start by autumn, most of the rest of 2004 was taken up with discussions over a proposal by the European Union to open up direct trade with the Turkish Cypriots and provide \u20ac259,000,000 in funds to help them upgrade their infrastructure. This plan has provoked considerable debate. The Republic of Cyprus has argued that there can be no direct trade via ports and airports in Northern Cyprus as these are unrecognised. Instead, it has offered to allow Turkish Cypriots to use Greek Cypriot facilities, which are internationally recognised. This has been rejected by the Turkish Cypriots. At the same time, attention turned to the question of the start of Turkey's future membership of the European Union. At a [[European Council]] held on 17 December 2004, and despite earlier Greek Cypriot threats to impose a veto, Turkey was granted a start date for formal membership talks on condition that it signed a protocol extending the customs union to the new entrants to the EU, including Cyprus. Assuming this is done, formal membership talks would begin on 3 October 2005.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the UN plan in the referendum there has been no attempt to restart negotiations between the two sides. While both sides have reaffirmed their commitment to continuing efforts to reach an agreement, the UN Secretary-General has not been willing to restart the process until he can be sure that any new negotiations will lead to a comprehensive settlement based on the plan he put forward in 2004. To this end, he has asked the Greek Cypriots to present a written list of the changes they would like to see made to the agreement. This was rejected by President [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] on the grounds that no side should be expected to present their demands in advance of negotiations. However, it appears as though the Greek Cypriots would be prepared to present their concerns orally. Another Greek Cypriot concern centres on the procedural process for new talks. Mr. Papadopoulos said that he will not accept arbitration or timetables for discussions. The UN fears that this would lead to another open-ended process that could drag on indefinitely.\n\nIn October 2012, [[Northern Cyprus]] became an \"observer member\" country of the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] under the name \"[[Turkish Cypriot State]]\".\n\nAccording to Stratis Efthymiou, even though defeated, the referendum had a formative impact on the Greek Cypriot community;<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis|title=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2019|isbn=978-3-030-14702-0|location=Cham|pages=}}</ref> Greek Cypriots felt that reunification is a touchable reality, and this undermined the nationalist struggle and ideas of military defence. According to Efthymiou, since the referendum, the phenomenon of [[draft dodging]] has become prevalent and the defence budget has turned into a trivial amount.<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n===Formula One and the Cyprus dispute===\nThe podium display after the [[2006 Turkish Grand Prix]] caused a controversy, when winner [[Felipe Massa]] received the trophy from [[Mehmet Ali Talat]], who was referred to as the \"President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\". The government of the Republic of Cyprus filed an official complaint with the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]. After investigating the incident, the FIA fined the organisers of the Grand Prix $5 million on 19 September 2006.<ref>[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17474.html Turks fined only $5m], GrandPrix.com, 19 September 2006</ref> The Turkish Motorsports Federation (TOSFED) and the organisers of the [[Turkish Grand Prix]] (MSO) agreed to pay half the fined sum pending an appeal to be heard by the FIA International Court of Appeal on 7 November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17612.html |title=F1 News > Turks to appeal |publisher=Grandprix.com |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2009}}</ref> TOSFED insisted the move was not planned and that Mehmet Ali Talat did fit FIA's criteria for podium presentations as a figure of world standing.

The status quo is unacceptable and its prolongation will have negative consequences for the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The leaders affirmed that a settlement would have a positive impact on the entire region, while first and foremost benefiting Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, respecting democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as each other's distinct identity and integrity and ensuring their common future in a united Cyprus within the European Union.\n\n2. The leaders expressed their determination to resume structured negotiations in a results-oriented manner. All unresolved core issues will be on the table, and will be discussed interdependently. The leaders will aim to reach a settlement as soon as possible, and hold separate simultaneous referenda thereafter.\n \n3. The settlement will be based on a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council Resolutions and the High Level Agreements. The united Cyprus, as a member of the United Nations and of the European Union, shall have a single international legal personality and a single sovereignty, which is defined as the sovereignty which is enjoyed by all member States of the United Nations under the UN Charter and which emanates equally from Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. There will be a single united Cyprus citizenship, regulated by federal law. All citizens of the united Cyprus shall also be citizens of either the Greek-Cypriot constituent state or the Turkish-Cypriot constituent state. This status shall be internal and shall complement, and not substitute in any way, the united Cyprus citizenship.\n\nThe powers of the federal government, and like matters that are clearly incidental to its specified powers, will be assigned by the constitution. The Federal constitution will also provide for the residual powers to be exercised by the constituent states. The constituent states will exercise fully and irrevocably all their powers, free from encroachment by the federal government. The federal laws will not encroach upon constituent state laws, within the constituent states' area of competences, and the constituent states' laws will not encroach upon the federal laws within the federal government's competences. Any dispute in respect thereof will be adjudicated finally by the Federal Supreme Court. Neither side may claim authority or jurisdiction over the other.\n\n4. The united Cyprus federation shall result from the settlement following the settlement's approval by separate simultaneous referenda. The Federal constitution shall prescribe that the united Cyprus federation shall be composed of two constituent states of equal status. The bi-zonal, bi-communal nature of the federation and the principles upon which the EU is founded will be safeguarded and respected throughout the island.  The Federal constitution shall be the supreme law of the land and will be binding on all the federation's authorities and on the constituent states. Union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession or any other unilateral change to the state of affairs will be prohibited.\n\n5. The negotiations are based on the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\n\n6. The appointed representatives are fully empowered to discuss any issue at any time and should enjoy parallel access to all stakeholders and interested parties in the process, as needed. The leaders of the two communities will meet as often as needed. They retain the ultimate decision making power. Only an agreement freely reached by the leaders may be put to separate simultaneous referenda. Any kind of arbitration is excluded.\n\n7. The sides will seek to create a positive atmosphere to ensure the talks succeed. They commit to avoiding blame games or other negative public comments on the negotiations. They also commit to efforts to implement confidence building measures that will provide a dynamic impetus to the prospect for a united Cyprus.}}\n\nThe governments of both Greece and Turkey expressed their support for renewed peace talks.<ref name=\"DW_Peace\">{{cite news |last=Morley |first=Nathan |date=11 February 2014 |title=Cyprus peace talks resume after two-year break |url=http://www.dw.de/cyprus-peace-talks-resume-after-two-year-break/a-17424693 |newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=23 February 2014 }}</ref> The declaration was also welcomed by the European Union.<ref name=\"EUObs_Big\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Big expectations as Cyprus peace talks restart |url=http://euobserver.com/foreign/123097 |newspaper=[[EUobserver]] |location=Brussels |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn 13 February 2014, [[Chrysostomos II of Cyprus|Archbishop Chrysostomos]] lent [[Nicos Anastasiades|Anastasiades]] his backing on the Joint Declaration.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Anastasiades secures Archbishop's backing |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/13/anastasiades-secures-archbishops-backing/ |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |date=13 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 2014, the Greek Cypriot negotiator Andreas Mavroyiannis and Turkish Cypriot negotiator Kudret \u00d6zersay held their first meeting and agreed to visit Greece and Turkey respectively.<ref>{{cite news |last=Evripidou |first=Stefanos |date=15 February 2014 |title=Direct access to guarantors |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/15/direct-access-to-guarantors/ |newspaper=Cyprus Mail }}</ref>\n\nReactions among the Greek Cypriot political parties were mixed.

In the 4th century BC, Cyprus was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and then ruled by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] until 58 BC, when it was incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]]. In the division of the Roman Empire [[Byzantine Empire#Christianization and partition of the Empire|around the 4th century AD]], the island was assigned to the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nRoman rule in Cyprus was interrupted in 649, when the Arab armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] invaded the island. Fighting over the island between the Muslims and Romans continued for several years, until in 668 the belligerents agreed to make Cyprus a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. This arrangement persisted for nearly 300 years, until a Byzantine army conquered the island in around 965. Cyprus would become a [[Cyprus (theme)|theme]] of the Byzantine Empire until the late 12th century.\n\nAfter an occupation by the [[Knights Templar]] and the rule of [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], the island in 1192 came under the rule of the [[Lusignans|Lusignan family]], who established the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]]. In February 1489 it was seized by the [[Republic of Venice]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Between September 1570 and August 1571 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} starting three centuries of Turkish rule over Cyprus.\n\nStarting in the early 19th century, ethnic Greeks of the island sought to bring about an end to almost 300 years of Ottoman rule and unite Cyprus with [[Greece]]. The United Kingdom took administrative control of the island in 1878, to prevent Ottoman possessions from falling under Russian control following the [[Cyprus Convention]], which led to the call for union with Greece (''[[enosis]]'') to grow louder.

From the beginning, and throughout their relationship, Grivas resented having to share leadership with the archbishop. Makarios, concerned about Grivas's extremism from their very first meeting, preferred to continue diplomatic efforts, particularly efforts to get the United Nations involved.

This resulted in the deaths of 387 British servicemen and personnel<ref>[http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org/roll UK casualties of war] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725102127/http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org/roll |date=25 July 2011 }} UK army personnel killed by Greek Cypriot EOKA militant organisation</ref> and some Greek Cypriots suspected of collaboration; in 2009, a memorial for the British soldiers killed by Greek Cypriot EOKA during 1955\u20131959 Cyprus Emergency was erected in [[Kyrenia]], Northern Cyprus.<ref>[http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org ]</ref> As a result of this a number of Greek Cypriots began to leave the police. This however did not affect the Colonial police force as they had already created the solely Turkish Cypriot (Epicourical) reserve force to fight EOKA paramilitaries. At the same time, it led to tensions between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. In 1957 the Turkish Resistance Organisation (''T\u00fcrk Mukavemet'' ''Te\u015fkilat\u0131'' [[Turkish Resistance Organisation|TMT]]), which had already been formed to protect the Turkish Cypriots from EOKA, took action. In response to the growing demand for ''enosis'', a number of Turkish Cypriots became convinced that the only way to protect their interests and identity of the Turkish Cypriot population in the event of ''enosis'' would be to divide the island \u2013 a policy known as ''taksim'' (\"partition\" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] borrowed from (\u062a\u0642\u0633\u06cc\u0645)\"Taqs\u012bm\" in [[Arabic Language|Arabic]]) \u2013 into a Greek sector in the south and a Turkish sector in the north.\n\n===Establishment of the constitution===\nBy now the island was on the verge of civil war. Several attempts to present a compromise settlement had failed. Therefore, beginning in December 1958, representatives of Greece and Turkey, the so-called \"mother lands\" opened discussions of the Cyprus issue. Participants for the first time discussed the concept of an independent Cyprus, i.e., neither ''enosis'' nor ''taksim''. Subsequent talks always headed by the British yielded a so-called compromise agreement supporting independence, laying the foundations of the Republic of Cyprus. The scene then naturally shifted to London, where the Greek and Turkish representatives were joined by representatives of the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots (represented by Arch. Makarios and [[Dr Fazil Kucuk]] with no significant decision making power), and the British. The Z\u00fcrich-London agreements that became the basis for the Cyprus constitution of 1960 were supplemented with three treaties \u2013 the Treaty of Establishment, the Treaty of Guarantee, and the Treaty of Alliance. The general tone of the agreements was one of keeping the British sovereign bases and military and monitoring facilities intact. Some Greek Cypriots, especially members of organisations such as [[EOKA]], expressed disappointment because ''enosis'' had not been attained. In a similar way some Turkish Cypriots especially members of organisations such as TMT expressed their disappointment as they had to postpone their target for ''taksim'', however most Cypriots that were not influenced by the three so called guarantor powers (Greece, Turkey, and Britain), welcomed the agreements and set aside their demand for ''enosis'' and ''taksim''. According to the Treaty of Establishment, Britain retained sovereignty over 256 square kilometres, which became the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area]], to the northeast of [[Larnaca]], and the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area]] to the southwest of [[Limassol]].\n\nCyprus achieved independence on 16 August 1960.\n\n==Independence, constitutional breakdown, and intercommunal talks, 1960\u20131974==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Makarios III and Robert F.

General executive authority was vested in a [[Cabinet (government)|council of ministers]] with a ratio of seven Greeks to three Turks. (The Greek Cypriots represented 78% of the population and the Turkish Cypriots 18%. The remaining 4% was made up by the three minority communities: the Latins, [[Maronite]]s and [[Armenians]].) A [[House of Representatives]] of fifty members, also with a seven-to-three ratio, were to be separately elected by communal balloting on a [[universal suffrage]] basis. In addition, separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot Communal Chambers were provided to exercise control in matters of religion, culture, and education. According to Article 78(2) \"any law imposing duties or taxes shall require a simple majority of the representatives elected by the Greek and Turkish communities respectively taking part in the vote\". Legislation on other subjects was to take place by simple majority but again the President and the Vice-President had the same right of veto\u2014absolute on foreign affairs, defence and internal security, delaying on other matters\u2014as in the Council of Ministers. The judicial system would be headed by a Supreme [[Constitutional Court]], composed of one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot and presided over by a contracted judge from a neutral country. The Constitution of Cyprus, whilst establishing an Independent and sovereign Republic, was, in the words of [[Stanley Alexander de Smith|de Smith]], an authority on Constitutional Law, \"Unique in its tortuous complexity and in the multiplicity of the safeguards that it provides for the principal minority; the Constitution of Cyprus stands alone among the constitutions of the world\".<ref name=\"Humanrights.coe.int\">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrights.coe.int/minorities/eng/FrameworkConvention/StateReports/1999/cyprus/B.htm |title=Report Submitted By Cyprus \u2013 Recent Political History And Developments |publisher=Humanrights.coe.int |accessdate=22 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125115646/http://www.humanrights.coe.int/minorities/eng/FrameworkConvention/StateReports/1999/cyprus/B.htm |archive-date=25 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nWithin a short period of time the first disputes started to arise between the two communities. Issues of contention included taxation and the creation of separate municipalities. Because of the legislative veto system, this resulted in a lockdown in communal and state politics in many cases.\n\n===Crisis of 1963\u20131964===\n{{Main|Cyprus crisis of 1963\u201364}}\nRepeated attempts to solve the disputes failed. Eventually, on 30 November 1963, [[Makarios III|Makarios]] put forward to the three guarantors a [[13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|thirteen-point proposal]] designed, in his view, to eliminate impediments to the functioning of the government. The [[13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|thirteen points]] involved constitutional revisions, including the abandonment of the veto power by both the president and the vice president. Turkey initially rejected it (although later in future discussed the proposal). A few days later, on [[Bloody Christmas (1963)]] 21 December 1963 fighting erupted between the communities in [[Nicosia]]. In the days that followed it spread across the rest of the island. At the same time, the power-sharing government collapsed. How this happened is one of the most contentious issues in modern Cypriot history. The Greek Cypriots argue that the Turkish Cypriots withdrew in order to form their own administration. The Turkish Cypriots maintain that they were forced out. Many Turkish Cypriots chose to withdraw from the government. However, in many cases those who wished to stay in their jobs were prevented from doing so by the Greek Cypriots. Also, many of the Turkish Cypriots refused to attend because they feared for their lives after the recent violence that had erupted. There was even some pressure from the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation|TMT]] as well. In any event, in the days that followed the fighting a frantic effort was made to calm tensions. In the end, on 27 December 1963, an interim peacekeeping force, the Joint Truce Force, was put together by Britain, Greece and Turkey. After the partnership government collapsed, the Greek Cypriot led administration was recognized as the legitimate government of the Republic of Cyprus at the stage of the debates in New York in February 1964.<ref>[http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/03/09/unficyp-a-living-fossil-of-the-cold-war Cyprus-Mail, 09.03.2014] UNFICYP: a living fossil of the Cold War</ref> The Joint Truce Force held the line until a [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force, [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UNFICYP]], was formed following [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186]], passed on 4 March 1964.\n\n===Peacemaking efforts, 1964\u20131974===\nAt the same time as it established a peacekeeping force, the Security Council also recommended that the Secretary-General, in consultation with the parties and the Guarantor Powers, designate a mediator to take charge of formal peacemaking efforts. [[U Thant]], then the UN Secretary-General, appointed [[Sakari Tuomioja]], a Finnish diplomat. While Tuomioja viewed the problem as essentially international in nature and saw ''[[enosis]]'' as the most logical course for a settlement, he rejected union on the grounds that it would be inappropriate for a UN official to propose a solution that would lead to the dissolution of a UN member state. The United States held a differing view. In early June, following another Turkish threat to intervene, Washington launched an independent initiative under [[Dean Acheson]], a former Secretary of State. In July he presented a plan to unite Cyprus with Greece. In return for accepting this, Turkey would receive a sovereign military base on the island. The Turkish Cypriots would also be given minority rights, which would be overseen by a resident international commissioner. [[Makarios III|Makarios]] rejected the proposal, arguing that giving Turkey territory would be a limitation on ''enosis'' and would give Ankara too strong a say in the island's affairs. A second version of the plan was presented that offered Turkey a 50-year lease on a base. This offer was rejected by the Greek Cypriots and by Turkey. After several further attempts to reach an agreement, the United States was eventually forced to give up its effort.\n\nFollowing the sudden death of Ambassador Tuomioja in August, [[Galo Plaza]] was appointed Mediator. He viewed the problem in communal terms. In March 1965 he presented a report criticising both sides for their lack of commitment to reaching a settlement. While he understood the Greek Cypriot aspiration of ''enosis'', he believed that any attempt at union should be held in voluntary abeyance. Similarly, he considered that the Turkish Cypriots should refrain from demanding a federal solution to the problem. Although the Greek Cypriots eventually accepted the report, despite its opposition to immediate ''enosis'', Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots rejected the plan, calling on Plaza to resign on the grounds that he had exceeded his mandate by advancing specific proposals. He was simply meant to broker an agreement. But the Greek Cypriots made it clear that if Galo Plaza resigned they would refuse to accept a replacement. U Thant was left with no choice but to abandon the mediation effort. Instead he decided to make his Good Offices available to the two sides via resolution 186 of 4 March 1964 and a Mediator was appointed. In his Report (S/6253, A/6017, 26 March 1965), the Mediator, Dr Gala Plaza, criticised the 1960 legal framework, and proposed necessary amendments which were rejected by Turkey, a fact which resulted in serious deterioration of the situation with constant threats by Turkey against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus, necessitating a series of UN Resolutions calling, inter alia, for respect of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.<ref name=\"Humanrights.coe.int\" />\n\nThe end of the mediation effort was effectively confirmed when, at the end of the year, Plaza resigned and was not replaced.\n\nIn March 1966, a more modest attempt at peacemaking was initiated under the auspices of Carlos Bernades, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Cyprus. Instead of trying to develop formal proposals for the parties to bargain over, he aimed to encourage the two sides agree to settlement through direct dialogue. However, ongoing political chaos in Greece prevented any substantive discussions from developing. The situation changed the following year.\n\nOn 21 April 1967, a [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|coup d'\u00e9tat in Greece brought to power a military administration]]. Just months later, in November 1967, Cyprus witnessed its most severe bout of intercommunal fighting since 1964. Responding to a major attack on Turkish Cypriot villages in the south of the island, which left 27 dead, Turkey bombed Greek Cypriot forces and appeared to be readying itself for an intervention. Greece was forced to capitulate. Following international intervention, Greece agreed to recall General [[George Grivas]], the Commander of the Greek [[Cypriot National Guard]] and former EOKA leader, and reduce its forces on the island. Capitalising on the weakness of the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own provisional administration on 28 December 1967. Makarios immediately declared the new administration illegal. Nevertheless, a major change had occurred. The Archbishop, along with most other Greek Cypriots, began to accept that the Turkish Cypriots would have to have some degree of political autonomy. It was also realised that unification of Greece and Cyprus was unachievable under the prevailing circumstances.\n\nIn May 1968, intercommunal talks began between the two sides under the auspices of the Good Offices of the UN Secretary-General. Unusually, the talks were not held between President Makarios and Vice-President Kucuk. Instead they were conducted by the presidents of the communal chambers, [[Glafcos Clerides]] and [[Rauf Denkta\u015f]]. Again, little progress was made. During the first round of talks, which lasted until August 1968, the Turkish Cypriots were prepared to make several concessions regarding constitutional matters, but Makarios refused to grant them greater autonomy in return. The second round of talks, which focused on local government, was equally unsuccessful. In December 1969 a third round of discussion started. This time they focused on constitutional issues. Yet again there was little progress and when they ended in September 1970 the Secretary-General blamed both sides for the lack of movement. A fourth and final round of intercommunal talks also focused on constitutional issues, but again failed to make much headway before they were forced to a halt in 1974.\n\n==1974 Greek coup d'etat and Turkish invasion==\n\n{{Main|Timeline of events in Cyprus, 1974|1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Military operations during the Invasion of Cyprus (1974)}}\n\nIntercommunal strife was also overshadowed during this period by a serious rift on the Greek side, between Makarios and the [[enosis]]t National Front supported by the Greek military junta. Makarios had now become an obstacle to enosis. An attempt was made on his life, and Grivas returned in 1971 to head a new organisation, [[EOKA-B]], with Makarios, rather than the Turkish-Cypriots, in its sight. Makarios was told from Athens to dismiss his foreign minister and to regard Athens as the National Centre. Makarios rallied supporters successfully against attempts to remove him. He was still popular in Cyprus.\n\nMatters became worse when a new junta came to power in September 1973, and there was less relief from rightist pressure than might have been expected when Grivas died suddenly in January 1974. The pressure mounted until a peace operation in July 1974 allegedly led by a 'hammer of the Turks' [[Nikos Sampson]], overthrew Makarios, who managed to flee the country via a British base. For Turkey this raised the spectre of Greek control of Cyprus.\n\nThe Turkish government therefore now demanded that Greece should dismiss Sampson, withdraw all Greek officers from the island and respect the island's independence. The Greek military government refused. For the United States, Kissinger did not seem to be greatly disturbed by the Sampson coup and looked as if he could accept enosis. Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit's assertiveness in foreign policy, reinforced by his junior coalition partner strongly inclined the Turks to intervene. The British were invited to participate in military operations, under the Treaty of Guarantee, but declined. The American envoy Joseph Sisco tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Greek military government to accept Ecevit's conditions for a Cyprus settlement, which included Turkish-Cypriot control of a coastal region in the north and negotiations for a federal solution. The Soviet Union stood aside not wanting to see enosis, which would strengthen NATO and weaken the left in Cyprus.\n\nAfter failing to secure British support for a joint intervention under the Treaty of Guarantee, [[B\u00fclent Ecevit]], the Turkish prime minister, decided to act unilaterally. On 20 July Turkey ordered a [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|military invasion of the island]]. Within two days, Turkish forces had established a narrow corridor linking the north coast with Nicosia. The intervention led to turmoil in Greece. On 23 July, the military junta collapsed.\n\nLaunched with relatively few troops, the Turkish landing had limited success at first, and resulted everywhere on the island in the occupation of Turkish-Cypriot enclaves by the Greek forces. After securing a more or less satisfactory bridgehead Turkish forces agreed to a cease-fire on 23 July 1974. The same day civilian government under Karamanlis took office in Athens, the day the Sampson coup collapsed. Glafcos Clerides became the Acting President in absence still of Makarios.\n\nTwo days later formal peace talks were convened in [[Geneva]] between Greece, Turkey and Britain. Over the course of the following five days Turkey agreed to halt its advance on the condition that it would remain on the island until a political settlement was reached between the two sides. Meanwhile, Turkish troops did not refrain from extending their positions, as more Turkish-Cypriot enclaves were occupied by Greek forces. A new cease-fire line was agreed. On 30 July the powers agreed that the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island should be linked to a 'just and lasting settlement acceptable to all parties concerned'. The declaration also spoke of 'two autonomous administrations -that of Greek-Cypriot community and that of the Turkish-Cypriot community'. On 8 August another round of discussion was held in Geneva, Switzerland. Unlike before, this time the talks involved the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. During the discussions the Turkish Cypriots, supported by Turkey, insisted on some form of geographical separation between the two communities. [[Makarios III|Makarios]] refused to accept the demand, insisting that Cyprus must remain a unitary state. Despite efforts to break the deadlock, the two sides refused to budge. On 14 August, Turkey demanded from Clerides acceptance of a proposal for a [[federation|federal state]], in which the Turkish Cypriot community (who, at that time, comprised about 18% of the population and owned about 10% of the land) would have received 34% of the island. Clerides asked for 36 to 48 hours to consult with the Cypriot and Greek governments, but Turkey refused to grant any consultation time, effectively ending the talks. Within hours, Turkey had resumed its second offensive. By the time a new, and permanent, ceasefire was called 36 per cent of the island was under the control of the Turkish military. The partition was marked by the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus]] or \"green line\" running east to west across the island.\n\nThe effect of the division was catastrophic for all concerned. Thousands of Greek and Turkish Cypriots had been killed, wounded or missing. A further two hundred thousand Greek and Turkish Cypriots had been displaced. In addition to the entire north coast (Kerynia, Morfou) and the Karpas peninsula, the Greek Cypriots were also forced to flee the eastern port city of [[Famagusta]]. The vast majority of the Turkish occupied area was predominantly populated and owned by Greek Cypriots prior to 1974.\nIn the process about 160,000<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www02.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa.nsf/FEB4D72828085695C2256FD50031BF1E/$FILE/MEMOResponse10.3.05.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614123038/http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa.nsf/FEB4D72828085695C2256FD50031BF1E/$FILE/MEMOResponse10.3.05.doc |archive-date=14 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \u2013 200,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/32.htm |title=Cyprus \u2013 Refugees and Social Reconstruction |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=22 March 2009}}</ref> Greek Cypriots who made up 82% of the population in the north became [[refugee]]s; many of them fleeing at the word of the approaching Turkish army. Since 1974, the ceasefire line separates the two communities on the island, and is commonly referred to as the Green Line<ref>{{Citation|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|title=Introduction: Becoming a Man in a Post-conflict Society|date=2019|work=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|volume=|pages=17|publisher=Springer International Publishing|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-14702-0_1|isbn=978-3-030-14701-3}}</ref>. The United Nations consented to the transfer of the remainder of the 51,000 Turkish Cypriots that were trapped in the south to settle in the north, if they wished to do so. Many of them had previously moved to the areas under UK sovereign control awaiting permission to be transferred to the areas under Turkish control.\n\n==The divided island 1974\u20131997==\n[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|Control of the island by different parties, super-imposed upon the claimed administrative boundaries of the Republic of Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus claims sovereignty of all the areas except the British bases (in green), but the dark pink areas are controlled by Northern Cyprus, and the blue buffer zone is administered by the United Nations.]]\nAt the second Geneva Conference on 9 August, Turkey pressed for a federal solution to the problem against stiffening Greek resistance. Whilst Turkish Cypriots wanted a bi-zonal federation, Turkey, under American advice, submitted a cantonal plan involving separation of Turkish-Cypriot areas from one another. For security reasons Turkish-Cypriots did not favour cantons. Each plan embraced about thirty-four per cent of the territory.\n\nThese plans were presented to the conference on 13 August by the Turkish Foreign Minister, [[Turan G\u00fcne\u015f]]. Clerides wanted thirty-six to forty-eight hours to consider the plans, but G\u00fcne\u015f demanded an immediate response. This was regarded as unreasonable by the Greeks, the British, and the Americans, who were in close consultation. Nevertheless, the next day, the Turkish forces extended their control to some 36 per cent of the island, afraid that delay would turn international opinion strongly against them.\n\nTurkey's international reputation suffered as a result of the precipitate move of the Turkish military to extend control to a third of the island. The British prime minister regarded the Turkish ultimatum as unreasonable since it was presented without allowing adequate time for study. In Greek eyes, the Turkish proposals were submitted in the full awareness that the Greek side could not accept them, and reflected the Turkish desire for a military base in Cyprus. The Greek side has gone some way in their proposals by recognising Turkish 'groups' of villages and Turkish administrative 'areas'. But they stressed that the constitutional order of Cyprus should retain its bi-communal character based on the co-existence of the Greek and Turkish communities within the framework of a sovereign, independent and integral republic. Essentially the Turkish side's proposals were for geographic consolidation and separation and for a much larger measure of autonomy for that area, or those areas, than the Greek side could envisage.\n\n===1975\u20131979===\nOn 28 April 1975, [[Kurt Waldheim]], the UN Secretary-General, launched a new mission of [[good offices]]. Starting in Vienna, over the course of the following ten months Clerides and Denkta\u015f discussed a range of humanitarian issues relating to the events of the previous year. However, attempts to make progress on the substantive issues \u2013 such as territory and the nature of the central government \u2013 failed to produce any results. After five rounds the talks fell apart in February 1976. In January 1977, the UN managed to organise a meeting in Nicosia between [[Makarios III|Makarios]] and [[Rauf Denkta\u015f|Denkta\u015f]]. This led to a major breakthrough. On 12 February, the two leaders signed a four-point agreement confirming that a future Cyprus settlement would be based on a federation. The size of the states would be determined by economic viability and land ownership. The central government would be given powers to ensure the unity of the state. Various other issues, such as freedom of settlement and freedom of movement, would be settled through discussion. Just months later, in August 1977, [[Makarios III|Makarios]] died. He was replaced by [[Spyros Kyprianou]], the foreign minister.\n\nIn 1979 the [[ABC plan (Cyprus)|ABC plan]] was presented by the USA, as a proposal for a permanent solution of the Cyprus problem. It projected a Bicommunal Bizonal Federation with a strong central government. It was first rejected by the Greek Cypriot leader Spyros Kyprianou and later by Turkey.{{sfn|Kordoni|2016|p=28}}{{sfn|Michael|2015|p=229}}\n\nIn May 1979, Waldheim visited Cyprus and secured a further ten-point set of proposals from the two sides. In addition to re-affirming the 1977 High-Level Agreement, the ten points also included provisions for the demilitarisation of the island and a commitment to refrain from destabilising activities and actions. Shortly afterwards a new round of discussions began in Nicosia. Again, they were short-lived. For a start, the Turkish Cypriots did not want to discuss [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], a resort quarter of Famagusta that had been vacated by Greek Cypriots when it was overrun by Turkish troops. This was a key issue for the Greek Cypriots. Second, the two sides failed to agree on the concept of 'bicommunality'. The Turkish Cypriots believed that the Turkish Cypriot federal state would be exclusively Turkish Cypriot and the Greek Cypriot state would be exclusively Greek Cypriot. The Greek Cypriots believed that the two states should be predominantly, but not exclusively, made up of a particular community.\n\n===Turkish Cypriots' declaration of independence===\n{{Politics of Northern Cyprus}}\nIn May 1983, an effort by [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]], then UN Secretary-General, foundered after the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of all occupation forces from Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriots were furious at the resolution, threatening to declare independence in retaliation. Despite this, in August, P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar gave the two sides a set of proposals for consideration that called for a rotating presidency, the establishment of a bicameral assembly along the same lines as previously suggested, and 60:40 representation in the central executive. In return for increased representation in the central government, the Turkish Cypriots would surrender 8\u201313 per cent of the land in their possession. Both Kyprianou and Denkta\u015f accepted the proposals. However, on 15 November 1983, the Turkish Cypriots took advantage of the post-election political instability in Turkey and [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|unilaterally declared independence]]. Within days the [[Security Council]] passed a resolution, no.541 (13\u20131 vote: only [[Pakistan]] opposed) making it clear that it would not accept the new state and that the decision disrupted efforts to reach a settlement. Denkta\u015f denied this. In a letter addressed to the Secretary-General informing him of the decision, he insisted that the move guaranteed that any future settlement would be truly federal in nature. Although the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' (TRNC) was soon recognised by [[Turkey]], the rest of the international community condemned the move. The [[Security Council]] passed another resolution, no.550<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.int/cyprus/scr550.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506115414/http://www.un.int/cyprus/scr550.htm |archivedate=6 May 2012  }}</ref> (13\u20131 vote: again only [[Pakistan]] opposed) condemning the \"purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership\".\n\nIn September 1984, talks resumed. After three rounds of discussions it was again agreed that Cyprus would become a bi-zonal, bi-communal, non-aligned federation. The Turkish Cypriots would retain 29 per cent for their federal state and all foreign troops would leave the island. In January 1985, the two leaders met for their first face-to-face talks since the 1979 agreement. However, while the general belief was that the meeting was being held to agree to a final settlement, Kyprianou insisted that it was a chance for further negotiations. The talks collapsed. In the aftermath, the Greek Cypriot leaders came in for heavy criticism, both at home and abroad. After that Denkta\u015f announced that he would not make so many concessions again. Undeterred, in March 1986, de Cu\u00e9llar presented the two sides with a [http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/draft%20agreement%201986.htm/ Draft Framework Agreement]. Again, the plan envisaged the creation of an independent, non-aligned, bi-communal, bi-zonal state in Cyprus. However, the Greek Cypriots were unhappy with the proposals. They argued that the questions of removing Turkish forces from Cyprus was not addressed, nor was the repatriation of the increasing number of Turkish settlers on the island. Moreover, there were no guarantees that the full three freedoms would be respected. Finally, they saw the proposed state structure as being confederal in nature. Further efforts to produce an agreement failed as the two sides remained steadfastly attached to their positions.\n\n===The \"Set of Ideas\"===\nIn August 1988, P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar called upon the two sides to meet with him in Geneva in August. There the two leaders \u2013 [[George Vasiliou]] and [[Rauf Denkta\u015f]] \u2013 agreed to abandon the Draft Framework Agreement and return to the 1977 and 1979 High Level Agreements. However, the talks faltered when the Greek Cypriots announced their intention to apply for membership of the [[European Community]] (EC, subsequently EU), a move strongly opposed by the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey. Nevertheless, in June 1989, de Cuellar presented the two communities with the \"Set of Ideas\". Denkta\u015f quickly rejected them as he not only opposed the provisions, he also argued that the UN Secretary-General had no right to present formal proposals to the two sides. The two sides met again, in New York, in February 1990. However, the talks were again short lived. This time Denkta\u015f demanded that the Greek Cypriots recognise the existence of two peoples in Cyprus and the basic right of the Turkish Cypriots to self-determination.\n\nOn 4 July 1990, Cyprus formally applied to join the EC. The Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which had applied for membership in 1987, were outraged. Denkta\u015f claimed that Cyprus could only join the Community at the same time as Turkey and called off all talks with UN officials. Nevertheless, in September 1990, the EC member states unanimously agreed to refer the Cypriot application to the Commission for formal consideration. In retaliation, Turkey and the TRNC signed a joint declaration abolishing passport controls and introducing a customs union just weeks later. Undeterred, [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] continued his search for a solution throughout 1991. He made no progress. In his last report to the Security Council, presented in October 1991 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 716]], he blamed the failure of the talks on Denkta\u015f, noting the Turkish Cypriot leader's demand that the two communities should have equal sovereignty and a right to secession.\n\nOn 3 April 1992, [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], the new UN Secretary-General, presented the Security Council with the outline plan for the creation of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation that would prohibit any form of partition, secession or union with another state. While the Greek Cypriots accepted the Set of Ideas as a basis for negotiation, Denkta\u015f again criticised the UN Secretary-General for exceeding his authority. When he did eventually return to the table, the Turkish Cypriot leader complained that the proposals failed to recognise his community. In November, Ghali brought the talks to a halt. He now decided to take a different approach and tried to encourage the two sides to show goodwill by accepting eight [[confidence building measures]] (CBMs). These included reducing military forces on the island, transferring [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]] to direct UN control, reducing restrictions on contacts between the two sides, undertaking an island-wide census and conducting feasibility studies regarding a solution. The Security Council endorsed the approach.\n\nOn 24 May 1993, the Secretary-General formally presented the two sides with his CBMs. Denkta\u015f, while accepting some of the proposals, was not prepared to agree to the package as a whole. Meanwhile, on 30 June, the European Commission returned its opinion on the Cypriot application for membership. While the decision provided a ringing endorsement of the case for Cypriot membership, it refrained from opening the way for immediate negotiations. The Commission stated that it felt that the issue should be reconsidered in January 1995, taking into account \"the positions adopted by each party in the talks\". A few months later, in December 1993, [[Glafcos Clerides]] proposed the demilitarisation of Cyprus. Denkta\u015f dismissed the idea, but the next month he announced that he would be willing to accept the CBMs in principle. [[Proximity talks]] started soon afterwards. In March 1994, the UN presented the two sides with a draft document outlining the proposed measures in greater detail. Clerides said that he would be willing to accept the document if Denkta\u015f did, but the Turkish Cypriot leader refused on the grounds that it would upset the balance of forces on the island. Once again, Ghali had little choice but to pin the blame for another breakdown of talks on the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas would be willing to accept mutually agreed changes, but Clerides refused to negotiate any further changes to the March proposals. Further proposals put forward by the Secretary-General in an attempt to break the deadlock were rejected by both sides.\n\n===Deadlock and legal battles, 1994\u20131997===\nAt the [[Corfu]] [[European Council]], held on 24\u201325 June 1994, the EU officially confirmed that Cyprus would be included in the Union's next phase of enlargement. Two weeks later, on 5 July, the [[European Court of Justice]] imposed restrictions on the export of goods from Northern Cyprus into the [[European Union]]. Soon afterwards, in December, relations between the EU and Turkey were further damaged when Greece blocked the final implementation of a customs union. As a result, talks remained completely blocked throughout 1995 and 1996.\n\nIn December 1996, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) delivered a landmark ruling that declared that Turkey was an occupying power in Cyprus. The case \u2013 [[Loizidou v. Turkey]] \u2013 centred on Titina Loizidou, a refugee from [[Kyrenia]], who was judged to have been unlawfully denied the control of her property by Turkey. The case also had severe financial implications as the Court later ruled that Turkey should pay Mrs Loizidou US$825,000 in compensation for the loss of use of her property. Ankara rejected the ruling as politically motivated.\n\nAfter twenty years of talks, a settlement seemed as far off as ever. However, the basic parameters of a settlement were by now internationally agreed. Cyprus would be a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. A solution would also be expected to address the following issues:\n* Constitutional framework\n* Territorial adjustments\n* Return of property to pre-1974 owners and/or compensation payments\n* Return of displaced persons\n* Demilitarisation of Cyprus\n* Residency rights/repatriation of Turkish settlers\n* Future peacekeeping arrangements\n\n====August 1996 incidents====\nIn August 1996, Greek [[Cypriot refugees]] demonstrated with a motorcycle protest in [[Deryneia]] against the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Turkish occupation]] of Cyprus.

The crisis effectively ended in December 1998 with the decision of the Cypriot government to transfer the S-300s to [[Crete]], in exchange for alternative weapons from [[Greece]].\n\n==EU accession and the settlement process, 1997\u2013present==\n[[File:Map of Cyprus, Greece and Turkey.svg|thumb|{{legend|#07ef00|Under the control of the [[Republic of Cyprus]]}}\n{{legend|#f7991c|The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]}}\n{{legend|#ff0000|[[Turkey]]}}\n{{legend|#007efc|[[Greece]]}}]]\nIn 1997 the basic parameters of the Cyprus Dispute changed. A decision by the [[European Union]] to open up accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus created a new catalyst for a settlement. Among those who supported the move, the argument was made that Turkey could not have a veto on Cypriot accession and that the negotiations would encourage all sides to be more moderate. However, opponents of the move argued that the decision would remove the incentive of the Greek Cypriots to reach a settlement. They would instead wait until they became a member and then use this strength to push for a settlement on their terms. In response to the decision, Rauf Denkta\u015f announced that he would no longer accept federation as a basis for a settlement. In the future he would only be prepared to negotiate on the basis of a confederal solution. In December 1999 tensions between Turkey and the European Union eased somewhat after the EU decided to declare Turkey a candidate for EU membership, a decision taken at the Helsinki European Council. At the same time a new round of talks started in New York. These were short lived. By the following summer they had broken down. Tensions started to rise again as a showdown between Turkey and the European Union loomed over the island's accession.\n\nPerhaps realising the gravity of the situation, and in a move that took observers by surprise, [[Rauf Denkta\u015f]] wrote to [[Glafcos Clerides]] on 8 November 2001 to propose a face-to-face meeting. The offer was accepted. Following several informal meetings between the two men in November and December 2001 a new peace process started under UN auspices on 14 January 2002. At the outset the stated aim of the two leaders was to try to reach an agreement by the start of June that year. However, the talks soon became deadlocked. In an attempt to break the impasse, [[Kofi Annan]], the UN Secretary-General visited the island in May that year. Despite this no deal was reached. After a summer break Annan met with the two leaders again that autumn, first in Paris and then in New York. As a result of the continued failure to reach an agreement, the Security Council agreed that the Secretary-General should present the two sides with a blueprint settlement. This would form the basis of further negotiations. The original version of the UN peace plan was presented to the two sides by Annan on 11 November 2002. A little under a month later, and following modifications submitted by the two sides, it was revised (Annan II). It was hoped that this plan would be agreed by the two sides on the margins of the European Council, which was held in [[Copenhagen]] on 13 December. However, Rauf Denkta\u015f, who was recuperating from major heart surgery, declined to attend. The EU therefore decided to confirm that Cyprus would join the EU on 1 May 2004, along with [[Malta]] and eight other states from [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe.\n\n[[File:Border between nort and south cyprus Nicosia.JPG|thumb|The North-South checkpoint has been open since 2003]]\nAlthough it had been expected that talks would be unable to continue, discussions resumed in early January 2003. Thereafter, a further revision (Annan III) took place in February 2003, when Annan made a second visit to the island. During his stay he also called on the two sides to meet with him again the following month in [[The Hague]], where he would expect their answer on whether they were prepared to put the plan to a referendum. While the Greek Cypriot side, which was now led by [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], agreed to do so, albeit reluctantly, [[Rauf Denkta\u015f]] refused to allow a popular vote. The peace talks collapsed. A month later, on 16 April 2003, Cyprus formally signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2003|EU Treaty of Accession]] at a ceremony in [[Athens]].\n\nThroughout the rest of the year there was no effort to restart talks. Instead, attention turned to the [[Elections in Northern Cyprus|Turkish Cypriot elections]], which were widely expected to see a victory by moderate pro-solution parties. In the end, the assembly was evenly split. A coalition administration was formed that brought together the pro-solution [[Republican Turkish Party|CTP]] and the [[Democratic Party (Northern Cyprus)|Democrat Party]], which had traditionally taken the line adopted by Rauf Denkta\u015f. This opened the way for Turkey to press for new discussions. After a meeting between [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] and [[Kofi Annan]] in Switzerland, the leaders of the two sides were called to New York. There they agreed to start a new negotiation process based on two phases: phase one, which would just involve the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, being held on the island and phase two, which would also include Greece and Turkey, being held elsewhere. After a month of negotiations in Cyprus, the discussions duly moved to Burgenstock, Switzerland. The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denkta\u015f rejected the plan outright and refused to attend these talks. Instead, his son [[Serdar Denkta\u015f]] and [[Mehmet Ali Talat]] attended in his place. There a fourth version of the plan was presented. This was short-lived. After final adjustments, a fifth and final version of the Plan was presented to the two sides on 31 March 2004.\n\n===The UN plan for settlement (Annan Plan)===\n{{Main|Annan Plan for Cyprus}}\n[[File:Proposed flag of the United Cyprus Republic.svg|thumb|left|190px|Proposed flag of the United Republic of Cyprus]]\n[[File:Kofi Annan.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Former UN secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]] was the creator of the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan plan]].]]\nUnder the final proposals, the Republic of Cyprus would become the United Cyprus Republic. It would be a loose federation composed of two component states. The northern [[Turkish Cypriot constituent state]] would encompass about 28.5% of the island, the southern [[Greek Cypriot constituent state]] would be made up of the remaining 71.5%. Each part would have had its own parliament. There would also be a [[Bicameralism|bicameral parliament]] on the federal level. In the [[Chamber of Deputies]], the Turkish Cypriots would have 25% of the seats. (While no accurate figures are currently available, the split between the two communities at independence in 1960 was approximately 80:20 in favour of the Greek Cypriots.) The [[Senate]] would consist of equal parts of members of each ethnic group. Executive power would be vested in a presidential council. The chairmanship of this council would rotate between the communities. Each community would also have the right to veto all legislation.\n\nOne of the most controversial elements of the plan concerned property. During Turkey's military intervention/invasion in 1974, many Greek Cypriots (who owned 90% of the land and property in the north) were forced to abandon their homes. (A few Turkish Cypriots were also forced to abandon their homes in the South.) Since then, the question of restitution of their property has been a central demand of the Greek Cypriot side. However, the Turkish Cypriots argue that the complete return of all Greek Cypriot properties to their original owners would be incompatible with the functioning of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal settlement. To this extent, they have argued compensation should be offered. The Annan Plan attempted to bridge this divide. In certain areas, such as [[Morphou]] (G\u00fczelyurt) and [[Famagusta]] (Gazima\u011fusa), which would be returned to Greek Cypriot control, Greek Cypriot refugees would have received back all of their property according to a phased timetable. In other areas, such as [[Kyrenia]] (Girne) and the [[Karpass Peninsula]], which would remain under Turkish Cypriot control, they would be given back a proportion of their land (usually one third assuming that it had not been extensively developed) and would receive compensation for the rest. All land and property (that was not used for worship) belonging to businesses and institutions, including the Church the largest property owner on the island, would have been expropriated. While many Greek Cypriots found these provisions unacceptable in themselves, many others resented the fact that the Plan envisaged all compensation claims by a particular community to be met by their own side. This was seen as unfair as Turkey would not be required to contribute any funds towards the compensation.\n\nApart from the property issue, there were many other parts of the plan that sparked controversy. For example, the agreement envisaged the gradual reduction in the number of Greek and [[Turkish Military Forces in Northern Cyprus|Turkish troops]] on the island. After six years, the number of soldiers from each country would be limited to 6,000. This would fall to 600 after 19 years. Thereafter, the aim would be to try to achieve full demilitarisation, a process that many hoped would be made possible by Turkish accession to the European Union. The agreement also kept in place the Treaty of Guarantee \u2013 an integral part of the 1960 constitution that gave Britain, Greece and Turkey a right to intervene militarily in the island's affairs. Many Greek Cypriots were concerned that the continuation of the right of intervention would give Turkey too large a say in the future of the island. However, most Turkish Cypriots felt that a continued Turkish military presence was necessary to ensure their security. Another element of the plan the Greek Cypriots objected to was that it allowed many Turkish citizens who had been brought to the island to remain. (The exact number of these Turkish 'settlers' is highly disputed. Some argue that the figure is as high as 150,000 or as low as 40,000. They are seen as settlers illegally brought to the island in contravention of international law. However, while many accepted Greek Cypriot concerns on this matter, there was a widespread feeling that it would be unrealistic \u2013 and legally and morally problematic \u2013 to forcibly remove every one of these settlers, especially as many of them had been born and raised on the island.)\n\n===Referendums, 24 April 2004===\n{{main|Cypriot Annan Plan referendums, 2004}}\nUnder the terms of the plan, the Annan plan would only come into force if accepted by the two communities in simultaneous [[2004 Cypriot Annan Plan referendums|referendums]]. These were set for 24 April 2004. In the weeks that followed there was intense campaigning in both communities. However, and in spite of opposition from Rauf Denkta\u015f, who had boycotted the talks in [[Switzerland]], it soon became clear that the Turkish Cypriots would vote in favour of the agreement. Among Greek Cypriots opinion was heavily weighted against the plan. [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], the president of Cyprus, in a speech delivered on 7 April called on Greek Cypriots to reject the plan. His position was supported by the centrist Diko party and the socialists of EDEK as well as other smaller parties. His major coalition partner [[AKEL]], one of the largest parties on the island, chose to reject the plan bowing to the wishes of the majority of the party base. Support for the plan was voiced by [[Democratic Rally]] (DISY) leadership, the main right-wing party, despite opposition to the plan from the majority of party followers, and the [[United Democrats]], a small centre-left party led by [[George Vasiliou]], a former president. [[Glafcos Clerides]], now retired from politics, also supported the plan. Prominent members of DISY who did not support the Annan plan split from the party and openly campaigned against it. The Greek Cypriot Church also opposed the plan in line with the views of the majority of public opinion.\n\nThe United Kingdom (a Guarantor Power) and the United States came out in favour of the plan. Turkey signalled its support for the plan. The Greek Government decided to remain neutral. However, Russia was troubled by an attempt by Britain and the US to introduce a resolution in the UN [[Security Council]] supporting the plan and used its veto to block the move. This was done because they believed that the resolution would provide external influence to the internal debate, which they did not view as fair.<ref>UN Security Council Press Release SC / 8066 http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sc8066.doc.htm</ref>\n\nIn 24 April [[referendum]] the Turkish Cypriots endorsed the plan by a margin of almost two to one. However, the Greek Cypriots resoundingly voted against the plan, by a margin of about three to one.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Referendum results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!rowspan=2|Referendum result!!colspan=2| Yes!!colspan=2|No!!rowspan=2|Turnout\n|-\n!

Since then, two Turkish Cypriot representatives of [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] have been elected in the Assembly of [[Northern Cyprus]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PwmeRG9QsUC James Ker-Lindsay (UN SG's Former Special Representative for Cyprus)] The Foreign Policy of Counter Secession: Preventing the Recognition of Contested States, p.149</ref><ref>[https://archive.is/20140226103031/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action;jsessionid=516B38E2EAFF2073525EEB08F7B53903?newsId=105715 Today's Zaman] 2005\u20132007: CTP \u00d6zdil Nami; UBP Huseyin Ozgurgun</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 2004, a week after the [[referendum]], Cyprus joined the [[European Union]]. Under the terms of accession the whole island is considered to be a member of the European Union. However, the terms of the ''[[Acquis|acquis communautaire]]'', the EU's body of laws, have been suspended in [[Northern Cyprus]].\n\nAfter the referendum, in June 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community, despite the objection of the Cypriot government, had its designation at the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], of which it has been an observer since 1979, changed to the \"[[Turkish Cypriot State]]\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PwmeRG9QsUC James Ker-Lindsay (UN SG's Former Special Representative for Cyprus)] The Foreign Policy of Counter Secession: Preventing the Recognition of Contested States, p.141: \"..despite strong objections from Nicosia, this designation was changed to the \"Turkish Cypriot State\"\"</ref>\n\nDespite initial hopes that a new process to modify the rejected plan would start by autumn, most of the rest of 2004 was taken up with discussions over a proposal by the European Union to open up direct trade with the Turkish Cypriots and provide \u20ac259,000,000 in funds to help them upgrade their infrastructure. This plan has provoked considerable debate. The Republic of Cyprus has argued that there can be no direct trade via ports and airports in Northern Cyprus as these are unrecognised. Instead, it has offered to allow Turkish Cypriots to use Greek Cypriot facilities, which are internationally recognised. This has been rejected by the Turkish Cypriots. At the same time, attention turned to the question of the start of Turkey's future membership of the European Union. At a [[European Council]] held on 17 December 2004, and despite earlier Greek Cypriot threats to impose a veto, Turkey was granted a start date for formal membership talks on condition that it signed a protocol extending the customs union to the new entrants to the EU, including Cyprus. Assuming this is done, formal membership talks would begin on 3 October 2005.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the UN plan in the referendum there has been no attempt to restart negotiations between the two sides. While both sides have reaffirmed their commitment to continuing efforts to reach an agreement, the UN Secretary-General has not been willing to restart the process until he can be sure that any new negotiations will lead to a comprehensive settlement based on the plan he put forward in 2004. To this end, he has asked the Greek Cypriots to present a written list of the changes they would like to see made to the agreement. This was rejected by President [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] on the grounds that no side should be expected to present their demands in advance of negotiations. However, it appears as though the Greek Cypriots would be prepared to present their concerns orally. Another Greek Cypriot concern centres on the procedural process for new talks. Mr. Papadopoulos said that he will not accept arbitration or timetables for discussions. The UN fears that this would lead to another open-ended process that could drag on indefinitely.\n\nIn October 2012, [[Northern Cyprus]] became an \"observer member\" country of the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] under the name \"[[Turkish Cypriot State]]\".\n\nAccording to Stratis Efthymiou, even though defeated, the referendum had a formative impact on the Greek Cypriot community;<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis|title=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2019|isbn=978-3-030-14702-0|location=Cham|pages=}}</ref> Greek Cypriots felt that reunification is a touchable reality, and this undermined the nationalist struggle and ideas of military defence. According to Efthymiou, since the referendum, the phenomenon of [[draft dodging]] has become prevalent and the defence budget has turned into a trivial amount.<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n===Formula One and the Cyprus dispute===\nThe podium display after the [[2006 Turkish Grand Prix]] caused a controversy, when winner [[Felipe Massa]] received the trophy from [[Mehmet Ali Talat]], who was referred to as the \"President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\". The government of the Republic of Cyprus filed an official complaint with the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]. After investigating the incident, the FIA fined the organisers of the Grand Prix $5 million on 19 September 2006.<ref>[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17474.html Turks fined only $5m], GrandPrix.com, 19 September 2006</ref> The Turkish Motorsports Federation (TOSFED) and the organisers of the [[Turkish Grand Prix]] (MSO) agreed to pay half the fined sum pending an appeal to be heard by the FIA International Court of Appeal on 7 November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17612.html |title=F1 News > Turks to appeal |publisher=Grandprix.com |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2009}}</ref> TOSFED insisted the move was not planned and that Mehmet Ali Talat did fit FIA's criteria for podium presentations as a figure of world standing.

The status quo is unacceptable and its prolongation will have negative consequences for the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The leaders affirmed that a settlement would have a positive impact on the entire region, while first and foremost benefiting Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, respecting democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as each other's distinct identity and integrity and ensuring their common future in a united Cyprus within the European Union.\n\n2. The leaders expressed their determination to resume structured negotiations in a results-oriented manner. All unresolved core issues will be on the table, and will be discussed interdependently. The leaders will aim to reach a settlement as soon as possible, and hold separate simultaneous referenda thereafter.\n \n3. The settlement will be based on a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council Resolutions and the High Level Agreements. The united Cyprus, as a member of the United Nations and of the European Union, shall have a single international legal personality and a single sovereignty, which is defined as the sovereignty which is enjoyed by all member States of the United Nations under the UN Charter and which emanates equally from Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. There will be a single united Cyprus citizenship, regulated by federal law. All citizens of the united Cyprus shall also be citizens of either the Greek-Cypriot constituent state or the Turkish-Cypriot constituent state. This status shall be internal and shall complement, and not substitute in any way, the united Cyprus citizenship.\n\nThe powers of the federal government, and like matters that are clearly incidental to its specified powers, will be assigned by the constitution. The Federal constitution will also provide for the residual powers to be exercised by the constituent states. The constituent states will exercise fully and irrevocably all their powers, free from encroachment by the federal government. The federal laws will not encroach upon constituent state laws, within the constituent states' area of competences, and the constituent states' laws will not encroach upon the federal laws within the federal government's competences. Any dispute in respect thereof will be adjudicated finally by the Federal Supreme Court. Neither side may claim authority or jurisdiction over the other.\n\n4. The united Cyprus federation shall result from the settlement following the settlement's approval by separate simultaneous referenda. The Federal constitution shall prescribe that the united Cyprus federation shall be composed of two constituent states of equal status. The bi-zonal, bi-communal nature of the federation and the principles upon which the EU is founded will be safeguarded and respected throughout the island.  The Federal constitution shall be the supreme law of the land and will be binding on all the federation's authorities and on the constituent states. Union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession or any other unilateral change to the state of affairs will be prohibited.\n\n5. The negotiations are based on the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\n\n6. The appointed representatives are fully empowered to discuss any issue at any time and should enjoy parallel access to all stakeholders and interested parties in the process, as needed. The leaders of the two communities will meet as often as needed. They retain the ultimate decision making power. Only an agreement freely reached by the leaders may be put to separate simultaneous referenda. Any kind of arbitration is excluded.\n\n7. The sides will seek to create a positive atmosphere to ensure the talks succeed. They commit to avoiding blame games or other negative public comments on the negotiations. They also commit to efforts to implement confidence building measures that will provide a dynamic impetus to the prospect for a united Cyprus.}}\n\nThe governments of both Greece and Turkey expressed their support for renewed peace talks.<ref name=\"DW_Peace\">{{cite news |last=Morley |first=Nathan |date=11 February 2014 |title=Cyprus peace talks resume after two-year break |url=http://www.dw.de/cyprus-peace-talks-resume-after-two-year-break/a-17424693 |newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=23 February 2014 }}</ref> The declaration was also welcomed by the European Union.<ref name=\"EUObs_Big\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Big expectations as Cyprus peace talks restart |url=http://euobserver.com/foreign/123097 |newspaper=[[EUobserver]] |location=Brussels |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn 13 February 2014, [[Chrysostomos II of Cyprus|Archbishop Chrysostomos]] lent [[Nicos Anastasiades|Anastasiades]] his backing on the Joint Declaration.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Anastasiades secures Archbishop's backing |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/13/anastasiades-secures-archbishops-backing/ |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |date=13 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 2014, the Greek Cypriot negotiator Andreas Mavroyiannis and Turkish Cypriot negotiator Kudret \u00d6zersay held their first meeting and agreed to visit Greece and Turkey respectively.<ref>{{cite news |last=Evripidou |first=Stefanos |date=15 February 2014 |title=Direct access to guarantors |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/15/direct-access-to-guarantors/ |newspaper=Cyprus Mail }}</ref>\n\nReactions among the Greek Cypriot political parties were mixed.
