(Editor), ''The Blue Book of Electric Guitars'', (5th Edition), 1998</ref> and manufactured and marketed by the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]]. It was first introduced as a line of \"student\" guitars to replace the outgoing [[Fender Mustang|Mustang]] and [[Fender Musicmaster|Musicmaster]] models.<ref name=\"Bullet Appreciation\">[http://fenderbullet.info The Original USA Fender Bullet Appreciation Page]</ref>\n\n==USA Version 1 (1981)==\nFender marketed two models, initially manufacture was set up offshore in Korea, but due to technical issues, such as unacceptable high actions, the guitars were recalled to the U.S.A for manufacture at the Fullerton plant.\n\nTwo models were available - The \"Bullet\" ( known as The standard Bullet ) & the \"Bullet Deluxe\", retailers & dealers in the USA often called the guitars \"The Bullet One\" but this was never a marketing name used by Fender . These two models had a single cutaway body style similar to that of the [[Fender Telecaster]] but much closer in size to the Mustang and Duo-Sonic that the Bullet replaced, the guitar had a 21 fret rosewood neck and Telecaster-style [[headstock]] and Kluson Deluxe tuners. Similarly to preceding student models like the Mustang, Bronco and Musicmaster, cost savings were made by using less wood for the body, both guitar bodies were 1- 5/8 inches thick as opposed to the 1- 3/4 inch thickness of other Fender guitars, parts were quick to assemble and labor saving, both models had the same hardware & electrics as other Fender guitars from the same era. The standard model originally retailed at $199.00 or $249 including the vacuum formed case, cord, strap, polishing cloth & bridge adjustment wrenches. The Bullet Deluxe had a plastic pickguard with a separate, traditional hardtail bridge while the standard model featured an Steel pickguard-bridge-tailpiece combo, powder coated white or black, with separate saddles for each string. Both models had 2 single coil pickups with a three-way selector switch. The pickups had the same closed pickup covers as used on the Mustang & were initially left over Mustang stock. Color options were red or ivory, with a white or black pick guards on both models. At release in 1981, the only neck option was maple with a rosewood fretboard; a maple neck with a walnut skunk stripe was introduced as an option in 1982.\n\n==USA Version 2 (1982 - 1983)==\nIn 1982, Fender introduced a revised version of the Bullet, including two [[Fender Bullet Bass|bass models]]. This series featured a double cutaway body similar to the [[Fender Stratocaster]] without body contouring and therefore almost the same shape as the Mustang and Duo-Sonic that the Bullet replaced. Maple was the only neck option and the headstock retained the version one telecaster profile. Due to Kluson going out of business in 1981, Fender introduced the 70's style F tuners on the 1982 Bullet range and also used the Fender logo sealed tuners on the series, both made by Schaller in W. Germany. Five models were marketed - the Bullet (standard), the Bullet H-1, the Bullet S-2, S-3, and H-2\u2014in addition to the two new bass models (a regular scale \"B-34\" and short scale \"B-30\"). The Bullet (standard) had the patented alloy pickguard-bridge-tailpiece combo with two single coil pickups and a 3 way switch. The H-1 sported the same alloy pickguard-bridge-tailpiece combo with one humbucker pickup; it also had a coil tap button to split the humbucker to single coil. The S-2, S-3 & H-2 were marketed as Deluxe versions & had a white plastic 3-ply pickguard with a separate hardtail bridge, in 1983 a single ply pickguard was introduced with the model number S-2, S-3 or H-2 embossed on the lower horn. The S-2 had two single coil pickups & a 3-way switch, the S-3 had 3 single coil pickups & a 5-way switch, the H-2 had two humbucker pickups each with their own coil tapping button & a 3-way switch. The humbucker pickups were really two single coil pickups with alnico rod magnets side-by-side. The basses each had plastic guards and traditional bridges. They had the old Mustang bass style pickups. They differed only in scale. The popular second version Bullets were available in color options of red, ivory, brown sunburst, or walnut; black was also available but never marketed as a color option.  The S-2 was notably featured in the music video for [[Twisted Sister]]'s \"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (Twisted Sister song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]],\" used by the son of [[Mark Metcalf]]'s character to blow him out of the window when the song begins. Fender ceased production of Bullet guitars at the end of 1983 and was never produced again in the USA. Production of the Bullet range moved to Japan, under the Squier name.\n\n==Squier Bullet==\n\n===1983\u20132007===\n[[File:Squier by Fender.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stamp that appears on the guitar's headstock.]]\n[[File:Squier Bullet Special. all collors.jpg|thumb|right|250px|All factory colors for the Squier Bullet Special. All of these examples have been modified by the owner.]]\n\nLate 1983 to 1984 the Bullet manufacture was moved to Japan (SQ serial number pre-fix), these guitars were also known as \"Bullet One\" in the USA by dealers & retailers, but never marketed as such. The guitars had solid wood bodies,good quality pick-ups and hardware but no longer had string through bodies.A and hard tail bridge & later a six screw vintage style trem bridge was offered .The guitars featured 3 Single coils or 2 Humbucking pickups like the original USA made \"Bullet\" guitars, but steel rods were used as pole pieces with a ceramic bar magnet, the humbucker version, consisted of the same paired single coil configuration as the American-made models. In 1985,86 and 87 production was again moved, this time to Korea to reduce costs (E serial number pre-fix stamped on the neck plate). These guitars were marketed as the [[Squier]] Bullet and used plywood bodies, the neck was a rosewood board on maple & had a strat headstock with a telecaster style heel, three single coil pickup pattern like the Stratocaster as well as low cost two point tremolo . These were available in Red or Black.\n       \nIn 1984/85 there was a Squier Bullet guitar model manufactured in Japan that featured a full sized strat style body made of solid wood. This particular Squier Bullet model is also distinguished by the fact that it featured a two pickup configuration, (neck and bridge) instead of the usual three pickup, a Stratocaster style headstock with Telecaster style heel shape, jack socket located on the pickguard, 2 knobs, (one volume, one tone) and a top-load hard tail or two point trem. It was offered in two colors, ivory and black.\n\nIn 1986 Squier released the contemporary HST ( Hybrid Start/Tele ) Bullet, E prefix serial on the neck plate, the guitar had a more pointy shaped telecaster style body with 3 pickups HSS configuration (Humbucker, single coil, single coil), a rosewood board on maple neck with a strat shaped headstock, no pickguard & a two pivot tremolo, this was a budget guitar aimed at the Heavy Metal market & was available in ivory or Black. This guitar had no country of origin mark, it is not known whether the guitar was made in Japan or Korea, the overall build quality is reasonably good, as the serial is an E prefix it maybe Korean as most Japanese models had the SQ prefix.\n\nIn 1989 Squier introduced a revamped version of the contemporary HST Bullet, this guitar did feature \"Made in Korea\" on the headstock with an E prefix serial & is exactly the same as the guitar above but it had a strat shaped body, also available in ivory or black.\n\n===2007\u2013present===\nSquier introduced a new, Chinese-made Bullet Strat in 2007, sporting a built-in tremolo arm, rosewood fingerboard, and one of six body finishes (Pink, Arctic White, Daphne Blue, Fiesta Red, Brown Sunburst, or Black) with a single-ply white pickguard.\n\nBy 2015, Fender was using Squier Bullet as a line name for their lowest-priced guitars at the $150 price point. The guitars used inexpensive [[basswood]] for their bodies and reduced paint steps to the absolute minimum to keep costs under control. However, they used the same pickups and tuners as their slightly more expensive Affinity series cousins, and generally were acknowledged as good starter instruments. In 2018, Fender had done away with the vibrato bridge on the Bullet line and made its mainline Bullet guitars top-loading hardtail instruments (vibrato bridges could still be found on special production runs for stores such as [[Guitar Center]]). The Stratocaster headstocks say \"Bullet\u00ae Strat\u00ae,\" while the Mustang headstocks simply have an all-black version of the Squier Mustang logo used on the more-expensive Vintage Modified instruments.\n\nAs of [[Summer NAMM]] 2018, Fender's Squier Bullet line consisted of:\n* Squier Mini Strat (SSS, 22.75\" short-scale)\n* Squier Bullet Stratocaster (SSS, 25.5\" scale)\n* Squier Bullet Stratocaster (HSS, 25.5\" scale)\n* Squier Bullet Mustang (HH, 24\" short-scale)\n\n<!-- Need info here regarding the current Indonesia-made Squier Bullets available via Guitar Center/Musicians Friend.  What was the first year they were offered, differences from Chinese version mentioned above, etc. -->\n\n==The Squier Bullet Special==\nFrom around 1999 to 2004, Fender produced a single pickup Squier Bullet Special guitar. It had a fixed, hardtail bridge, a dual-coil (humbucker) bridge pickup, one volume control, and a 21 fret rosewood fingerboard bolt on neck. The body was made out of plywood and it was made in six colors: Black, Ice Blue Metallic, Red Metallic, Cobalt Blue Metallic, Orange, and Satin Silver. The Red and Orange bodies were made with black hardware; all other colors had chrome hardware. All Bullet Specials had a 1 ply black pickguard. Most of the Squier Bullet Specials made in 2002 came with a special 20th Anniversary engraved neck plate. The logo on the headstock reads \"Squier Bullet\" with no mention of \"Special\". Some 2002 versions of the black and Frost Red Metallic Squier Bullet Special are known to have the Affinity brand on the headstock as well.<ref>Bacon, Tony ''Squier Electrics: 30 Years of Fenders Budget Guitar Brand''; Backbeat,1st Edition, January 1, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-61713-022-9}}</ref>\n\nAll '''Squier''' Bullet Special guitars were made in Indonesia at the Cort factory. The serial numbers start with IC followed by two digits that designate the year the guitar was made. The remaining digits indicate month of production, color, and sequence.

Introduced in the early 1970s, these strings differ by having cylindrical bullet-shaped ends instead of the \"ball ends\" common to other manufacturers. Fender states the bullet ends create a tighter fit in the tremolo block on Stratocaster guitars, leading to greater tuning stability when the tremolo is used. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.fender.com/experience/tech-talk/fender-bullets-strings/#|title=Fender Bullet Strings|quote=Fender engineers of the early 1970s were aware that the standard ball-end string design that had prevailed until then presented very specific tuning problems, especially on tremolo-equipped guitars.}}</ref> In the early 1990s Fender switched from using zinc-plated steel for the bullet ends to brass, improving sustain. Today nickel is also used. Stainless steel strings with bullet ends are also offered since the late '90s.\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fjestad, Zachary R.

Ioannidis denied the rumours and actually reassured Pattakos, on his \"military honour\", that he was a supporter of the Constitution and of Papadopoulos' reforms.<ref name=\"Unrepetant\"/> Pattakos also mentioned that he knew very well that in the afternoon of 24 November 1973 Ioannidis had been called by Papadopoulos himself and, with Makarezos present, he again vehemently denied any rumours about planning a coup. Pattakos added that a few hours after that meeting, around 3:30&nbsp;a.m. the next day, the tanks appeared in the streets of Athens and [[Phaedon Gizikis]] was sworn early that morning as figurehead President of the Republic.<ref name=\"Unrepetant\"/>\n\nOn the second day of the trial, Papadopoulos' defence lawyers Karagiannopoulos, Papaspyrou and Steiropoulos raised the objection that the court did not have jurisdictional authority over their client regarding the events of the Polytechnic, because he had [[Sovereign immunity|Presidential immunity]] as [[President of Greece]] during the time of the events and demanded an immediate [[court order|ruling]] from the court.<ref name=\"Markoulakis\"/> The court went immediately in recess for further deliberations. Once the proceedings resumed the Court announced its decision. The court found that Papadopoulos was not immune from prosecution as President of the Republic at the time of the events because the 21 April 1967 coup initiated violence against the Greek State and usurped the power and legal authority of the people and therefore all subsequent governments of the junta were deemed by the court to be products of violence.<ref name=\"Markoulakis\"/> Consequently, the Court found that Papadopoulos was not a legitimate President of the Republic at the time, and as such not immune from prosecution.<ref

The consequent governments were governments of violence. Therefore it is clearly concluded that anyone who exercised duties of governmental authority under any office including that of the head of state, did not in reality exercise legal authority and consequently they are not protected for their actions during the exercise of such authority under the regulations which define immunity.  Accordingly and the standing as accused Georgios Papadopoulos, having exercised duties as President of the Republic during the time the actions were carried out as are attributed to him by the indictment, he was not the legitimate President of the Republic and therefore he is not protected under the sections of immunity.</blockquote>\n\nFollowing the ruling about immunity, Ioannidis' lawyer Giorgos Alfantakis made a motion to split and postpone the trial on the grounds that the indictment did not have a complete rationale: although it was mentioned in the order that Ioannidis encouraged and persuaded unit commanders of the security forces to act in a criminal fashion during the suppression of the uprising, the names of the commanders were not mentioned in the indictment. The court rejected the motion on the grounds that it could not annul the indictment.<ref name=\"Markoulakis\"/>\n\n===Verdict===\n\nOn 31 December 1975, the five-member court in Athens convicted 20 of the 32 accused and held Ioannidis as the only person morally responsible for the events.<ref name=\"Unrepetant\"/>\n\nThe main sentences are shown in the following table:<ref name=\"sentencing table\">[http://www.phorum.gr/viewtopic.php?p=98590 Sentencing table]</ref><ref name=patris.gr>{{cite news|script-title=el:\u039e\u03b5\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1: ... \u039a\u03b9 \u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ae\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5 \u03bf \u0399\u03c9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a4\u03af \u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03bf|url=http://www.patris.gr/articles/21474?PHPSESSID=#.UU6O4xec7g0|accessdate=24 March 2013|newspaper=patris.gr|author=\u039c\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u039a\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u039c\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7|language=el}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"225\"|Junta member\n!width=\"225\"|Sentence\n|-\n|Dimitrios Ioannidis||Seven Life sentences\n|-\n|Georgios Papadopoulos||25 years\n|-\n|Barnabas||Three Life sentences\n|-\n|Nikolaos Dertilis||Life\n|-\n|Zagorianakos||25 years\n|-\n|Mavroidis||25 years\n|-\n|Karayannis||25 years\n|-\n|Lymberis||25 years\n|}\n\n==The torturers==\n\n=== Trials of the torturers ===\nIn addition to the two [[civil trial]]s of the instigators and the Polytechnic events, there were another six trials, which concerned the use of torture by the regime ({{lang-el|\u039f\u03b9 \u0394\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd}}, \"The Trials of the Torturers\").<ref name=\"Torture Trials\"/> Two of the trials involved the [[court martial]] of members of the [[Greek Military Police|EAT/ESA]] military police.<ref name=\"rizo\">[http://www1.rizospastis.gr/page.do?publDate=9/12/2000&id=1484&pageNo=2&direction=1 Rizospastis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724130122/http://www1.rizospastis.gr/page.do?publDate=9%2F12%2F2000&id=1484&pageNo=2&direction=1 |date=2011-07-24 }}</ref>  The first trial started 7 August 1975 at the Athens Permanent Court\nMartial,<ref name=\"Amnesty 3\"/> and the second trial on 13 October 1975, with the verdict announced on 9 December 1975.<ref name=\"sentencing table\"/><ref name=\"rizo\"/> In total, the defendants totalled 18 officers and 14 soldiers of the non commissioned rank who all faced charges arising from using torture during interrogations.

By the end of 2005, lawyers representing Ioannidis and Dertilis petitioned the court for their release, but at the same time Ioannidis declared that he did not regret any of his actions.

Ioannidis denied the rumours and actually reassured Pattakos, on his \"military honour\", that he was a supporter of the Constitution and of Papadopoulos' reforms.<ref name=\"Unrepetant\"/> Pattakos also mentioned that he knew very well that in the afternoon of 24 November 1973 Ioannidis had been called by Papadopoulos himself and, with Makarezos present, he again vehemently denied any rumours about planning a coup. Pattakos added that a few hours after that meeting, around 3:30&nbsp;a.m. the next day, the tanks appeared in the streets of Athens and [[Phaedon Gizikis]] was sworn early that morning as figurehead President of the Republic.<ref name=\"Unrepetant\"/>\n\nOn the second day of the trial, Papadopoulos' defence lawyers Karagiannopoulos, Papaspyrou and Steiropoulos raised the objection that the court did not have jurisdictional authority over their client regarding the events of the Polytechnic, because he had [[Sovereign immunity|Presidential immunity]] as [[President of Greece]] during the time of the events and demanded an immediate [[court order|ruling]] from the court.<ref name=\"Markoulakis\"/> The court went immediately in recess for further deliberations. Once the proceedings resumed the Court announced its decision. The court found that Papadopoulos was not immune from prosecution as President of the Republic at the time of the events because the 21 April 1967 coup initiated violence against the Greek State and usurped the power and legal authority of the people and therefore all subsequent governments of the junta were deemed by the court to be products of violence.<ref name=\"Markoulakis\"/> Consequently, the Court found that Papadopoulos was not a legitimate President of the Republic at the time, and as such not immune from prosecution.<ref

The consequent governments were governments of violence. Therefore it is clearly concluded that anyone who exercised duties of governmental authority under any office including that of the head of state, did not in reality exercise legal authority and consequently they are not protected for their actions during the exercise of such authority under the regulations which define immunity.  Accordingly and the standing as accused Georgios Papadopoulos, having exercised duties as President of the Republic during the time the actions were carried out as are attributed to him by the indictment, he was not the legitimate President of the Republic and therefore he is not protected under the sections of immunity.</blockquote>\n\nFollowing the ruling about immunity, Ioannidis' lawyer Giorgos Alfantakis made a motion to split and postpone the trial on the grounds that the indictment did not have a complete rationale: although it was mentioned in the order that Ioannidis encouraged and persuaded unit commanders of the security forces to act in a criminal fashion during the suppression of the uprising, the names of the commanders were not mentioned in the indictment. The court rejected the motion on the grounds that it could not annul the indictment.<ref name=\"Markoulakis\"/>\n\n===Verdict===\n\nOn 31 December 1975, the five-member court in Athens convicted 20 of the 32 accused and held Ioannidis as the only person morally responsible for the events.<ref name=\"Unrepetant\"/>\n\nThe main sentences are shown in the following table:<ref name=\"sentencing table\">[http://www.phorum.gr/viewtopic.php?p=98590 Sentencing table]</ref><ref name=patris.gr>{{cite news|script-title=el:\u039e\u03b5\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1: ... \u039a\u03b9 \u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ae\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5 \u03bf \u0399\u03c9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a4\u03af \u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03bf|url=http://www.patris.gr/articles/21474?PHPSESSID=#.UU6O4xec7g0|accessdate=24 March 2013|newspaper=patris.gr|author=\u039c\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u039a\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u039c\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7|language=el}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"225\"|Junta member\n!width=\"225\"|Sentence\n|-\n|Dimitrios Ioannidis||Seven Life sentences\n|-\n|Georgios Papadopoulos||25 years\n|-\n|Barnabas||Three Life sentences\n|-\n|Nikolaos Dertilis||Life\n|-\n|Zagorianakos||25 years\n|-\n|Mavroidis||25 years\n|-\n|Karayannis||25 years\n|-\n|Lymberis||25 years\n|}\n\n==The torturers==\n\n=== Trials of the torturers ===\nIn addition to the two [[civil trial]]s of the instigators and the Polytechnic events, there were another six trials, which concerned the use of torture by the regime ({{lang-el|\u039f\u03b9 \u0394\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd}}, \"The Trials of the Torturers\").<ref name=\"Torture Trials\"/> Two of the trials involved the [[court martial]] of members of the [[Greek Military Police|EAT/ESA]] military police.<ref name=\"rizo\">[http://www1.rizospastis.gr/page.do?publDate=9/12/2000&id=1484&pageNo=2&direction=1 Rizospastis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724130122/http://www1.rizospastis.gr/page.do?publDate=9%2F12%2F2000&id=1484&pageNo=2&direction=1 |date=2011-07-24 }}</ref>  The first trial started 7 August 1975 at the Athens Permanent Court\nMartial,<ref name=\"Amnesty 3\"/> and the second trial on 13 October 1975, with the verdict announced on 9 December 1975.<ref name=\"sentencing table\"/><ref name=\"rizo\"/> In total, the defendants totalled 18 officers and 14 soldiers of the non commissioned rank who all faced charges arising from using torture during interrogations.

By the end of 2005, lawyers representing Ioannidis and Dertilis petitioned the court for their release, but at the same time Ioannidis declared that he did not regret any of his actions.

dissident. The military police, ESA, were responsible for most of the torture. Their headquarters and major center of interrogation in Athens was called EAT/ESA a place deliberately created to \"make all Greece tremble\"and \"In 1975 shortly after the fall of the military regime, two trials of EAT/ESA soldiers and conscript soldiers were held in Athens. Those trials offered the first, full public disclosure of the effect of the culture of torture on both the victims and the victimizers.

Inequality and uneven development globally\nInequality is driving migration, as poorer populations become better connected. 165 million of the world\u2019s international migrants, or nearly two thirds of the total as of 2017, were being hosted in high-income countries, according to United Nations statistics, while just 11 million were living in low-income countries. <ref> UN Migration Report 2017, United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs, NY. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/migrationreport/docs/MigrationReport2017_Highlights.pdf </ref> The most popular migration corridors clearly lead from poorer to wealthier countries, as most of the people migrating are doing so in order to seek a better life. <ref>IOM World Migration Report 2020, IOM, Geneva; see Chapter 3 with main migration corridors globally. http://www.iom.int/wmr/ </ref>They are in search of better incomes and means of securing food and shelter, and they are motivated by factors that are fundamental to the operation of any healthy civil society: the rule of law; safeguards to help prevent or limit corruption; access to health and education services; and protections from human rights abuses. The effects of economic inequality are far reaching; a person\u2019s ability to earn a decent living is overwhelmingly determined simply by the country where he or she lives. While at first it may seem like poor people would be the most likely to migrate for a better life, wealthy individuals often look to use their resources in order to migrate to a more favourable environment. Having second citizenship can give you a plan B and when you take into account that 71,300 UNHW's (36% of global UHNWI's) hold a second passport the full picture is clearer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imidaily.com/editors-picks/71300-uhnwis-already-have-second-citizenship-another-57400-considering-it/|title=71,300 UHNWIs Already Have Second Citizenship; Another 57,400 considering it|last=Insider|first=Investment Migration|date=2019-03-07|website=Investment Migration Insider|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\n2. Demographic change\nDemographic trends are posing migration challenges for some countries. Some countries and regions in the world have high birth rates and young populations, posing increasing challenges for some countries in feeding, educating, housing and providing employment opportunities for expanding numbers of people. <ref>World Economic Forum Transformation Map on Migration, 2019, World Economic Forum, Geneva. https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1Gb0000000LGr8EAG?tab=publications </ref>The incentive to migrate due to demographic pressure is likely to increase in many parts of the world, at least until improved education for girls and greater gender parity improve development outcomes and reduce both fertility rates and entrenched poverty. Meanwhile other countries and regions faced with rapidly ageing populations have a need to replace retiring members of their workforces and active contributors to their economies. This issue is most acute in Europe, where countries including Germany and the United Kingdom are among those where fertility was actually below the population replacement level between 2010 and 2015, according to the UN. <ref> UN Population Projection 2017, United Nations, NY. http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2017/06/world-population-projected-to-reach-9-8-billion-in-2050-and-11-2-billion-in-2100-says-un/ </ref> Japan also faces a significant related challenge. International migration could provide a strategic benefit to such countries in need of replenishing their populations for economic, social, and political reasons. \n\n3. Conflict and security\nConflict and a lack of security are increasingly displacing populations. Armed conflict is becoming increasingly complex, and involves an increasing number of actors, while the number of countries becoming embroiled in extreme conflict is rising. More people had been uprooted by war, violence and persecution than at any time in the last 70 years. The number of people seeking safety across international borders as refugees topped 25.9 million. <ref> UNHCR media release, 2017. http://www.unhcr.org/afr/news/stories/2017/6/5941561f4/forced-displacement-worldwide-its-highest-decades.html</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Emigration]]\n*[[Global Compact for Migration]]\n*[[Global Forum on Migration and Development]]\n*[[Human migration]]\n*[[Immigration]]\n*[[Transnationalism]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.iom.int/wmr/ IOM World Migration Report 2020]\n* [http://www.pstalker.com/migration Stalker's Guide to International Migration] Comprehensive interactive guide, with map and statistics\n* [http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_33931_1_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Trends in International Migration and in Migration Policies]\n* [http://meme.phpwebhosting.com/~migracion/rimd/indexing.php International Network on Migration and Development]\n\n[[Category:Human migration]]\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n[[Category:Population genetics]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Net migration rate world.PNG|thumb|342x342px|[[Net migration rate]]s for 2008: positive (blue), negative (orange), stable (green), and no data (gray) ]]\n'''International migration''' involves people crossing state boundaries and staying in the host state for a minimum length of time.<ref>World Migration Report 2020, International Organization for Migration, Geneva.</ref> Migration occurs for many reasons.

Temporary migrants intend only to stay for a limited periods of time; perhaps until the end of a particular program of study or for the duration of a their work contract or a certain work season.<ref>OECD International Migration Outlook, 2007.</ref> Both types of migrants have a significant effect on the economies and societies of the chosen destination country and the country of origin.<ref>\u201cTrends in International Migration and Migration Policies: About,\u201d OECD Directorate for Labour, Employment and Social Affairs, OECD.org, 18 July 2007 http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_33931_1_1_1_1_1,00.html .</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the countries which receive these migrants are often grouped into four categories: traditional settlement countries, European countries which encouraged labour migration after World War II, European countries which receive a significant portion of their immigrant populations from their former colonies, and countries which formerly were points of emigration but have recently emerged as immigrant destinations.<ref>Where Immigrant Students Succeed (17-19).</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n{{see|Human migration#Migration statistics}}\n\n==Drivers of international migration==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe main drivers of international migration include:\n\n1. Inequality and uneven development globally\nInequality is driving migration, as poorer populations become better connected. 165 million of the world\u2019s international migrants, or nearly two thirds of the total as of 2017, were being hosted in high-income countries, according to United Nations statistics, while just 11 million were living in low-income countries. <ref> UN Migration Report 2017, United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs, NY. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/migrationreport/docs/MigrationReport2017_Highlights.pdf </ref> The most popular migration corridors clearly lead from poorer to wealthier countries, as most of the people migrating are doing so in order to seek a better life. <ref>IOM World Migration Report 2020, IOM, Geneva; see Chapter 3 with main migration corridors globally. http://www.iom.int/wmr/ </ref>They are in search of better incomes and means of securing food and shelter, and they are motivated by factors that are fundamental to the operation of any healthy civil society: the rule of law; safeguards to help prevent or limit corruption; access to health and education services; and protections from human rights abuses. The effects of economic inequality are far reaching; a person\u2019s ability to earn a decent living is overwhelmingly determined simply by the country where he or she lives.\n\n2. Demographic change\nDemographic trends are posing migration challenges for some countries. Some countries and regions in the world have high birth rates and young populations, posing increasing challenges for some countries in feeding, educating, housing and providing employment opportunities for expanding numbers of people. <ref>World Economic Forum Transformation Map on Migration, 2019, World Economic Forum, Geneva. https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1Gb0000000LGr8EAG?tab=publications </ref>The incentive to migrate due to demographic pressure is likely to increase in many parts of the world, at least until improved education for girls and greater gender parity improve development outcomes and reduce both fertility rates and entrenched poverty. Meanwhile other countries and regions faced with rapidly ageing populations have a need to replace retiring members of their workforces and active contributors to their economies. This issue is most acute in Europe, where countries including Germany and the United Kingdom are among those where fertility was actually below the population replacement level between 2010 and 2015, according to the UN. <ref> UN Population Projection 2017, United Nations, NY. http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2017/06/world-population-projected-to-reach-9-8-billion-in-2050-and-11-2-billion-in-2100-says-un/ </ref> Japan also faces a significant related challenge. International migration could provide a strategic benefit to such countries in need of replenishing their populations for economic, social, and political reasons. \n\n3. Conflict and security\nConflict and a lack of security are increasingly displacing populations. Armed conflict is becoming increasingly complex, and involves an increasing number of actors, while the number of countries becoming embroiled in extreme conflict is rising. More people had been uprooted by war, violence and persecution than at any time in the last 70 years. The number of people seeking safety across international borders as refugees topped 25.9 million. <ref> UNHCR media release, 2017. http://www.unhcr.org/afr/news/stories/2017/6/5941561f4/forced-displacement-worldwide-its-highest-decades.html</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Emigration]]\n*[[Global Compact for Migration]]\n*[[Global Forum on Migration and Development]]\n*[[Human migration]]\n*[[Immigration]]\n*[[Transnationalism]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.iom.int/wmr/ IOM World Migration Report 2020]\n* [http://www.pstalker.com/migration Stalker's Guide to International Migration] Comprehensive interactive guide, with map and statistics\n* [http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_33931_1_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Trends in International Migration and in Migration Policies]\n* [http://meme.phpwebhosting.com/~migracion/rimd/indexing.php International Network on Migration and Development]\n\n[[Category:Human migration]]\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n[[Category:Population genetics]]\n", "name_user": "GlobalResident", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDrivers of international migration)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_migration"}
