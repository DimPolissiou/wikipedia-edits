Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective.<ref name=carol/> Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism \u2013 dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).<ref name=ttgov/><ref name=apara>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 57\u201359</ref>\n\nIn Lakshmi's iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolises knowledge, self-realisation, and liberation in Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness and karma (work, deed) in the Tantra ([[Sahasrara]]) context.<ref name=parasarthy>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 91\u201392, 160\u2013162</ref> The lotus, a flower that blossoms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which it grows.

[[Amrita]], the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning Kshirasagar ([[Ocean of Milk]]). The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirasagar with Mount Mandhara. The [[samudra manthan]] commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. [[Vishnu]] incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], the great venom-spewing serpent-god, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lakshmi. In some versions, she is said to be daughter of the sea god since she emerged from the sea.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn [[Garuda Purana]], [[Linga Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]], Lakshmi is said to have been born as daughter of the divine sage [[Bhrigu]] and his wife Khyati and was named ''Bhargavi''. According to Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the ''Devas''(god) and ''Asuras''(evil) churn the cosmic ocean of milk([[Ksheera Sagara]]). Lakshmi came out of the ocean bearing lotus, along with divine cow [[Kamadhenu]], [[Varuni]], [[Parijat]] tree, [[Apsaras]], [[Chandra]](the moon) and [[Dhanvantari]] with [[Amrita]](nectar of immortality). When she appeared, she had a choice to go to Devas or Asuras. She chose Devas' side and among thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu. Thereafter, in all three worlds, the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated.<ref name=buitenen>J. A.

In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore; those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same time|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2020|date=20 February 2020}}</ref> In response to the leak, SCCCI said that the leak is \"deeply disappointing\" and a \"betrayal of trust\", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tee |first1=Zhuo |title=Leak of closed-door Chan Chun Sing meeting 'deeply disappointing' and a 'betrayal', says Singapore Chinese Chamber president |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, [[The New York Times]] argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|title=As Coronavirus Surveillance Escalates, Personal Privacy Plummets|date=2020-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-24|last2=Sang-Hun|first2=Choe|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://sgwuhan.xose.net/ Interactive map of Singapore] \n* [https://corona.arrangy.com Worldwide Coronavirus Map, confirmed Cases] \u2013 Map the route paths of coronavirus confirmed cases.\n* [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation \u2013 Ministry of Health (Singapore)]\n* [https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html??cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna ChannelNewsAsia's COVID-19 clusters]\n* [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore The Straits Times article tracking every single case in Singapore]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Medical outbreaks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Singapore]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Details of ongoing viral pandemic in Singapore}}\n{{Current disaster|event=disease pandemic|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox pandemic\n| name            = 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore\n<!--Difficult to update, so no longer appropriate\n| map2            = COVID-19 Cases in Singapore by Planning Areas.svg\n| legend2         = {{center|Map of planning areas with confirmed (red) coronavirus cases (as of 11 March)}}\n-->\n| map3            = \n| legend3         = \n| disease         = [[COVID-19]]\n| virus_strain    = [[SARS-CoV-2]]\n| location        = [[Singapore]]\n| first_case      = \n| arrival_date    = 23 January 2020<br />({{Age in years, months, weeks and days|month1=01|day1=23|year1=2020|month2=|day2=|year2=}})\n| origin          = [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei]], China\n| recovery_cases  = 297<ref name=\"worldometers\">[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ worldometers.info]</ref><ref name=\"DashBoard\"/><ref name=\"CTSG\"/>\n| deaths          = 6<ref name=\"worldometers\"/><ref name=\"DashBoard\">[https://coronaboard.com COVID-19 Dashboard]</ref><ref name=\"CTSG\"/>\n| confirmed_cases = 1,189<ref name=\"worldometers\"/><ref name=\"DashBoard\"/><ref name=\"CTSG\">[https://www.coronatracker.com/country/sg Corona Tracker Overview]</ref>\n| active          = \n| suspected_cases = \n| total_ili       = \n| website         = {{url|https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19}}\n| First Case detected: = \n}}\nThe '''2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore''' is part of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing global pandemic]] of [[coronavirus disease 2019]] (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2).

He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same time|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2020|date=20 February 2020}}</ref> In response to the leak, SCCCI said that the leak is \"deeply disappointing\" and a \"betrayal of trust\", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tee |first1=Zhuo |title=Leak of closed-door Chan Chun Sing meeting 'deeply disappointing' and a 'betrayal', says Singapore Chinese Chamber president |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, [[The New York Times]] argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|title=As Coronavirus Surveillance Escalates, Personal Privacy Plummets|date=2020-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-24|last2=Sang-Hun|first2=Choe|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://sgwuhan.xose.net/ Interactive map of Singapore] \n* [https://corona.arrangy.com Worldwide Coronavirus Map, confirmed Cases] \u2013 Map the route paths of coronavirus confirmed cases.\n* [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation \u2013 Ministry of Health (Singapore)]\n* [https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html??cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna ChannelNewsAsia's COVID-19 clusters]\n* [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore The Straits Times article tracking every single case in Singapore]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Medical outbreaks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Singapore]]\n", "name_user": "CRau080", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Singapore"}

In 1930 the Mayor and [[Councillors]] resigned in protest against the re-introduction of adult suffrage. A caretaker Council was appointed until 1937, when it was abolished at the Council's own request.\n\nIn 1955 a statement added to the Local Government Ordinance provided for the Constitution of the Municipality of Darwin. In 1957 the Council was increased to twelve members and a Mayor.\n\nAn annual election providing for the Mayor and half of the Council members to be retired at each election, was also introduced at this time.

The Darwin Town Council was created in 1915. From 1921 the five member Council had been elected on a ratepayer's franchise. In 1930 the Mayor and [[Councillors]] resigned in protest against the re-introduction of adult suffrage. A caretaker Council was appointed until 1937, when it was abolished at the Council's own request.\n\nIn 1955 a statement added to the Local Government Ordinance provided for the Constitution of the Municipality of Darwin. In 1957 the Council was increased to twelve members and a Mayor.\n\nAn annual election providing for the Mayor and half of the Council members to be retired at each election, was also introduced at this time. The first council elections were held on 29 June 1957 and the first elected mayor of Darwin was [[Lucius Richardson | Lucius (Bill) Richardson]]. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.darwin.nt.gov.au/live/welcome-to-darwin/a-global-city/history |title=History|website=City of Darwin|date=2019|publisher=City of Darwin|access-date=December 5, 2019 }}</ref> In 1959 an Ordinance provided that the Municipality of Darwin be constituted a city and named 'City of Darwin'.\n\nThe first female [[Mayor]] of Darwin was Dr [[Ella Stack]], who served as the Mayor of Darwin from May 1975 to November 1979, and as Darwin's first [[Lord Mayor]] from November 1979.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.darwin.nt.gov.au/live/welcome-to-darwin/a-global-city/history |title=History|website=City of Darwin|date=2019|publisher=City of Darwin|access-date=December 5, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Wards and councillors==\nCity of Darwin is divided into four wards, governed by 12 alderman across those wards, as well as one directly elected Lord Mayor.

The English fan translations had different transliterations of the names of the characters, such as Androssi Zahard (fan translation) being transliterated to Endorsi Jahad (Line Webtoon). The story and characters remain the same.\n\n==Plot==\n''Tower of God'' centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n==Setting==\n===The Tower===\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the webtoon, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n===Shinsu===\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n===Positions===\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman(Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer(Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer(Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout(Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller(Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Characters==\n;Twenty-Fifth Bam/Jue Viole Grace\n;{{Voiced by|Taichi Ichikawa}}\n:Twenty-Fifth Bam ({{korean|hangul=\uc2a4\ubb3c\ub2e4\uc12f\ubc88\uc9f8 \ubc24|rr=Seumul-daseot-banjjae Bam}}; literal translation: Twenty-fifth Night) is the protagonist of ''Tower of God''. Bam is the latest Irregular to enter the Tower, but because of his young age and naivet\u00e9, his abilities don't resemble those that previous Irregulars are known for. In the story, Bam enters The Tower in search of his best friend Rachel, the only person who visited him and cared for him in the years of isolation that he spent in a cave underneath the Tower. After entering the Tower, he is told that all the answers that he seeks will be answered if he climbs the tower, though he is immediately presented with a seemingly impossible and deadly test. Bam succeeds, and is allowed to move onto the second floor, where all would-be Regulars start their ascension. Throughout the webtoon, Bam makes several friends among the candidates, and together they pass the many tests of the floor.\n\n:Bam returns in ''Tower of God: Part 2 - The Return of the Prince'', which takes place six years after the original story, using the alias Jue Viole Grace ({{korean|hangul=\uc96c \ube44\uc62c\ub808 \uadf8\ub808\uc774\uc2a4|rr=Ju Violet Grace}}). In this story, Bam is under the control of the infamous anti-Jahad group FUG, forced to cooperate to keep his old teammates safe. But then, not long after, his old teammates, including Khun, found out that he was alive, and was Ju Viole Grace. They set out a plan to free Bam from FUG, which takes place in the Workshop Battle, and it was successful. After that, Bam and his teammates goes through a series of adventures on the Hell Express.\n\n:Bam returns again in Tower of God:Part 3, taking place a few years after the Battle of the Last Stop. Ha Jin Sung, Bam's teacher in FUG, was caught by Kallavan, who is in control of a unit in Jahad's army. To rescue Ha Jin Sung, Bam needs help from the King of the Dogs, Baylord  Yama, a FUG slayer, and him and his teammates set out on another adventure in the Cage, where the Dogs live.\n\n;Rachel\n;{{Voiced by|[[Saori Hayami]]}}\n:Rachel ({{korean|hangul=\ub77c\ud5ec|rr=Rahel}}) was Bam's best friend until she entered the Tower and became a regular (but that was only what Bam thought which is proved in the later half of the webtoon). She desires to see the stars in the night sky at the top of the Tower and is determined to reach it by all means. This wish comes from her [[fear of the dark]]ness of the night. Later in the webtoon, she is wounded and pretends to be heavily crippled, at which point Bam declares that he will \"be her legs\" and help her continue climb the Tower. In a later test, she decides to betray Bam and attempts to kill him. She convinces his friends that Bam died protecting her and profits from the pity of the group that wants to continue the task Bam had started: carrying her to the top of the tower, then after six years Bam finds out Rachel is part of FUG. She then goes with Khun Aguero Agnes and climbs the tower. She and two new teammates in their new team decide to betray the group. They kill one and injure another one from their team then run away. She soon meets Bam again, only to push him away yet again. She meets a woman named Yura Ha on the train and they quickly become friends. She promises to show Yura the stars in return for helping her. She decides to help a former FUG slayer named \u2018White\u2019 to use him for her own purposes.\n\n;Khun Aguero Agnes\n;{{Voiced by|[[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]}}\n:Khun Aguero Agnes ({{korean|hangul=\ucfe4 \uc544\uac8c\ub85c \uc544\uadf8\ub2c8\uc2a4|rr=Kun Agero Ageuneseu}}) is from one of the 10 Noble families that first climbed the tower, and the son of High Ranker Khun Eduan. He meets Bam in the first test of the second floor, and deems him interesting enough to accompany and aids him while they climb the tower. He and Rak quickly become Bam's closest friends. He is usually in the Lightbearer position, but he has been shown to be capable of basic close combat as well when the situation calls for it. Khun is named after the Argentinian soccer player [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero|Sergio \"Kun\" Ag\u00fcero]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n;Rak Wraithraiser\n;{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]}}\n:Rak Wraithraiser ({{korean|hangul=\ub77c\ud06c \ub808\ud06c\ub808\uc774\uc154|rr=Rahk Rekraisher}}) is a large, powerful, and very confident [[spear]] bearer. He unwillingly teamed up with Twenty-Fifth Bam and Khun Aguero Agnis early in the story, and he quickly became attached to them during the following tests. Due to his [[reptile]]-like features, he is sometimes referred to as \"Alligator\" or \"Gator\" and even \"Crocodile\". Rak refers to his friends and people he meets as \"turtles\" of different colours and features (ex: black turtle, blue turtle, crazy turtle); the term by which he also earnestly addresses his \"prey\". Rak is able to change his size so that he is smaller and convenient to walk around because he is a Compression Lisensor which gives him the ability to shrink his size at will so he can move around the Tower more easily. On the hidden floor in an encounter with the data of Khun Eduan(the head of the Khun family) Rak learns that he has the power to control rocks/stone and might be a part of/a descendant of a native species in the tower until the king of the tower hunted them all down and killed them.\n\n;Ja Wangnan\n:Ja Wangnan ({{korean|hangul=\uc790 \uc655\ub09c|rr=Ja Wangnan}}) is another primary protagonist introduced at the beginning of part II, which initially focuses on him before spreading attention to the other main cast again. On the 20th floor Wagnan is initially selfish and willing to resort to trickery to pass the test to the 21st Floor, as he has been stuck on the 20th floor failing the same floor advancement test repeatedly ever since arriving on the 20th floor which results in him falling into financial debt with loan sharks; but later in his last chance test he starts to display his inner caring side and is shown to be sympathetic and forgiving to people who similarly used trickery against others to survive. His goal is to become the King of the Tower. He is blond haired, has red protrusions on the back of his head, and has a red ring with the symbol of Zahard (also known as Jahad in other translations) inscribed on it, a ring that Karaka, a FUG slayer wears. He has not displayed any special abilities with shinsu or martial arts, but was able to survive a fatal pierce through his heart in the Workshop battle when Beta tried to stop him from summoning Baam later showing a full recovery, which garnered suspicion and interest from the few people who took notice of this. He is also referred to as Prince of the Red Light district. Wangnan wishes his horns would grow. \"Wangnan Jah\" read backwards in Korean means \"I am the prince.\"\n\n;Hwa Ryun\n:Hwa Ryun&nbsp;(\ud654\ub828,&nbsp;''Hwaryeon''; or \"''Hwaryun''\") is Viole's&nbsp;Guide&nbsp;and also the Guide for FUG's&nbsp;Rankers&nbsp;notably&nbsp;Ha Jinsung.&nbsp;She is a member of the Red Witch species known for being&nbsp;Guides&nbsp;and currently a member of&nbsp;FUG.&nbsp;Evan Edrok&nbsp;briefly encountered her during the&nbsp;Submerged Fish Test&nbsp;and was shocked by seeing her, although&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;and Evan don't actually know each other. She entered the tests on the&nbsp;Second Floor&nbsp;posed as a Regular (a job given to her by FUG) in order to better accomplish her objectives without rising any suspicion. In the crown game, she was teamed up with&nbsp;Yung Changsoo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Goon where she refused to ally with the other teams, instead wiping them all out until she was stopped by&nbsp;Androssi (Sometimes Endorsi). She then got past Androssi and attacked Rachel and as a result she was wounded in the face by&nbsp;Bam&nbsp;who somehow attacked with&nbsp;Shinsoo&nbsp;despite him not having made a contract with the manager. After the game she was assigned the&nbsp;Wave Controller Position.\n\n:Viole/Bam went to meet her on the&nbsp;21st Floor, at a karaoke box which was being extorted for money by a Viole impersonator.&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;provoked the Viole impersonator, having fun with the situation. Viole easily took care of them. After the Flower of Zygaena test,&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;easily manipulated Yihwa into helping Viole by saying that an elite would attempt to correct her family's wrongs. Wangnan later approached her for guidance, knowing that she was a Guide. He realised that she told him that Viole was an Irregular because he would be able to reconnect Viole to his friends.&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;made a remark that implied that his motives could be altruistic or selfish, calling him the \"Prince of the Red Light District\". She told him that if he wanted to reunite Viole with his friends, they must climb to the&nbsp;30th Floor&nbsp;and participate in the Workshop Battle.\n\n:Before the Workshop Battle,&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;traded places with&nbsp;Yuto&nbsp;to become part of FUG's team. When Viole was taken in the Thorn chamber, she guided his friends to summon him and save him from being molten. She helped her side of FUG, by using the other side of FUG's plans against them, so that Viole acquired the Thorn. Unfortunately,&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;was taken hostage by&nbsp;Reflejo&nbsp;and used in his fight with Viole. Using the&nbsp;White Heavenly Mirror&nbsp;Koon saved her. After the events of&nbsp;the Workshop Battle, she was seen sitting in a room. She had pre-emptively known that Baam would ask her for her help, which Koon noticed. After Koon agreed to the deal, she offered her help and told them of the&nbsp;Hell Express&nbsp;on the&nbsp;35th Floor.\n\n:SIU wrote that she was the most beautiful woman of the Season 1&nbsp;Regulars.&nbsp;He further stated that this was a foreshadowing,&nbsp;the importance of which has yet to be revealed. Her name means \"inferno wheel\" when translated from Korean to English. It could also mean \"lotus flower\".\n\n;White\n:White was the 10th of eleven slayers in FUG. He belongs in the Arie family, one of the \u201810 great families\u2019. His body has been lost, and only his name and souls remain. He is good at using swords, and has white hair, just like all the other members of the Arie family. His height varies depending on the size of his power. He often competes with Jue Viole Grace, the new slayer candidate of FUG. White has been interested in spells or dangerous magic since ancient times, especially those that needed human sacrifice. Because of that, people in the tower feared him. The cruelest spell he could use was used at a hidden place in the tower. He caused war between two countries, and cheated them so that they would pray for his help. Many people died for him, and he ate the souls of these people, which made him stronger. This spell supposedly killed more than one billion people. Finally, a \u2018princess of Jahad\u2019 suppressed him and he lost almost all of his power. After that, he went into the hell train to regain his lost power. He manipulated people in the train to kill each other. One of the people in the train, Roen, made sacrifices to stop White, and he has been sealed for 600 years.\n\n:Actually, White is the aggregate of five sons and daughters of the Arie family. They used a spell to combine their souls and became stronger. The central personality of the five was Hoaqin\u2019s. However, the spell needed them to keep eating the souls of others. As a result, White has eaten souls since they used the spell. In the hell train, people who wanted to revive White; FUG, the conductor of the hell train; Pedro, and party of Rachel\u2019s, clashed with Jue Viole Grace, and had a life-and-death confrontation. When this match was over, the conductor's plan, to kill the party of Jue Viole Grace, was thwarted by Ha-Yuri Jahad. She suppressed the conductor and the hell train. This made the match unclear. and White was able to escape from the hell train. The five clones of White are;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95|title=Tower of God|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref>\n\n# Arie Vicente\n# Arie Anna\n# Arie David\n# Arie Albelda\n# Arie Hoaqin\n\n:The last clone of White is made from the souls killed by White and Arie Albelda.\n\n;Urek Mazino\n:He is an irregular, currently the fourth in rank. He is the strongest active Ranker and also the fastest one to climb the tower via \u2018normal methods\u2019. As the strongest currently active Ranker, as an irregular, and as one of the founders of the Wolhaiksong, Urek Mazino is one of the most influential people inside the tower. His nickname is Ray Barracuda. Ray refers to his combat style, in which he fires Shinsu at the speed of light. Barracuda is the name of the most aggressive fish in the tower.\n\n:Urek is a tall, and handsome man. He has white hair, and fiery red eyes.On his back, a tattoo of a tree with 7 pairs of wings (the symbol of Wolhaiksong). He is a ruthless person, and is respected by men. However, he is disliked by every woman he meets. Ha-Yuri-Jahad said: \u201cHe is the best man to fight with, but the worse man to live with.\u201d The most famous quote of Urek is: \u201cWhat fun would it be to become the king of the tower? Tell Jahad to keep his boring seat. I will get out of the Tower. Outside the Tower, there exists a vast world, rolling skies stretch endlessly, and countless stars illuminate the darkness. A place that is a thousand times\u2014no, a billion times wider and freer than the tower. Once you imagine that such a world exists, don\u2019t you think all those things you want are all so trivial?\u201d\n\n:Although his main position is fisherman, he excels in every other position better than almost all of the rankers. He beats everyone in agility, strength, Shinsu control, etc. After entering the tower, he passed all of the tests faster than any other ranker.\n\n;Enryu\n:He is mentioned in the 84th episode of the second season. He is shortly mentioned in the 240th episode of the second season when Garam Jahad was thinking of the past. He has red hair and is very handsome. He is an irregular and currently the second in rank.\n\n:Jahad built a temple for his followers to worship him on the 43rd floor of the tower. One day, Enryu appeared, turning the Shinsu red, and said,\u201d \u201cOnly those who believe in the false king will remain here and face death.\u201d Many people fled, but some remained and even fought Enryu. Enryu eliminated every remaining people on the floor. The administrator and ruler of the 43rd floor was furious and fought with him, but even he could not fight with Enryu; he was killed. Enryu is the only one in the tower who was able to kill an administrator.\n\n;Endorsi Jahad\n;{{Voiced by|[[Rie Suegara]]}}\n:When Endorsi was little, she had no family and wandered around. One day, an elderly couple took her in and took care of her, until a snake came up to Endorsi, telling her she had the potential to be a princess. The snake transformed into a jewel, which she took home. Later that night, the snake killed her adoptive parents, fearing they would get in the way of her becoming a princess. The snake stayed with Endorsi until she became of princess, and it would come back as Endorsi's \"sworn enemy\" in the Hidden Floor. She was later adopted by a great family, who adopted girls with exceptional talent in hopes of one becoming a princess. Every day at dinner, the girls would sit in order of who did the best that day, with people at the front getting an extravagant meal and girls at the back getting only stale bread. When Endorsi first got there, she was the smallest and weakest, and ate cold bread for months.\n:One day, she had the luck to beat an older girl, so she got her first meal at the table. At the time, it was the best thing she had ever tasted. So Endorsi wondered how good the food must be at the front of the table. It is then heavily hinted that she killed all the other girls so she would get all the food at the table. Endorsi was then selected to become a princess of Jahad, and began climbing the tower as a regular. She became very popular and famous for being beautiful but savage and is also known as the girl you want to go out with the most. At the floor of the test, she met all the friends she would climb the tower with, including Bam, who she soon developed a crush on.\n\n;Aanak Jahad\n;{{Voiced by|[[Akira Sekine]]}}\n:Was a princess of Jahad who \"walked out of the display case\" and had a daughter. She is later killed by a royal assassination, but her daughter escaped. Her daughter would later take her name when she became a regular. Former owner of the Green April.\n\n;Ha Jinsung\n:Ha jinsung(jinsund ha) is the mentor of Bam. He trains Bam when he is trained by the fug to become Jue Viole Grace(which is Bam itself but a slayer candidate) he is one of the top rankers and a prominent member of fug. He has experienced very bad things which led him to join fug. Bam is his favourite student and he cares for him a lot. The ongoing episodes are revolving around Bam trying to save jinsung ha which shows that Bam cares deeply for his master.\n\n==Other media==\nIn 2013, Naver released a [[mobile game|mobile]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] on [[Google Play]] based on ''Tower of God'', developed by Sunrise.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Non-Regular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds.

The English fan translations had different transliterations of the names of the characters, such as Androssi Zahard (fan translation) being transliterated to Endorsi Jahad (Line Webtoon). The story and characters remain the same.\n\n==Plot==\n''Tower of God'' centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n==Setting==\n===The Tower===\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the webtoon, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n===Shinsu===\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n===Positions===\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman(Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer(Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer(Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout(Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller(Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Characters==\n;Twenty-Fifth Bam/Jue Viole Grace\n;{{Voiced by|Taichi Ichikawa}}\n:Twenty-Fifth Bam ({{korean|hangul=\uc2a4\ubb3c\ub2e4\uc12f\ubc88\uc9f8 \ubc24|rr=Seumul-daseot-banjjae Bam}}; literal translation: Twenty-fifth Night) is the protagonist of ''Tower of God''. Bam is the latest Irregular to enter the Tower, but because of his young age and naivet\u00e9, his abilities don't resemble those that previous Irregulars are known for. In the story, Bam enters The Tower in search of his best friend Rachel, the only person who visited him and cared for him in the years of isolation that he spent in a cave underneath the Tower. After entering the Tower, he is told that all the answers that he seeks will be answered if he climbs the tower, though he is immediately presented with a seemingly impossible and deadly test. Bam succeeds, and is allowed to move onto the second floor, where all would-be Regulars start their ascension. Throughout the webtoon, Bam makes several friends among the candidates, and together they pass the many tests of the floor.\n\n:Bam returns in ''Tower of God: Part 2 - The Return of the Prince'', which takes place six years after the original story, using the alias Jue Viole Grace ({{korean|hangul=\uc96c \ube44\uc62c\ub808 \uadf8\ub808\uc774\uc2a4|rr=Ju Violet Grace}}). In this story, Bam is under the control of the infamous anti-Jahad group FUG, forced to cooperate to keep his old teammates safe. But then, not long after, his old teammates, including Khun, found out that he was alive, and was Ju Viole Grace. They set out a plan to free Bam from FUG, which takes place in the Workshop Battle, and it was successful. After that, Bam and his teammates goes through a series of adventures on the Hell Express.\n\n:Bam returns again in Tower of God:Part 3, taking place a few years after the Battle of the Last Stop. Ha Jin Sung, Bam's teacher in FUG, was caught by Kallavan, who is in control of a unit in Jahad's army. To rescue Ha Jin Sung, Bam needs help from the King of the Dogs, Baylord  Yama, a FUG slayer, and him and his teammates set out on another adventure in the Cage, where the Dogs live.\n\n;Rachel\n;{{Voiced by|[[Saori Hayami]]}}\n:Rachel ({{korean|hangul=\ub77c\ud5ec|rr=Rahel}}) was Bam's best friend until she entered the Tower and became a regular (but that was only what Bam thought which is proved in the later half of the webtoon). She desires to see the stars in the night sky at the top of the Tower and is determined to reach it by all means. This wish comes from her [[fear of the dark]]ness of the night. Later in the webtoon, she is wounded and pretends to be heavily crippled, at which point Bam declares that he will \"be her legs\" and help her continue climb the Tower. In a later test, she decides to betray Bam and attempts to kill him. She convinces his friends that Bam died protecting her and profits from the pity of the group that wants to continue the task Bam had started: carrying her to the top of the tower, then after six years Bam finds out Rachel is part of FUG. She then goes with Khun Aguero Agnes and climbs the tower. She and two new teammates in their new team decide to betray the group. They kill one and injure another one from their team then run away. She soon meets Bam again, only to push him away yet again. She meets a woman named Yura Ha on the train and they quickly become friends. She promises to show Yura the stars in return for helping her. She decides to help a former FUG slayer named \u2018White\u2019 to use him for her own purposes.\n\n;Khun Aguero Agnes\n;{{Voiced by|[[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]}}\n:Khun Aguero Agnes ({{korean|hangul=\ucfe4 \uc544\uac8c\ub85c \uc544\uadf8\ub2c8\uc2a4|rr=Kun Agero Ageuneseu}}) is from one of the 10 Noble families that first climbed the tower, and the son of High Ranker Khun Eduan. He meets Bam in the first test of the second floor, and deems him interesting enough to accompany and aids him while they climb the tower. He and Rak quickly become Bam's closest friends. He is usually in the Lightbearer position, but he has been shown to be capable of basic close combat as well when the situation calls for it. Khun is named after the Argentinian soccer player [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero|Sergio \"Kun\" Ag\u00fcero]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n;Rak Wraithraiser\n;{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]}}\n:Rak Wraithraiser ({{korean|hangul=\ub77c\ud06c \ub808\ud06c\ub808\uc774\uc154|rr=Rahk Rekraisher}}) is a large, powerful, and very confident [[spear]] bearer. He unwillingly teamed up with Twenty-Fifth Bam and Khun Aguero Agnis early in the story, and he quickly became attached to them during the following tests. Due to his [[reptile]]-like features, he is sometimes referred to as \"Alligator\" or \"Gator\" and even \"Crocodile\". Rak refers to his friends and people he meets as \"turtles\" of different colours and features (ex: black turtle, blue turtle, crazy turtle); the term by which he also earnestly addresses his \"prey\". Rak is able to change his size so that he is smaller and convenient to walk around because he is a Compression Lisensor which gives him the ability to shrink his size at will so he can move around the Tower more easily. On the hidden floor in an encounter with the data of Khun Eduan(the head of the Khun family) Rak learns that he has the power to control rocks/stone and might be a part of/a descendant of a native species in the tower until the king of the tower hunted them all down and killed them.\n\n;Ja Wangnan\n:Ja Wangnan ({{korean|hangul=\uc790 \uc655\ub09c|rr=Ja Wangnan}}) is another primary protagonist introduced at the beginning of part II, which initially focuses on him before spreading attention to the other main cast again. On the 20th floor Wagnan is initially selfish and willing to resort to trickery to pass the test to the 21st Floor, as he has been stuck on the 20th floor failing the same floor advancement test repeatedly ever since arriving on the 20th floor which results in him falling into financial debt with loan sharks; but later in his last chance test he starts to display his inner caring side and is shown to be sympathetic and forgiving to people who similarly used trickery against others to survive. His goal is to become the King of the Tower. He is blond haired, has red protrusions on the back of his head, and has a red ring with the symbol of Zahard (also known as Jahad in other translations) inscribed on it, a ring that Karaka, a FUG slayer wears. He has not displayed any special abilities with shinsu or martial arts, but was able to survive a fatal pierce through his heart in the Workshop battle when Beta tried to stop him from summoning Baam later showing a full recovery, which garnered suspicion and interest from the few people who took notice of this. He is also referred to as Prince of the Red Light district. Wangnan wishes his horns would grow. \"Wangnan Jah\" read backwards in Korean means \"I am the prince.\"\n\n;Hwa Ryun\n:Hwa Ryun&nbsp;(\ud654\ub828,&nbsp;''Hwaryeon''; or \"''Hwaryun''\") is Viole's&nbsp;Guide&nbsp;and also the Guide for FUG's&nbsp;Rankers&nbsp;notably&nbsp;Ha Jinsung.&nbsp;She is a member of the Red Witch species known for being&nbsp;Guides&nbsp;and currently a member of&nbsp;FUG.&nbsp;Evan Edrok&nbsp;briefly encountered her during the&nbsp;Submerged Fish Test&nbsp;and was shocked by seeing her, although&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;and Evan don't actually know each other. She entered the tests on the&nbsp;Second Floor&nbsp;posed as a Regular (a job given to her by FUG) in order to better accomplish her objectives without rising any suspicion. In the crown game, she was teamed up with&nbsp;Yung Changsoo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Goon where she refused to ally with the other teams, instead wiping them all out until she was stopped by&nbsp;Androssi (Sometimes Endorsi). She then got past Androssi and attacked Rachel and as a result she was wounded in the face by&nbsp;Bam&nbsp;who somehow attacked with&nbsp;Shinsoo&nbsp;despite him not having made a contract with the manager. After the game she was assigned the&nbsp;Wave Controller Position.\n\n:Viole/Bam went to meet her on the&nbsp;21st Floor, at a karaoke box which was being extorted for money by a Viole impersonator.&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;provoked the Viole impersonator, having fun with the situation. Viole easily took care of them. After the Flower of Zygaena test,&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;easily manipulated Yihwa into helping Viole by saying that an elite would attempt to correct her family's wrongs. Wangnan later approached her for guidance, knowing that she was a Guide. He realised that she told him that Viole was an Irregular because he would be able to reconnect Viole to his friends.&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;made a remark that implied that his motives could be altruistic or selfish, calling him the \"Prince of the Red Light District\". She told him that if he wanted to reunite Viole with his friends, they must climb to the&nbsp;30th Floor&nbsp;and participate in the Workshop Battle.\n\n:Before the Workshop Battle,&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;traded places with&nbsp;Yuto&nbsp;to become part of FUG's team. When Viole was taken in the Thorn chamber, she guided his friends to summon him and save him from being molten. She helped her side of FUG, by using the other side of FUG's plans against them, so that Viole acquired the Thorn. Unfortunately,&nbsp;Hwa Ryun&nbsp;was taken hostage by&nbsp;Reflejo&nbsp;and used in his fight with Viole. Using the&nbsp;White Heavenly Mirror&nbsp;Koon saved her. After the events of&nbsp;the Workshop Battle, she was seen sitting in a room. She had pre-emptively known that Baam would ask her for her help, which Koon noticed. After Koon agreed to the deal, she offered her help and told them of the&nbsp;Hell Express&nbsp;on the&nbsp;35th Floor.\n\n:SIU wrote that she was the most beautiful woman of the Season 1&nbsp;Regulars.&nbsp;He further stated that this was a foreshadowing,&nbsp;the importance of which has yet to be revealed. Her name means \"inferno wheel\" when translated from Korean to English. It could also mean \"lotus flower\".\n\n;White\n:White was the 10th of eleven slayers in FUG. He belongs in the Arie family, one of the \u201810 great families\u2019. His body has been lost, and only his name and souls remain. He is good at using swords, and has white hair, just like all the other members of the Arie family. His height varies depending on the size of his power. He often competes with Jue Viole Grace, the new slayer candidate of FUG. White has been interested in spells or dangerous magic since ancient times, especially those that needed human sacrifice. Because of that, people in the tower feared him. The cruelest spell he could use was used at a hidden place in the tower. He caused war between two countries, and cheated them so that they would pray for his help. Many people died for him, and he ate the souls of these people, which made him stronger. This spell supposedly killed more than one billion people. Finally, a \u2018princess of Jahad\u2019 suppressed him and he lost almost all of his power. After that, he went into the hell train to regain his lost power. He manipulated people in the train to kill each other. One of the people in the train, Roen, made sacrifices to stop White, and he has been sealed for 600 years.\n\n:Actually, White is the aggregate of five sons and daughters of the Arie family. They used a spell to combine their souls and became stronger. The central personality of the five was Hoaqin\u2019s. However, the spell needed them to keep eating the souls of others. As a result, White has eaten souls since they used the spell. In the hell train, people who wanted to revive White; FUG, the conductor of the hell train; Pedro, and party of Rachel\u2019s, clashed with Jue Viole Grace, and had a life-and-death confrontation. When this match was over, the conductor's plan, to kill the party of Jue Viole Grace, was thwarted by Ha-Yuri Jahad. She suppressed the conductor and the hell train. This made the match unclear. and White was able to escape from the hell train. The five clones of White are;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95|title=Tower of God|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref>\n\n# Arie Vicente\n# Arie Anna\n# Arie David\n# Arie Albelda\n# Arie Hoaqin\n\n:The last clone of White is made from the souls killed by White and Arie Albelda.\n\n;Urek Mazino\n:He is an irregular, currently the fourth in rank. He is the strongest active Ranker and also the fastest one to climb the tower via \u2018normal methods\u2019. As the strongest currently active Ranker, as an irregular, and as one of the founders of the Wolhaiksong, Urek Mazino is one of the most influential people inside the tower. His nickname is Ray Barracuda. Ray refers to his combat style, in which he fires Shinsu at the speed of light. Barracuda is the name of the most aggressive fish in the tower.\n\n:Urek is a tall, and handsome man. He has white hair, and fiery red eyes.On his back, a tattoo of a tree with 7 pairs of wings (the symbol of Wolhaiksong). He is a ruthless person, and is respected by men. However, he is disliked by every woman he meets. Ha-Yuri-Jahad said: \u201cHe is the best man to fight with, but the worse man to live with.\u201d The most famous quote of Urek is: \u201cWhat fun would it be to become the king of the tower? Tell Jahad to keep his boring seat. I will get out of the Tower. Outside the Tower, there exists a vast world, rolling skies stretch endlessly, and countless stars illuminate the darkness. A place that is a thousand times\u2014no, a billion times wider and freer than the tower. Once you imagine that such a world exists, don\u2019t you think all those things you want are all so trivial?\u201d\n\n:Although his main position is fisherman, he excels in every other position better than almost all of the rankers. He beats everyone in agility, strength, Shinsu control, etc. After entering the tower, he passed all of the tests faster than any other ranker.\n\n;Enryu\n:He is mentioned in the 84th episode of the second season. He is shortly mentioned in the 240th episode of the second season when Garam Jahad was thinking of the past. He has red hair and is very handsome. He is an irregular and currently the second in rank.\n\n:Jahad built a temple for his followers to worship him on the 43rd floor of the tower. One day, Enryu appeared, turning the Shinsu red, and said,\u201d \u201cOnly those who believe in the false king will remain here and face death.\u201d Many people fled, but some remained and even fought Enryu. Enryu eliminated every remaining people on the floor. The administrator and ruler of the 43rd floor was furious and fought with him, but even he could not fight with Enryu; he was killed. Enryu is the only one in the tower who was able to kill an administrator.\n\n;Endorsi Jahad\n;{{Voiced by|[[Rie Suegara]]}}\n:When Endorsi was little, she had no family and wandered around. One day, an elderly couple took her in and took care of her, until a snake came up to Endorsi, telling her she had the potential to be a princess. The snake transformed into a jewel, which she took home. Later that night, the snake killed her adoptive parents, fearing they would get in the way of her becoming a princess. The snake stayed with Endorsi until she became of princess, and it would come back as Endorsi's \"sworn enemy\" in the Hidden Floor. She was later adopted by a great family, who adopted girls with exceptional talent in hopes of one becoming a princess. Every day at dinner, the girls would sit in order of who did the best that day, with people at the front getting an extravagant meal and girls at the back getting only stale bread. When Endorsi first got there, she was the smallest and weakest, and ate cold bread for months.\n:One day, she had the luck to beat an older girl, so she got her first meal at the table. At the time, it was the best thing she had ever tasted. So Endorsi wondered how good the food must be at the front of the table. It is then heavily hinted that she killed all the other girls so she would get all the food at the table. Endorsi was then selected to become a princess of Jahad, and began climbing the tower as a regular. She became very popular and famous for being beautiful but savage and is also known as the girl you want to go out with the most. At the floor of the test, she met all the friends she would climb the tower with, including Bam, who she soon developed a crush on.\n\n;Aanak Jahad\n;{{Voiced by|[[Akira Sekine]]}}\n:Was a princess of Jahad who \"walked out of the display case\" and had a daughter. She is later killed by a royal assassination, but her daughter escaped. Her daughter would later take her name when she became a regular. Former owner of the Green April.\n\n;Ha Jinsung\n:Ha jinsung(jinsund ha) is the mentor of Bam. He trains Bam when he is trained by the fug to become Jue Viole Grace(which is Bam itself but a slayer candidate) he is one of the top rankers and a prominent member of fug. He has experienced very bad things which led him to join fug. Bam is his favourite student and he cares for him a lot. The ongoing episodes are revolving around Bam trying to save jinsung ha which shows that Bam cares deeply for his master.\n\n==Other media==\nIn 2013, Naver released a [[mobile game|mobile]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] on [[Google Play]] based on ''Tower of God'', developed by Sunrise.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Non-Regular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n<!--{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = 2\n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = \n}}-->\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nHead of [[Line Webtoon]] Tom Akel stated in July 2015 that the webtoon's weekly installments are read by five million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/business/media/free-digital-comics-site-is-expanding-in-us-with-celebrity-help.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Stan Lee and Michelle Phan Help Line Webtoon, Digital Comics Site, Expand in U.S.|last=Gustines|first=George Gene|date=2015-07-05}}</ref> \n\nOn the original Korean platform, Tower of God is the most profitable series based on the paid preview system, where readers can buy up to 3 chapters in advance.

[[Rajmata]] Ahilyabai was born in the village of Chondi in [[Jamkhed]], [[Ahmednagar]], Maharashtra. She moved the capital to [[Maheshwar]] south of [[Indore]] on the [[Narmada River]].\n\nAhilyabai's husband Khanderao Holkar was killed in the battle of [[Kumher|Kumbher]] in 1754. Twelve years later, her father-in-law, [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], died. A year after that she was crowned as the queen of the Malwa kingdom. She tried to protect her kingdom from plundering invaders. She personally led armies into battle. She appointed Tukojirao Holkar as the Chief of Army.\n\nRani Ahilyabai was a great pioneer and builder of [[Hindu temples]]. She built hundreds of temples and Dharmashalas throughout India.\n\n==Early life==\nAhilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, in the present-day [[Ahmednagar district]] in Maharashtra. Her father, Mankoji Rao Shinde, was the [[Patil (title)|Patil]] of the village. Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nHer entrance on to the stage of history was something of an accident: [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], a commander in the service of the Maratha Peshwa [[Balaji Baji Rao]] and lord of the Malwa territory, stopped in Chaundi on his way to Pune and, according to legend, saw the eight-year-old Ahilyabai at the temple service in the village. Recognising her piety and her character, he brought the girl to the Holkar territory as a bride for his son, Khanderao (1723\u20131754). She was married to [[Khanderao Holkar]] in 1733. In 1745, she gave birth to their son Malerao and in 1748, a daughter Muktabai. Malerao was mentally unwell and died of his illness in 1767. Ahilyabai broke another tradition when she married her daughter to Yashwantrao a brave but poor man after he succeeded in defeating the dacoits.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Royal Palace of Maheshwar.jpg|thumb|The Royal Palace of Maheshwar]]\n[[File:Rajwada of Ahilya Bai.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the royal palace (Rajwada), Maheshwar]]\n[[File:Statue of Ahilya Bai Holkar.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ahilya Bai Holkar in the royal palace, Maheshwar]]\n\nHer husband was killed during the siege of [[Kumher]] in 1754.<ref name=kr1>{{cite book|author=Jaswant Lal Mehta |title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707\u20131813 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d1wUgKKzawoC&pg=PA606 |date=1 January 2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

You may halt there for four or five days. You should keep your big artillery and arrange for its ammunition as much as possible....On the march you should arrange for military posts being located for protection of the road.\"''\n\nAlready trained to be a ruler, Ahilyabai petitioned the Peshwa after Malhar's death, and the death of her son, to take over the administration herself. Some in Malwa objected to her assumption of rule, but the army of Holkar supported her leadership. She led them in person, with four bows and quivers of arrows fitted to the corners of the howdah of her favourite elephant. The Peshwa granted her permission on 11 December 1767, and, with Subhedar [[Tukojirao Holkar]] (Malharrao's adopted son) as the head of military matters, she proceeded to rule Malwa in a most enlightened manner, even reinstating a Brahmin who had opposed her. Ahilyabai daily public audience and was always accessible to anyone who needed her ear.\n\nAmong Ahilyabai's accomplishments was the development of Indore from a small village to a prosperous and beautiful city; her own capital, however, was in nearby Maheshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada river. She also built forts and roads in Malwa, sponsored festivals and gave donations for regular worship in many Hindu temples. Outside Malwa, she built dozens of temples, ghats, wells, tanks and rest-houses across an area stretching from the Himalayas to pilgrimage centres in South India. The Bharatiya Sanskritikosh lists as sites she embellished, Kashi, Gaya, Somnath, Ayodhya, Mathura, Hardwar, Kanchi, Avanti, Dwarka, Badrinarayan, Rameshwar and Jaganathpuri. Ahilyadevi also supported the rise of merchants, farmers and cultivators to levels of affluence, and did not consider that she had any legitimate claim to their wealth, be it through taxes or feudal right.\n\nThere are many stories of her care for her people. In one instance, when her minister refused to allow the adoption unless he was suitably bribed, she is said to have sponsored the child herself, and given him clothes and jewels as part of the ritual. To honour the memory of Ahilyadevi Holkar, in 1996 leading citizens of Indore instituted an award in her name to be bestowed annually on an outstanding public figure. The Prime Minister of India gave away the first award to Nanaji Deshmukh.\n\nAhilyadevi was not able to settle the conflict peacefully in the case of the [[Bhil people|Bhils]] and [[Gondi people|Gonds]], who plundered her borders; but she granted them waste hilly lands and the right to a small duty on goods passing through their territories. Even in this case, according to Malcolm, she did give \"considerate attention to their habits\".\n\nAhilyabai's capital at Maheshwar was the scene of literary, musical, artistic and industrial enterprise. She entertained the famous Marathi poet, [[Moropant]] and the shahir, Anantaphandi from Maharashtra, and also patronised the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram. Craftsmen, sculptors and artists received salaries and honours at her capital, and she even established a textile industry in the city of Maheshwar.\n\nAfter her death, she was succeeded by [[Tukojirao Holkar|Tukoji Rao Holkar I]], her commander-in-chief, who soon abdicated the throne in favour of his son [[Kashi Rao Holkar]] in 1797.\n\n==Death==\n\nAhilyabai died on 13th August, 1795 at the age of 70. A woman of modern times Ahilyabai's rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore\u2019s history. Ironically, her daughter became a Sati by jumping into the funeral pyre when her husband, Yashwantrao Phanse, died. Ahilyabai was succeeded by her commander-in-chief, Tukoji Rao Holkar I.\n\n==Views about her==\n{{quote farm|date=May 2019}}\n[[File: Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar]]\n\"The reign of Ahilyabai, of Indore in central India, lasted for thirty years.

Twelve years later, her father-in-law, [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], died. A year after that she was crowned as the queen of the Malwa kingdom. She tried to protect her kingdom from plundering invaders. She personally led armies into battle. She appointed Tukojirao Holkar as the Chief of Army.\n\nRani Ahilyabai was a great pioneer and builder of [[Hindu temples]]. She built hundreds of temples and Dharmashalas throughout India.\n\n==Early life==\nAhilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, in the present-day [[Ahmednagar district]] in Maharashtra. Her father, Mankoji Rao Shinde, was the [[Patil (title)|Patil]] of the village. Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nHer entrance on to the stage of history was something of an accident: [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], a commander in the service of the Maratha Peshwa [[Balaji Baji Rao]] and lord of the Malwa territory, stopped in Chaundi on his way to Pune and, according to legend, saw the eight-year-old Ahilyabai at the temple service in the village. Recognising her piety and her character, he brought the girl to the Holkar territory as a bride for his son, Khanderao (1723\u20131754). She was married to [[Khanderao Holkar]] in 1733. In 1745, she gave birth to their son Malerao and in 1748, a daughter Muktabai. Malerao was mentally unwell and died of his illness in 1767.

You may halt there for four or five days. You should keep your big artillery and arrange for its ammunition as much as possible....On the march you should arrange for military posts being located for protection of the road.\"''\n\nAlready trained to be a ruler, Ahilyabai petitioned the Peshwa after Malhar's death, and the death of her son, to take over the administration herself. Some in Malwa objected to her assumption of rule, but the army of Holkar supported her leadership. She led them in person, with four bows and quivers of arrows fitted to the corners of the howdah of her favourite elephant. The Peshwa granted her permission on 11 December 1767, and, with Subhedar [[Tukojirao Holkar]] (Malharrao's adopted son) as the head of military matters, she proceeded to rule Malwa in a most enlightened manner, even reinstating a Brahmin who had opposed her. Ahilyabai daily public audience and was always accessible to anyone who needed her ear.\n\nAmong Ahilyabai's accomplishments was the development of Indore from a small village to a prosperous and beautiful city; her own capital, however, was in nearby Maheshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada river. She also built forts and roads in Malwa, sponsored festivals and gave donations for regular worship in many Hindu temples. Outside Malwa, she built dozens of temples, ghats, wells, tanks and rest-houses across an area stretching from the Himalayas to pilgrimage centres in South India. The Bharatiya Sanskritikosh lists as sites she embellished, Kashi, Gaya, Somnath, Ayodhya, Mathura, Hardwar, Kanchi, Avanti, Dwarka, Badrinarayan, Rameshwar and Jaganathpuri. Ahilyadevi also supported the rise of merchants, farmers and cultivators to levels of affluence, and did not consider that she had any legitimate claim to their wealth, be it through taxes or feudal right.\n\nThere are many stories of her care for her people. In one instance, when her minister refused to allow the adoption unless he was suitably bribed, she is said to have sponsored the child herself, and given him clothes and jewels as part of the ritual. To honour the memory of Ahilyadevi Holkar, in 1996 leading citizens of Indore instituted an award in her name to be bestowed annually on an outstanding public figure. The Prime Minister of India gave away the first award to Nanaji Deshmukh.\n\nAhilyadevi was not able to settle the conflict peacefully in the case of the [[Bhil people|Bhils]] and [[Gondi people|Gonds]], who plundered her borders; but she granted them waste hilly lands and the right to a small duty on goods passing through their territories. Even in this case, according to Malcolm, she did give \"considerate attention to their habits\".\n\nAhilyabai's capital at Maheshwar was the scene of literary, musical, artistic and industrial enterprise. She entertained the famous Marathi poet, [[Moropant]] and the shahir, Anantaphandi from Maharashtra, and also patronised the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram. Craftsmen, sculptors and artists received salaries and honours at her capital, and she even established a textile industry in the city of Maheshwar.\n\nAfter her death, she was succeeded by [[Tukojirao Holkar|Tukoji Rao Holkar I]], her commander-in-chief, who soon abdicated the throne in favour of his son [[Kashi Rao Holkar]] in 1797.\n\n==Death==\n\nAhilyabai died on 13th August, 1795 at the age of 70. A woman of modern times Ahilyabai's rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore\u2019s history. Ironically, her daughter became a Sati by jumping into the funeral pyre when her husband, Yashwantrao Phanse, died. Ahilyabai was succeeded by her commander-in-chief, Tukoji Rao Holkar I.\n\n==Views about her==\n{{quote farm|date=May 2019}}\n[[File: Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar]]\n\"The reign of Ahilyabai, of Indore in central India, lasted for thirty years. This has become almost legendary as a period during which perfect order and good government prevailed and the people prospered. She was a very able ruler and organizer, highly respected during her lifetime, and considered as a saint by a grateful people after her death.\"<ref>Jawaharlal Nehru (1946) ''[[The Discovery of India]]''.

Far and wide the roads were planted with shady trees, and wells were made, and rest-houses for travelers. The poor, the homeless, the orphaned were all helped according to their needs. The Bhils who had long been the torment of all caravans were routed from their mountain fastnesses and persuaded to settle down as honest farmers. Hindu and Musalman alike revered the famous Queen and prayed for her long life. Her last great sorrow was when her daughter became a Sati upon the death of Yashwantrao Phanse.

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThere were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor). Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966. Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''. After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''. Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began early 1967.\n\nThe situation with the writers is more complex.

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThere were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor). Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966. Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''. After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''. Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began early 1967.\n\nThe situation with the writers is more complex. Bentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').
