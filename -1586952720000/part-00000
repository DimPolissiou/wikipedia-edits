It begins with the [[Agony in the Garden]] in the [[Garden of Olives]] (or Gethsemane), the betrayal of [[Judas Iscariot]], the brutal [[Scourging at the Pillar]], the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] as prophesied by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke) |Simeon]], the crucifixion and death of Christ, and ends with a brief depiction of His [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. However, the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ's life, some of which are biblically based, such as [[The Last Supper]] and [[The Sermon on the Mount]], and others that are artistic license, such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table. \n\nIt was, for the most part, shot in Italy.<ref>[https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/Passion-Of-The-Christ.php. \"The Passion of the Christ\".] ''Movie-Locations''</ref> The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew, Latin, and reconstructed [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Aramaic]].

While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in an androgynous form, and tempts him, stating that no one can bear the burden that God asks of him: to suffer and die for humanity's sins. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nJudas Iscariot, another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of 30 pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.\n\nJohn informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene, but a temple guard assures them that she is insane. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus answers \"I am\". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by ghosts and demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death. At the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas (as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth). After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely flogged. Jesus is then scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying \u201cHail, king of the Jews\u201d. A bleeding Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' encouragement, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' suffering with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Saint Veronica a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. \n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God the Father God asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a penitent thief crucified beside him. Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering an earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the Holy of Holies in two. Satan screams in defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Jesus [[Resurrection of Jesus|rises from the dead]] and exits the tomb resurrected, with wound holes visible on his palms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n*[[Maia Morgenstern]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Christo Jivkov]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n*[[Francesco De Vito]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n*[[Mattia Sbragia]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n*[[Toni Bertorelli]] as [[Annas|Annas ben Seth]]\n*[[Luca Lionello]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n*[[Hristo Shopov|Hristo Naumov Shopov]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n*[[Claudia Gerini]] as [[Saint Procula|Claudia Procles]]\n*Fabio Sartor as Abenader\n*Giacinto Ferro as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n*Aleksander Mincer as [[Nicodemus]]\n*Sheila Mokhtari as Woman in audience\n*[[Sergio Rubini]] as [[Saint Dismas|Dismas]]\n*Roberto Bestazoni as [[Malchus]]\n*[[Francesco Cabras]] as [[Gestas|Gesmas]]\n*Giovanni Capalbo as [[Longinus|Cassius]]\n*[[Rosalinda Celentano]] as [[Satan]]\n*[[Emilio De Marchi (actor)|Emilio De Marchi]] as Scornful Roman\n*Lello Giulivo as Brutish Roman\n*Abel Jafry as 2nd Temple officer\n*Jarreth Merz as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n*Matt Patresi as [[Janus]]\n*Roberto Visconti as Scornful Roman\n*[[Luca De Dominicis]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod \u00c1ntipas]]\n*Chokri Ben Zagden as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]\n*[[Sabrina Impacciatore]] as [[St. Veronica]]\n*Pietro Sarubbi as [[Barabbas]]\n*[[Ted Rusoff]] as Chief Elder\n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''The Passion: Photography from the Movie \"The Passion of the Christ\"'', director Mel Gibson says, \"This is a movie about Love, Hope, Faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\" The important message of ''The Passion'' is that God Loves each of us so much that He gave us His Son to suffer and die for our sins, so that we may be with Him for eternity in Heaven.\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film cannot be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004| url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film. Mary asks \"Why is this night different from other nights?\", and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: \"Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Rachel | title = Along came Mary; Mel Gibson was sold on Maia Morgenstern for 'Passion' at first sight | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 7, 2004 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/07/entertainment/ca-encounter7}}</ref>\n\nThe conflation of Mary Magdalene with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulteress saved from stoning]] by Jesus has some precedent in tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic  reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, [[Dismas]] and Gesmas (also [[Gestas]]).\n\n===Catholic devotional writings===\nScreenwriters Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]] said that they read many accounts of Christ's Passion for inspiration, including the devotional writings of Roman Catholic mystics. A principal source is ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ''<ref name=dolorous>{{cite book | url=http://www.jesus-passion.com/DOLOROUS_PASSION_OF_OUR_LORD_JESUS_CHRIST.htm | title=The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ | author=Clement Brentano}}</ref> the visions of [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] (1774\u20131824), as written by the poet [[Clemens Brentano]].<ref name=Corl /><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref name=Dimare /> A careful reading of Emmerich's book shows the film's high level of dependence on it.<ref name=\"Corl\"/><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref>''Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Philip C.

This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.\n\nGibson's film was released on [[Ash Wednesday]], February 25, 2004. Icon Entertainment distributed the theatrical version of the film, and [[20th Century Fox]] distributed the VHS/DVD/Blu-ray version of the film.\n\nGibson consulted several theological advisers during filming, including [[Jonathan Morris (priest)|Fr.

In the first, Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem (at the eighth station of the cross) and falls to the ground as the women wail around him, and [[Simon of Cyrene]] attempts to hold up the cross and help up Jesus simultaneously. Afterwards, while both are holding up the cross, Jesus says to the women weeping for him, \"Do not weep for me, but for yourselves and for your children\". In the second, Pilate washes his hands, turns to Caiaphas, and says: \"Look you to it\" (i.e., the Pharisees wish to have Jesus crucified). Pilate then turns to Abanader and says: \"Do as they wish\". The scene next shows Pilate calling to his servant, who is carrying a wooden board on which Pilate writes, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews\", in Latin and Hebrew. He then holds the board above his head in full view of Caiaphas, who after reading it challenges Pilate on its content. Pilate replies angrily to Caiaphas in non-subtitled Hebrew. The disc contains only two deleted scenes in total. No other scenes from the movie are shown on disc 2.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stella Papamichael |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/03/19/the_passion_of_the_christ_special_edition_dvd_2007_review.shtml |title=''The Passion of the Christ: Special Edition DVD''|publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn February 7, 2017, 20th Century Fox re-released the film on Blu-ray and DVD featuring both cuts, with the theatrical version being dubbed in English and Spanish;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/20th_Century_Fox/Disc_Announcements/mel-gibsons-the-passion-of-the-christ-returns-to-bluray/37982 | title=Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' Returns to Blu-ray | publisher=High-Def Digest}}</ref> this marks the first time the film has ever been dubbed in another language.\n\n===Television broadcast===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\nOn April 17, 2011 ([[Palm Sunday]]), [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] (TBN) presented the film at 7:30&nbsp;pm ET/PT, with multiple showings scheduled.

John Paul II has a long personal and [[Pope John Paul II and Judaism|professional history]] of opposing anti-Semitism, of working against it, and of [[Pope John Paul II#Relations with other denominations and religions|calling for dialogue]], respect and reconciliation between all religions. His comments here would have great importance.}}\n\n===Allegations of antisemitism===\nBefore the film was released, there were prominent criticisms of perceived [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] content in the film. 20th Century Fox told New York Assemblyman [[Dov Hikind]] it had passed on distributing the film in response to a protest outside the [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] building. Hikind warned other companies that \"they should not distribute this film.

They released a statement, calling it <blockquote>one of the most troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in 25 years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest [[Caiaphas]], who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archivedate=August 20, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\n<blockquote>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

It begins with the [[Agony in the Garden]] in the [[Garden of Olives]] (or Gethsemane), the betrayal of [[Judas Iscariot]], the brutal [[Scourging at the Pillar]], the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] as prophesied by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke) |Simeon]], the crucifixion and death of Christ, and ends with a brief depiction of His [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. However, the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ's life, some of which are biblically based, such as [[The Last Supper]] and [[The Sermon on the Mount]], and others that are artistic license, such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table. \n\nIt was, for the most part, shot in Italy.<ref>[https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/Passion-Of-The-Christ.php. \"The Passion of the Christ\".] ''Movie-Locations''</ref> The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew, Latin, and reconstructed [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Aramaic]]. Although Gibson was initially against it, the film is subtitled.\n\nThe film has been controversial and received largely polarized reviews, with some critics calling the film a religious classic while others found the extreme violence distracting and excessive, and claimed that the film promoted [[antisemitism]].<ref name=EW /><ref name=tomatoes >{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/passion_of_the_christ/|title=''The Passion of the Christ'' (2004)|accessdate=July 16, 2008|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref><ref name=metacritic>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/passionofthechrist|title= ''The Passion of the Christ'' (2004): reviews|accessdate=July 16, 2008|website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> The film grossed over $622 million worldwide<ref name=\"POTC TN\"/> and became the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|seventh-highest-grossing film]] domestically at the end of its theatrical run.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It is currently the highest-grossing [[Christian film industry|Christian film]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=christian.htm|title=Christian Movies at the Box Office|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref> It received three nominations at the [[77th Academy Awards]] in 2005, for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Gibson|first=Mel|title=The Passion of the Christ|date=February 25, 2004|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335345/awards?ref_=tt_awd|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late hours of the night at the forested garden of Gethsemane, at the height of his cause, Jesus prays while his disciples Saint Peter, James, son of Zebedee James, and John the Evangelist sleep. While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in an androgynous form, and tempts him, stating that no one can bear the burden that God asks of him: to suffer and die for humanity's sins. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nJudas Iscariot, another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of 30 pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.\n\nJohn informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene, but a temple guard assures them that she is insane. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus answers \"I am\". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by ghosts and demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death. At the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas (as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth). After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely flogged. Jesus is then scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying \u201cHail, king of the Jews\u201d. A bleeding Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' encouragement, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' suffering with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Saint Veronica a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. \n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God the Father God asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a penitent thief crucified beside him. Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering an earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the Holy of Holies in two. Satan screams in defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Jesus [[Resurrection of Jesus|rises from the dead]] and exits the tomb resurrected, with wound holes visible on his palms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n*[[Maia Morgenstern]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Christo Jivkov]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n*[[Francesco De Vito]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n*[[Mattia Sbragia]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n*[[Toni Bertorelli]] as [[Annas|Annas ben Seth]]\n*[[Luca Lionello]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n*[[Hristo Shopov|Hristo Naumov Shopov]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n*[[Claudia Gerini]] as [[Saint Procula|Claudia Procles]]\n*Fabio Sartor as Abenader\n*Giacinto Ferro as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n*Aleksander Mincer as [[Nicodemus]]\n*Sheila Mokhtari as Woman in audience\n*[[Sergio Rubini]] as [[Saint Dismas|Dismas]]\n*Roberto Bestazoni as [[Malchus]]\n*[[Francesco Cabras]] as [[Gestas|Gesmas]]\n*Giovanni Capalbo as [[Longinus|Cassius]]\n*[[Rosalinda Celentano]] as [[Satan]]\n*[[Emilio De Marchi (actor)|Emilio De Marchi]] as Scornful Roman\n*Lello Giulivo as Brutish Roman\n*Abel Jafry as 2nd Temple officer\n*Jarreth Merz as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n*Matt Patresi as [[Janus]]\n*Roberto Visconti as Scornful Roman\n*[[Luca De Dominicis]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod \u00c1ntipas]]\n*Chokri Ben Zagden as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]\n*[[Sabrina Impacciatore]] as [[St. Veronica]]\n*Pietro Sarubbi as [[Barabbas]]\n*[[Ted Rusoff]] as Chief Elder\n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''The Passion: Photography from the Movie \"The Passion of the Christ\"'', director Mel Gibson says, \"This is a movie about Love, Hope, Faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\" The important message of ''The Passion'' is that God Loves each of us so much that He gave us His Son to suffer and die for our sins, so that we may be with Him for eternity in Heaven.\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film cannot be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004| url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film. Mary asks \"Why is this night different from other nights?\", and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: \"Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Rachel | title = Along came Mary; Mel Gibson was sold on Maia Morgenstern for 'Passion' at first sight | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 7, 2004 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/07/entertainment/ca-encounter7}}</ref>\n\nThe conflation of Mary Magdalene with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulteress saved from stoning]] by Jesus has some precedent in tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic  reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, [[Dismas]] and Gesmas (also [[Gestas]]).\n\n===Catholic devotional writings===\nScreenwriters Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]] said that they read many accounts of Christ's Passion for inspiration, including the devotional writings of Roman Catholic mystics. A principal source is ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ''<ref name=dolorous>{{cite book | url=http://www.jesus-passion.com/DOLOROUS_PASSION_OF_OUR_LORD_JESUS_CHRIST.htm | title=The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ | author=Clement Brentano}}</ref> the visions of [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] (1774\u20131824), as written by the poet [[Clemens Brentano]].<ref name=Corl /><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref name=Dimare /> A careful reading of Emmerich's book shows the film's high level of dependence on it.<ref name=\"Corl\"/><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref>''Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Philip C. DiMare 2011 {{ISBN|1-59884-296-X}} page 909</ref>\n\nHowever, Brentano's attribution of the book ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ'' to Emmerich has been subject to dispute, with allegations that Brentano wrote much of the book himself; a Vatican investigation concluding that: \"It is absolutely not certain that she ever wrote this\".<ref name=Anvil >Emmerich, Anne Catherine, and Clemens Brentano.

Because the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\"<ref name=\"Zenit interview 2003\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english| title=Mel Gibson's great passion: Christ's agony as you've never seen it|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=March 6, 2003|accessdate=October 17, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815141913/http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english|archivedate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> The script was written in English by Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]], then [[translation|translated]] by [[William Fulco]], S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic.

This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.\n\nGibson's film was released on [[Ash Wednesday]], February 25, 2004. Icon Entertainment distributed the theatrical version of the film, and [[20th Century Fox]] distributed the VHS/DVD/Blu-ray version of the film.\n\nGibson consulted several theological advisers during filming, including [[Jonathan Morris (priest)|Fr.

This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archivedate=August 20, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\n<blockquote>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

On 9 May 2003 (the day after ''Major Fraud'' aired in the US as a special episode of ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime]]''), the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled ''The Final Answer'', which was credited with over 5 million viewers.\n\n=== Trial ===\nFollowing [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|a trial]] at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]] lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), Ingram, his wife and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of \"[[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]\" on 7 April 2003.

Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram \u00a340,000 and Diana Ingram \u00a325,000.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken. During the trial, Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing throughout the episode, claiming he was too busy to notice.<ref name=\"scotsman\">{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-news/quizmaster-amazed-to-hear-163-1m-winner-could-have-cheated-1-598995 |title=Quizmaster 'amazed' to hear \u00a31m winner could have cheated |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=Karen |last=Mcveigh}}</ref>\n\n====Testimony of Larry Whitehurst====\nLarry Whitehurst, another contestant who had appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions.

[[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\nA book covering the case, ''Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major'', by [[Bob Woffinden]] and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.

The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\".

It was originally skipped by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] upon the original American broadcast of the series until 2000. On June 24, 2000, an English-language version of the episode aired on [[Kids' WB]] as \"Beauty and the Beach\". Promoted as a \"lost episode\" special presentation, it has only received one rerun and has not yet been shown elsewhere, nor was it included in the English Indigo League DVD boxset or the English Indigo League Champions Edition Blu-ray boxset released in November 2017.\n\nIn this episode, the female characters all enter a beauty contest. [[Team Rocket]] also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One scene of the episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: \"Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a chest like this!\" In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There were a number of other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her. In addition, all Japanese text on signs, etc. remains intact in this episode, as opposed to other first-season episodes in which it was digitally replaced with English text.\n\nA continuity problem created with this episode's removal is due to a flashback in \"Hypno's Naptime\" Also, this episode marks the first time chronologically that Misty and Brock meet Gary and Delia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dogasu |url=http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/kanto/ep027.html |title=Japanese Episode 027 |publisher=Dogasu.bulbagarden.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref>\n\n====\"The Legend of Miniryu\" (Episode 35)====\n{{nihongo|\"The Legend of Miniryu ([[Dratini]])\"|\u30df\u30cb\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u306e\u3067\u3093\u305b\u3064|Miniry\u016b no Densetsu}} was the second episode to be banned by 4Kids Entertainment.

It was originally skipped by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] upon the original American broadcast of the series until 2000. On June 24, 2000, an English-language version of the episode aired on [[Kids' WB]] as \"Beauty and the Beach\". Promoted as a \"lost episode\" special presentation, it has only received one rerun and has not yet been shown elsewhere, nor was it included in the English Indigo League DVD boxset or the English Indigo League Champions Edition Blu-ray boxset released in November 2017.\n\nIn this episode, the female characters all enter a beauty contest. [[Team Rocket]] also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One scene of the episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: \"Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a chest like this!\" In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There were a number of other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her. In addition, all Japanese text on signs, etc. remains intact in this episode, as opposed to other first-season episodes in which it was digitally replaced with English text.\n\nA continuity problem created with this episode's removal is due to a flashback in \"Hypno's Naptime\" Also, this episode marks the first time chronologically that Misty and Brock meet Gary and Delia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dogasu |url=http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/kanto/ep027.html |title=Japanese Episode 027 |publisher=Dogasu.bulbagarden.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref>\n\n====\"The Legend of Miniryu\" (Episode 35)====\n{{nihongo|\"The Legend of Miniryu ([[Dratini]])\"|\u30df\u30cb\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u306e\u3067\u3093\u305b\u3064|Miniry\u016b no Densetsu}} was the second episode to be banned by 4Kids Entertainment.

Frederick IX died in 1972, and was succeeded by his eldest daughter, Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=   http://kongehuset.dk/en/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-royal-lineage|title =  The Royal Lineage|website= kongehuset.dk  |access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Birth and family==\n[[File:Firekonger.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Four generations&nbsp;\u2014 four kings: [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]], [[Frederik VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick (VIII)]], [[Christian X of Denmark|Prince Christian (X)]] and Prince Frederick (IX) in 1903.]]\nPrince Frederick was born on 11 March 1899 at [[Sorgenfri Palace]] in [[Kongens Lyngby]] on [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] during the reign of his great-grandfather [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]]. His father was [[Christian X of Denmark|Prince Christian of Denmark]] (later King Christian X), the eldest son of [[Frederik VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick]] and [[Louise of Sweden|Princess Louise of Sweden]] (later King Frederick VIII and Queen Louise). His mother was [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], a daughter of [[Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia]].\n\nHe was baptised at Sorgenfri Palace on 9 April 1899. The young prince had 21 [[godparents]], among them his great-grandfather [[Christian IX of Denmark]], [[Nicholas II of Russia]], [[George I of Greece]], [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II of Sweden and Norway]], his grandfather [[Frederik VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark]], the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII of the United Kingdom)]] and his uncle [[Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sa.dk/composite-2686| title=Prinser og Prinsesser kommer ogs\u00e5 i kirkebogen| publisher=The Danish State Archives| accessdate=10 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFrederick's only sibling, [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Knud]], was born one year after Frederick. The family lived in apartments in Christian VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in [[Copenhagen]], in [[Sorgenfri Palace]] near the capital and in a summer residence, [[Marselisborg Palace]] in [[Aarhus]] in [[Jutland]], which Frederick's parents had received as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the [[villa]] [[Klitg\u00e5rden]] in [[Skagen]] in [[Northern Jutland]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Crown Prince Denmark 5125513827 c7a710ba95 o.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crown Prince Frederick in 1914.]]\nChristian IX died on 29 January 1906, and Frederick's grandfather Crown Prince Frederick succeeded him as King Frederick VIII. Frederick's father became crown prince, and Frederick moved up to second in line to the throne.\n\nJust six years later, on 14 May 1912, King Frederick VIII died, and Frederick's father ascended the throne as King Christian X. Frederick himself became crown prince. On 1 December 1918, as the [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union]] recognized Iceland as a fully [[sovereign state]] in [[personal union]] with Denmark through a common [[monarch]], Frederick also became crown prince of [[Kingdom of Iceland|Iceland]] (where his name was officially spelled Fri\u00f0rik). However, as a [[1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum|national referendum]] [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|established the Republic of Iceland]] on 17 June 1944, he never succeeded as king of Iceland.\n\nFrederick was educated at the [[Royal Danish Naval Academy]] (breaking with Danish royal tradition by choosing a naval instead of an army career) and the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Before he became king, he had acquired the rank of [[rear admiral]] and he had had several senior commands on active service. He acquired several tattoos during his naval service.\n\nIn addition, with his great love of music, the king was an able [[piano]] player and [[Conducting|conductor]].\n\n==Marriage and issue==\n[[File:IngridandFrederikIX.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The newly engaged Princess Ingrid of Sweden and Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark in 1935.]]\nIn the 1910s Alexandrine considered the two youngest daughters, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia]] and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], of her cousin [[Tsar Nicholas II]] as possible wives for Frederick until the subsequent execution of the Romanov family in 1918. In 1922, Frederick was engaged to [[Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark]], his second cousin. They never wed.<ref>{{cite news|title=DANISH HEIR ENGAGED.; Crown Prince Will Wed Princess Olga of Greece.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D05E1DA1F30EE3ABC4E53DFB5668389639EDE|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=6 March 1922}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CONSTANTINE'S NIECE NOT TO WED PRINCE; Engagement of Princess Olga and Heir to the Danish Throne Is Annuled (sic)|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D07EEDF1E39EF3ABC4051DFBF668389639EDE|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=28 September 1922}}</ref>\n\nInstead, on 15 March 1935, a few days after his 36th birthday, he was engaged to Princess [[Ingrid of Sweden]] (1910\u20132000), a daughter of [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf]] (later King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden) and his first wife, [[Princess Margaret of Connaught]]. They were related in several ways. In descent from [[Oscar I of Sweden]] and [[Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden]], they were double third cousins. In descent from [[Paul I of Russia]], Frederick was a fourth cousin of Ingrid's mother. They married in [[Storkyrkan|Stockholm Cathedral]] on 24 May 1935. Their wedding was one of the greatest media events of the day in Sweden in 1935, and\namong the wedding guests were the [[Christian X of Denmark|King]] and [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen of Denmark]], the [[Leopold III of Belgium|King]] and [[Astrid of Sweden|Queen of Belgium]] and the [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince]] and [[M\u00e4rtha of Sweden|Crown Princess of Norway]].\n\nUpon their return to Denmark, the couple were given [[Frederick VIII's Palace]] at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen as their primary residence and [[Gr\u00e5sten Palace]] in [[Northern Schleswig]] as a summer residence.\n\nTheir daughters are:\n* Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], born 16 April 1940, married to [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]] and has two sons\n* [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark]], born 29 April 1944, married to [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and has three children\n* [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece]], born 30 August 1946, married to [[King Constantine II of Greece]] and has five children\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Kongeparret.jpg|thumb|left|King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid, circa 1950's.]]\nFrom 1942 until 1943, Frederick acted as [[regent]] on behalf of his father who was temporarily incapacitated after a fall from his horse in October 1942.\n\nOn 20 April 1947, Christian X died, and Frederick succeeded to the throne. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Knud Kristensen]].\n\nFrederick IX's reign saw great change. During these years, Danish society shook off the restrictions of an agricultural society, developed a welfare state, and, as a consequence of the booming economy of the 1960s, women entered the labour market. In other words, Denmark became a modern country, which meant new demands on the monarchy.\n\nIn 1948, one year into the king's reign, the [[Faroe Islands]] obtained [[home rule]] and became a [[self-governing]] country within the [[Danish Realm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Faeroe_Islands.html|title=Faeroe Islands|publisher=World Statesmen|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Changes to the Act of Succession===\nAs King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid had no sons, it was expected that the king's younger brother, [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]], would inherit the throne, in accordance with Denmark's succession law (Royal Ordinance of 1853).\n\nHowever, in 1953, an Act of Succession was passed, changing the method of succession to [[male-preference primogeniture]] (which allows daughters to succeed if there are no sons). This meant that his daughters could succeed him if he had no sons. As a consequence, his eldest daughter, Margrethe, became [[heir presumptive]]. By order of 27 March 1953 the succession to the throne was limited to the issue of King Christian X.\n\n==Death and funeral==\n[[File:Roskilde mauzoleum.jpg|thumb|left|Mausoleum of Frederick IX of Denmark, next to [[Roskilde Cathedral]].]]\nShortly after the King had delivered his New Year's Address to the Nation at the 1971/72 turn of the year, he became ill with flu-like symptoms. After a few days rest, he suffered cardiac arrest and was rushed to the [[Copenhagen Municipal Hospital]] on 3 January. After a brief period of apparent improvement, the King's condition took a negative turn on 11 January, and he died 3 days later, on 14 January, at 7:50&nbsp;pm surrounded by his immediate family and closest friends, having been unconscious since the previous day.<ref>Jon Bloch Skipper.

First a brief ceremony was held in the chapel where the king had lain in state, where the [[Diocese of Copenhagen|Bishop of Copenhagen]], [[Willy Westergaard Madsen]] said a brief prayer, followed by a hymn, before the coffin was carried out of the chapel by members of the [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] and placed on a [[Limbers and caissons|gun carriage]] for the journey through [[Copenhagen]] to [[Copenhagen Central Station]]. The gun carriage was pulled by 48 [[Sailor|seamen]] and was escorted by [[Guard of honour|honor guards]] from the Danish [[Royal Danish Army|Army]], [[Royal Danish Air Force|Air Force]], and [[Royal Danish Navy|Navy]], as well as honor guards from France, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nAt the [[Copenhagen Central Station]], the coffin was placed in a special railway carriage for the rail journey to [[Roskilde]]. The [[funeral train]] was pulled by two [[SJ F (steam locomotive)|DSB class E]] steam engines. Once in Roskilde, the coffin was pulled through the city by a group of [[Sailor|seamen]] to [[Roskilde Cathedral]] where the final ceremony took place.

The family lived in apartments in Christian VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in [[Copenhagen]], in [[Sorgenfri Palace]] near the capital and in a summer residence, [[Marselisborg Palace]] in [[Aarhus]] in [[Jutland]], which Frederick's parents had received as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the [[villa]] [[Klitg\u00e5rden]] in [[Skagen]] in [[Northern Jutland]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Crown Prince Denmark 5125513827 c7a710ba95 o.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crown Prince Frederick in 1914.]]\nChristian IX died on 29 January 1906, and Frederick's grandfather Crown Prince Frederick succeeded him as King Frederick VIII. Frederick's father became crown prince, and Frederick moved up to second in line to the throne.\n\nJust six years later, on 14 May 1912, King Frederick VIII died, and Frederick's father ascended the throne as King Christian X. Frederick himself became crown prince. On 1 December 1918, as the [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union]] recognized Iceland as a fully [[sovereign state]] in [[personal union]] with Denmark through a common [[monarch]], Frederick also became crown prince of [[Kingdom of Iceland|Iceland]] (where his name was officially spelled Fri\u00f0rik). However, as a [[1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum|national referendum]] [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|established the Republic of Iceland]] on 17 June 1944, he never succeeded as king of Iceland.\n\nFrederick was educated at the [[Royal Danish Naval Academy]] (breaking with Danish royal tradition by choosing a naval instead of an army career) and the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Before he became king, he had acquired the rank of [[rear admiral]] and he had had several senior commands on active service. He acquired several tattoos during his naval service.\n\nIn addition, with his great love of music, the king was an able [[piano]] player and [[Conducting|conductor]].\n\n==Marriage and issue==\n[[File:IngridandFrederikIX.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The newly engaged Princess Ingrid of Sweden and Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark in 1935.]]\nIn the 1910s Alexandrine considered the two youngest daughters, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia]] and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], of her cousin [[Tsar Nicholas II]] as possible wives for Frederick until the subsequent execution of the Romanov family in 1918. In 1922, Frederick was engaged to [[Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark]], his second cousin. They never wed.<ref>{{cite news|title=DANISH HEIR ENGAGED.; Crown Prince Will Wed Princess Olga of Greece.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D05E1DA1F30EE3ABC4E53DFB5668389639EDE|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=6 March 1922}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CONSTANTINE'S NIECE NOT TO WED PRINCE; Engagement of Princess Olga and Heir to the Danish Throne Is Annuled (sic)|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D07EEDF1E39EF3ABC4051DFBF668389639EDE|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=28 September 1922}}</ref>\n\nInstead, on 15 March 1935, a few days after his 36th birthday, he was engaged to Princess [[Ingrid of Sweden]] (1910\u20132000), a daughter of [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf]] (later King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden) and his first wife, [[Princess Margaret of Connaught]]. They were related in several ways. In descent from [[Oscar I of Sweden]] and [[Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden]], they were double third cousins. In descent from [[Paul I of Russia]], Frederick was a fourth cousin of Ingrid's mother. They married in [[Storkyrkan|Stockholm Cathedral]] on 24 May 1935. Their wedding was one of the greatest media events of the day in Sweden in 1935, and\namong the wedding guests were the [[Christian X of Denmark|King]] and [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen of Denmark]], the [[Leopold III of Belgium|King]] and [[Astrid of Sweden|Queen of Belgium]] and the [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince]] and [[M\u00e4rtha of Sweden|Crown Princess of Norway]].\n\nUpon their return to Denmark, the couple were given [[Frederick VIII's Palace]] at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen as their primary residence and [[Gr\u00e5sten Palace]] in [[Northern Schleswig]] as a summer residence.\n\nTheir daughters are:\n* [[Queen Margrethe II of Denmark]], born 16 April 1940, married to [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]] and has two sons\n* [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark]], born 29 April 1944, married to [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and has three children\n* [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece]], born 30 August 1946, married to [[King Constantine II of Greece]] and has five children\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Kongeparret.jpg|thumb|left|King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid, circa 1950's.]]\nFrom 1942 until 1943, Frederick acted as [[regent]] on behalf of his father who was temporarily incapacitated after a fall from his horse in October 1942.\n\nOn 20 April 1947, Christian X died, and Frederick succeeded to the throne. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Knud Kristensen]].\n\nFrederick IX's reign saw great change. During these years, Danish society shook off the restrictions of an agricultural society, developed a welfare state, and, as a consequence of the booming economy of the 1960s, women entered the labour market. In other words, Denmark became a modern country, which meant new demands on the monarchy.\n\nIn 1948, one year into the king's reign, the [[Faroe Islands]] obtained [[home rule]] and became a [[self-governing]] country within the [[Danish Realm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Faeroe_Islands.html|title=Faeroe Islands|publisher=World Statesmen|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Changes to the Act of Succession===\nAs King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid had no sons, it was expected that the king's younger brother, [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]], would inherit the throne, in accordance with Denmark's succession law (Royal Ordinance of 1853).\n\nHowever, in 1953, an Act of Succession was passed, changing the method of succession to [[male-preference primogeniture]] (which allows daughters to succeed if there are no sons). This meant that his daughters could succeed him if he had no sons. As a consequence, his eldest daughter, Margrethe, became [[heir presumptive]]. By order of 27 March 1953 the succession to the throne was limited to the issue of King Christian X.\n\n==Death and funeral==\n[[File:Roskilde mauzoleum.jpg|thumb|left|Mausoleum of Frederick IX of Denmark, next to [[Roskilde Cathedral]].]]\nShortly after the King had delivered his New Year's Address to the Nation at the 1971/72 turn of the year, he became ill with flu-like symptoms. After a few days rest, he suffered cardiac arrest and was rushed to the [[Copenhagen Municipal Hospital]] on 3 January.

Metals hold the highest values of fracture toughness. Cracks cannot easily propagate in tough materials, making metals highly resistant to cracking under stress and gives their stress\u2013strain curve a large zone of plastic flow. Ceramics have a lower fracture toughness but show an exceptional improvement in the stress fracture that is attributed to their 1.5 orders of magnitude strength increase, relative to metals. The fracture toughness of composites, made by combining engineering ceramics with engineering polymers, greatly exceeds the individual fracture toughness of the constituent materials.\n\n== Mechanisms ==\n=== Intrinsic mechanisms ===\nIntrinsic [[toughening]] mechanisms are processes which act ahead of the crack tip to increase the material's toughness. These will tend to be related to the structure and bonding of the base material, as well as microstructural features and additives to it. Examples of mechanisms include \n* crack deflection by secondary phases, \n* crack bifurcation due to fine [[Microstructure|grain structure]] \n* changes in the crack path due to grain boundaries\n\nAny alteration to the base material which increases its [[ductility]] can also be thought of as intrinsic toughening.<ref>{{Citation |last=Wei|first= Robert|year= 2010|title= Fracture Mechanics: Integration of Mechanics, Materials Science and Chemistry|publisher= Cambridge University Press|page= |id= {{ASIN|052119489X|country=uk}}}}</ref>\n\n==== Grain boundaries ====\nThe presence of grains in a material can also affect its toughness by affecting the way cracks propagate. In front of a crack, a plastic zone can be present as the material yields. Beyond that region, the material remains elastic. The conditions for fracture are the most favorable at the boundary between this plastic and elastic zone, and thus cracks often initiate by the cleavage of a grain at that location.\n\nAt low temperatures, where the material can become completely brittle, such as in a body-centered cubic (BCC) metal, the plastic zone shrinks away, and only the elastic zone exists. In this state, the crack will propagate by successive cleavage of the grains. At these low temperatures, the yield strength is high, but the fracture strain and crack tip radius of curvature are low, leading to a low toughness.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|last=Courtney|first=Thomas H.|date=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=9781577664253|oclc=41932585}}</ref>\n\nAt higher temperatures, the yield strength decreases, and leads to the formation of the plastic zone. Cleavage is likely to initiate at the elastic-plastic zone boundary, and then link back to the main crack tip. This is usually a mixture of cleavages of grains, and ductile fracture of grains known as fibrous linkages. The percentage of fibrous linkages increase as temperature increases until the linkup is entirely fibrous linkages. In this state, even though yield strength is lower, the presence of ductile fracture and a higher crack tip radius of curvature results in a higher toughness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Inclusions ====\nInclusions in a material such as a second phase particles can act similar to brittle grains that can affect crack propagation. Fracture or decohesion at the inclusion can either be caused by the external applied stress or by the dislocations generated by the requirement of the inclusion to maintain contiguity with the matrix around it. Similar to grains, the fracture is most likely to occur at the plastic-elastic zone boundary. Then the crack can linkup back to the main crack. If the plastic zone is small or the density of the inclusions is small, the fracture is more likely to directly link up with the main crack tip. If the plastic zone is large, or the density of inclusions is high, additional inclusion fractures may occur within the plastic zone, and linkup occurs by progressing from the crack to the closest fracturing inclusion within the zone.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Transformation toughening ====\n''Transformation toughening'' is a phenomenon whereby a material undergoes one or more [[Martensitic transformation#Martensitic transformation|martensitic]] (displacive, diffusionless) phase transformations which result in an almost instantaneous change in volume of that material. This transformation is triggered by a change in the stress state of the material, such as an increase in tensile stress, and acts in opposition to the applied stress. Thus when the material is locally put under tension, for example at the tip of a growing crack, it can undergo a phase transformation which increases its volume, lowering the local tensile stress and hindering the crack's progression through the material. This mechanism is exploited to increase the toughness of ceramic materials, most notably in [[Yttria-stabilized zirconia]] for applications such as ceramic knives and thermal barrier coatings on jet engine turbine blades.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Padture\n | first = Nitin\n | title = Thermal Barrier Coatings for Gas-Turbine Engine Applications\n | journal = Science\n | volume = 296\n | issue = 5566\n | pages = 280\u2013284\n | date = 12 April 2002\n | doi =10.1126/science.1068609\n|bibcode = 2002Sci...296..280P\n | pmid = 11951028 }}</ref>\n\n=== Extrinsic mechanisms ===\nExtrinsic toughening mechanisms are processes which act behind the crack tip to resist its further opening. Examples include \n* fibre/lamella bridging, where these structures hold the two fracture surfaces together after the crack has propagated through the matrix, \n* crack wedging from the friction between two rough fracture surfaces, and\n* microcracking, where smaller cracks form in the material around the main crack, relieving the stress at the crack tip by effectively increasing the material's [[Elastic modulus|compliance]].<ref>{{Citation |last= Liang|first= Yiling|year= 2010|title= The toughening mechanism in hybrid epoxy-silica-rubber nanocomposites |publisher= Lehigh University|location= |page= 20|oclc= 591591884}}</ref>\n\n== Test methods ==\nFracture toughness tests are performed to quantify the resistance of a material to failure by cracking. Such tests result in either a single-valued measure of fracture toughness or in a [[Crack growth resistance curve|resistance curve]]. Resistance curves are plots where fracture toughness parameters (K, J etc.) are plotted against parameters characterizing the propagation of crack. The resistance curve or the single-valued fracture toughness is obtained based on the mechanism and stability of fracture. Fracture toughness is a critical mechanical property for engineering applications. There are several types of test used to measure fracture toughness of materials, which generally utilise a [[Notch (engineering)|notched]] specimen in one of various configurations. A widely utilized standardized test method is the [[Charpy impact test]] whereby a sample with a [[Notch (engineering)#V-Notch|V-notch]] or a [[Notch (engineering)#U-Notch|U-notch]] is subjected to impact from behind the notch. Also widely used are crack displacement tests such as three-point beam bending tests with thin cracks preset into test specimens before applying load.\n\n=== Testing requirements ===\n==== Choice of specimen ====\nThe ASTM standard describes<ref>{{Cite journal|last=E08 Committee|title=Terminology Relating to Fatigue and Fracture Testing|url=http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E1823-13|language=en|doi=10.1520/e1823-13}}</ref> five specimen configurations, namely compact specimen, disk-shaped compact specimen, single edge notched bend specimen(SENB), middle tension and arc-shaped specimen. Each specimen configuration is characterized by three dimensions, namely the crack length(a), the thickness (B) and the width (W). The values of these dimensions are determined by the demand of the particular test that is being performed on the specimen. The vast majority of the tests are carried out on either [[Compact tension specimen|compact]] or [[Three-point flexural test|SENB]] configuration. For the same characteristic dimensions, compact configuration takes a lesser amount of material compared to SENB.\n\n==== Material orientation ====\nOrientation of fracture is important because of the inherent non-isotropic nature of most engineering materials. Due to this, there may be ''planes of weakness'' within the material, and crack growth along this plane may be easier compared to other direction. Due to this importance ASTM has devised a standardized way of reporting the crack orientation with respect to forging axis.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E1823-13|title=Standard Terminology Relating to Fatigue Fracture Testing|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e1823-13|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> The letters L, T and S are used to denote the ''longitudinal'', ''transverse'' and ''short transverse'' directions, where the longitudinal direction coincides with forging axis. The orientation is defined with two letters the first one being the direction of principal tensile stress and the second one is the direction of crack propagation. Generally speaking, the lower bound of the toughness of a material is obtained in the orientation where the crack grows in the direction of forging axis.\n\n==== Pre-cracking ====\nTo apply the results of the toughness tests to the theory we need an infinitely sharp crack prior to loading. The machined cracks do not meet this criterion, i.e. they have a finite opening at the crack tip. The most effective way of introducing a sufficiently sharp crack is through cyclic loading. Fatigue cracks are initiated at the tip of the machined crack and allowed to extend until the crack length reaches its desired value. \n\n==== Crack growth ====\nThe cyclic loading is controlled carefully so as to not affect the actual toughness of the material through strain-hardening. This is done through choosing cyclic loads that produce a far smaller plastic zone compared to plastic zone of the main fracture. For example, according to ASTM E399 standard the maximum stress intensity K<sub>max</sub> should be no larger than 0.6<math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> during the initial stage and less than 0.8<math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> when crack approaches its final size.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E399-90R97|title=Standard Test Method for Plane-Strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic Materials.|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e0399-90r97|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nIn certain cases grooves are machined into the sides of a fracture toughness specimen so that the thickness of the specimen is reduced to a minimum of 80% of the original thickness along the intended path of crack extensions.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/doiLink.cgi?STP35842S|title=Thickness and Side-Groove Effects on J- and \u03b4-Resistance Curves for A533-B Steel at 93C|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/stp35842s|access-date=2019-05-10|page=426 | last1 = Andrews | first1 = WR | last2 = Shih | first2 = CF}}</ref> The reason is to maintain a straight crack front during R-curve test.\n\n\nThe four main standardized tests are described below with K<sub>Ic</sub> and K<sub>R</sub> tests valid for linear-elastic fracture mechanics(LEFM) while J and J<sub>R</sub> tests valid for elastic-plastic fracture mechanics(PEFM)\n\n=== Determination of plane strain fracture toughness ===\nWhen a material behaves in a linear elastic way prior to failure, such that the plastic zone is small compared to the specimen dimension, a critical value of Mode-I stress intensity factor can be an appropriate fracture parameter. This method provides a quantitative measure of fracture toughness in terms of the critical [[Infinitesimal strain theory |plane strain]] stress intensity factor. The test must be validated once complete to ensure the results are meaningful. The specimen size is fixed, and must be large enough to ensure plane strain conditions at the crack tip. This limits the product forms to which the test can be applied.\n\nIn the 1960s, it was postulated that small specimens or thin sections fail under plane stress conditions, and that ''plane strain fracture'' occurs in thick sections. The ASTM E 399 test method reflects this viewpoint. Over the years, it has been accepted that toughness decreases with increasing specimen size until a plateau is reached. Specimen size requirements in ASTM E 399 are intended to ensure that <math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> measurements correspond to the supposed plane strain plateau.  The specimen size requirements in this standard are far more stringent than they need to be to ensure predominately plane strain conditions at the crack tip. The real key to a K-based test method is ensuring that the specimen fractures under nominally linear elastic conditions. That is, the plastic zone must be small compared to the specimen cross section. Consequently, the important specimen dimensions to ensure a valid <math>K</math> test are the crack length a and the ligament length W-a, not the thickness B. Four specimen configurations are permitted by the current version of E 399: the compact, SE(B), arc-shaped, and disk-shaped specimens. Specimens for <math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> tests are usually fabricated with the width W equal to twice the thickness B. They are fatigue pre-cracked so that the crack length/width ratio (a /W) lies between 0.45 and 0.55. Thus, the specimen design is such that all of the key dimensions, a, B, and W\u2212a, are approximately equal. This design results in the efficient use of material, since the standard requires that each of these dimensions must be large compared to the plastic zone.\n\n;Plane-strain fracture toughness testing\n\nWhen performing a fracture toughness test, the most common test specimen configurations are the single edge [[Notch (engineering)|notch]] bend (SENB or three-point bend), and the compact tension (CT) specimens. From the above discussion, it is clear that an accurate determination of the plane-strain fracture toughness requires a specimen whose thickness exceeds some critical thickness (B). Testing has shown that plane-strain conditions generally prevail when:<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E399-90R97|title=Standard Test Method for Plane-Strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic Materials|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e0399-90r97|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n::<math>B,a\\geq2.5\\left(\\frac{K_{IC}}{\\sigma_\\text{YS}}\\right)^2</math>\nWhere: B is the minimum thickness that produces a condition where plastic strain energy at the crack tip in minimal, <math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> the fracture toughness of the material and <math>\\sigma_\\text{YS}</math> is the material yield strength.\n\nThe test is performed by loading steadily at a rate such that K<sub>I</sub> increases steadily from 0.55 to 2.75 (MPa<math>\\sqrt{m}</math>)/s. The load and the crack mouth opening displacement(CMOD) is noted and the test is continued till the maximum load is reached. The critical load, P<sub>Q</sub> is calculated through specialized data reduction method from the load vs CMOD plot. Then we calculate a provisional toughness K<sub>Q</sub> given as <math>K_Q=\\frac{P_Q}{\\sqrt{W}B}f(a/W,...)</math>. The function<math>f(a/W,...)</math> is a dimensionless function of a/W. This function is given in polynomial form in E 399 standard, Function for compact test geometry can be found [[Compact tension specimen|here]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.twi-global.com/what-we-do/research-and-technology/research-reports/industrial-member-reports/stress-intensity-factors-compliances-and-elastic-nu-factors-for-six-test-geometries-136-1980|title=Stress Intensity Factors Compliances And Elastic Nu Factors For Six Test Geometries}}</ref> This provisional toughness value is recognized as the valid one when the validity requirements are met, which include\n\n::<math>min(B,a)>2.5\\left(\\frac{K_{Q}}{\\sigma_\\text{YS}}\\right)^2</math>and <math>P_{max}\\leq 1.1P_Q</math>\n\nWhen a material of unknown fracture toughness is tested, a specimen of full material section thickness is tested or the specimen is sized based on a prediction of the fracture toughness. If the fracture toughness value resulting from the test does not satisfy the requirement of the above equation, the test must be repeated using a thicker specimen. In addition to this thickness calculation, test specifications have several other requirements that must be met (such as the size of the shear lips) before a test can be said to have resulted in a K<sub>IC</sub> value.\n\nWhen a test fails to meet the thickness and other test requirements that are in place to ensure plane-strain condition, the fracture toughness value produced is given the designation K<sub>C</sub>. Sometimes it is not possible to produce a specimen that meets the thickness requirement. For example, when a relatively thin plate product with high toughness is being tested, it might not be possible to produce a thicker specimen with plane-strain conditions at the crack tip.\n\n;Plane-stress and transitional-stress states\n\nFor cases where the plastic energy at the crack tip is not negligible, other fracture mechanics parameters, such as the J integral or R-curve, can be used to characterize a material. The toughness data produced by these other tests will be dependent on the thickness of the product tested and will not be a true material property. However, plane-strain conditions do not exist in all structural configurations and using K<sub>IC</sub> values in the design of relatively thin areas may result in excess conservatism and a weight or cost penalty. In cases where the actual stress state is plane-stress or, more generally, some intermediate- or transitional-stress state, it is more appropriate to use J integral or R-curve data, which account for slow, stable fracture (ductile tearing) rather than rapid (brittle) fracture.\n\n=== Determination of R-curve, K-R ===\nThe specimen showing stable crack growth shows an increasing trend in fracture toughness as the crack length increases (ductile crack extension). This plot of fracture toughness vs crack length is called the resistance(R)-curve. ASTM E561 outlines a procedure for determining toughness vs crack growth curves in materials.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E561-98|title=Standard Practice for R-Curve Determination|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e0561-98|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> This standard does not have a constraint over the minimum thickness of the material and hence can be used for thin sheets however the requirements for LEFM must be fulfilled for the test to be valid. The criteria for LEFM essentially states that in-plane dimension has to be large compared to the plastic zone. There is a misconception about the effect of thickness on the shape of R curve. It is hinted that for the same material thicker section fails by plane strain fracture and shows a single-valued fracture toughness, the thinner section fails by plane stress fracture and shows the rising R-curve. However, the main factor that controls the slope of R curve is the fracture morphology not the thickness. In some material section thickness changes the fracture morphology from ductile tearing to cleavage from thin to thick section, in which case the thickness alone dictates the slope of R-curve. There are cases where even plane strain fracture ensues in rising R-curve due to \"microvoid coalescence\" being the mode of failure.\n\nThe most accurate way of evaluating K-R curve is taking presence of plasticity into account depending on the relative size of the plastic zone. For the case of negligible plasticity, the load vs displacement curve is obtained from the test and on each point the compliance is found. The compliance is reciprocal of the slope of the curve that will be followed if the specimen is unloaded at a certain point, which can be given as the ratio of displacement to load for LEFM. The compliance is used to determine the instantaneous crack length through the relationship given in the ASTM standard. \n\nThe stress intensity should be corrected by calculating an effective crack length. ASTM standard suggests two alternative approaches. The first method is named Irwin's plastic zone correction. Irwin's approach describes the effective crack length <math>a_\\text{eff}</math> to be<ref name=\"notch\">{{cite journal|last1= Liu | first1= M. | display-authors=etal |title= An improved semi-analytical solution for stress at round-tip notches | journal= Engineering Fracture Mechanics | year=2015 | volume=149| pages=134\u2013143 |url= http://drgan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/032_EFM_2015.pdf | doi= 10.1016/j.engfracmech.2015.10.004 }}</ref>\n\n::<math>a_\\text{eff}=a+\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\frac{K}{\\sigma_{YS}}\\right)^2</math>\n\nIrwin's approach leads to an iterative solution as K itself is a function of crack length.\n\nThe other method, namely the secant method, uses the compliance-crack length equation given by ASTM standard to calculate effective crack length from an effective compliance. Compliance at any point in Load vs displacement curve is essentially the reciprocal of the slope of the curve that ensues if the specimen is unloaded at that point. Now the unloading curve returns to the origin for linear elastic material but not for elastic plastic material as there is a permanent deformation. The effective compliance at a point for the elastic plastic case is taken as the slope of the line joining the point and origin( i.e the compliance if the material was an elastic one). This effective compliance is used to get an effective crack growth and the rest of the calculation follows the equation\n\n::<math>K_I=\\frac{P}{\\sqrt{W}B} f(a_\\text{eff}/W,...)</math>\n\nThe choice of plasticity correction is factored on the size of plastic zone. ASTM standard covering resistance curve suggests using Irwin's method is acceptable for small plastic zone and recommends using Secant method when crack-tip plasticity is more prominent. Also since the ASTM E 561 standard does not contain requirements on the specimen size or maximum allowable crack extension, thus the size independence of the resistance curve is not guaranteed. Few studies show that the size dependence is less detected in the experimental data for the Secant method.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Faturohman|first=Topan|date=2018-04-10|doi = 10.31237/osf.io/3ftb7|title = Peranan Pramusaji Dalam Meningkatkan Kepuasan Tamu di Saffron Restoran Four Points by Sheraton Hotel Bandung}}</ref>\n\n=== Determination of J<sub>IC</sub> ===\nStrain energy release rate per unit fracture surface area is calculated by J-integral method which is a contour path integral around the crack tip where the path begins and ends on either crack surfaces. J-toughness value signifies the resistance of the material in terms of amount of stress energy required for a crack to grow.  J<sub>IC</sub> toughness value is measured for elastic-plastic materials. Now the single-valued J<sub>IC</sub> is determined as the toughness near the onset of the ductile crack extension( effect of strain hardening is not important). The test is performed with multiple specimen loading each of the specimen to various levels and unloading. This gives the crack mouth opening compliance which is to be used to get crack length with the help of relationships given in ASTM standard E 1820, which covers the J-integral testing.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E1820-01|title=Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fracture Toughness|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e1820-01|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> Another way of measuring crack growth is to mark the specimen with heat tinting or fatigue cracking. The specimen is eventually broken apart and the crack extension is measured with the help of the marks.\n\nThe test thus performed yields several Load vs Crack Mouth Opening Displacement (CMOD) curve, which are used to calculate J as following:-\n\n::<math>J=J_{el}+J_{pl}</math>\n\nThe linear elastic J is calculated using\n\n<math>J_{el}=\\frac{K^2\\left(1-\\nu^2\\right)}{E}</math>and K is determined from <math>K_I=\\frac{P}{\\sqrt{WBB_N}} f(a/W,...)</math>where B<sub>N</sub> is the net thickness for side-grooved specimen and equal to B for not side-grooved specimen\n\nThe elastic plastic J is calculated using\n\n::<math>J_{pl}=\\frac{\\eta A_{pl}}{B_Nb_o}</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\eta</math>=2 for SENB specimen\n\nb<sub>o</sub> is initial ligament length given by the difference between width and initial crack length\n\nA<sub>Pl</sub> is the plastic area under the load-displacement curve.\n\nSpecialized data reduction technique is used to get a provisional J<sub>Q</sub>. The value is accepted if the following criterion is met\n\n::<math>\\min(B,b_o)\\geq\\frac{25J_Q}{\\sigma_\\text{YS}}</math>\n\n=== Determination of tear resistance (Kahn tear test) ===\nThe tear test (e.g. Kahn tear test) provides a semi-quantitative measure of toughness in terms of tear resistance. This type of test requires a smaller specimen, and can, therefore, be used for a wider range of product forms. The tear test can also be used for very ductile aluminium alloys (e.g. 1100, 3003), where linear elastic fracture mechanics do not apply.\n\n=== Standard test methods ===\nThe real-world consequence of the failure of materials by fracture has motivated a variety of organizations throughout the world to publish standardized procedures for fracture toughness measurements, namely [[ASTM International|ASTM]], [[BSI Group|BSI]], ISO, JSME. \n\n*ASTM C1161 Test Method for Flexural Strength of Advanced Ceramics at Ambient Temperature\n*ASTM C1322 Practice for Fractography and Characterization of Fracture Origins in Advanced Ceramics\n*ASTM E4 Practices for Force Verification of Testing Machines\n*ASTM E112 Test Methods for Determining Average Grain Size\n*ASTM E177 Practice for Use of the Terms Precision and Bias in ASTM Test Methods\n*ASTM E337 Test Method for Measuring Humidity with a Psychrometer (the Measurement of Wet- and Dry-Bulb Temperatures)\n*ASTM E399 Test Method for Plane-strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic Materials \n*ASTM E691 Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method\n*ASTM E740 Practice for Fracture Testing with Surface-Crack Tension Specimens\n*ASTM E1823 Terminology Relating to Fatigue and Fracture Testing\n*IEEE/ASTM SI 10 Standard for Use of the International System of Units (SI) (The Modern Metric System)<ref>NIST SRM 2100 Fracture Toughness of Ceramics</ref>\n*ISO 28079:2009, the [[Palmqvist method]], used to determine the fracture toughness for [[cemented carbide]]s.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44495 ISO 28079:2009, Palmqvist toughness test], Retrieved 22 January 2016</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n*[[Brittle-ductile transition zone]]\n*[[Charpy impact test]]\n*[[Impact (mechanics)]]\n*[[Izod impact strength test]]\n*[[Puncture resistance]]\n*[[Shock (mechanics)]]\n*[[Three point flexural test#Fracture toughness testing|Three point flexural fracture toughness testing]]\n*[[Ceramography#Microindention hardness and toughness|Toughness of ceramics by indentation]]\n*[[Palmqvist method]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Anderson, T L., ''Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications'' (CRC Press, Boston 1995).\n*Davidge, R.

Metals hold the highest values of fracture toughness. Cracks cannot easily propagate in tough materials, making metals highly resistant to cracking under stress and gives their stress\u2013strain curve a large zone of plastic flow. Ceramics have a lower fracture toughness but show an exceptional improvement in the stress fracture that is attributed to their 1.5 orders of magnitude strength increase, relative to metals. The fracture toughness of composites, made by combining engineering ceramics with engineering polymers, greatly exceeds the individual fracture toughness of the constituent materials.\n\n== Mechanisms ==\n=== Intrinsic mechanisms ===\nIntrinsic [[toughening]] mechanisms are processes which act ahead of the crack tip to increase the material's toughness. These will tend to be related to the structure and bonding of the base material, as well as microstructural features and additives to it. Examples of mechanisms include \n* crack deflection by secondary phases, \n* crack bifurcation due to fine [[Microstructure|grain structure]] \n* changes in the crack path due to grain boundaries\n\nAny alteration to the base material which increases its [[ductility]] can also be thought of as intrinsic toughening.<ref>{{Citation |last=Wei|first= Robert|year= 2010|title= Fracture Mechanics: Integration of Mechanics, Materials Science and Chemistry|publisher= Cambridge University Press|page= |id= {{ASIN|052119489X|country=uk}}}}</ref>\n\n==== Grain boundaries ====\nThe presence of grains in a material can also affect its toughness by affecting the way cracks propagate. In front of a crack, a plastic zone can be present as the material yields. Beyond that region, the material remains elastic. The conditions for fracture are the most favorable at the boundary between this plastic and elastic zone, and thus cracks often initiate by the cleavage of a grain at that location.\n\nAt low temperatures, where the material can become completely brittle, such as in a body-centered cubic (BCC) metal, the plastic zone shrinks away, and only the elastic zone exists. In this state, the crack will propagate by successive cleavage of the grains. At these low temperatures, the yield strength is high, but the fracture strain and crack tip radius of curvature are low, leading to a low toughness.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|last=Courtney|first=Thomas H.|date=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=9781577664253|oclc=41932585}}</ref>\n\nAt higher temperatures, the yield strength decreases, and leads to the formation of the plastic zone. Cleavage is likely to initiate at the elastic-plastic zone boundary, and then link back to the main crack tip. This is usually a mixture of cleavages of grains, and ductile fracture of grains known as fibrous linkages. The percentage of fibrous linkages increase as temperature increases until the linkup is entirely fibrous linkages. In this state, even though yield strength is lower, the presence of ductile fracture and a higher crack tip radius of curvature results in a higher toughness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Inclusions ====\nInclusions in a material such as a second phase particles can act similar to brittle grains that can affect crack propagation. Fracture or decohesion at the inclusion can either be caused by the external applied stress or by the dislocations generated by the requirement of the inclusion to maintain contiguity with the matrix around it. Similar to grains, the fracture is most likely to occur at the plastic-elastic zone boundary. Then the crack can linkup back to the main crack. If the plastic zone is small or the density of the inclusions is small, the fracture is more likely to directly link up with the main crack tip. If the plastic zone is large, or the density of inclusions is high, additional inclusion fractures may occur within the plastic zone, and linkup occurs by progressing from the crack to the closest fracturing inclusion within the zone.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Transformation toughening ====\n''Transformation toughening'' is a phenomenon whereby a material undergoes one or more [[Martensitic transformation#Martensitic transformation|martensitic]] (displacive, diffusionless) phase transformations which result in an almost instantaneous change in volume of that material. This transformation is triggered by a change in the stress state of the material, such as an increase in tensile stress, and acts in opposition to the applied stress. Thus when the material is locally put under tension, for example at the tip of a growing crack, it can undergo a phase transformation which increases its volume, lowering the local tensile stress and hindering the crack's progression through the material. This mechanism is exploited to increase the toughness of ceramic materials, most notably in [[Yttria-stabilized zirconia]] for applications such as ceramic knives and thermal barrier coatings on jet engine turbine blades.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Padture\n | first = Nitin\n | title = Thermal Barrier Coatings for Gas-Turbine Engine Applications\n | journal = Science\n | volume = 296\n | issue = 5566\n | pages = 280\u2013284\n | date = 12 April 2002\n | doi =10.1126/science.1068609\n|bibcode = 2002Sci...296..280P\n | pmid = 11951028 }}</ref>\n\n=== Extrinsic mechanisms ===\nExtrinsic toughening mechanisms are processes which act behind the crack tip to resist its further opening. Examples include \n* fibre/lamella bridging, where these structures hold the two fracture surfaces together after the crack has propagated through the matrix, \n* crack wedging from the friction between two rough fracture surfaces, and\n* microcracking, where smaller cracks form in the material around the main crack, relieving the stress at the crack tip by effectively increasing the material's [[Elastic modulus|compliance]].<ref>{{Citation |last= Liang|first= Yiling|year= 2010|title= The toughening mechanism in hybrid epoxy-silica-rubber nanocomposites |publisher= Lehigh University|location= |page= 20|oclc= 591591884}}</ref>\n\n== Test methods ==\nFracture toughness tests are performed to quantify the resistance of a material to failure by cracking. Such tests result in either a single-valued measure of fracture toughness or in a [[Crack growth resistance curve|resistance curve]]. Resistance curves are plots where fracture toughness parameters (K, J etc.) are plotted against parameters characterizing the propagation of crack. The resistance curve or the single-valued fracture toughness is obtained based on the mechanism and stability of fracture. Fracture toughness is a critical mechanical property for engineering applications. There are several types of test used to measure fracture toughness of materials, which generally utilise a [[Notch (engineering)|notched]] specimen in one of various configurations. A widely utilized standardized test method is the [[Charpy impact test]] whereby a sample with a [[Notch (engineering)#V-Notch|V-notch]] or a [[Notch (engineering)#U-Notch|U-notch]] is subjected to impact from behind the notch. Also widely used are crack displacement tests such as three-point beam bending tests with thin cracks preset into test specimens before applying load.\n\n=== Testing requirements ===\n==== Choice of specimen ====\nThe ASTM standard describes<ref>{{Cite journal|last=E08 Committee|title=Terminology Relating to Fatigue and Fracture Testing|url=http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E1823-13|language=en|doi=10.1520/e1823-13}}</ref> five specimen configurations, namely compact specimen, disk-shaped compact specimen, single edge notched bend specimen(SENB), middle tension and arc-shaped specimen. Each specimen configuration is characterized by three dimensions, namely the crack length(a), the thickness (B) and the width (W). The values of these dimensions are determined by the demand of the particular test that is being performed on the specimen. The vast majority of the tests are carried out on either [[Compact tension specimen|compact]] or [[Three-point flexural test|SENB]] configuration. For the same characteristic dimensions, compact configuration takes a lesser amount of material compared to SENB.\n\n==== Material orientation ====\nOrientation of fracture is important because of the inherent non-isotropic nature of most engineering materials. Due to this, there may be ''planes of weakness'' within the material, and crack growth along this plane may be easier compared to other direction. Due to this importance ASTM has devised a standardized way of reporting the crack orientation with respect to forging axis.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E1823-13|title=Standard Terminology Relating to Fatigue Fracture Testing|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e1823-13|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> The letters L, T and S are used to denote the ''longitudinal'', ''transverse'' and ''short transverse'' directions, where the longitudinal direction coincides with forging axis. The orientation is defined with two letters the first one being the direction of principal tensile stress and the second one is the direction of crack propagation. Generally speaking, the lower bound of the toughness of a material is obtained in the orientation where the crack grows in the direction of forging axis.\n\n==== Pre-cracking ====\nTo apply the results of the toughness tests to the theory we need an infinitely sharp crack prior to loading. The machined cracks do not meet this criterion, i.e. they have a finite opening at the crack tip. The most effective way of introducing a sufficiently sharp crack is through cyclic loading. Fatigue cracks are initiated at the tip of the machined crack and allowed to extend until the crack length reaches its desired value. \n\n==== Crack growth ====\nThe cyclic loading is controlled carefully so as to not affect the actual toughness of the material through strain-hardening. This is done through choosing cyclic loads that produce a far smaller plastic zone compared to plastic zone of the main fracture. For example, according to ASTM E399 standard the maximum stress intensity K<sub>max</sub> should be no larger than 0.6<math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> during the initial stage and less than 0.8<math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> when crack approaches its final size.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E399-90R97|title=Standard Test Method for Plane-Strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic Materials.|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e0399-90r97|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nIn certain cases grooves are machined into the sides of a fracture toughness specimen so that the thickness of the specimen is reduced to a minimum of 80% of the original thickness along the intended path of crack extensions.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/doiLink.cgi?STP35842S|title=Thickness and Side-Groove Effects on J- and \u03b4-Resistance Curves for A533-B Steel at 93C|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/stp35842s|access-date=2019-05-10|page=426 | last1 = Andrews | first1 = WR | last2 = Shih | first2 = CF}}</ref> The reason is to maintain a straight crack front during R-curve test.\n\n\nThe four main standardized tests are described below with K<sub>Ic</sub> and K<sub>R</sub> tests valid for linear-elastic fracture mechanics(LEFM) while J and J<sub>R</sub> tests valid for elastic-plastic fracture mechanics(PEFM)\n\n=== Determination of plane strain fracture toughness ===\nWhen a material behaves in a linear elastic way prior to failure, such that the plastic zone is small compared to the specimen dimension, a critical value of Mode-I stress intensity factor can be an appropriate fracture parameter. This method provides a quantitative measure of fracture toughness in terms of the critical [[Infinitesimal strain theory |plane strain]] stress intensity factor. The test must be validated once complete to ensure the results are meaningful. The specimen size is fixed, and must be large enough to ensure plane strain conditions at the crack tip. This limits the product forms to which the test can be applied.\n\nIn the 1960s, it was postulated that small specimens or thin sections fail under plane stress conditions, and that ''plane strain fracture'' occurs in thick sections. The ASTM E 399 test method reflects this viewpoint. Over the years, it has been accepted that toughness decreases with increasing specimen size until a plateau is reached. Specimen size requirements in ASTM E 399 are intended to ensure that <math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> measurements correspond to the supposed plane strain plateau.  The specimen size requirements in this standard are far more stringent than they need to be to ensure predominately plane strain conditions at the crack tip. The real key to a K-based test method is ensuring that the specimen fractures under nominally linear elastic conditions. That is, the plastic zone must be small compared to the specimen cross section. Consequently, the important specimen dimensions to ensure a valid <math>K</math> test are the crack length a and the ligament length W-a, not the thickness B. Four specimen configurations are permitted by the current version of E 399: the compact, SE(B), arc-shaped, and disk-shaped specimens. Specimens for <math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> tests are usually fabricated with the width W equal to twice the thickness B. They are fatigue pre-cracked so that the crack length/width ratio (a /W) lies between 0.45 and 0.55. Thus, the specimen design is such that all of the key dimensions, a, B, and W\u2212a, are approximately equal. This design results in the efficient use of material, since the standard requires that each of these dimensions must be large compared to the plastic zone.\n\n;Plane-strain fracture toughness testing\n\nWhen performing a fracture toughness test, the most common test specimen configurations are the single edge [[Notch (engineering)|notch]] bend (SENB or three-point bend), and the compact tension (CT) specimens. From the above discussion, it is clear that an accurate determination of the plane-strain fracture toughness requires a specimen whose thickness exceeds some critical thickness (B). Testing has shown that plane-strain conditions generally prevail when:<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E399-90R97|title=Standard Test Method for Plane-Strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic Materials|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e0399-90r97|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n::<math>B,a\\geq2.5\\left(\\frac{K_{IC}}{\\sigma_\\text{YS}}\\right)^2</math>\nWhere: B is the minimum thickness that produces a condition where plastic strain energy at the crack tip in minimal, <math>K_\\text{Ic}</math> the fracture toughness of the material and <math>\\sigma_\\text{YS}</math> is the material yield strength.\n\nThe test is performed by loading steadily at a rate such that K<sub>I</sub> increases steadily from 0.55 to 2.75 (MPa<math>\\sqrt{m}</math>)/s. The load and the crack mouth opening displacement(CMOD) is noted and the test is continued till the maximum load is reached. The critical load, P<sub>Q</sub> is calculated through specialized data reduction method from the load vs CMOD plot. Then we calculate a provisional toughness K<sub>Q</sub> given as <math>K_Q=\\frac{P_Q}{\\sqrt{W}B}f(a/W,...)</math>. The function<math>f(a/W,...)</math> is a dimensionless function of a/W. This function is given in polynomial form in E 399 standard, Function for compact test geometry can be found [[Compact tension specimen|here]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.twi-global.com/what-we-do/research-and-technology/research-reports/industrial-member-reports/stress-intensity-factors-compliances-and-elastic-nu-factors-for-six-test-geometries-136-1980|title=Stress Intensity Factors Compliances And Elastic Nu Factors For Six Test Geometries}}</ref> This provisional toughness value is recognized as the valid one when the validity requirements are met, which include\n\n::<math>min(B,a)>2.5\\left(\\frac{K_{Q}}{\\sigma_\\text{YS}}\\right)^2</math>and <math>P_{max}\\leq 1.1P_Q</math>\n\nWhen a material of unknown fracture toughness is tested, a specimen of full material section thickness is tested or the specimen is sized based on a prediction of the fracture toughness. If the fracture toughness value resulting from the test does not satisfy the requirement of the above equation, the test must be repeated using a thicker specimen. In addition to this thickness calculation, test specifications have several other requirements that must be met (such as the size of the shear lips) before a test can be said to have resulted in a K<sub>IC</sub> value.\n\nWhen a test fails to meet the thickness and other test requirements that are in place to ensure plane-strain condition, the fracture toughness value produced is given the designation K<sub>C</sub>. Sometimes it is not possible to produce a specimen that meets the thickness requirement. For example, when a relatively thin plate product with high toughness is being tested, it might not be possible to produce a thicker specimen with plane-strain conditions at the crack tip.\n\n;Plane-stress and transitional-stress states\n\nFor cases where the plastic energy at the crack tip is not negligible, other fracture mechanics parameters, such as the J integral or R-curve, can be used to characterize a material. The toughness data produced by these other tests will be dependent on the thickness of the product tested and will not be a true material property. However, plane-strain conditions do not exist in all structural configurations and using K<sub>IC</sub> values in the design of relatively thin areas may result in excess conservatism and a weight or cost penalty. In cases where the actual stress state is plane-stress or, more generally, some intermediate- or transitional-stress state, it is more appropriate to use J integral or R-curve data, which account for slow, stable fracture (ductile tearing) rather than rapid (brittle) fracture.\n\n=== Determination of R-curve, K-R ===\nThe specimen showing stable crack growth shows an increasing trend in fracture toughness as the crack length increases (ductile crack extension). This plot of fracture toughness vs crack length is called the resistance(R)-curve. ASTM E561 outlines a procedure for determining toughness vs crack growth curves in materials.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E561-98|title=Standard Practice for R-Curve Determination|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e0561-98|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> This standard does not have a constraint over the minimum thickness of the material and hence can be used for thin sheets however the requirements for LEFM must be fulfilled for the test to be valid. The criteria for LEFM essentially states that in-plane dimension has to be large compared to the plastic zone. There is a misconception about the effect of thickness on the shape of R curve. It is hinted that for the same material thicker section fails by plane strain fracture and shows a single-valued fracture toughness, the thinner section fails by plane stress fracture and shows the rising R-curve. However, the main factor that controls the slope of R curve is the fracture morphology not the thickness. In some material section thickness changes the fracture morphology from ductile tearing to cleavage from thin to thick section, in which case the thickness alone dictates the slope of R-curve. There are cases where even plane strain fracture ensues in rising R-curve due to \"microvoid coalescence\" being the mode of failure.\n\nThe most accurate way of evaluating K-R curve is taking presence of plasticity into account depending on the relative size of the plastic zone. For the case of negligible plasticity, the load vs displacement curve is obtained from the test and on each point the compliance is found. The compliance is reciprocal of the slope of the curve that will be followed if the specimen is unloaded at a certain point, which can be given as the ratio of displacement to load for LEFM. The compliance is used to determine the instantaneous crack length through the relationship given in the ASTM standard. \n\nThe stress intensity should be corrected by calculating an effective crack length. ASTM standard suggests two alternative approaches. The first method is named Irwin's plastic zone correction. Irwin's approach describes the effective crack length <math>a_\\text{eff}</math> to be<ref name=\"notch\">{{cite journal|last1= Liu | first1= M. | display-authors=etal |title= An improved semi-analytical solution for stress at round-tip notches | journal= Engineering Fracture Mechanics | year=2015 | volume=149| pages=134\u2013143 |url= http://drgan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/032_EFM_2015.pdf | doi= 10.1016/j.engfracmech.2015.10.004 }}</ref>\n\n::<math>a_\\text{eff}=a+\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\frac{K}{\\sigma_{YS}}\\right)^2</math>\n\nIrwin's approach leads to an iterative solution as K itself is a function of crack length.\n\nThe other method, namely the secant method, uses the compliance-crack length equation given by ASTM standard to calculate effective crack length from an effective compliance. Compliance at any point in Load vs displacement curve is essentially the reciprocal of the slope of the curve that ensues if the specimen is unloaded at that point. Now the unloading curve returns to the origin for linear elastic material but not for elastic plastic material as there is a permanent deformation. The effective compliance at a point for the elastic plastic case is taken as the slope of the line joining the point and origin( i.e the compliance if the material was an elastic one). This effective compliance is used to get an effective crack growth and the rest of the calculation follows the equation\n\n::<math>K_I=\\frac{P}{\\sqrt{W}B} f(a_\\text{eff}/W,...)</math>\n\nThe choice of plasticity correction is factored on the size of plastic zone. ASTM standard covering resistance curve suggests using Irwin's method is acceptable for small plastic zone and recommends using Secant method when crack-tip plasticity is more prominent. Also since the ASTM E 561 standard does not contain requirements on the specimen size or maximum allowable crack extension, thus the size independence of the resistance curve is not guaranteed. Few studies show that the size dependence is less detected in the experimental data for the Secant method.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Faturohman|first=Topan|date=2018-04-10|doi = 10.31237/osf.io/3ftb7|title = Peranan Pramusaji Dalam Meningkatkan Kepuasan Tamu di Saffron Restoran Four Points by Sheraton Hotel Bandung}}</ref>\n\n=== Determination of J<sub>IC</sub> ===\nStrain energy release rate per unit fracture surface area is calculated by J-integral method which is a contour path integral around the crack tip where the path begins and ends on either crack surfaces. J-toughness value signifies the resistance of the material in terms of amount of stress energy required for a crack to grow.  J<sub>IC</sub> toughness value is measured for elastic-plastic materials. Now the single-valued J<sub>IC</sub> is determined as the toughness near the onset of the ductile crack extension( effect of strain hardening is not important). The test is performed with multiple specimen loading each of the specimen to various levels and unloading. This gives the crack mouth opening compliance which is to be used to get crack length with the help of relationships given in ASTM standard E 1820, which covers the J-integral testing.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/resolver.cgi?E1820-01|title=Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fracture Toughness|website=www.astm.org|doi=10.1520/e1820-01|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> Another way of measuring crack growth is to mark the specimen with heat tinting or fatigue cracking. The specimen is eventually broken apart and the crack extension is measured with the help of the marks.\n\nThe test thus performed yields several Load vs Crack Mouth Opening Displacement (CMOD) curve, which are used to calculate J as following:-\n\n::<math>J=J_{el}+J_{pl}</math>\n\nThe linear elastic J is calculated using\n\n<math>J_{el}=\\frac{K^2\\left(1-\\nu^2\\right)}{E}</math>and K is determined from <math>K_I=\\frac{P}{\\sqrt{WBB_N}} f(a/W,...)</math>where B<sub>N</sub> is the net thickness for side-grooved specimen and equal to B for not side-grooved specimen\n\nThe elastic plastic J is calculated using\n\n::<math>J_{pl}=\\frac{\\eta A_{pl}}{B_Nb_o}</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\eta</math>=2 for SENB specimen\n\nb<sub>o</sub> is initial ligament length given by the difference between width and initial crack length\n\nA<sub>Pl</sub> is the plastic area under the load-displacement curve.\n\nSpecialized data reduction technique is used to get a provisional J<sub>Q</sub>.

This type of test requires a smaller specimen, and can, therefore, be used for a wider range of product forms. The tear test can also be used for very ductile aluminium alloys (e.g. 1100, 3003), where linear elastic fracture mechanics do not apply.\n\n=== Standard test methods ===\nThe real-world consequence of the failure of materials by fracture has motivated a variety of organizations throughout the world to publish standardized procedures for fracture toughness measurements, namely [[ASTM International|ASTM]], [[BSI Group|BSI]], ISO, JSME. \n\n*ASTM C1161 Test Method for Flexural Strength of Advanced Ceramics at Ambient Temperature\n*ASTM C1322 Practice for Fractography and Characterization of Fracture Origins in Advanced Ceramics\n*ASTM E4 Practices for Force Verification of Testing Machines\n*ASTM E112 Test Methods for Determining Average Grain Size\n*ASTM E177 Practice for Use of the Terms Precision and Bias in ASTM Test Methods\n*ASTM E337 Test Method for Measuring Humidity with a Psychrometer (the Measurement of Wet- and Dry-Bulb Temperatures)\n*ASTM E399 Test Method for Plane-strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic Materials \n*ASTM E691 Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method\n*ASTM E740 Practice for Fracture Testing with Surface-Crack Tension Specimens\n*ASTM E1823 Terminology Relating to Fatigue and Fracture Testing\n*IEEE/ASTM SI 10 Standard for Use of the International System of Units (SI) (The Modern Metric System)<ref>NIST SRM 2100 Fracture Toughness of Ceramics</ref>\n*ISO 28079:2009, the [[Palmqvist method]], used to determine the fracture toughness for [[cemented carbide]]s.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44495 ISO 28079:2009, Palmqvist toughness test], Retrieved 22 January 2016</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n*[[Brittle-ductile transition zone]]\n*[[Charpy impact test]]\n*[[Impact (mechanics)]]\n*[[Izod impact strength test]]\n*[[Puncture resistance]]\n*[[Shock (mechanics)]]\n*[[Three point flexural test#Fracture toughness testing|Three point flexural fracture toughness testing]]\n*[[Ceramography#Microindention hardness and toughness|Toughness of ceramics by indentation]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Anderson, T L., ''Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications'' (CRC Press, Boston 1995).\n*Davidge, R.

{"title_page": "Quartal and quintal harmony", "text_new": "{{short description|Types of harmonic structures in music}}\n{{redirects|Fourth chord||Eleventh chord#Fourth}}\n\nIn [[music]], '''quartal harmony''' is the building of [[Harmony|harmonic]] structures built from the [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of the [[perfect fourth]], the [[tritone|augmented fourth]] and the [[diminished fourth]]. For instance, a three-note quartal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fourths, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}. \n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1\n} }\n</score>\n\n'''Quintal harmony''' is harmonic structure preferring the [[perfect fifth]], the [[augmented fifth]] and the [[tritone|diminished fifth]].

Listeners familiar with music of the (European) [[common practice period]] perceive [[tonality|tonal]] music as that which uses [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[musical scale|scales]], wherein both the [[major third]] and [[minor third]] constitute the basic ''structural elements'' of the harmony. \n\nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] writes that:\n{{quote|Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals ([[Diminished seventh chord|diminished seventh chords]] or [[Augmented triad|augmented triads]]), any member can function as the [[Root (chord)|root]]. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of [[Key (music)|key]] verification upon the [[Part (music)|voice]] with the most active melodic line. {{harv|Persichetti|1961|loc=94}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n''Quintal harmony'' (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] or [[Complement (music)|complement]] of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from ''quartal harmony''. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\n\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}, can be written as<blockquote><score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1 <f bes c> <bes c f> <f bes c f>\n} }\n</score></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance.  During the [[common practice period]] (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] (when appearing as a [[Suspension (music)|suspension]] requiring resolution in the [[voice leading]]) or as a [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord).  In the later 19th century, during the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|breakdown of tonality]] in [[classical music]], all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed.  Quartal harmony was developed in the early [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[Tristan chord]] is made up of the notes F{{music|natural}}, B{{music|natural}}, D{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} and is the first chord heard in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.  \n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n                \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n                \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\< f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\> d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red <f b>2.( <e gis>4.)~ <e gis>8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant.  The chord had been found in earlier works ({{harvnb|Vogel|1962|loc=12}}), notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 18 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 18]], but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional [[tonal harmony]] and even towards [[atonality]], and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its [[Functional harmony|function]], a notion which was soon after to be explored by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and others ({{harvnb|Erickson|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=June 2012}}).  \n\nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary [[dominant seventh]] chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony.

In his ''Theory of Harmony'' (''Harmonielehre'') of 1911, he wrote:\n{{quote|The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]]; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords\u2026 But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony. {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=406\u2013407}}}}\n\nFor [[Anton Webern]], the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds.

In his 1937 writing ''Unterweisung im Tonsatz'' (''The Craft of Musical Composition'', {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937}}), he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\"<!--- (\u201edass die T\u00f6ne eine Familienzugeh\u00f6rigkeit besitzen, die sich in der Bindung an tonale Hauptt\u00f6ne \u00e4u\u00dfert, die eine unzweideutige Rangliste der Tonverwandschaften aufstellt.\u201c)---> so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"\u2026the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\"<!--- (\u201e... der Musiker ist an ihn gebunden, wie der Maler an die prim\u00e4ren Farben, der Architekt an die drei Dimensionen.\u201c)---> He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its [[Combination tone]]s.\"<!--- (\u201eDas st\u00e4rkste und eindeutige harmonische Intervall ist n\u00e4chst der alleinstehenden  Oktave die Quinte, das sch\u00f6nste jedoch die Terz wegen ihrer in den Kombinationst\u00f6nen begr\u00fcndeten Akkordwirkung.\u201c)--->\n\n[[Image:Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.png|thumb|center|378x378px|Quartal harmony in Hindemith's Flute Sonata, II with tonal center on B established by descent in left hand in [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and repeated B's and F{{music|sharp}}'s {{harv|Kostka, Payne, and Alm\u00e9n|2013|loc=Chapter twenty six: Materials and techniques, Chord structures, Quartal and secundal harmony, 469\u201370<!--  Meaningful subheadings simplify reference in translations and other editions (p. 498 in third ed.) -->}} {{Audio|Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.mid|Play}}|alt=]]The works of the Filipino composer [[Eliseo M.

In the first movement of his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.\n\n===Jazz===\nThe style of jazz, having an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] harmonic orbit, was in its [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|early days]] overtaken (until perhaps the [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] of the 1930s) by the vocabulary of 19th-century European music.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}<!--This makes almost no sense at all.

Jazz musicians had a clear interest in harmonic richness of colour, for which quartal harmony provided possibilities, as used by [[pianist]]s and [[arranger]]s like [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Bill Evans]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Milt Buckner]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Chick Corea]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) [[Herbie Hancock]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) and especially [[McCoy Tyner]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=205}}).\n\n[[Image:II V I for wikipedia.png|thumb|right|275px|The [[II-V-I progression|ii\u2013V\u2013I cadence]] {{audio|II V9 I.MID|Play}}; the fourth-suspension or [[sus chord]] {{audio|II V9sus I.MID|Play}}]]\n\n[[Image:SenorBlues.png|thumb|380px|A typical [[hard bop]] brass part, from [[Horace Silver]]'s \"Se\u00f1or Blues\"]]\n\nThe [[hard bop]] of the 1950s made new applications of quartal harmony accessible to jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Quintet]] writing in which two brass instruments (commonly trumpet and saxophone) may proceed in fourths, while the piano (as a uniquely harmonic instrument) lays down chords, but sparsely, only hinting at the intended harmony.

Thin-sounding unison bebop horn sections occur frequently, but these are balanced by bouts of very refined [[polyphony]] such as is found in [[cool jazz]].\n\n[[File:So What chord.png|thumb|100px|The [[So What chord|\"So What\" chord]] uses three intervals of a fourth.]]\n\nOn his watershed record ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', [[Miles Davis]] with pianist [[Bill Evans]] used a chord consisting of three perfect fourth intervals and a major third on the composition \"[[So What (composition)|So What]]\". This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a [[So What chord]], and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom {{harv|Levine|1989|loc=97}}.\n\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist [[McCoy Tyner]]'s work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. [[Oliver Nelson]] was also known for his use of fourth chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] {{harv|Corozine|2002|loc=12}}.

Jazz guitarists cited as using modern quartal harmony include [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] (especially [[Sonny Rollins]]'s ''[[The Bridge (Sonny Rollins album)|The Bridge]]''), [[George Benson]] (\"Skydive\"), [[Pat Martino]], [[Jack Wilkins]] (\"Windows\"), [[Joe Diorio]], [[Howard Roberts]] (\"Impressions\"), [[Kenny Burrell]] (\"So What\"), [[Wes Montgomery]] (\"Little Sunflower\"), [[Henry Johnson (guitarist)|Henry Johnson]], [[Russell Malone]], [[Jimmy Bruno]], [[Howard Alden]], [[Paul Bollenback]], [[Mark Whitfield]], and [[Rodney Jones (guitarist)|Rodney Jones]] {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nQuartal harmony was also explored as a possibility under new experimental [[Scale (music)|scale]] models as they were \"discovered\" by jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Musicians began to work extensively with the so-called [[Mode (music)|church modes]] of old European music, and they became firmly situated in their compositional process. Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Chick Corea]] are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as [[free jazz]] also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use due to the wandering nature of its harmony.\n\n[[Image:Maiden Voyage2.png|thumb|center|400px|Fourths in Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}]]\n\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\n\n[[Image:Quartal voicings.png|thumb|center|400px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] with fourth voicings: all chords are in fourth voicings {{audio|Quartal voicings.mid|Play}}; They are often ambiguous as, for example, the Dm11 and G9sus chords are here voiced identically and will thus be distinguished for the listener by the [[root (chord)|root]] movement of the [[bassist]] {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=94}}]]\n\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=95}}.\n\n===Rock music===\n[[image:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|Disliking the sound of thirds (in equal-temperament tuning), Robert Fripp builds chords with perfect intervals in his new&nbsp;standard tuning.]]\n{{See also|Progressive rock|Symphonic rock}}\n\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by [[Robert Fripp]], who has described himself as the <!-- self-described.

Listeners familiar with music of the (European) [[common practice period]] perceive [[tonality|tonal]] music as that which uses [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[musical scale|scales]], wherein both the [[major third]] and [[minor third]] constitute the basic ''structural elements'' of the harmony. \n\nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] writes that:\n{{quote|Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals ([[Diminished seventh chord|diminished seventh chords]] or [[Augmented triad|augmented triads]]), any member can function as the [[Root (chord)|root]]. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of [[Key (music)|key]] verification upon the [[Part (music)|voice]] with the most active melodic line. {{harv|Persichetti|1961|loc=94}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n''Quintal harmony'' (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] or [[Complement (music)|complement]] of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from ''quartal harmony''. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\n\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}, can be written as<blockquote><score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1 <f bes c> <bes c f> <f bes c f>\n} }\n</score></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance.  During the [[common practice period]] (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] (when appearing as a [[Suspension (music)|suspension]] requiring resolution in the [[voice leading]]) or as a [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord).  In the later 19th century, during the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|breakdown of tonality]] in [[classical music]], all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed.  Quartal harmony was developed in the early [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[Tristan chord]] is made up of the notes F{{music|natural}}, B{{music|natural}}, D{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} and is the first chord heard in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.  \n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n                \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n                \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\< f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\> d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red <f b>2.( <e gis>4.)~ <e gis>8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant.  The chord had been found in earlier works ({{harvnb|Vogel|1962|loc=12}}), notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 18 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 18]], but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional [[tonal harmony]] and even towards [[atonality]], and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its [[Functional harmony|function]], a notion which was soon after to be explored by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and others ({{harvnb|Erickson|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=June 2012}}).  \n\nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary [[dominant seventh]] chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his [[Mystic chord]] (shown below) in his [[Piano Sonata No. 6 (Scriabin)|Piano Sonata No. 6]]. \n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c fis bes e a d>1\n} }\n</score>\n\nScriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional [[tertian]] passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D) into a seven-note chord (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G). Scriabin's sketches for his unfinished work ''[[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'' show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] {{harv|Morrison|1998|loc=316}}.<!-- image may be allowed for this article only: see the licensing question on its page -->\n\nIn France, [[Erik Satie]] experimented with [[Parallel harmony|planing]] in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for ''[[Le Fils des \u00e9toiles]]'' {{harv|Solomon|2003}}. [[Paul Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to \"rise and rise\". \n===20th- and 21st-century classical music===\nComposers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include [[Claude Debussy]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Herder|1987|loc=78}}.\n\n==== Schoenberg ====\n[[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1|Chamber Symphony Op. 9]] (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measures construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013A{{music|flat}} distributed over several instruments.\n\n[[Image:SchoenbergOp9.png|thumb|280x280px|Vertical quartal-harmony in the opening measures of Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9 {{audio|SchoenbergOp9.mid|Play}}|alt=|center]]\n\n[[Image:Sch\u00f6nberg Kammersymhonie 9 for wikipedia.png|thumb|250x250px|Six-note horizontal fourth chord in Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9|alt=]]\n\nThe composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSchoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his ''Theory of Harmony'' (''Harmonielehre'') of 1911, he wrote:\n{{quote|The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]]; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords\u2026 But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony. {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=406\u2013407}}}}\n\nFor [[Anton Webern]], the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote \"You must write something like that, too!\" ({{harvnb|Webern|1963|loc=48}}; \"So was mu\u00dft du auch machen!\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}<!--Source for the German text needed.-->)\n\n==== Others ====\nIn his ''Theory of Harmony'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=407}}: \"Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and [[Alban Berg]] have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] or the Viennese [[Franz Schreker]], who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], are not far off.\"<!--- (\u201eAu\u00dfer mir haben meine Sch\u00fcler Dr. Anton Webern und Alban Berg solche Kl\u00e4nge [gemeint sind Quartenkl\u00e4nge] geschrieben.

In his 1937 writing ''Unterweisung im Tonsatz'' (''The Craft of Musical Composition'', {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937}}), he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\"<!--- (\u201edass die T\u00f6ne eine Familienzugeh\u00f6rigkeit besitzen, die sich in der Bindung an tonale Hauptt\u00f6ne \u00e4u\u00dfert, die eine unzweideutige Rangliste der Tonverwandschaften aufstellt.\u201c)---> so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"\u2026the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\"<!--- (\u201e... der Musiker ist an ihn gebunden, wie der Maler an die prim\u00e4ren Farben, der Architekt an die drei Dimensionen.\u201c)---> He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its [[Combination tone]]s.\"<!--- (\u201eDas st\u00e4rkste und eindeutige harmonische Intervall ist n\u00e4chst der alleinstehenden  Oktave die Quinte, das sch\u00f6nste jedoch die Terz wegen ihrer in den Kombinationst\u00f6nen begr\u00fcndeten Akkordwirkung.\u201c)--->\n\n[[Image:Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.png|thumb|center|378x378px|Quartal harmony in Hindemith's Flute Sonata, II with tonal center on B established by descent in left hand in [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and repeated B's and F{{music|sharp}}'s {{harv|Kostka, Payne, and Alm\u00e9n|2013|loc=Chapter twenty six: Materials and techniques, Chord structures, Quartal and secundal harmony, 469\u201370<!--  Meaningful subheadings simplify reference in translations and other editions (p. 498 in third ed.) -->}} {{Audio|Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.mid|Play}}|alt=]]The works of the Filipino composer [[Eliseo M.

In the first movement of his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.\n\n===Jazz===\nThe style of jazz, having an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] harmonic orbit, was in its [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|early days]] overtaken (until perhaps the [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] of the 1930s) by the vocabulary of 19th-century European music.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}<!--This makes almost no sense at all.

Jazz musicians had a clear interest in harmonic richness of colour, for which quartal harmony provided possibilities, as used by [[pianist]]s and [[arranger]]s like [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Bill Evans]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Milt Buckner]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Chick Corea]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) [[Herbie Hancock]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) and especially [[McCoy Tyner]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=205}}).\n\n[[Image:II V I for wikipedia.png|thumb|right|275px|The [[II-V-I progression|ii\u2013V\u2013I cadence]] {{audio|II V9 I.MID|Play}}; the fourth-suspension or [[sus chord]] {{audio|II V9sus I.MID|Play}}]]\n\n[[Image:SenorBlues.png|thumb|380px|A typical [[hard bop]] brass part, from [[Horace Silver]]'s \"Se\u00f1or Blues\"]]\n\nThe [[hard bop]] of the 1950s made new applications of quartal harmony accessible to jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Quintet]] writing in which two brass instruments (commonly trumpet and saxophone) may proceed in fourths, while the piano (as a uniquely harmonic instrument) lays down chords, but sparsely, only hinting at the intended harmony. This style of writing, in contrast with that of the previous decade, preferred a moderate tempo. Thin-sounding unison bebop horn sections occur frequently, but these are balanced by bouts of very refined [[polyphony]] such as is found in [[cool jazz]].\n\n[[File:So What chord.png|thumb|100px|The [[So What chord|\"So What\" chord]] uses three intervals of a fourth.]]\n\nOn his watershed record ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', [[Miles Davis]] with pianist [[Bill Evans]] used a chord consisting of three perfect fourth intervals and a major third on the composition \"[[So What (composition)|So What]]\". This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a [[So What chord]], and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom {{harv|Levine|1989|loc=97}}.\n\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist [[McCoy Tyner]]'s work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. [[Oliver Nelson]] was also known for his use of fourth chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] {{harv|Corozine|2002|loc=12}}. Floyd claims that the \"foundation of 'modern quartal harmony'\" began in the era when the [[Charlie Parker]]\u2013influenced John Coltrane added classically trained pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner to his ensemble {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nJazz guitarists cited as using chord voicings using quartal harmony include [[Johnny Smith]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Chuck Wayne]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Jimmy Raney]], [[Wes Montgomery]], however all in a traditional manner, as major 9th, 13th and minor 11th chords {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}} (an octave and fourth equals an 11th). Jazz guitarists cited as using modern quartal harmony include [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] (especially [[Sonny Rollins]]'s ''[[The Bridge (Sonny Rollins album)|The Bridge]]''), [[George Benson]] (\"Skydive\"), [[Pat Martino]], [[Jack Wilkins]] (\"Windows\"), [[Joe Diorio]], [[Howard Roberts]] (\"Impressions\"), [[Kenny Burrell]] (\"So What\"), [[Wes Montgomery]] (\"Little Sunflower\"), [[Henry Johnson (guitarist)|Henry Johnson]], [[Russell Malone]], [[Jimmy Bruno]], [[Howard Alden]], [[Paul Bollenback]], [[Mark Whitfield]], and [[Rodney Jones (guitarist)|Rodney Jones]] {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nQuartal harmony was also explored as a possibility under new experimental [[Scale (music)|scale]] models as they were \"discovered\" by jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Musicians began to work extensively with the so-called [[Mode (music)|church modes]] of old European music, and they became firmly situated in their compositional process. Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Chick Corea]] are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as [[free jazz]] also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use due to the wandering nature of its harmony.\n\n[[Image:Maiden Voyage2.png|thumb|center|400px|Fourths in Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}]]\n\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\n\n[[Image:Quartal voicings.png|thumb|center|400px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] with fourth voicings: all chords are in fourth voicings {{audio|Quartal voicings.mid|Play}}; They are often ambiguous as, for example, the Dm11 and G9sus chords are here voiced identically and will thus be distinguished for the listener by the [[root (chord)|root]] movement of the [[bassist]] {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=94}}]]\n\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=95}}.\n\n===Rock music===\n[[image:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|Disliking the sound of thirds (in equal-temperament tuning), Robert Fripp builds chords with perfect intervals in his new&nbsp;standard tuning.]]\n{{See also|Progressive rock|Symphonic rock}}\n\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by [[Robert Fripp]], who has described himself as the <!-- self-described.
