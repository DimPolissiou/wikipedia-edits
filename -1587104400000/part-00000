{"title_page": "Lendrum & Hartman Limited", "text_new": "'''Lendrum & Hartman Ltd''' was a major London importer, and sole UK concessionaires of Buick and Cadillac cars from North America between 1919 and 1968.\nIt became the most prestigious car dealership in the country, having sold a Buick to the Prince of Wales, later King [[Edward VIII]] in 1935.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/15348/lot/706/|title=Bonhams : Formerly the Property of His Majesty, King Edward VIII,1936 Buick Limited Series 90 Eight Limousine Chassis no. 649990164 Engine no. 2943885|website=www.bonhams.com}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nErnest Lendrum, a self-made successful businessman and Frederick Hartman, a stockbroker invalided out of the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] met in 1917 at a [[City of London]] function, struck up a friendship realising a mutual interest in motor cars.<ref>Maud Coleno\u2019s Daughter, John Dann, Troubador, 2017, page 180</ref> They recognised the sales opportunities there would be after the First World War, particularly American cars, as the whole of British industry had been devoted to the war effort. In May 1919 they travelled to New York to secure a deal with General Motors. Their initiative was successful. [[General Motors]] had already established itself in London at [[Long Acre]] but met with variable success over the years. The persuasive businessmen had secured a deal as non-franchised importers of top General Motors brands, [[Buick]] and [[Cadillac]]. In October Ernest registered the new company Lendrum Motors Ltd, using the address of Hartman's London flat at 26b [[Albemarle Street]], London W 1.\n\nIn 1920 they acquired the General Motors old premises in Long Acre, and in 1921 moved to a better location in Mayfair, the recently vacated ground floor and basement premises of the The Mellier building at 26b Albemarle Street. They renamed it \u2018Buick House\u2019. It would be the Lendrum & Hartman Mayfair showrooms for the next thirty years. The following year General Motors announced they were seeking to appoint another agent in London. Hartman again travelled to New York, and after a series of meetings at the [[General Motors Building (Manhattan)]] on Broadway won the business. With the result Ernest Lendrum made Hartman a full partner in January 1923 creating Lendrum & Hartman Ltd. By 1927 the [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders]] announced that it had achieved 27,949 -the highest number of US imported cars to the UK. Confident that the business was developing well in the capable hands of Hartman, took on the role of silent partner and resigned in 1931. The following year the company became Buick, Cadillac, and La Salle Concessionaires.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s was a period of rapid growth for Lendrum & Hartman. Captain Hartman, (using his assumed war-time rank) was a consummate salesman and went out of his way to cultivate American executives like [[James D. Mooney]], President of General Motors Overseas, and [[Alfred P. Sloan]] General Motors President. Hartman used the 1924 [[British Empire Exhibition]] at Wembley Park, officially opened by H.M. King George V, for social and business networking. General Motors of Canada Limited took the largest space in the Canadian Pavilion receiving a visit from the Prince of Wales. It was the largest exhibition ever staged anywhere in the world and had attracted twenty-seven million visitors. By the early 1930s the Buick brand in the UK had generally become accepted as representing one of the finest examples of transatlantic design in the field of medium-priced cars. The models exported to the UK came from Canada and were badged as McLaughlin Buicks for the British market and classified as being Empire-built.\nIn the summer of 1934, Lendrum and Hartman Limited was completely reorganised, with an increased share capital, and a new director was appointed, Hartman's wife, (the former Lady Dalrymple) Mrs. Dorothea Mirabelle Cynthia Hartman.\n\nErnest Lendrum died in 1938 in Maidenhead Berkshire, and \u2018Captain\u2019 Hartman died in 1942 in Luckington Wiltshire.

The company was bequeathed to a close family friend Guy Nicholas (Nick) Vansittart, then Chairman of Vauxhall Motors, his brother was [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart]]. Nick sold it to the Lex Group in the early 1960s. Around that time Lex had bought the US franchise for Chevrolet and Oldsmobile by the acquisition of British and Colonial Motors, in St Martins Lane and the Lendrum & Hartman concessions of [[Buick]] and [[Cadillac]] fitted into their strategic plans. \nBy the end of the1960s the showroom in Albemarle Street had been closed and Lendrum & Hartman moved to Flood Street in Chelsea just off the Kings Road.

This fashionable and stylish showroom in the Beaux-Arts building in Albemarle Street was known originally as The Mellier, once the home and showroom of Charles Mellier & Co. Mellier was born in France and became a successful high quality cabinet maker and decorator, one of his most famous commissions had been for the liner, [[RMS Mauretania (1906)]]. They renamed it \u2018Buick House\u2019 and from 1923 it remained the Lendrum & Hartman Mayfair showrooms for the next thirty years. After the company was sold, the showroom was closed in the late 1960s. Today the building renamed The Mellier again, has been transformed by architect [[Eric Parry]] from commercial use into apartments with spectacular penthouse.\n\n== Willesden works ==\nIn 1921 the company took a new lease on the facilities at Old Oak Lane in Willesden, originally the Bedford Motors assembly plant, which became the \u2018Buick Works\u2019 for servicing and maintenance. From the very early days Lendrum & Hartman had specialised bodies built on Buick chassis. In the 1920s the most popular were two-seater coupes with dickey seats, built by Page & Hunt of Farnborough, Surrey. It was one of these that the artist [[Augustus John]] had acquired in exchange for a picture.<ref name=\"Augustus John 2011, pages 447-8\">Augustus John, Michael Holroyd, Pimlico, 2011, pages 447-8</ref> The limousines version was usually by [[Vanden Plas]] of Brussels. The chassis were shipped from the London docks and they returned finished to Harwich, several at a time, escorted by the Lendrum & Hartman Belgium representative.<br>\nHartman recruited well, his choice of Merle Gates Armstrong from Noyes Buick in Boston in 1924, to run the London servicing operation, proved a success, assisted by Ted Taylor, his under-manager, who had previously been employed by [[General Motors]], and a popular Canadian, Bob Berryman, headed the Reception Department. Hartman had initiated a new-car delivery service and Berryman's team was instructed to show anyone interested over the Buick Service Department without prior appointment, all innovative business practices at the time.\nBy 1929 the Old Oak Lane in Willesden the service depot for Buick, Cadillac and La Salle cars was now covering 114,000 square foot and employing over two-hundred personnel, with a wide range of skills on the premises. These included blacksmiths, welders, trimmers and upholsterers, machine shops, paint shops and a spare-parts department. This coordinated approach was a very unusual and advanced for the 1920s. In the 1930s the facility was handling over 12,000 cars a year. <br>\nWhen war was declared in 1939, the Old Oak Lane service complex was given over to military repairs. Just after the Dunkirk evacuations in 1940 Captain Hartman had seized the publicity opportunity of presenting General [[Charles de Gaulle]] with a Buick limousine on his arrival in England. Amongst the work carried out during the war included, Admiral Sir [[Max Horton]] VC, Commander in Chief Western Approaches, Exiled King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]], Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile, and the Russian Ambassador, [[Ivan Maisky]]. With the arrival of the first American Forces in January 1942 the works were instructed to prepare a bullet-proof car for the use of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. This was done, using armour plate inside the doors, flooring, roof, as well as special Triplex glass and Dunlop tyres.\n\n== Royal connection ==\nEdward, Prince of Wales had visited Canada in 1927, and used a lavishly outfitted McLaughlin Buick, [[McLaughlin Motor Car Company]] that appears to have sparked his affection for the company's products. In the summer of 1935, the Prince of Wales arrived unannounced at the showrooms of Lendrum & Hartman and ordered a customized McLaughlin Buick, that would give two passengers luxury and privacy, specifications to include drinks cabinets, vanity mirrors, reading lights, correspondence facilities, radio, smoker's cabinet, jewellery cabinet, compartments for canteen and luncheon trays, and a drawer to accommodate London telephone directories.<ref name=\"auto\"/><br>\nCaptain Hartman was called from a local hairdresser [[Truefitt & Hill]] in Bond Street, to personally attend to his Royal client. The works manager, Ted Taylor, was sent to visit the Prince at [[York House, St James's Palace]] to take instructions on the requirements of the client. Taylor was then sent to General Motors Canada, at [[Oshawa]], in Ontario, to supervise the building of two cars ordered, one the main car, the other a back-up. The choice of these Buicks was said to have been made by Mrs. Simpson. The car was delivered to the King at St James's Palace in February the following year. Fred Kirk who worked for Lendrum & Hartman was seconded to King Edward VIII as his private chauffeur when the King bought these customised Buicks. He drove Edward and Mrs Simpson throughout 1936 including the last visit to [[Windsor Castle]] to make his abdication speech. He accompanied the king to France in December 1936 before his exile in Paris.<br>\nThe car with registration CUL 421, was sold at auction by [[Bonhams]] in London for more than \u00a3100,000 in 2007. It had clocked up 42,827 miles, and included many original fittings, including two silver gilt cigarette boxes, a silver jewellery box, six silver top decanters and two posy holders. The documents include the original logbook, stating the first owner to be H.M. The King, St James's Palace, SW1, and an album of photographs of the car to the point when it was handed over to the King.\n\n== Distinguished customers ==\nLendrum & Hartman, under Captain Hartman's direction, had become \u2018the\u2019 car dealership in England, boosted enormously by royal association. By the early 1930s the Buick brand in the UK had generally become accepted as representing one of the finest examples of transatlantic design in the field of medium-priced cars. The models exported to the UK came from Canada and were badged as McLaughlin Buicks for the British market and classified as being Empire-built. Buick cars became the \u2018must haves\u2019 for leading businesspeople, as well as theatricals and celebrities. Apart from the King Edward VIII (Duke of Windsor) and his friend Mrs Wallis Simpson, customers included:\n\n* Lady Patricia Ramsey, granddaughter of Queen Victoria, was over six-foot, so had the body built especially high in order that she could enter and alight gracefully <ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-1980/122/buick-by-gones|title=BUICK BY-GONES|website=Motor Sport Magazine}}</ref>\n* \t[[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]\n* \tThomas Edward Anson, fourth [[Earl of Lichfield]]\n* \tLady Brownlow, wife of [[Peregrine Cust, 6th Baron Brownlow]], closely linked with Wallis Simpson's circle (out of royal favour after the abdication)\n* \tThe Honourable Mrs Charles Greville, wife of [[Charles Greville, 3rd Baron Greville]] a British society hostess and philanthropist\n* \t[[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort]] and Master of The Beaufort Hunt in Badminton\n* \t[[Henry Pelham-Clinton-Hope, 9th Duke of Newcastle]] styled Earl of Lincoln from 1928 to 1941, was a British peer and aviator\n* Sir David Dalrymple, Dorothy Hartman's ex second husband\n*[[Henry Gage, 6th Viscount Gage]], Chairman of Southdown Hunt in Sussex <ref>Maud Coleno's Daughter, John Dann, Troubador, 2017, page 204</ref>\n* \tSir [[Arthur Ernest Guinness]], bought a custom-built V16 Cadillac, exhibited at London Motor Show in 1930 before delivery <ref>Maud Coleno\u2019s Daughter, John Dann, \n       Troubador, 2017, page 192</ref>\n* \t[[Augustus John]], Welsh painter <ref name=\"Augustus John 2011, pages 447-8\"/>\n* \t[[Gracie Fields]], actress, singer and comedienne\n* \t[[George Formby]], actor, singer-songwriter and comedian\n* \t[[Firth Shephard]], a London theatrical impresario\n* \t[[Diana Dors]], English film actress and singer \n* \t[[Raymond Bessone]], known as Mr Teasy-Weasy, Britain's first celebrity hairdresser in the post war years (he trained [[Vidal Sassoon]])\n* \t[[Jack Hylton]], [[Jack Payne (bandleader)]] and [[Edmundo Ros]], leading dance band leaders \n* \tSir [[John Moores (British businessman)]] and philanthropist who founded Littlewoods retail company\n* \t[[Barbara Hutton]], an American socialite, heiress and philanthropist, during her brief stay at the Savoy in London\n* \t[[Whitney Straight]], Grand Prix motor racing driver, a distinguished Air Commodore and deputy chairman of [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC)\n* \tSir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], architect of Liverpool Cathedral, Waterloo Bridge, Battersea Power Station, and the iconic red telephone box\n* \tSir [[Jack Cohen (businessman)]], a grocer who founded the Tesco supermarket chain\n* \tthe [[Cartier (jeweler)]] family of Bond Street, Royal Warrant holder since 1921\n* \t[[Sir John Ellerman, 1st Baronet]], English ship-owner, once considered one of the wealthiest men in England\n* \tAdmiral Sir [[Max Horton]] VC, who was Commander in Chief Western Approaches <ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n* \t[[Ian Fleming]], Author and Journalist, who as a young man working for [[Reuters]] was a L&H Buick sports car fan <ref>Ian Fleming, Andrew Lycett, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1995, chapter two, page 51</ref>\n\n== \u2018Concours d'El\u00e9gance\u2019 ==\nDuring the thirties Captain Hartman would \u2018showcase\u2019 his company cars by entering many of his personal Cadillacs in various [[Concours d'Elegance]] events at home and abroad where he won many premier awards.<ref>Maud Coleno\u2019s Daughter, John Dann, Troubador, 2017, page 205</ref> These cars were serviced and maintained by his works at Old Oak Lane, in Willesden. These events, essentially \u2018beauty contests\u2019 for automobiles flourished in Europe, particularly France during the interwar period, emerging in 1920s Paris in the Bois de Boulogne and resort cities like Le Touquet in the north and on the Riviera, and continued until the onset of the war. Organized by French newspapers [[L'Auto-Journal]] and [[L'Intransigeant]] and the journal [[F\u00e9mina]], ([[Lady Diana Cooper]] once briefly edited the English edition in the twenties) the idea in the early days was to mix models in haute couture with a parade of various elegant cars, later actresses and celebrities took part. It continues as the Annual European Concours d\u2019Elegance.\n\n== London Motor Shows ==\nThe first British Motor Show organised by the [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders]] (SMMT) was held at Crystal Palace, London in 1903, the same year that the speed limit was raised from 14 miles per hour to 20 miles per hour by the Motor Car Act 1903. After the 1903 event it moved to Olympia in London, where it was held for the next 32 years before moving to [[Earl's Court Exhibition Centre]], London from 1937 until 1976, except for the period of World War II during which time where were no shows.\nThe London Motor Show in 1955 took place at Earls Court in October. That year [[General Motors]] announced from its Lendrum & Hartman stand, it had been the best year for Buick sales ever, with over 738,800 sold. One of the star exhibits was a display model of the Cadillac \u2018La Espada\u2019 -the only one built for exhibition purposes, there was no price tag, but it was insured for thirty-five thousand dollars.<ref>Maud Coleno\u2019s Daughter, John Dann, Toubador, 2017, page 317</ref>\n\n== Creative Advertising ==\nHartman was a salesman with a love of cars, and a member of the [[Royal Automobile Club]] in Pall Mall. One of his early advertising stunts during the 1920s included a couple dancing the Charleston on the roof of a Buick saloon while it was being driven in London's Kingsway. (An original film clip of this event is used to introduce the P. G. Wodehouse BBC TV comedy series.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoUmGfLiamw</ref> The World of Wooster 1965\u201367). Another, to prove the durability of an L&H Buick, it was driven up a long flight of stairs in the grounds of the Crystal Palace.<ref>Russell Johns article about his life with Lendrum & Hartman in MotorSport Magazine, October 1980 (pages 1560-62, 1580)</ref>\n\n== Film associations ==\n* 1920s, Huntley Film Archives [[John Huntley (film historian)]] Ref: 1096286, Category: London, Decade: 1920, Sound: Mute, Colour: Film - B/W London streets after the war (WW1).

In May 1919 they travelled to New York to secure a deal with General Motors. Their initiative was successful. [[General Motors]] had already established itself in London at [[Long Acre]] but met with variable success over the years. The persuasive businessmen had secured a deal as non-franchised importers of top General Motors brands, [[Buick]] and [[Cadillac]]. In October Ernest registered the new company Lendrum Motors Ltd, using the address of Hartman's London flat at 26b [[Albemarle Street]], London W 1.\n\nIn 1920 they acquired the General Motors old premises in Long Acre, and in 1921 moved to a better location in Mayfair, the recently vacated ground floor and basement premises of the The Mellier building at 26b Albemarle Street. They renamed it \u2018Buick House\u2019. It would be the Lendrum & Hartman Mayfair showrooms for the next thirty years. The following year General Motors announced they were seeking to appoint another agent in London. Hartman again travelled to New York, and after a series of meetings at the [[General Motors Building (Manhattan)]] on Broadway won the business. With the result Ernest Lendrum made Hartman a full partner in January 1923 creating Lendrum & Hartman Ltd. By 1927 the [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders]] announced that it had achieved 27,949 -the highest number of US imported cars to the UK. Confident that the business was developing well in the capable hands of Hartman, took on the role of silent partner and resigned in 1931. The following year the company became Buick, Cadillac, and La Salle Concessionaires.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s was a period of rapid growth for Lendrum & Hartman. Captain Hartman, (using his assumed war-time rank) was a consummate salesman and went out of his way to cultivate American executives like [[James D. Mooney]], President of General Motors Overseas, and [[Alfred P. Sloan]] General Motors President. Hartman used the 1924 [[British Empire Exhibition]] at Wembley Park, officially opened by H.M. King George V, for social and business networking. General Motors of Canada Limited took the largest space in the Canadian Pavilion receiving a visit from the Prince of Wales. It was the largest exhibition ever staged anywhere in the world and had attracted twenty-seven million visitors.

Taylor was then sent to General Motors Canada, at [[Oshawa]], in Ontario, to supervise the building of two cars ordered, one the main car, the other a back-up. The choice of these Buicks was said to have been made by Mrs. Simpson. The car was delivered to the King at St James's Palace in February the following year. Fred Kirk who worked for Lendrum & Hartman was seconded to King Edward VIII as his private chauffeur when the King bought these customised Buicks. He drove Edward and Mrs Simpson throughout 1936 including the last visit to [[Windsor Castle]] to make his abdication speech. He accompanied the king to France in December 1936 before his exile in Paris.<br>\nThe car with registration CUL 421, was sold at auction by [[Bonhams]] in London for more than \u00a3100,000 in 2007. It had clocked up 42,827 miles, and included many original fittings, including two silver gilt cigarette boxes, a silver jewellery box, six silver top decanters and two posy holders. The documents include the original logbook, stating the first owner to be H.M. The King, St James's Palace, SW1, and an album of photographs of the car to the point when it was handed over to the King.\n\n== Distinguished customers ==\nLendrum & Hartman, under Captain Hartman's direction, had become \u2018the\u2019 car dealership in England, boosted enormously by royal association. By the early 1930s the Buick brand in the UK had generally become accepted as representing one of the finest examples of transatlantic design in the field of medium-priced cars. The models exported to the UK came from Canada and were badged as McLaughlin Buicks for the British market and classified as being Empire-built. Buick cars became the \u2018must haves\u2019 for leading businesspeople, as well as theatricals and celebrities. Apart from the King Edward VIII (Duke of Windsor) and his friend Mrs Wallis Simpson, customers included:\n\n* Lady Patricia Ramsey, granddaughter of Queen Victoria, was over six-foot, so had the body built especially high in order that she could enter and alight gracefully <ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-1980/122/buick-by-gones|title=BUICK BY-GONES|website=Motor Sport Magazine}}</ref>\n* \t[[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]\n* \tThomas Edward Anson, fourth [[Earl of Lichfield]]\n* \tLady Brownlow, wife of [[Peregrine Cust, 6th Baron Brownlow]], closely linked with Wallis Simpson's circle (out of royal favour after the abdication)\n* \tThe Honourable Mrs Charles Greville, wife of [[Charles Greville, 3rd Baron Greville]] a British society hostess and philanthropist\n* \t[[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort]] and Master of The Beaufort Hunt in Badminton\n* \t[[Henry Pelham-Clinton-Hope, 9th Duke of Newcastle]] styled Earl of Lincoln from 1928 to 1941, was a British peer and aviator\n* Sir David Dalrymple, Dorothy Hartman's ex second husband\n*[[Henry Gage, 6th Viscount Gage]], Chairman of Southdown Hunt in Sussex <ref>Maud Coleno's Daughter, John Dann, Troubador, 2017, page 204</ref>\n* \tSir [[Arthur Ernest Guinness]], bought a custom-built V16 Cadillac, exhibited at London Motor Show in 1930 before delivery <ref>Maud Coleno\u2019s Daughter, John Dann, \n       Troubador, 2017, page 192</ref>\n* \t[[Augustus John]], Welsh painter <ref name=\"Augustus John 2011, pages 447-8\"/>\n* \t[[Gracie Fields]], actress, singer and comedienne\n* \t[[George Formby]], actor, singer-songwriter and comedian\n* \t[[Firth Shephard]], a London theatrical impresario\n* \t[[Diana Dors]], English film actress and singer \n* \t[[Raymond Bessone]], known as Mr Teasy-Weasy, Britain's first celebrity hairdresser in the post war years (he trained [[Vidal Sassoon]])\n* \t[[Jack Hylton]], [[Jack Payne (bandleader)]] and [[Edmundo Ros]], leading dance band leaders \n* \tSir [[John Moores (British businessman)]] and philanthropist who founded Littlewoods retail company\n* \t[[Barbara Hutton]], an American socialite, heiress and philanthropist, during her brief stay at the Savoy in London\n* \t[[Whitney Straight]], Grand Prix motor racing driver, a distinguished Air Commodore and deputy chairman of [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC)\n* \tSir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], architect of Liverpool Cathedral, Waterloo Bridge, Battersea Power Station, and the iconic red telephone box\n* \tSir [[Jack Cohen (businessman)]], a grocer who founded the Tesco supermarket chain\n* \tthe [[Cartier (jeweler)]] family of Bond Street, Royal Warrant holder since 1921\n* \t[[Sir John Ellerman, 1st Baronet]], English ship-owner, once considered one of the wealthiest men in England\n* \tAdmiral Sir [[Max Horton]] VC, who was Commander in Chief Western Approaches <ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n* \t[[Ian Fleming]], Author and Journalist, who as a young man working for [[Reuters]] was a L&H Buick sports car fan <ref>Ian Fleming, Andrew Lycett, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1995, chapter two, page 51</ref>\n\n== \u2018Concours d'El\u00e9gance\u2019 ==\nDuring the thirties Captain Hartman would \u2018showcase\u2019 his company cars by entering many of his personal Cadillacs in various [[Concours d'Elegance]] events at home and abroad where he won many premier awards.<ref>Maud Coleno\u2019s Daughter, John Dann, Troubador, 2017, page 205</ref> These cars were serviced and maintained by his works at Old Oak Lane, in Willesden. These events, essentially \u2018beauty contests\u2019 for automobiles flourished in Europe, particularly France during the interwar period, emerging in 1920s Paris in the Bois de Boulogne and resort cities like Le Touquet in the north and on the Riviera, and continued until the onset of the war. Organized by French newspapers [[L'Auto-Journal]] and [[L'Intransigeant]] and the journal [[F\u00e9mina]], ([[Lady Diana Cooper]] once briefly edited the English edition in the twenties) the idea in the early days was to mix models in haute couture with a parade of various elegant cars, later actresses and celebrities took part. It continues as the Annual European Concours d\u2019Elegance.\n\n== London Motor Shows ==\nThe first British Motor Show organised by the [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders]] (SMMT) was held at Crystal Palace, London in 1903, the same year that the speed limit was raised from 14 miles per hour to 20 miles per hour by the Motor Car Act 1903. After the 1903 event it moved to Olympia in London, where it was held for the next 32 years before moving to [[Earl's Court Exhibition Centre]], London from 1937 until 1976, except for the period of World War II during which time where were no shows.\nThe London Motor Show in 1955 took place at Earls Court in October. That year [[General Motors]] announced from its Lendrum & Hartman stand, it had been the best year for Buick sales ever, with over 738,800 sold. One of the star exhibits was a display model of the Cadillac \u2018La Espada\u2019 -the only one built for exhibition purposes, there was no price tag, but it was insured for thirty-five thousand dollars.<ref>Maud Coleno\u2019s Daughter, John Dann, Toubador, 2017, page 317</ref>\n\n== Creative Advertising ==\nHartman was a salesman with a love of cars, and a member of the [[Royal Automobile Club]] in Pall Mall. One of his early advertising stunts during the 1920s included a couple dancing the Charleston on the roof of a Buick saloon while it was being driven in London's Kingsway. (An original film clip of this event is used to introduce the P. G. Wodehouse BBC TV comedy series.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoUmGfLiamw</ref> The World of Wooster 1965\u201367). Another, to prove the durability of an L&H Buick, it was driven up a long flight of stairs in the grounds of the Crystal Palace.<ref>Russell Johns article about his life with Lendrum & Hartman in MotorSport Magazine, October 1980 (pages 1560-62, 1580)</ref>\n\n== Film associations ==\n* 1920s, Huntley Film Archives [[John Huntley (film historian)]] Ref: 1096286, Category: London, Decade: 1920, Sound: Mute, Colour: Film - B/W London streets after the war (WW1).
