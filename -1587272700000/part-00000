Except for some standard modules, Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules. Jython includes almost all of the modules in the standard [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] distribution, lacking only some of the modules implemented originally in [[C (programming language)|C]]. For example, a user interface in Jython could be written with [[Swing (Java)|Swing]], [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]] or [[Standard Widget Toolkit|SWT]]. Jython compiles Python source code to [[Java bytecode]] (an intermediate language) either on demand or statically.\n\n==History==\nJython was initially created in late 1997 to replace [[C (programming language)|C]] with [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for performance-intensive code accessed by Python programs, moving to [[SourceForge]] in October 2000. The [[Python Software Foundation]] awarded a grant in January 2005.

{"title_page": "Interpretations of quantum mechanics", "text_new": "{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Interpretations}}\nAn '''interpretation of quantum mechanics''' is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of [[quantum mechanics]] \"corresponds\" to [[reality]]. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments (not one prediction from quantum mechanics is found to be contradicted by experiments), there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation.  These views on interpretation differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is [[determinism|deterministic]] or [[stochastic|stochastic]], which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered real, and what is the nature of measurement, among other matters.\n\nDespite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached among physicists and [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] concerning which interpretation best \"represents\" reality.<ref>\nMurray Gell-Mann - Quantum Mechanics Interpretations - Feynman Sum over Histories - EPR Bertlemann's\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-OFP5tNtMY\nRichard P Feynman: Quantum Mechanical View of Reality 1 (Part 1)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72us6pnbEvE\n</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schlosshauer|first=Maximilian|last2=Kofler|first2=Johannes|last3=Zeilinger|first3=Anton|date=2013-08-01|title=A snapshot of foundational attitudes toward quantum mechanics|url=|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=44|issue=3|pages=222\u2013230|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|issn=1355-2198|arxiv=1301.1069|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n| header            = Influential figures in the interpretation of quantum mechanics\n| header_align      = center<!-- left/right/ -->\n| header_background = #CCCCFF\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Erwin Schrodinger2.jpg\n|caption1=[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]\n|width1=150\n|image2=Max Born.jpg\n|caption2=[[Max Born|Born]]\n|width2=147\n|image3=Niels Bohr.jpg\n|caption3=[[Niels Bohr|Bohr]]\n|width3=135\n}}\nThe definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as ''[[wave function]]s'' and ''[[matrix mechanics]]'', progressed through many stages.

The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:\n:\"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\n\n== Nature ==\nMore or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:\n# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''\u2014a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions\n# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''\u2014a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world\nTwo qualities vary among interpretations:\n# [[Ontology]]\u2014claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world\n# [[Epistemology]]\u2014claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world\n\nIn [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually \"governs\" outcomes\u2014and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism\u2014is a [[category mistake]].\n\nIn a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]\u2014approximately true description or explanation of the natural world\u2014or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.\n\n{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], \"Shut up and calculate\", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase \"shut up and calculate\", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10\u201311|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N. David|bibcode=2004PhT....57e..10M|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nOther approaches to resolve conceptual problems introduce new mathematical formalism, and so propose alternative theories with their interpretations.  An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms\u2014[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]\u2014has been demonstrated.\n\n== Interpretive challenges ==\n\n# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.\n# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. \n# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.<ref>Guido Bacciagaluppi, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.</ref>\n# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].<ref>''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.</ref>\n# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see \"[[Quantum logic]]\").  Like contextuality, the \"origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators\" that describe quantum objects (Omn\u00e8s 1999).\n# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.\n# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.\n\n== Influential Interpretations ==\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\n{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed below, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].\n\n=== The EPR Paradox ===\nThe current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete? | url =http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf | journal = Phys.

They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.\n\nDeterminism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.\n\nLocal realism has two aspects:\n* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;\n* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.\n\nA precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].\n\n[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nRegardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the \"standard\" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like \"where was the particle before I measured its position?\" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], \"reality is in the observations, not in the electron\".<ref>http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf</ref> In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.\n\n=== Quantum information theories ===\n[[Quantum information]]al approaches<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.quantum.at/fileadmin/links/newscientist/bit.html\n | title=In the beginning was the bit\n | work=New Scientist\n | date=2001-02-17\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref> have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  They subdivide into two kinds.<ref>[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/iii_2.pdf Information, Immaterialism, Instrumentalism: Old and New in Quantum Information.] Christopher G.

''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 19(7):8\u201314.)</ref> Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].\n<blockquote>\nThe state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.\n...A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/\n |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu\n |date=\n |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>For more information, see {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02302261 |author=Carlo Rovelli |year=1996 |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1637\u20131678 |arxiv=quant-ph/9609002|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |authorlink= Carlo Rovelli }}</ref>\n\nAn independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,<ref>David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965</ref> in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

This interpretation is distinguished by its use of a [[Bayesian probability#Dutch book approach|subjective Bayesian]] account of probabilities to understand the quantum mechanical [[Born rule]] as a [[normative]] addition to good decision-making. QBism draws from the fields of [[quantum information]] and [[Bayesian probability]] and aims to eliminate the interpretational conundrums that have beset quantum theory.\n\nQBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of [[wavefunction]] [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], [[Measurement problem|quantum measurement]], and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]].<ref name=\":21\">{{cite journal|last=Timpson|first=Christopher Gordon|year=2008|title=Quantum Bayesianism: A study|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/qb_s.ps|format=postscript|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=579\u2013609|arxiv=0804.2047|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2008.03.006|via=|accessdate=|bibcode=2008SHPMP..39..579T}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mermin|first=N.

The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly \"splitting\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories\u2014effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].\n\n=== Consistent histories ===\n{{Main|Consistent histories}}\n\nThe [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\n{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}\n\nThe [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent.

The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint.

Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.

This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Modal interpretations of quantum theory ===\nModal interpretations of quantum mechanics were first conceived of in 1972 by B. van Fraassen, in his paper \"A formal approach to the philosophy of science.\"  However, this term now is used to describe a larger set of models that grew out of this approach. The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] describes several versions:<ref>{{cite journal\n|url=http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/qm-modal/\n |title=Modal Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics\n |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n |publisher=Science.uva.nl\n |date=2002-11-12\n |accessdate=2011-01-24|last1=Lombardi\n |first1=Olimpia\n |last2=Dieks\n |first2=Dennis\n }}</ref>\n* The Copenhagen variant\n* Kochen-[[Dennis Dieks|Dieks]]-Healey Interpretations\n* Motivating Early Modal Interpretations, based on the work of R.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\n\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''.

It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.<ref name=\"Sharlow\">[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; \"What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics\"] p.2</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nThe most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.<ref>{{Cite book|title=What is quantum information?|last=Olimpia|first=Lombardi|last2=1979-|first2=Fortin, Sebastian|last3=Federico|first3=Holik|last4=Cristian|first4=L\u00f3pez|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781107142114|location=|pages=138\u2013144|oclc=965759965|arxiv = 1509.04711|doi = 10.1017/9781316494233.009|chapter = Interpretations of Quantum Theory: A Map of Madness}}</ref>\n\nNo experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to \"interpret\" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.\n\nMost of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued about by many people.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:\n:\"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\n\n== Nature ==\nMore or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:\n# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''\u2014a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions\n# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''\u2014a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world\nTwo qualities vary among interpretations:\n# [[Ontology]]\u2014claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world\n# [[Epistemology]]\u2014claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world\n\nIn [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually \"governs\" outcomes\u2014and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism\u2014is a [[category mistake]].\n\nIn a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]\u2014approximately true description or explanation of the natural world\u2014or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.\n\n{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], \"Shut up and calculate\", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase \"shut up and calculate\", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10\u201311|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N.

An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms\u2014[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]\u2014has been demonstrated.\n\n== Interpretive challenges ==\n\n# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.\n# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. \n# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.<ref>Guido Bacciagaluppi, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.</ref>\n# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].<ref>''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.</ref>\n# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see \"[[Quantum logic]]\").  Like contextuality, the \"origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators\" that describe quantum objects (Omn\u00e8s 1999).\n# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.\n# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.\n\n== Influential Interpretations ==\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\n{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed below, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].\n\n=== The EPR Paradox ===\nThe current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete? | url =http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf | journal = Phys.

They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.\n\nDeterminism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.\n\nLocal realism has two aspects:\n* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;\n* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.\n\nA precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].\n\n[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nRegardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the \"standard\" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like \"where was the particle before I measured its position?\" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], \"reality is in the observations, not in the electron\".<ref>http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf</ref> In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.\n\n=== Quantum information theories ===\n[[Quantum information]]al approaches<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.quantum.at/fileadmin/links/newscientist/bit.html\n | title=In the beginning was the bit\n | work=New Scientist\n | date=2001-02-17\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref> have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  They subdivide into two kinds.<ref>[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/iii_2.pdf Information, Immaterialism, Instrumentalism: Old and New in Quantum Information.] Christopher G.

''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 19(7):8\u201314.)</ref> Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].\n<blockquote>\nThe state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.\n...A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/\n |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu\n |date=\n |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>For more information, see {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02302261 |author=Carlo Rovelli |year=1996 |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1637\u20131678 |arxiv=quant-ph/9609002|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |authorlink= Carlo Rovelli }}</ref>\n\nAn independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,<ref>David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965</ref> in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

For this reason, some [[Philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] have deemed QBism a form of [[anti-realism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bananaworld: Quantum Mechanics for Primates|last=Bub|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0198718536|location=Oxford|pages=232}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Every Thing Must Go: Metaphysics Naturalized|last=Ladyman|first=James|last2=Ross|first2=Don|last3=Spurrett|first3=David|last4=Collier|first4=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199573097|location=Oxford|pages=184}}</ref> The originators of the interpretation disagree with this characterization, proposing instead that the theory more properly aligns with a kind of realism they call \"participatory realism\", wherein reality consists of ''more'' than can be captured by any putative third-person account of it.<ref>For \"participatory realism,\" see, e.g.,<br/>{{Cite book|title=Information and Interaction: Eddington, Wheeler, and the Limits of Knowledge|last=Fuchs|first=Christopher A.|year=2017|isbn=9783319437606|editor-last=Durham|editor-first=Ian T.|location=|pages=|chapter=On Participatory Realism|arxiv=1601.04360|oclc=967844832|editor2-last=Rickles|editor2-first=Dean|bibcode=2016arXiv160104360F}}<br/>{{Cite web|url=http://fqxi.org/grants/large/awardees/view/__details/2016/fuchs|title=Does Participatory Realism Make Sense?

The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly \"splitting\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories\u2014effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].\n\n=== Consistent histories ===\n{{Main|Consistent histories}}\n\nThe [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\n{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}\n\nThe [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. In the words of Einstein:\n\n{{Quote|The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems.|Einstein in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', ed.

Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality. The [[measurement problem]] is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maudlin | first1 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Why Bohm's Theory Solves the Measurement Problem | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/557e16347518003aa208a20ed704220e5706fc6d| journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 479\u2013483 | doi=10.1086/289879}}</ref> Collapse is explained as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]].<ref name=\"CushingFine2013\">{{cite arXiv |last1=Durr |first1=D. |last2=Zanghi |first2=N. |last3=Goldstein |first3=S.|eprint=quant-ph/9511016 |title=''Bohmian Mechanics as the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics ''|date=Nov 14, 1995 }} Also published in {{cite book|author1=J.T.

It was proposed in 2003 by [[Wojciech Zurek]] and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout. The development of the theory is due to the integration of a number of Zurek\u2019s research topics pursued over the course of twenty-five years including: [[pointer state]]s, [[einselection]] and [[decoherence]].\n\n=== Transactional interpretation ===\n{{Main|Transactional interpretation}}\nThe [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by [[John G. Cramer]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/qm_nl.html\n |title       = Quantum Nocality \u2013 Cramer\n |publisher   = Npl.washington.edu\n |accessdate  = 2011-01-24\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101229074514/http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/qm_nl.html\n |archivedate = 2010-12-29\n}}</ref> It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function).  This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.\n\n=== Stochastic mechanics ===\n{{Main|Stochastic interpretation}}\nAn entirely classical derivation and interpretation of Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation by analogy with [[Brownian motion]] was suggested by [[Princeton University]] professor [[Edward Nelson]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = E | year = 1966 | title = Derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation from Newtonian Mechanics | url = | journal = Phys.

F\u00fcrth (1933), [[I. F\u00e9nyes]] (1952), and [[Walter Weizel]] (1953), and are referenced in Nelson's paper. More recent work on the stochastic interpretation has been done by M.

In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly (\"spontaneous localization\") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role.  Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension to QM means that objective collapse is more of a theory than an interpretation.

He also described how measurement could cause a collapse of the wave function.<ref>von Neumann, John. (1932/1955). ''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\n\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''.

It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.<ref name=\"Sharlow\">[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; \"What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics\"] p.2</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nThe most common interpretations are summarized in the table below.

Moreover, to know the motion of the particles at any moment, you have to know what the Markov process is. However, once we know the exactly initial conditions and the Markov process, the theory is in fact a realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n* {{note label|note16|16}} A wavefunction merely encodes an agent\u2019s expectations for future experiences. It is no more real than a probability distribution is in [[Bayesian probability#Dutch book approach|subjective Bayesianism]].\n* {{note label|note17|17}} Quantum theory is a tool any agent may use to help manage their expectations. The past comes into play only insofar as an agent\u2019s individual experiences and temperament influence their priors.\n* {{note label|note18|18}} Although QBism would eschew this terminology. A change in the wavefunction that an agent ascribes to a system as a result of having an experience represents a change in his or her beliefs about further experiences they may have.

They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

Critics of the Cyprus initiative suspected that it served the interests of [[Iran]].

They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

Despite a split in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] defeated [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] nominee [[Horace Greeley]]. The election is notable for being the only presidential election in which a major party nominee died during the election process.\n\nGrant was unanimously re-nominated at the [[1872 Republican National Convention]], but his intra-party opponents organized the Liberal Republican Party and held their own convention. The [[1872 Liberal Republican convention]] nominated Greeley, a New York newspaper publisher, and wrote a platform calling for [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and an end to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] leaders believed that their only hope of defeating Grant was to unite around Greeley, and the [[1872 Democratic National Convention]] nominated the Liberal Republican ticket.\n\nDespite the union between the Liberal Republicans and Democrats, Greeley proved to be an ineffective campaigner and Grant remained widely popular. Grant decisively won re-election, carrying 31 of the 37 states, including several [[Southern United States|Southern]] states that would not again vote Republican until the 20th century. Grant would be the last incumbent to win a second term until [[William McKinley]]'s victory in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 presidential election]], and his [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular vote margin]] of 11.8% was the largest margin between [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]].\n\nOn November 29, 1872, after the popular vote was counted, but before the Electoral College cast its votes, Greeley died. As a result, electors previously committed to Greeley voted for four different candidates for president and eight different candidates for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. It was the last instance until the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] in which more than one presidential elector voted for a candidate to whom [[Faithless elector|they were not pledged]].\n\n== Nominations ==\n\n=== Republican Party nomination ===\n{{Main|1872 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Republican Party Ticket, 1872'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#CE2029; width:200px;\"| [[Ulysses S.

Because of its strong desire to defeat Ulysses S.

Accepting the Liberal platform meant the Democrats had accepted the [[New Departure (Democrats)|New Departure]] strategy, which rejected the anti-Reconstruction platform of 1868. They realized that to win the election they had to look forward, not try to re-fight the Civil War.<ref>Dunning 198</ref> Also, they realized they would only split the anti-Grant vote if they nominated a candidate other than Greeley. However, Greeley's long reputation as the most aggressive antagonist of the Democratic party, its principles, its leadership, and its activists cooled Democrats' enthusiasm for the nominee. \n\nSome Democrats were worried that backing Greeley would effectively bring the party to extinction, much like the moribund [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] had been doomed by endorsing the [[Know Nothing]] candidacy of [[Millard Fillmore]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]], though others felt that the Democrats were in a much stronger position on a regional level than the Whigs had been at the time of their demise, and predicted (correctly, as it turned out) that the Liberal Republicans would not be viable in the long-term due to their lack of distinctive positions compared to the main Republican Party. A sizable minority led by [[James A. Bayard, Jr.|James A. Bayard]] sought to act independently of the Liberal Republican ticket, but the bulk of the party agreed to endorse Greeley's candidacy. The convention, which lasted only six hours stretched over two days, is the shortest major political party convention in history.\n\nThe Liberal Republican Party fused with the Democratic Party in all states except for Louisiana and Texas. In states where Republicans were stronger, the Liberal Republicans fielded a majority of the joint slate of candidates for lower offices; while in states where Democrats were stronger, the Democrats fielded the most candidates. In many states, such as Ohio, each party nominated half of a joint slate of candidates. Even initially reluctant Democratic leaders like [[Thomas F. Bayard]] came to support Greeley.<ref name=\"Ross 1910\">Ross (1910)</ref>\n\n=== Other nominations ===\n\n==== Labor Reform Party ====\nPresidential Candidates:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; width:200px;\"| [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; width:200px;\"| [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]]\n|-  \n| \n|-\n| [[File:Charles OConor - Brady-Handy.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:JudgeDDavis.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[Lawyer]] from [[New York (state)|New York]]<br /><small>''(Declined Nomination)''</small>\n| [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]] from [[Illinois]]<br /><small>''(Nominee \u2013 Withdrew on June 24, 1872)''</small>\n|}\n\nThe Labor Reform Party had only been organized in 1870, with its first National Convention meeting held in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, on February 22, 1872. Initially, there was a fair amount of discussion as to whether the party should actually nominate anyone for the presidency at that time, or if they should wait at least for the Liberal Republicans to nominate their own ticket first. Every motion to that effect lost, and a number of ballots were taken that resulted in the nomination of [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], who was the frontrunner for the Liberal Republican nomination at that time. [[Joel Parker (politician)|Joel Parker]], the Governor of New Jersey, was nominated for vice-president.\n\nWhile Davis did not decline the nomination of the Labor Reform party, he decided to hinge his campaign in large part on the success of attaining the Liberal Republican nomination, so that he might at least have their resources behind him. After their convention, in which he failed to attain the nomination, Davis telegraphed the Labor Reform party and informed them of his intention to withdraw from the presidential contest entirely. Joel Parker soon followed suit.\n\nA second convention was called on August 22 in Philadelphia, where it was decided, rather than making the same mistake again, that the party would cooperate with the new [[Straight-Out Democratic Party]] that had recently formed. After the election, the various state affiliates grew less and less active, and by the following year, the party ceased to exist.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n | last = Bewig\n | first = Matthew S.

They nominated as presidential candidate [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]], who declined their nomination by telegram; as vice president they nominated [[John Quincy Adams II]]. Without time to choose a substitute, the party ran the two candidates anyway. They received 0.36% of the [[indirect election|popular vote]]s, and no [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes.\n\n== General election ==\n\n=== Campaign ===\nGrant's administration and his [[Radical Republican]] supporters had been widely accused of corruption, and the Liberal Republicans demanded civil service reform and an end to the Reconstruction process, including withdrawal of federal troops from the [[Southern United States|South]]. Both Liberal Republicans and Democrats were disappointed in their candidate Greeley. As wits asked, \"Why turn out a knave just to replace him with a fool?\"<ref>Dunning 197</ref> A poor campaigner with little political experience, Greeley's career as a newspaper editor gave his opponents a long history of eccentric public positions to attack. With memories of his victories in the Civil War to run on, Grant was unassailable. Grant also had a large campaign budget to work with. One historian was quoted saying, \"Never before was a candidate placed under such great obligation to men of wealth as was Grant.\" A large portion of Grant's campaign funds came from [[entrepreneurs]], including [[Jay Cooke]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Alexander Turney Stewart]], [[Henry Hilton]], and John Astor.<ref>{{cite book | title = Guide to U.S. Elections | edition = Fifth | volume = Volume 1 | date = November 17, 2005 | publisher = CQ Press | isbn = 1-56802-981-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/guidetouselectio00cqpr }}</ref>\n\n==== Women's suffrage ====\nThis was the first election after the formation of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)|American Woman Suffrage Association]] in 1869. As a result, protests for [[women's suffrage]] became more prevalent. The [[National Woman's Suffrage Association]] held its annual convention in New York City on May 9, 1872. Some of the delegates supported [[Victoria Woodhull]], who had spent the year since the previous NWSA annual meeting touring the New York City environs and giving speeches on why women should be allowed to vote. The delegates selected Victoria Woodhull to run for president, and named [[Frederick Douglass]] for vice- president. He did not attend the convention and never acknowledged the nomination, though he would serve as a presidential elector in the United States Electoral College for the State of New York. Woodhull gave a series of speeches around New York City during the campaign. Her finances were very thin, and when she borrowed money from supporters, she often was unable to repay them. On the day before the election, Woodhull was arrested for \"publishing an obscene newspaper\" and so was unable to cast a vote for herself. Woodhull was ineligible to be president on Inauguration Day, not because she was a woman (the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and the law were silent on the issue), but because she would not reach the constitutionally prescribed minimum age of 35 until September 23, 1873; historians have debated whether to consider her activities a true election campaign. Woodhull and Douglass are not listed in \"Election results\" below, as the ticket received a negligible percentage of the popular vote and no electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=26851|title=Our Campaigns \u2013 Candidate \u2013 Victoria C. Woodhull|publisher=}}</ref> In addition, several suffragists would attempt to vote in the election. [[Susan B. Anthony]] was arrested when she tried to vote and was fined $100 in a [[Trial of Susan B. Anthony|widely publicized trial]].\n\n=== Results ===\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1872Colorbrewer.gif|thumb|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of red are for Grant (Republican) and shades of blue are for Greeley (Liberal Republican/Democratic).]]\nGrant won an easy re-election over Greeley, with a popular vote margin of 11.8% and 763,000 votes. \n\nGrant also won the electoral college with 286 electoral votes; while Greeley won 66 electoral votes, he died on November 29, 1872, twenty-four days after the election and before any of his pledged electors (from Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Maryland) could cast their votes. Subsequently, 63 of Greeley's electors cast their votes for other Democrats: 18 of them cast their presidential votes for Greeley's running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown, and 45 cast their presidential votes for three non-candidates. \n\nOf the 2,171 counties making returns, Grant won in 1,335 while Greeley carried 833. Three counties were split evenly between Grant and Greeley.\n\n=== Disputed votes ===\nDuring the joint session of Congress for the counting of the electoral vote on February 12, 1873, various objections were raised to some of the results.

Most Liberal Republican Congressmen eventually joined the Democratic Party. Outside of the South, some Liberal Republicans sought the creation of a new party opposed to Republicans, but Democrats were unwilling to abandon their old party affiliation and even relatively successful efforts like Wisconsin's [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Reform Party]] collapsed. Even the strong Missouri Liberal Republican Party collapsed as the Democrats re-established themselves as the major opposition party to the Republicans.

Despite a split in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] defeated [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] nominee [[Horace Greeley]]. The election is notable for being the only presidential election in which a major party nominee died during the election process.\n\nGrant was unanimously re-nominated at the [[1872 Republican National Convention]], but his intra-party opponents organized the Liberal Republican Party and held their own convention. The [[1872 Liberal Republican convention]] nominated Greeley, a New York newspaper publisher, and wrote a platform calling for [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and an end to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] leaders believed that their only hope of defeating Grant was to unite around Greeley, and the [[1872 Democratic National Convention]] nominated the Liberal Republican ticket.\n\nDespite the union between the Liberal Republicans and Democrats, Greeley proved to be an ineffective campaigner and Grant remained widely popular. Grant decisively won re-election, carrying 31 of the 37 states, including several [[Southern United States|Southern]] states that would not again vote Republican until the 20th century. Grant would be the last incumbent to win a second term until [[William McKinley]]'s victory in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 presidential election]], and his [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular vote margin]] of 11.8% was the largest margin between [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]].\n\nOn November 29, 1872, after the popular vote was counted, but before the Electoral College cast its votes, Greeley died. As a result, electors previously committed to Greeley voted for four different candidates for president and eight different candidates for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. It was the last instance until the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] in which more than one presidential elector voted for a candidate to whom [[Faithless elector|they were not pledged]].\n\n== Nominations ==\n\n=== Republican Party nomination ===\n{{Main|1872 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Republican Party Ticket, 1872'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#CE2029; width:200px;\"| [[Ulysses S.

Accepting the Liberal platform meant the Democrats had accepted the [[New Departure (Democrats)|New Departure]] strategy, which rejected the anti-Reconstruction platform of 1868. They realized that to win the election they had to look forward, not try to re-fight the Civil War.<ref>Dunning 198</ref> Also, they realized they would only split the anti-Grant vote if they nominated a candidate other than Greeley. However, Greeley's long reputation as the most aggressive antagonist of the Democratic party, its principles, its leadership, and its activists cooled Democrats' enthusiasm for the nominee. \n\nSome Democrats were worried that backing Greeley would effectively bring the party to extinction, much like the moribund [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] had been doomed by endorsing the [[Know Nothing]] candidacy of [[Millard Fillmore]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]], though others felt that the Democrats were in a much stronger position on a regional level than the Whigs had been at the time of their demise, and predicted (correctly, as it turned out) that the Liberal Republicans would not be viable in the long-term due to their lack of distinctive positions compared to the main Republican Party. A sizable minority led by [[James A. Bayard, Jr.|James A. Bayard]] sought to act independently of the Liberal Republican ticket, but the bulk of the party agreed to endorse Greeley's candidacy. The convention, which lasted only six hours stretched over two days, is the shortest major political party convention in history.\n\nThe Liberal Republican Party fused with the Democratic Party in all states except for Louisiana and Texas. In states where Republicans were stronger, the Liberal Republicans fielded a majority of the joint slate of candidates for lower offices; while in states where Democrats were stronger, the Democrats fielded the most candidates. In many states, such as Ohio, each party nominated half of a joint slate of candidates. Even initially reluctant Democratic leaders like [[Thomas F. Bayard]] came to support Greeley.<ref name=\"Ross 1910\">Ross (1910)</ref>\n\n=== Other nominations ===\n\n==== Labor Reform Party ====\nPresidential Candidates:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; width:200px;\"| [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; width:200px;\"| [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]]\n|-  \n| \n|-\n| [[File:Charles OConor - Brady-Handy.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:JudgeDDavis.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[Lawyer]] from [[New York (state)|New York]]<br /><small>''(Declined Nomination)''</small>\n| [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]] from [[Illinois]]<br /><small>''(Nominee \u2013 Withdrew on June 24, 1872)''</small>\n|}\n\nThe Labor Reform Party had only been organized in 1870, with its first National Convention meeting held in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, on February 22, 1872. Initially, there was a fair amount of discussion as to whether the party should actually nominate anyone for the presidency at that time, or if they should wait at least for the Liberal Republicans to nominate their own ticket first. Every motion to that effect lost, and a number of ballots were taken that resulted in the nomination of [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], who was the frontrunner for the Liberal Republican nomination at that time. [[Joel Parker (politician)|Joel Parker]], the Governor of New Jersey, was nominated for vice-president.\n\nWhile Davis did not decline the nomination of the Labor Reform party, he decided to hinge his campaign in large part on the success of attaining the Liberal Republican nomination, so that he might at least have their resources behind him. After their convention, in which he failed to attain the nomination, Davis telegraphed the Labor Reform party and informed them of his intention to withdraw from the presidential contest entirely. Joel Parker soon followed suit.\n\nA second convention was called on August 22 in Philadelphia, where it was decided, rather than making the same mistake again, that the party would cooperate with the new [[Straight-Out Democratic Party]] that had recently formed. After the election, the various state affiliates grew less and less active, and by the following year, the party ceased to exist.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n | last = Bewig\n | first = Matthew S.

They nominated as presidential candidate [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]], who declined their nomination by telegram; as vice president they nominated [[John Quincy Adams II]]. Without time to choose a substitute, the party ran the two candidates anyway.

Both Liberal Republicans and Democrats were disappointed in their candidate Greeley. As wits asked, \"Why turn out a knave just to replace him with a fool?\"<ref>Dunning 197</ref> A poor campaigner with little political experience, Greeley's career as a newspaper editor gave his opponents a long history of eccentric public positions to attack. With memories of his victories in the Civil War to run on, Grant was unassailable. Grant also had a large campaign budget to work with. One historian was quoted saying, \"Never before was a candidate placed under such great obligation to men of wealth as was Grant.\" A large portion of Grant's campaign funds came from [[entrepreneurs]], including [[Jay Cooke]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Alexander Turney Stewart]], [[Henry Hilton]], and John Astor.<ref>{{cite book | title = Guide to U.S. Elections | edition = Fifth | volume = Volume 1 | date = November 17, 2005 | publisher = CQ Press | isbn = 1-56802-981-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/guidetouselectio00cqpr }}</ref>\n\n==== Women's suffrage ====\nThis was the first election after the formation of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)|American Woman Suffrage Association]] in 1869. As a result, protests for [[women's suffrage]] became more prevalent. The [[National Woman's Suffrage Association]] held its annual convention in New York City on May 9, 1872. Some of the delegates supported [[Victoria Woodhull]], who had spent the year since the previous NWSA annual meeting touring the New York City environs and giving speeches on why women should be allowed to vote. The delegates selected Victoria Woodhull to run for president, and named [[Frederick Douglass]] for vice- president. He did not attend the convention and never acknowledged the nomination, though he would serve as a presidential elector in the United States Electoral College for the State of New York. Woodhull gave a series of speeches around New York City during the campaign. Her finances were very thin, and when she borrowed money from supporters, she often was unable to repay them. On the day before the election, Woodhull was arrested for \"publishing an obscene newspaper\" and so was unable to cast a vote for herself. Woodhull was ineligible to be president on Inauguration Day, not because she was a woman (the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and the law were silent on the issue), but because she would not reach the constitutionally prescribed minimum age of 35 until September 23, 1873; historians have debated whether to consider her activities a true election campaign. Woodhull and Douglass are not listed in \"Election results\" below, as the ticket received a negligible percentage of the popular vote and no electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=26851|title=Our Campaigns \u2013 Candidate \u2013 Victoria C. Woodhull|publisher=}}</ref> In addition, several suffragists would attempt to vote in the election. [[Susan B. Anthony]] was arrested when she tried to vote and was fined $100 in a [[Trial of Susan B. Anthony|widely publicized trial]].\n\n=== Results ===\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1872Colorbrewer.gif|thumb|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of red are for Grant (Republican) and shades of blue are for Greeley (Liberal Republican/Democratic).]]\nGrant won an easy re-election over Greeley, with a popular vote margin of 11.8% and 763,000 votes. \n\nGrant also won the electoral college with 286 electoral votes; while Greeley won 66 electoral votes, he died on November 29, 1872, twenty-four days after the election and before any of his pledged electors (from Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Maryland) could cast their votes. Subsequently, 63 of Greeley's electors cast their votes for other Democrats: 18 of them cast their presidential votes for Greeley's running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown, and 45 cast their presidential votes for three non-candidates. \n\nOf the 2,171 counties making returns, Grant won in 1,335 while Greeley carried 833. Three counties were split evenly between Grant and Greeley.\n\n=== Disputed votes ===\nDuring the joint session of Congress for the counting of the electoral vote on February 12, 1873, various objections were raised to some of the results. However, unlike the objections which would be made in [[1876 United States presidential election|1877]], these had no impact on the outcome of the election. <ref>{{cite book| author=United States Congress| others=42nd Congress, 3rd Session, February 12| title=Senate Journal| url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj06845))| accessdate=March 23, 2006| year=1873| pages=334\u2013346}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!State\n!Voters\n!Winning candidate\n!Outcome\n!Reason\n!Electors counted\n|-\n| Arkansas\n| 6\n|rowspan=2| Grant\n|rowspan=2| Votes rejected \n|rowspan=2| Various irregularities, including allegations of electoral fraud\n|rowspan=2| No\n|-\n| Louisiana\n| 8\n|-\n| Georgia\n| 3 (of 11)\n| Greeley\n| Votes rejected\n| Ballots cast for Horace Greeley as President, but were cast after Greeley had died and he was thus ineligible for the office of President\n| Yes (votes for B.

Most Liberal Republican Congressmen eventually joined the Democratic Party. Outside of the South, some Liberal Republicans sought the creation of a new party opposed to Republicans, but Democrats were unwilling to abandon their old party affiliation and even relatively successful efforts like Wisconsin's [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Reform Party]] collapsed. Even the strong Missouri Liberal Republican Party collapsed as the Democrats re-established themselves as the major opposition party to the Republicans. In the following years, former Liberal Republicans became members in good standing of both major parties.<ref>Ross, pp. 192-239</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Presidency of Ulysses S.
