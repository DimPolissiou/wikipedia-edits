He explains that, unlike other cases of sexual abuse or harassment that could have been ignored without being taken seriously or adequately investigated, Mia Farrow's accusation against him was taken with the utmost seriousness and was immediately and thoroughly investigated by two groups of different experts.\n\nOn the one hand, the police and the prosecution hired the most prestigious experts in the country: the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whom the police used to look into such matters and who concluded that the evidence conclusively proved that there was not sexual abuse, that Dylan\u00b4s statements had \"a rehearsed quality\" and were likely \"coached or influenced by her mother. \" Regarding the criticism against Yale New haven for having destroyed the original notes at the time of incorporating them into the report, Allen reveals that in the course of the trial it turned out that it was the usual procedure of both Yale New Haven and the FBI to preserve privacy\n\nOn the other hand, the New York State Child Welfare scrupulously investigated the case for 14 months and concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse and that the allegation was unfounded.\n\nAllen recounts a session of the Yale-New Haven investigation during which Mia Farrow explained to experts how Dylan was so disturbed by the sexual abuse that she immediately rushed to her sister Lark's room for comfort. Farrow described how Dylan hugged Lark and how Lark comforted her. When Allen noted that Lark was in New York on the day the abuse was alleged to have happened and there was no way Dylan would have come to her, hugged her, and Lark comfort her, Mia Farrow changed her account and said that \"\" Lark was in New York at the time, but Dylan hugged her spiritually. \" Allen concluded that while Mia Farrow's story may have had some impact on the judges, it did not mislead investigators.\n\nRegarding the investigation conducted by Connecticut prosecutor Frank Maco, Allen indicates that from the moment the experts the prosecution had hired totally rejected the possibility of sexual abuse, the prosecution's investigation should have been closed. That it was kept open without any justification and that this fact was in favor of Farrow during the custody trial, that the statement at the prosecutor's press conference saying that there was probable cause was totally unfounded once the prosecution experts had already completely ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse. Allen points out that it is absurd to think that the prosecutor did not initiate prosecution becouse he did not want to hurt Dylan when he had police question Dylan for months without caring at all about Dylan's well-being. Allen also indicates that a nanny and a housekeeper who worked at Mia Farrow's house stated that on multiple occasions the prosecutor \u00a0showed up by the house and he and Mia Farrow went out to luch. Allen \u00a0regrets that this does not seem the most appropriate way conducting an impartial investigation.\n\nAllan also says that in the custody trial, the Court Clerk drove Mia Farrow to her home from the courthose many nigths and thinks it was a \u00a0\u201cunfair conduit to the judge\u201d, recalls the testimony by Moses Farrow, who said he witnessed how Mia Farrow coached Dylan to say that she had been abused, collects the testimony of a babysitter to whom Dylan said \"Mummy want me to lie.\" Allen says that long before the allegation of abuse emerged Mia Farrow took Dylan to a child therapist because the girl had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. The girl who under normal conditions had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy was at the exclusive care of her mother during a strong and confusing emotional crisis Farrow suggested the child that she had been abused, which ended up leading to Dylan sincerely believed it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen, Woody.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147948052|title=Apropos of Nothing|isbn=978-1-951627-34-8|oclc=1147948052}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=September 21, 1992|pages=32\u201342}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statements], The New York Times, May 4, 1993\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-02/news/mn-952_1_woody-allen Nanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges : Custody: She tells Allen's lawyers the actress pressured her to support molestation accusations against him.

Moses explains that on the afternoon of August 4 he was at home: \"As the \u201cman of the house\u201d that day, I had promised to keep an eye out for any trouble, and I was doing just that. I remember where Woody sat in the TV room, and I can picture where Dylan and Satchel were. Not that everybody stayed glued to the same spot, but I deliberately made sure to note everyone's coming and going. I do remember that Woody would leave the room on occasion, but never with Dylan. He would wander into another room to make a phone call, read the paper, use the bathroom, or step outside to get some air and walk around the large pond on the property.\"<ref name=\"MosesFarrowMay2018\" /> Moses also indicates that the memory that his sister keeps from having suffered abuse while focusing her attention on an electric train set is not possible: \"It\u2019s a precise and compelling narrative, but there\u2019s a major problem: there ''was'' no electric train set in that attic. There was, in fact, no way for kids to play up there, even if we had wanted to. It was an unfinished crawl space, under a steeply-angled gabled roof, with exposed nails and floorboards, billows of fiberglass insulation, filled with mousetraps and droppings and stinking of mothballs, and crammed with trunks full of hand-me-down clothes and my mother\u2019s old wardrobes.

He explains that, unlike other cases of sexual abuse or harassment that could have been ignored without being taken seriously or adequately investigated, Mia Farrow's accusation against him was taken with the utmost seriousness and was immediately and thoroughly investigated by two groups of different experts.\n\nOn the one hand, the police and the prosecution hired the most prestigious experts in the country: the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whom the police used to look into such matters and who concluded that the evidence conclusively proved that there was not sexual abuse, that Dylan\u00b4s statements had \"a rehearsed quality\" and were likely \"coached or influenced by her mother. \" Regarding the criticism against Yale New haven for having destroyed the original notes at the time of incorporating them into the report, Allen reveals that in the course of the trial it turned out that it was the usual procedure of both Yale New Haven and the FBI to preserve privacy\n\nOn the other hand, the New York State Child Welfare scrupulously investigated the case for 14 months and concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse and that the allegation was unfounded.\n\nAllen recounts a session of the Yale-New Haven investigation during which Mia Farrow explained to experts how Dylan was so disturbed by the sexual abuse that she immediately rushed to her sister Lark's room for comfort. Farrow described how Dylan hugged Lark and how Lark comforted her. When Allen noted that Lark was in New York on the day the abuse was alleged to have happened and there was no way Dylan would have come to her, hugged her, and Lark comfort her, Mia Farrow changed her account and said that \"\" Lark was in New York at the time, but Dylan hugged her spiritually. \" Allen concluded that while Mia Farrow's story may have had some impact on the judges, it did not mislead investigators.\n\nRegarding the investigation conducted by Connecticut prosecutor Frank Maco, Allen indicates that from the moment the experts the prosecution had hired totally rejected the possibility of sexual abuse, the prosecution's investigation should have been closed. That it was kept open without any justification and that this fact was in favor of Farrow during the custody trial, that the statement at the prosecutor's press conference saying that there was probable cause was totally unfounded once the prosecution experts had already completely ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse. Allen points out that it is absurd to think that the prosecutor did not initiate prosecution becouse he did not want to hurt Dylanl when he had police question Dylan for months without caring at all about Dylan's well-being. Allen also indicates that a nanny and a housekeeper who worked at Mia Farrow's house stated that on multiple occasions the prosecutor \u00a0showed up by the house and he and Mia Farrow went out to luch. Allen \u00a0regrets that this does not seem the most appropriate way conducting an impartial investigation.\n\nAllan also says that in the custody trial, the Court Clerk drove Mia Farrow to her home from the courthose many nigths and thinks it was a \u00a0\u201cunfair conduit to the judge\u201d, recalls the testimony by Moses Farrow, who said he witnessed how Mia Farrow coached Dylan to say that she had been abused, collects the testimony of a babysitter to whom Dylan said \"Mummy want me to lie.\" Allen says that long before the allegation of abuse emerged Mia Farrow took Dylan to a child therapist because the girl had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. The girl who under normal conditions had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy was at the exclusive care of her mother during a strong and confusing emotional crisis Farrow suggested the child that she had been abused, which ended up leading to Dylan sincerely believed it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen, Woody.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147948052|title=Apropos of Nothing|isbn=978-1-951627-34-8|oclc=1147948052}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=September 21, 1992|pages=32\u201342}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statements], The New York Times, May 4, 1993\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-02/news/mn-952_1_woody-allen Nanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges : Custody: She tells Allen's lawyers the actress pressured her to support molestation accusations against him.

That is to say, ''c'' is a fixed point of the function ''f'' if ''f''(''c'') = ''c''. This means ''f''(''f''(...''f''(''c'')...)) = ''f''<sup>&thinsp;''n''</sup>(''c'') = ''c'', an important terminating consideration when recursively computing ''f''. A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of fixed points is sometimes called a ''fixed set''.\n\nFor example, if ''f'' is defined on the [[real number]]s by\n\n:<math> f(x) = x^2 - 3 x + 4,</math>\n\nthen 2 is a fixed point of ''f'', because ''f''(2) = 2.\n\nNot all functions have fixed points: for example, if ''f'' is a function defined on the real numbers as ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&thinsp;+{{Hair space}}1, then it has no fixed points, since ''x'' is never equal to ''x''&thinsp;+{{Hair space}}1 for any real number. In graphical terms, a fixed point ''x'' means the point (''x'', ''f''(''x'')) is on the line ''y''&thinsp;=&thinsp;''x'', or in other words the [[graph of a function|graph]] of ''f'' has a point in common with that line.\n\nPoints that come back to the same value after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] of the function are called ''[[periodic point]]s''. A ''fixed point'' is a periodic point with period equal to one. In [[projective geometry]], a fixed point of a [[projectivity]] has been called a '''double point'''.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=H. S.

The earliest person known to have a finite Erd\u0151s number is either [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (born 1743, Erd\u0151s number 13), [[Richard Dedekind]] (born 1831, Erd\u0151s number 7), or [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] (born 1849, Erd\u0151s number 3), depending on the standard of publication eligibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/erdpaths |title=Paths to Erd\u00f6s - The Erd\u00f6s Number Project- Oakland University|work=oakland.edu}}</ref> \n\nMartin Tompa<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tompa|first=Martin|title=Figures of merit|journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=20|issue=1|pages=62\u201371|year=1989|doi=10.1145/65780.65782}} {{cite journal|last=Tompa|first= Martin|title=Figures of merit: the sequel|journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=21|issue=4|pages=78\u201381|year=1990|doi=10.1145/101371.101376}}</ref> proposed a [[directed graph]] version of the Erd\u0151s number problem, by orienting edges of the collaboration graph from the alphabetically earlier author to the alphabetically later author and defining the ''monotone Erd\u0151s number'' of an author to be the length of a [[longest path]] from Erd\u0151s to the author in this directed graph.

It was created in 1994, 25 years after Goffman's article on the Erd\u0151s number.\n\nA small number of people are connected to both Erd\u0151s and Bacon and thus have an [[Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon number]], which combines the two numbers by taking their sum. One example is the actress-mathematician [[Danica McKellar]], best known for playing Winnie Cooper on the TV series, ''[[The Wonder Years]]''. \nHer Erd\u0151s number is 4,<ref>McKellar's co-author Lincoln Chayes published [https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103940982 a paper] with [[Elliott H.
