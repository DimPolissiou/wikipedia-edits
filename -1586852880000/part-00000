It had natural grass until 2006. However, the condition of the pitch, especially during the winter months, received considerable criticism from sports pundits and visiting managers. Usually in October, when the Norwegian top division is in its last rounds, winter sets in Troms\u00f8. This, along with the wear and tear from football matches and practicing sessions, caused the grass to disappear and reduced the pitch to a muddy field. To make up for this, Troms\u00f8 I.L. installed [[artificial turf]] at the stadium during the [[Football World Cup 2006|2006 World Cup]] in [[Germany]].  Funding for the turf came from contributions to the club from several businesses in Troms\u00f8, including 7.5 million [[Norwegian kroner|NOK]] from an anonymous donor. The artificial turf laid in 2006 was replaced with a new one in June 2010 after taking much criticism.\n\n== The stands ==\nThe East stand is an all seated covered stand which can accommodate about 2000 people. This stand was built in the mid-eighties and is the oldest stand at Alfheim. It houses the clubs offices. At the back of the stand there is a row of executive boxes. Some controversy surrounded the East Stand during the [[2004 Tippeligaen|2004 season]]. [[Ringnes]], a Norwegian [[brewery]], complained about the clubs [[S.K. Brann]] and [[Troms\u00f8 I.L.]] being sponsored by the breweries [[Hansa (brewery)|Hansa Borg]] and [[Mack Brewery]] respectively. Advertising for [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is illegal in Norway. The result of this complaint for Troms\u00f8 I.L. was that the club had to remove all advertisements for Mack, including the seating arrangement on one of the stands that spelled out Mack. The seats were changed, making the stands spell out \"Tack\" instead. Tack is a play on words, since it resembles the word Takk, Norwegian for \"thank you\", a gesture from Troms\u00f8 I.L. thanking Mack for the co-operation through a great deal of years. Ahead of the [[2005 Tippeligaen|2005 season]], the former Mack-stands had been renamed to the Coop-stands, being sponsored by the Norwegian [[convenience store]] chain Coop. \nThe West Stand was rebuilt during the 2005-season, meaning both sides now are seated and covered. Before the rebuilding the West Stand was an uncovered wooden stand. The West Stand has a capacity of approximately 4000, making it the largest stand at Alfheim. There are three media gantries suspended from the roof of the West Stand.\n\nStraddling the middle of the south end and running for two thirds of the length is an uncovered family stand which seats approximately 600 people.  Ahead of the 2011 season this stand replaced most of the 1500 capacity temporary uncovered stand. A part of the old stand remains next to the family stand towards the east stand. This part has no seating and can hold about 200 visiting supporters, leaving them with the worst facilities at Alfheim. The South Stand is closed for matches in European cup tournaments due to safety regulations imposed by [[UEFA]].\n\nUntil August 2007 there was a temporary uncovered stand at the north end which ran for about two thirds of the pitch, this was dismantled to allow place for a stage during a music festival. The north end is now filled with advertising hoardings. In 2010 the scoreboard and stadium clock at the north end were replaced with a large video screen in the north east corner. Set back from the pitch at the north end is ''TIL-huset'', a building that previously housed the teams' changing rooms.\n{{Gallery|width=180|lines=2|\nFile:Alfheim Stadion east stand.JPG|The East Stand|\nFile:South Stand.JPG|The South Stand|\nFile:West Stand.JPG|The West Stand|\nFile:Alfheim Stadion west stand.jpg|The West Stand on match day|\nFile:Tromso Alheim Stadion (North Stand).JPG|Open North Stand|}}\n\n==Details==\n\n===Records===\nRecord Attendance: 10,225 v [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] on 15 August 1990 ([[Single-elimination tournament|quarter final]] in the [[Norwegian Football Cup|Norwegian Cup]])\n\n== Fort Alfheim ==\nBecause of Troms\u00f8 I.L.'s good home record in many seasons in the Eliteserie (for example, 10 wins in 13 matches in the 2004 season), Alfheim Stadium has been given the nickname ''Fort Alfheim'', building on the image of Alfheim Stadium as being impregnable.

Ahead of the 2011 season this stand replaced most of the 1500 capacity temporary uncovered stand. A part of the old stand remains next to the family stand towards the east stand. This part has no seating and can hold about 200 visiting supporters, leaving them with the worst facilities at Alfheim. The South Stand is closed for matches in European cup tournaments due to safety regulations imposed by [[UEFA]].\n\nUntil August 2007 there was a temporary uncovered stand at the north end which ran for about two thirds of the pitch, this was dismantled to allow place for a stage during a music festival. The north end is now filled with advertising hoardings. In 2010 the scoreboard and stadium clock at the north end were replaced with a large video screen i the north east corner. Set back from the pitch at the north end is ''TIL-huset'', a building that previously housed the teams changing rooms.\n{{Gallery|width=180|lines=2|\nFile:Alfheim Stadion east stand.JPG|The East Stand|\nFile:South Stand.JPG|The South Stand|\nFile:West Stand.JPG|The West Stand|\nFile:Alfheim Stadion west stand.jpg|The West Stand on match day|\nFile:Tromso Alheim Stadion (North Stand).JPG|Open North Stand|}}\n\n==Details==\n\n===Records===\nRecord Attendance: 10,225 v [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] on 15 August 1990 ([[Single-elimination tournament|quarter final]] in the [[Norwegian Football Cup|Norwegian Cup]])\n\n== Fort Alfheim ==\nBecause of Troms\u00f8 I.L.'s good home record in many seasons in the Eliteserie (for example, 10 wins in 13 matches in the 2004 season), Alfheim Stadium has been given the nickname ''Fort Alfheim'', building on the image of Alfheim Stadium as being impregnable.

Popular for their strength, durability, lightness, recyclability, and cost-effectiveness, corrugated boxes are used for the shipping of a variety of items. Due to the quality and safety of packaging items in corrugated boxes, they are used widely in the food industry.

[[Unboxing]] is one emerging trend that has challenged designers to create cool new ways of opening boxes and lively product displays within those boxes. Another trend is the use of corrugated board for product displays. With the rigidity of corrugated board combined with the ability to print beautiful designs, corrugated board can be designed as a [[Point of sale|Point of Purchase]] display or \"POP\" display to showcase products in a fully branded display rather than the standard retail shelf. \n\nMore than 95% of all products in the [[United States]] are shipped in corrugated boxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprintingdaddy.com/corrugated-box-with-double-lid-locks|title=Corrugated Boxes Design|last=Miji|first=Kuboc|website=theprintingdaddy.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref> Corrugated paperboard accounts for more than half of all the paper recycled in the US.<ref name=\"appleltd1\"/>\n\n===Stacking strength===\nOne of the important functions of a corrugated box is to provide crush resistance (product protection) and adequate strength for stacking in warehouses.\n\nA box can be designed by optimizing the grade of corrugated board, box design, flute direction, and inner supports. Support from the product also provides \"load sharing\" and can be an important factor.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Koning |first=J |date=November 1966 |title=Slip Pad, Vertical Alignment Increase Stacking Strength 65%|journal=Boxboard Containers }}</ref> Box closures sometimes can have effects on box stacking strength.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sheehan |first=R |title = Box and Closure: Partners in Performance |journal = J. Packaging Technology |volume = 2 |issue = 4 |publisher = Technical Publications Inc |date = August 1988 }}</ref>\n\nIf long-term storage of corrugated boxes in high humidity is expected, extra strength and moisture resistance is called for.\n\nThe method of loading boxes on pallets strongly affects stacking. Vertical columns provide the best box performance while interlocking patterns of boxes significantly reduce performance. The interaction of the boxes and pallets is also important.\n\n[[Box compression test]]ing is a means of evaluating boxes, stacks of boxes, and [[unit load]]s under controlled conditions. Field conditions of stacking and dynamic compression do not have the same degree of control. Compression strength can be estimated based on container construction, size, and use parameters: actual [[package testing]] is often conducted to verify these estimates.\n\nMany [[packaging engineer]]s find it beneficial to periodically audit [[warehouse]]s and visit customer's package receiving operations. When field performance is observed or documented to have problems, a new cycle of design and testing may be justified.\nfor a corrugated box to withstand the deformation while stacking or storage (stack load = 1/3 compression strength).\nwhere stack load=gross weight of box *stack height.\n\n=== Estimating compression ===\nFiber Box Association has a method for estimating compression strength which includes the following factors:\n* Time\n* Moisture\n* Palletizing type\n* Pallet patterns\n* Pallet type\n* Handling\n\n==Process==\n{{main|Corrugated fiberboard}}\n[[File:Package Drop tester.jpg|thumb|250px|Laboratory drop test to determine ability to withstand rough handling]]\n[[Packaging engineer]]s design corrugated boxes to meet the particular needs of the product being shipped, the hazards of the shipping environment, (shock, vibration, compression, moisture, etc.), and the needs of retailers and consumers\n\nEngineers and designers start with the needs of the particular project: cost constraints, machinery capabilities, product characteristics, logistics needs, applicable regulations, consumer needs, etc. Often designs are made with [[Computer Aided Design]] programs connected to automated sample making tables. Several design and construction options might be considered.\n\nSamples are often submitted to [[Performance test (assessment)|performance testing]] based on [[ASTM]] or other [[Technical standard|standard]] test protocols such as the International Safe Transit Association. Structural design is matched with [[graphic design]]. For consumer based designs, marketing personnel sometimes use [[Focus group]]s or more quantitative means of assessing acceptance. [[Test market]]s are employed for major programs.\n\nThe process starts by making corrugated board on a corrugating line, a long series of linked machines which may be in size of a [[Yard lines|football field]]. A finished piece of singlewall corrugated board is a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liners.<ref name=\"appleltd1\"/>\n\nSkilled workers prepare job tickets for each stack of box blanks and route the blanks to fabrication machines. Printing dies and patterns are prepared on large, flexible, rubber or tin sheets. They are loaded onto rollers and the box blanks are fed through it, where each is trimmed, printed, cut, scored, folded, and glued to form a box. Finished boxes are then stacked and sent to a banding machine to be wrapped and shipped.<ref name=\"appleltd1\"/>\n\n==Design==\nThe most common box style is the Regular Slotted Container (RSC). All flaps are the same length from score to edge. Typically the major flaps meet in the middle and the minor flaps do not, unless the width is equal to the length. Box styles in Europe are typically specified by a 4-digit code provided by the European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers (FEFCO): A regular slotted container is coded 0201.<ref>{{Citation\n| title = International Fibreboard Case Code\n| publisher = FEFCO\n| date = 2007\n| url = http://www.fefco.org/technical-information/fefco-code\n}}</ref>\n[[Image:Regular Slotted Container.svg|thumb|Regular Slotted Container]]\n[[Image:Blank RSC.svg|thumb|Box blank for a regular slotted container showing score lines, slots, and manufacturer's joint]]\n\nThe manufacturer's joint is most often joined with adhesive but may also be taped or stitched. The box is shipped flat (knocked down) to the packager who sets up the box, fills it, and closes it for shipment. Box closure may be by tape, adhesive, staples, [[strapping]], etc.\n\nMany other styles of corrugated boxes and structures are available:\n* FOL (Full Overlap): A Full Overlap Box is similar to an RSC except the major flaps fully overlap. Full-overlap flaps provide extra stacking strength and edge protection.\n* HSC (Half Slotted Container): Half-Slotted Containers (HSC) are similar to an RSC, but with only one set of flaps. They are useful when an open-top container is desired. HSCs can be used to create a telescope box.\n* A Full Telescope Box has two fully telescoping sections. The sections may be formed by staples, die-cut locks, adhesive, etc.\n* A Partial Telescope Box has two sections. The top telescopes partially over the bottom. Commonly used for holding printing paper.\n* A corrugated tray is often used for display purposes or used with a [[shrink wrap]]\n* Corrugated corner pads can be used for product support and [[cushioning]]\n* Special die-cut shapes have almost endless designs and uses.\n* etc.\n\nThe size of a box can be measured for either internal (for product fit) or external (for handling machinery or palletizing) dimensions. Boxes are usually specified and ordered by the internal dimensions.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:BJs Wholesale Club VA.jpg|Wholesale outlet using full pallet loads.\nFile:Bag-in-box.jpg|[[Bag-In-Box]] containing liquids to dispense\nFile:Clementines.jpg|alt=Fruit Packaging Boxes|Box used for fruit packaging.

The goal is to put the case directly onto shelves and stocking locations without individually handling the unit packs or primary packages. Retailers often require products to come in shelf-ready packaging to reduce stocking costs and save labor expenses.\nSeveral specialized box designs are available.<ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US6073833A\n| title         =Shelf ready shipping container\n| pubdate       =2000\n| inventor      =Desrosiers\n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US6073833A/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US5881884A\n| title         =Shipping and display carton and blank therefor\n| pubdate       =1999\n| inventor      =Podosek\n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US5881884A/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US8342335B2\n| title         =Shelf-ready shipper display system\n| pubdate       =2013\n| inventor      =Couture \n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US8342335B2/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US20050184139A1\n| title         =Display-ready case\n| pubdate       =2005\n| inventor      =Couture \n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050184139A1/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US6523692B2\n| title         =Fold-in-half shipping/display box\n| pubdate       =2003\n| inventor      =Gregory\n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US6523692B2/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US5372299A\n| title         =Combined product shipping and display box\n| pubdate       =1994\n| inventor      =Edgerton \n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US5372299A/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        =US5657872A\n| title         =Shipping/display container\n| pubdate       =1997\n| inventor      =Lefwich \n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US5657872A/en\n}}</ref>\n\n==Individual mixed shipments==\n[[Image:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Box construction needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]\n\nMany items are shipped individually (in part or entirely) by express carrier, mail, or other mixed [[logistics]] systems. The demands of multiple manual handlings, automated sortation, and uncontrolled stacking in trucks or air containers put severe stress on boxes, box closures, and the contents. Boxes designed for [[unit load]] handling and storage may not be suited to mixed logistics systems.\n\n[[Less than truckload shipping]] puts more stress on corrugated shipping containers than shipment by uniform pallet loads in trucks or intermodal containers. Boxes sometimes need to be heavier construction to match the needs of the distribution system.\n\n==Government, military, and export==\nMany items being supplied to governments are handled very well: boxes are unitized, shipped on covered trucks or [[intermodal container]]s, and storage is in [[warehouse]]s. Normal \"domestic boxes\" and commercial packaging are acceptable.<ref>ASTM Standard D3951 - Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging</ref>\n\nMilitary [[materiel]], field supplies, and humanitarian aid often encounter severe handling and uncontrolled storage. Special box [[specification]]s for government shipments are often applicable. Weather-resistant fiberboards, box construction, box closure, and unitizing are needed.\n<gallery>\nFile:JTF Rita.jpg|RSCs of [[MRE]]s being off-loaded from a helicopter.

Normal \"domestic boxes\" are commonly used.\n\n[[Break bulk cargo]] needs to be water-resistant and heavy-duty. Even shipments initially sent via [[intermodal freight transport]]  may have subsequent logistics operations that are extreme and uncontrolled. The specific conditions in the destination port and the country of use need to be considered for the design of export boxes.\n\n==Dangerous and hazardous goods==\n[[File:Corrugated box - haz mat.jpg|thumb|Doublewall box with dividers for shipping four bottles of corrosive liquid]]\nShipment of [[dangerous goods]] or hazardous materials are highly regulated. Based on the [[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods]] model regulations, each country has coordinated design and performance requirements for shipment.  For example, in the US, the Department of Transportation has jurisdiction and published requirements in [[Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]. Corrugated boxes are described in 4G requirements.  Performance (severe drop test, etc.) needs to be certified for the box and contents.\n\nSome carriers have additional requirements.\n\n==Box closure==\nThe means of closing a box is an important aspect of design.  It affects the types of equipment available to production lines, the measured laboratory performance, the field performance, and the ability of end-users to easily and safely open the box.\n\nBox closures include:\n* [[Adhesive]],  water-based or [[hot-melt adhesive]]-Adhesives are applied manually or by machine. Starch-based adhesives are the choice of a corrugator as it is economic. Starch works as a medium for molds, lichens, and fungus, so to prevent it, antifungals are added in it before use.\n* [[Staple (fastener)|Staples]] - staples are used to attach the box flaps.  Small (nominally \u00bd inch crown) staples can be applied to a box with a post stapler. Wider crown (nominally 1\u00bc inch) staples can be applied with a blind clincher\n* [[Box sealing tape]], pressure-sensitive-taps are available in various widths i.e. 36, 48, and 72&nbsp;mm widths and several thicknesses. BOPP and PET are used as a backing.  Taping is done either manually or by semi-automatic [[Case sealer]].\n* [[Filament tape]], reinforced pressure-sensitive tape used to close boxes.\n* Gummed paper tape -  consists of a heavy paper in which adhesive is activated by water for bonding to the box.\n* Reinforced water activated gummed tape.  Two plies of paper with reinforcing filaments embedded between  \n* [[Strapping]]- straps are generally used for unitizing, made up of plastic(PP,PE,PET,PVC),metal(SS steel) etc. and available various width.\n* [[Shrink wrap]]- it is a thin film of LLDPE, LDPE, etc. which shrinks with the application of heat resulting in wrapping a box from all sides.it is costlier amongst all as it needs hot tunnel and material consumption will be more. However, the packed box will be protected from the environment as it will work as a barrier.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Books, general references===\n\n* \"Fibre Box Handbook\", Fibre Box Association, Chicago IL\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books/about/Corrugated_Crossroads.html?id=pLUGPQAACAAJ |title = Corrugated Crossroads: A Reference Guide for the Corrugated Containers Industry|isbn = 9780898522990|last1 = Koning|first1 = John W.|year = 1995}}\n* [http://www.fefco.org European Corrugated Board Industry]\n* [http://www.fefco.org/technical-documents/gmp-good-manufacturing-practice Good Manufacturing Practices for Corrugated and Solid Board Packaging]\n* Soroka, W, \"Fundamentals of Packaging Technology\", IoPP, 2002, {{ISBN|1-930268-25-4}}\n* \"Guide for Packaging for Small Parcel Shipments\", 2005, IoPP\n* Yam, K.

With the rigidity of corrugated board combined with the ability to print beautiful designs, corrugated board can be designed as a [[Point of sale|Point of Purchase]] display or \"POP\" display to showcase products in a fully branded display rather than the standard retail shelf. \n\nMore than 95% of all products in the [[United States]] are shipped in corrugated boxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprintingdaddy.com/corrugated-box-with-double-lid-locks|title=Corrugated Boxes Design|last=Miji|first=Kuboc|website=theprintingdaddy.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref> Corrugated paperboard accounts for more than half of all the paper recycled in the US.<ref name=\"appleltd1\"/>\n\n===Stacking strength===\nOne of the important functions of a corrugated box is to provide crush resistance (product protection) and adequate strength for stacking in warehouses.\n\nA box can be designed by optimizing the grade of corrugated board, box design, flute direction, and inner supports. Support from the product also provides \"load sharing\" and can be an important factor.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Koning |first=J |date=November 1966 |title=Slip Pad, Vertical Alignment Increase Stacking Strength 65%|journal=Boxboard Containers }}</ref> Box closures sometimes can have effects on box stacking strength.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sheehan |first=R |title = Box and Closure: Partners in Performance |journal = J. Packaging Technology |volume = 2 |issue = 4 |publisher = Technical Publications Inc |date = August 1988 }}</ref>\n\nIf long-term storage of corrugated boxes in high humidity is expected, extra strength and moisture resistance is called for.\n\nThe method of loading boxes on pallets strongly affects stacking. Vertical columns provide the best box performance while interlocking patterns of boxes significantly reduce performance. The interaction of the boxes and pallets is also important.\n\n[[Box compression test]]ing is a means of evaluating boxes, stacks of boxes, and [[unit load]]s under controlled conditions. Field conditions of stacking and dynamic compression do not have the same degree of control. Compression strength can be estimated based on container construction, size, and use parameters: actual [[package testing]] is often conducted to verify these estimates.\n\nMany [[packaging engineer]]s find it beneficial to periodically audit [[warehouse]]s and visit customer's package receiving operations. When field performance is observed or documented to have problems, a new cycle of design and testing may be justified.\nfor a corrugated box to withstand the deformation while stacking or storage (stack load = 1/3 compression strength).\nwhere stack load=gross weight of box *stack height.\n\n=== Estimating compression ===\nFiber Box Association has a method for estimating compression strength which includes the following factors:\n* Time\n* Moisture\n* Palletizing type\n* Pallet patterns\n* Pallet type\n* Handling\n\n==Process==\n{{main|Corrugated fiberboard}}\n[[File:Package Drop tester.jpg|thumb|250px|Laboratory drop test to determine ability to withstand rough handling]]\n[[Packaging engineer]]s design corrugated boxes to meet the particular needs of the product being shipped, the hazards of the shipping environment, (shock, vibration, compression, moisture, etc.), and the needs of retailers and consumers\n\nEngineers and designers start with the needs of the particular project: cost constraints, machinery capabilities, product characteristics, logistics needs, applicable regulations, consumer needs, etc. Often designs are made with [[Computer Aided Design]] programs connected to automated sample making tables. Several design and construction options might be considered.\n\nSamples are often submitted to [[Performance test (assessment)|performance testing]] based on [[ASTM]] or other [[Technical standard|standard]] test protocols such as the International Safe Transit Association. Structural design is matched with [[graphic design]]. For consumer based designs, marketing personnel sometimes use [[Focus group]]s or more quantitative means of assessing acceptance. [[Test market]]s are employed for major programs.\n\nThe process starts by making corrugated board on a corrugating line, a long series of linked machines which may be in size of a [[Yard lines|football field]]. A finished piece of singlewall corrugated board is a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liners.<ref name=\"appleltd1\"/>\n\nSkilled workers prepare job tickets for each stack of box blanks and route the blanks to fabrication machines. Printing dies and patterns are prepared on large, flexible, rubber or tin sheets. They are loaded onto rollers and the box blanks are fed through it, where each is trimmed, printed, cut, scored, folded, and glued to form a box. Finished boxes are then stacked and sent to a banding machine to be wrapped and shipped.<ref name=\"appleltd1\"/>\n\n==Design==\nThe most common box style is the Regular Slotted Container (RSC). All flaps are the same length from score to edge. Typically the major flaps meet in the middle and the minor flaps do not, unless the width is equal to the length. Box styles in Europe are typically specified by a 4-digit code provided by the European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers (FEFCO): A regular slotted container is coded 0201.<ref>{{Citation\n| title = International Fibreboard Case Code\n| publisher = FEFCO\n| date = 2007\n| url = http://www.fefco.org/technical-information/fefco-code\n}}</ref>\n[[Image:Regular Slotted Container.svg|thumb|Regular Slotted Container]]\n[[Image:Blank RSC.svg|thumb|Box blank for a regular slotted container showing score lines, slots, and manufacturer's joint]]\n\nThe manufacturer's joint is most often joined with adhesive but may also be taped or stitched. The box is shipped flat (knocked down) to the packager who sets up the box, fills it, and closes it for shipment. Box closure may be by tape, adhesive, staples, [[strapping]], etc.\n\nMany other styles of corrugated boxes and structures are available:\n* FOL (Full Overlap): A Full Overlap Box is similar to an RSC except the major flaps fully overlap. Full-overlap flaps provide extra stacking strength and edge protection.\n* HSC (Half Slotted Container): Half-Slotted Containers (HSC) are similar to an RSC, but with only one set of flaps. They are useful when an open-top container is desired. HSCs can be used to create a telescope box.\n* A Full Telescope Box has two fully telescoping sections. The sections may be formed by staples, die-cut locks, adhesive, etc.\n* A Partial Telescope Box has two sections. The top telescopes partially over the bottom. Commonly used for holding printing paper.\n* A corrugated tray is often used for display purposes or used with a [[shrink wrap]]\n* Corrugated corner pads can be used for product support and [[cushioning]]\n* Special die-cut shapes have almost endless designs and uses.\n* etc.\n\nThe size of a box can be measured for either internal (for product fit) or external (for handling machinery or palletizing) dimensions. Boxes are usually specified and ordered by the internal dimensions.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:BJs Wholesale Club VA.jpg|Wholesale outlet using full pallet loads.\nFile:Bag-in-box.jpg|[[Bag-In-Box]] containing liquids to dispense\nFile:Clementines.jpg|alt=Fruit Packaging Boxes|Box used for fruit packaging.

The goal is to put the case directly onto shelves and stocking locations without individually handling the unit packs or primary packages. Retailers often require products to come in shelf-ready packaging to reduce stocking costs and save labor expenses.\nSeveral specialized box designs are available.<ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US6073833A\n| title         =Shelf ready shipping container\n| pubdate       =2000\n| inventor      =Desrosiers\n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US6073833A/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US5881884A\n| title         =Shipping and display carton and blank therefor\n| pubdate       =1999\n| inventor      =Podosek\n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US5881884A/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US8342335B2\n| title         =Shelf-ready shipper display system\n| pubdate       =2013\n| inventor      =Couture \n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US8342335B2/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US20050184139A1\n| title         =Display-ready case\n| pubdate       =2005\n| inventor      =Couture \n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050184139A1/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US6523692B2\n| title         =Fold-in-half shipping/display box\n| pubdate       =2003\n| inventor      =Gregory\n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US6523692B2/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        = US5372299A\n| title         =Combined product shipping and display box\n| pubdate       =1994\n| inventor      =Edgerton \n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US5372299A/en\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent\n| number        =US5657872A\n| title         =Shipping/display container\n| pubdate       =1997\n| inventor      =Lefwich \n| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US5657872A/en\n}}</ref>\n\n==Individual mixed shipments==\n[[Image:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Box construction needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]\n\nMany items are shipped individually (in part or entirely) by express carrier, mail, or other mixed [[logistics]] systems. The demands of multiple manual handlings, automated sortation, and uncontrolled stacking in trucks or air containers put severe stress on boxes, box closures, and the contents. Boxes designed for [[unit load]] handling and storage may not be suited to mixed logistics systems.\n\n[[Less than truckload shipping]] puts more stress on corrugated shipping containers than shipment by uniform pallet loads in trucks or intermodal containers. Boxes sometimes need to be heavier construction to match the needs of the distribution system.\n\n==Government, military, and export==\nMany items being supplied to governments are handled very well: boxes are unitized, shipped on covered trucks or [[intermodal container]]s, and storage is in [[warehouse]]s. Normal \"domestic boxes\" and commercial packaging are acceptable.<ref>ASTM Standard D3951 - Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging</ref>\n\nMilitary [[materiel]], field supplies, and humanitarian aid often encounter severe handling and uncontrolled storage. Special box [[specification]]s for government shipments are often applicable. Weather-resistant fiberboards, box construction, box closure, and unitizing are needed.\n<gallery>\nFile:JTF Rita.jpg|RSCs of [[MRE]]s being off-loaded from a helicopter.

Normal \"domestic boxes\" are commonly used.\n\n[[Break bulk cargo]] needs to be water-resistant and heavy-duty. Even shipments initially sent via [[intermodal freight transport]]  may have subsequent logistics operations that are extreme and uncontrolled. The specific conditions in the destination port and the country of use need to be considered for the design of export boxes.\n\n==Dangerous and hazardous goods==\n[[File:Corrugated box - haz mat.jpg|thumb|Doublewall box with dividers for shipping four bottles of corrosive liquid]]\nShipment of [[dangerous goods]] or hazardous materials are highly regulated. Based on the [[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods]] model regulations, each country has coordinated design and performance requirements for shipment.  For example, in the US, the Department of Transportation has jurisdiction and published requirements in [[Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]. Corrugated boxes are described in 4G requirements.  Performance (severe drop test, etc.) needs to be certified for the box and contents.\n\nSome carriers have additional requirements.\n\n==Box closure==\nThe means of closing a box is an important aspect of design.  It affects the types of equipment available to production lines, the measured laboratory performance, the field performance, and the ability of end-users to easily and safely open the box.\n\nBox closures include:\n* [[Adhesive]],  water-based or [[hot-melt adhesive]]-Adhesives are applied manually or by machine. Starch-based adhesives are the choice of a corrugator as it is economic. Starch works as a medium for molds, lichens, and fungus, so to prevent it, antifungals are added in it before use.\n* [[Staple (fastener)|Staples]] - staples are used to attach the box flaps.  Small (nominally \u00bd inch crown) staples can be applied to a box with a post stapler. Wider crown (nominally 1\u00bc inch) staples can be applied with a blind clincher\n* [[Box sealing tape]], pressure-sensitive-taps are available in various widths i.e. 36, 48, and 72&nbsp;mm widths and several thicknesses. BOPP and PET are used as a backing.  Taping is done either manually or by semi-automatic [[Case sealer]].\n* [[Filament tape]], reinforced pressure-sensitive tape used to close boxes.\n* Gummed paper tape -  consists of a heavy paper in which adhesive is activated by water for bonding to the box.\n* Reinforced water activated gummed tape.  Two plies of paper with reinforcing filaments embedded between  \n* [[Strapping]]- straps are generally used for unitizing, made up of plastic(PP,PE,PET,PVC),metal(SS steel) etc. and available various width.\n* [[Shrink wrap]]- it is a thin film of LLDPE, LDPE, etc. which shrinks with the application of heat resulting in wrapping a box from all sides.it is costlier amongst all as it needs hot tunnel and material consumption will be more. However, the packed box will be protected from the environment as it will work as a barrier.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Books, general references===\n\n* \"Fibre Box Handbook\", Fibre Box Association, Chicago IL\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books/about/Corrugated_Crossroads.html?id=pLUGPQAACAAJ |title = Corrugated Crossroads: A Reference Guide for the Corrugated Containers Industry|isbn = 9780898522990|last1 = Koning|first1 = John W.|year = 1995}}\n* [http://www.fefco.org European Corrugated Board Industry]\n* [http://www.fefco.org/technical-documents/gmp-good-manufacturing-practice Good Manufacturing Practices for Corrugated and Solid Board Packaging]\n* Soroka, W, \"Fundamentals of Packaging Technology\", IoPP, 2002, {{ISBN|1-930268-25-4}}\n* \"Guide for Packaging for Small Parcel Shipments\", 2005, IoPP\n* Yam, K.

The lowest result achieved equates to the overall [[fire-resistance rating]] of the [[system]] in order to ensure that the barrier works equally well from both sides.]]\n'''Asymmetry''' is the absence of, or a violation of, [[symmetry]] (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.\n\n==In organisms==\nDue to how [[cell (biology)|cell]]s divide in [[organism]]s, asymmetry in organisms is fairly usual in at least one dimension, with [[symmetry (biology)|biological symmetry]] also being common in at least one dimension.\n\nLouis Pasteur proposed that biological molecules are asymmetric because the cosmic [i.e. physical] forces that preside over their formation are themselves asymmetric. While at his time, and even now, the symmetry of physical processes are highlighted, it is known that there are fundamental physical asymmetries, starting with time.\n\n===Asymmetry in biology===\n{{main|Symmetry in biology}}\nAsymmetry is an important and widespread trait, having evolved numerous times in many organisms and at many levels of organisation (ranging from individual cells, through organs, to entire body-shapes). Benefits of asymmetry sometimes have to do with improved spatial arrangements, such as the left [[human]] [[lung]] being smaller, and having one fewer lobes than the right lung to make room for the asymmetrical [[heart]]. In other examples, division of function between the right and left half may have been beneficial and has driven the asymmetry to become stronger. Such an explanation is usually given for mammal hand or paw preference ([[Handedness]]), an asymmetry in skill development in mammals. Training the neural pathways in a skill with one hand (or paw) may take less effort than doing the same with both hands.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nNature also provides several examples of handedness in traits that are usually symmetric. The following are examples of animals with obvious left-right asymmetries:\n[[Image:Fiddler Crab Gulf Coast.jpg|thumb|[[Fiddler crab]], ''Uca pugnax'']]\n*Most [[snail]]s, because of [[Torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] during development, show remarkable asymmetry in the shell and in the internal organs.\n*[[Fiddler crab]]s have one big claw and one small claw.\n*The [[narwhal]]'s tusk is a left incisor which can grow up to 10 feet in length and forms a left-handed helix.\n*[[Flatfish]] have evolved to swim with one side upward, and as a result have both eyes on one side of their heads.\n*Several species of [[owl]]s exhibit asymmetries in the size and positioning of their ears, which is thought to help locate prey.\n*Many animals (ranging from insects to mammals) have asymmetric male [[genitalia]]. The evolutionary cause behind this is, in most cases, still a mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schilthuizen|first1=Menno|title=Something gone awry: unsolved mysteries in the evolution of asymmetric animal genitalia|journal=Animal Biology|date=2013|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1163/15707563-00002398|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15707563-00002398}}</ref>\n\n===As an indicator of unfitness===\n\n*Certain disturbances during the development of the organism, resulting in [[birth defect]]s.\n*Injuries after cell division that cannot be biologically repaired, such as a lost [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] from an accident.\n\nSince birth defects and injuries are likely to indicate poor health of the organism, defects resulting in asymmetry often put an animal at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a mate. In particular, a degree of [[facial symmetry]] is associated with physical attractiveness, but complete symmetry is both impossible and probably unattractive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n==In structures==\nPre-modern architectural styles tended to place an emphasis on symmetry, except where extreme site conditions or historical developments lead away from this classical ideal. To the contrary, [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[Postmodernism#Architecture|postmodern architects]] became much more free to use asymmetry as a design element.\n\nWhile most bridges employ a symmetrical form due to intrinsic simplicities of design, analysis and fabrication and economical use of materials, a number of modern bridges have deliberately departed from this, either in response to site-specific considerations or to create a dramatic design statement.\n<center>\n<big>'''Some asymmetrical structures'''</big>\n<gallery widths=\"240px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:ProposedSFOBBEasternSpan.jpg|[[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge]]\nFile:MujeresBridgeCropped IMG 5968.jpg|[[Puente de la Mujer]]\nImage:Auditorio de Tenerife Pano.jpg|[[Auditorio de Tenerife]]\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-117-01, Aufkl\u00e4rungsflugzeug Blohm - Vo\u00df BV 141.jpg|[[Blohm & Voss BV 141]] aircraft\nFile:Munroe 1900 proa.jpg|A [[proa]], a form of [[outrigger canoe]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===In fire protection===\nIn [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated wall assemblies]], used in [[passive fire protection]], including, but not limited to, [[high-voltage transformer fire barriers]], asymmetry is a crucial aspect of design. When designing a facility, it is not always certain, that in the event of [[fire]], which ''side'' a fire may come from. Therefore, many building codes and fire test standards outline, that a symmetrical assembly, need only be [[Fire test|tested]] from one side, because both sides are the same. However, as soon as an assembly is asymmetrical, both sides must be tested and the test report is required to state the results for each side. In practical use, the lowest result achieved is the one that turns up in [[certification listing]]s. Neither the test sponsor, nor the laboratory can go by an opinion or deduction as to which side was in more peril as a result of contemplated testing and then test only one side. Both must be tested in order to be compliant with test standards and [[building code]]s\n\n==In mathematics==\n\nThere are no ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''a'' < ''b'' and ''b'' < ''a''.<ref>''Introduction to Set Theory'', Third Edition, Revised and Expanded: Hrbacek, Jech.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2014}}<!--missing year, page, publisher, possibly ISBN--></ref> This form of asymmetry is an [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetrical relation]].\n\n==In chemistry==\n\nCertain molecules are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]; that is, they cannot be superposed upon their mirror image. Chemically identical molecules with different chirality are called ''enantiomers''; this difference in orientation can lead to different properties in the way they react with biological systems.\n\n{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}\n\n==In physics==\n\nAsymmetry arises in physics in a number of different realms.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\n\nThe original non-statistical formulation of [[thermodynamics]] was [[Entropy (arrow of time)|asymmetrical in time]]: it claimed that the [[entropy]] in a closed system can only increase with time. This was derived from the Second Law (any of the two, [[Clausius]]' or [[Lord Kelvin]]'s statement can be used since they are equivalent) and using the [[Clausius' Theorem]] (see [[Kerson Huang]] {{ISBN|978-0471815181}}). The later theory of statistical mechanics, however, is symmetric in time. Although it states that a system significantly below maximum entropy is very likely to evolve ''towards'' higher entropy, it also states that such a system is very likely to have evolved ''from'' higher entropy.\n\n===Particle physics===\n\n[[Symmetry in physics|Symmetry]] is one of the most powerful tools in [[particle physics]], because it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. Violations of symmetry therefore present theoretical and experimental puzzles that lead to a deeper understanding of nature. Asymmetries in experimental measurements also provide powerful handles that are often relatively free from background or systematic uncertainties.\n\n====Parity violation====\n{{Main|parity (physics)}}\n\nUntil the 1950s, it was believed that fundamental physics was left-right symmetric; i.e., that interactions were invariant under [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Although parity is conserved in [[electromagnetism]], [[strong interactions]] and [[gravity]], it turns out to be violated in [[weak interactions]]. The [[Standard Model]] incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the Standard Model. A consequence of parity violation in particle physics is that [[neutrinos]] have only been observed as left-handed particles (and antineutrinos as right-handed particles).\n\nIn 1956-1957 [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], E. Ambler, R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hoppes, and R. P. Hudson found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of cobalt-60.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Simultaneously, [[Richard Garwin|R. L. Garwin]], [[Leon Lederman]], and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment and immediately verified parity violation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n====CP violation====\n{{Main|CP-violation}}\n\nAfter the discovery of the violation of parity in 1956\u201357, it was believed that the combined symmetry of parity (P) and simultaneous [[charge conjugation]] (C), called ''CP'', was preserved. For example, CP transforms a left-handed neutrino into a right-handed antineutrino. In 1964, however, [[James Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]] provided clear evidence that CP symmetry was also violated in an experiment with neutral [[kaons]].\n\nCP violation is one of the necessary conditions for the generation of a baryon asymmetry in the early universe.\n\nCombining the CP symmetry with simultaneous [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] (T) produces a combined symmetry called [[CPT symmetry]]. CPT symmetry must be preserved in any [[Lorentz invariant]] local [[quantum field theory]] with a [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. As of 2006, no violations of CPT symmetry have been observed.\n\n====Baryon asymmetry of the universe====\n{{Main|baryogenesis}}\n\nThe [[baryons]] (i.e., the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] and the atoms that they comprise) observed so far in the universe are overwhelmingly [[matter]] as opposed to [[anti-matter]]. This asymmetry is called the [[baryon asymmetry]] of the universe.\n\n====Isospin violation====\n\n[[Isospin]] is the symmetry transformation of the [[weak interactions]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in [[nuclear physics]] based on the observations that the masses of the [[neutron]] and the [[proton]] are almost identical and that the strength of the [[strong interaction]] between any pair of nucleons is the same, independent of whether they are protons or neutrons. This symmetry arises at a more fundamental level as a symmetry between up-type and down-type [[quark]]s. Isospin symmetry in the strong interactions can be considered as a subset of a larger [[flavor symmetry]] group, in which the strong interactions are invariant under interchange of different types of quarks. Including the [[strange quark]] in this scheme gives rise to the [[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] scheme for classifying mesons and baryons.\n\nIsospin is violated by the fact that the masses of the up and down quarks are different, as well as by their different electric charges. Because this violation is only a small effect in most processes that involve the strong interactions, isospin symmetry remains a useful calculational tool, and its violation introduces corrections to the isospin-symmetric results.\n\n====In collider experiments====\n\nBecause the [[weak interaction]]s violate parity, [[collider]] processes that can involve the weak interactions typically exhibit asymmetries in the distributions of the final-state particles. These asymmetries are typically sensitive to the ''difference'' in the interaction between particles and antiparticles, or between left-handed and right-handed particles. They can thus be used as a sensitive measurement of differences in interaction strength and/or to distinguish a small asymmetric signal from a large but symmetric background.\n*A '''forward-backward asymmetry''' is defined as A<sub>FB</sub>=(N<sub>F</sub>-N<sub>B</sub>)/(N<sub>F</sub>+N<sub>B</sub>), where N<sub>F</sub> is the number of events in which some particular final-state particle is moving \"forward\" with respect to some chosen direction (e.g., a final-state electron moving in the same direction as the initial-state electron beam in electron-positron collisions), while N<sub>B</sub> is the number of events with the final-state particle moving \"backward\". Forward-backward asymmetries were used by the [[LEP]] experiments to measure the difference in the interaction strength of the [[Z boson]] between left-handed and right-handed fermions, which provides a precision measurement of the [[weak mixing angle]].\n*A '''left-right asymmetry''' is defined as A<sub>LR</sub>=(N<sub>L</sub>-N<sub>R</sub>)/(N<sub>L</sub>+N<sub>R</sub>), where N<sub>L</sub> is the number of events in which some initial- or final-state particle is left-polarized, while N<sub>R</sub> is the corresponding number of right-polarized events. Left-right asymmetries in Z boson production and decay were measured at the [[Stanford Linear Collider]] using the event rates obtained with left-polarized versus right-polarized initial electron beams. Left-right asymmetries can also be defined as asymmetries in the polarization of final-state particles whose polarizations can be measured; e.g., [[tau lepton]]s.\n*A '''charge asymmetry''' or particle-antiparticle asymmetry is defined in a similar way. This type of asymmetry has been used to constrain the [[parton (particle physics)|parton distribution functions]] of protons at the [[Tevatron]] from events in which a produced [[W boson]] decays to a charged lepton. The asymmetry between positively and negatively charged leptons as a function of the direction of the W boson relative to the proton beam provides information on the relative distributions of up and down quarks in the proton. Particle-antiparticle asymmetries are also used to extract measurements of CP violation from [[Meson|B meson]] and anti-B meson production at the [[BaBar experiment|BaBar]] and [[Belle experiment|Belle]] experiments.\n\n==Lexical==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\n\nAsymmetry is also relevant to [[grammar]] and [[linguistics]], especially in the contexts of [[lexical analysis]] and [[transformational grammar]].\n\n'''Enumeration example:'''\nIn [[English language|English]], there are grammatical rules for specifying coordinate items in an enumeration or series. Similar rules exist for [[programming language]]s and [[mathematical notation]]. These rules vary, and some require lexical asymmetry to be considered grammatically correct.\n\nFor example, in standard written English:\n    We sell domesticated cats, dogs, and goldfish.        ### in-line asymmetric and grammatical\n    We sell domesticated animals (cats, dogs, goldfish).  ### in-line symmetric and grammatical\n    We sell domesticated animals (cats, dogs, goldfish,). ### in-line symmetric and ungrammatical\n    We sell domesticated animals:                         ### outline symmetric and grammatical\n      - cats\n      - dogs\n      - goldfish\n\n==See also==\n* [[Information asymmetry]]\n* [[Asymmetric multiprocessing]]\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]] (1990), ''[[The Ambidextrous Universe|The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings, 3rd edition]]'', W.H.Freeman & Co Ltd.\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Jan | first1 = Yuh-Nung | last2 = Yeh Jan | first2 = Lily | year = 1999 | title = Asymmetry across species | url = | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = E42\u2013E44 | pmid = 10559895 | doi = 10.1038/10036 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Asymmetry| ]]\n[[Category:Symmetry|*]]\n[[Category:Passive fire protection]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Absence of, or a violation of, symmetry}}\n{{about|the absence of symmetry|a specific use in mathematics|asymmetric relation|other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2011}}\n[[Image:Asymmetric (PSF).svg|thumb]]\n[[File:Durasteel fire barrier3.jpg|thumb|right|Asymmetrical [[High-voltage transformer fire barriers|fire barrier]], ''required'' by ASTM E119<ref>[https://www.astm.org/Standards/E119.htm ASTM E119 Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials]</ref> to be [[fire test]]ed on both sides. The lowest result achieved equates to the overall [[fire-resistance rating]] of the [[system]] in order to ensure that the barrier works equally well from both sides.]]\n'''Asymmetry''' is the absence of, or a violation of, [[symmetry]] (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.\n\n==In organisms==\nDue to how [[cell (biology)|cell]]s divide in [[organism]]s, asymmetry in organisms is fairly usual in at least one dimension, with [[symmetry (biology)|biological symmetry]] also being common in at least one dimension.\n\nLouis Pasteur proposed that biological molecules are asymmetric because the cosmic [i.e. physical] forces that preside over their formation are themselves asymmetric. While at his time, and even now, the symmetry of physical processes are highlighted, it is known that there are fundamental physical asymmetries, starting with time.\n\n===Asymmetry in biology===\n{{main|Symmetry in biology}}\nAsymmetry is an important and widespread trait, having evolved numerous times in many organisms and at many levels of organisation (ranging from individual cells, through organs, to entire body-shapes). Benefits of asymmetry sometimes have to do with improved spatial arrangements, such as the left [[human]] [[lung]] being smaller, and having one fewer lobes than the right lung to make room for the asymmetrical [[heart]]. In other examples, division of function between the right and left half may have been beneficial and has driven the asymmetry to become stronger. Such an explanation is usually given for mammal hand or paw preference ([[Handedness]]), an asymmetry in skill development in mammals. Training the neural pathways in a skill with one hand (or paw) may take less effort than doing the same with both hands.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nNature also provides several examples of handedness in traits that are usually symmetric. The following are examples of animals with obvious left-right asymmetries:\n[[Image:Fiddler Crab Gulf Coast.jpg|thumb|[[Fiddler crab]], ''Uca pugnax'']]\n*Most [[snail]]s, because of [[Torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] during development, show remarkable asymmetry in the shell and in the internal organs.\n*[[Fiddler crab]]s have one big claw and one small claw.\n*The [[narwhal]]'s tusk is a left incisor which can grow up to 10 feet in length and forms a left-handed helix.\n*[[Flatfish]] have evolved to swim with one side upward, and as a result have both eyes on one side of their heads.\n*Several species of [[owl]]s exhibit asymmetries in the size and positioning of their ears, which is thought to help locate prey.\n*Many animals (ranging from insects to mammals) have asymmetric male [[genitalia]]. The evolutionary cause behind this is, in most cases, still a mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schilthuizen|first1=Menno|title=Something gone awry: unsolved mysteries in the evolution of asymmetric animal genitalia|journal=Animal Biology|date=2013|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1163/15707563-00002398|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15707563-00002398}}</ref>\n\n===As an indicator of unfitness===\n\n*Certain disturbances during the development of the organism, resulting in [[birth defect]]s.\n*Injuries after cell division that cannot be biologically repaired, such as a lost [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] from an accident.\n\nSince birth defects and injuries are likely to indicate poor health of the organism, defects resulting in asymmetry often put an animal at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a mate. In particular, a degree of [[facial symmetry]] is associated with physical attractiveness, but complete symmetry is both impossible and probably unattractive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n==In structures==\nPre-modern architectural styles tended to place an emphasis on symmetry, except where extreme site conditions or historical developments lead away from this classical ideal. To the contrary, [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[Postmodernism#Architecture|postmodern architects]] became much more free to use asymmetry as a design element.\n\nWhile most bridges employ a symmetrical form due to intrinsic simplicities of design, analysis and fabrication and economical use of materials, a number of modern bridges have deliberately departed from this, either in response to site-specific considerations or to create a dramatic design statement.\n<center>\n<big>'''Some asymmetrical structures'''</big>\n<gallery widths=\"240px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:ProposedSFOBBEasternSpan.jpg|[[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge]]\nFile:MujeresBridgeCropped IMG 5968.jpg|[[Puente de la Mujer]]\nImage:Auditorio de Tenerife Pano.jpg|[[Auditorio de Tenerife]]\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-117-01, Aufkl\u00e4rungsflugzeug Blohm - Vo\u00df BV 141.jpg|[[Blohm & Voss BV 141]] aircraft\nFile:Munroe 1900 proa.jpg|A [[proa]], a form of [[outrigger canoe]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===In fire protection===\nIn [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated wall assemblies]], used in [[passive fire protection]], including, but not limited to, [[high-voltage transformer fire barriers]], asymmetry is a crucial aspect of design. When designing a facility, it is not always certain, that in the event of [[fire]], which ''side'' a fire may come from. Therefore, many building codes and fire test standards outline, that a symmetrical assembly, need only be [[Fire test|tested]] from one side, because both sides are the same. However, as soon as an assembly is asymmetrical, both sides must be tested and the test report is required to state the results for each side. In practical use, the lowest result achieved is the one that turns up in [[certification listing]]s. Neither the test sponsor, nor the laboratory can go by an opinion or deduction as to which side was in more peril as a result of contemplated testing and then test only one side. Both must be tested in order to be compliant with test standards and [[building code]]s\n\n==In mathematics==\n\nThere are no ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''a'' < ''b'' and ''b'' < ''a''.<ref>''Introduction to Set Theory'', Third Edition, Revised and Expanded: Hrbacek, Jech.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2014}}<!--missing year, page, publisher, possibly ISBN--></ref> This form of asymmetry is an [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetrical relation]].\n\n==In chemistry==\n\nCertain molecules are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]; that is, they cannot be superposed upon their mirror image. Chemically identical molecules with different chirality are called ''enantiomers''; this difference in orientation can lead to different properties in the way they react with biological systems.\n\n{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}\n\n==In physics==\n\nAsymmetry arises in physics in a number of different realms.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\n\nThe original non-statistical formulation of [[thermodynamics]] was [[Entropy (arrow of time)|asymmetrical in time]]: it claimed that the [[entropy]] in a closed system can only increase with time. This was derived from the Second Law (any of the two, [[Clausius]]' or [[Lord Kelvin]]'s statement can be used since they are equivalent) and using the [[Clausius' Theorem]] (see [[Kerson Huang]] {{ISBN|978-0471815181}}). The later theory of statistical mechanics, however, is symmetric in time. Although it states that a system significantly below maximum entropy is very likely to evolve ''towards'' higher entropy, it also states that such a system is very likely to have evolved ''from'' higher entropy.\n\n===Particle physics===\n\n[[Symmetry in physics|Symmetry]] is one of the most powerful tools in [[particle physics]], because it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. Violations of symmetry therefore present theoretical and experimental puzzles that lead to a deeper understanding of nature. Asymmetries in experimental measurements also provide powerful handles that are often relatively free from background or systematic uncertainties.\n\n====Parity violation====\n{{Main|parity (physics)}}\n\nUntil the 1950s, it was believed that fundamental physics was left-right symmetric; i.e., that interactions were invariant under [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Although parity is conserved in [[electromagnetism]], [[strong interactions]] and [[gravity]], it turns out to be violated in [[weak interactions]]. The [[Standard Model]] incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the Standard Model. A consequence of parity violation in particle physics is that [[neutrinos]] have only been observed as left-handed particles (and antineutrinos as right-handed particles).\n\nIn 1956-1957 [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], E. Ambler, R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hoppes, and R. P. Hudson found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of cobalt-60.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Simultaneously, [[Richard Garwin|R. L. Garwin]], [[Leon Lederman]], and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment and immediately verified parity violation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n====CP violation====\n{{Main|CP-violation}}\n\nAfter the discovery of the violation of parity in 1956\u201357, it was believed that the combined symmetry of parity (P) and simultaneous [[charge conjugation]] (C), called ''CP'', was preserved. For example, CP transforms a left-handed neutrino into a right-handed antineutrino. In 1964, however, [[James Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]] provided clear evidence that CP symmetry was also violated in an experiment with neutral [[kaons]].\n\nCP violation is one of the necessary conditions for the generation of a baryon asymmetry in the early universe.\n\nCombining the CP symmetry with simultaneous [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] (T) produces a combined symmetry called [[CPT symmetry]]. CPT symmetry must be preserved in any [[Lorentz invariant]] local [[quantum field theory]] with a [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. As of 2006, no violations of CPT symmetry have been observed.\n\n====Baryon asymmetry of the universe====\n{{Main|baryogenesis}}\n\nThe [[baryons]] (i.e., the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] and the atoms that they comprise) observed so far in the universe are overwhelmingly [[matter]] as opposed to [[anti-matter]]. This asymmetry is called the [[baryon asymmetry]] of the universe.\n\n====Isospin violation====\n\n[[Isospin]] is the symmetry transformation of the [[weak interactions]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in [[nuclear physics]] based on the observations that the masses of the [[neutron]] and the [[proton]] are almost identical and that the strength of the [[strong interaction]] between any pair of nucleons is the same, independent of whether they are protons or neutrons. This symmetry arises at a more fundamental level as a symmetry between up-type and down-type [[quark]]s. Isospin symmetry in the strong interactions can be considered as a subset of a larger [[flavor symmetry]] group, in which the strong interactions are invariant under interchange of different types of quarks. Including the [[strange quark]] in this scheme gives rise to the [[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] scheme for classifying mesons and baryons.\n\nIsospin is violated by the fact that the masses of the up and down quarks are different, as well as by their different electric charges. Because this violation is only a small effect in most processes that involve the strong interactions, isospin symmetry remains a useful calculational tool, and its violation introduces corrections to the isospin-symmetric results.\n\n====In collider experiments====\n\nBecause the [[weak interaction]]s violate parity, [[collider]] processes that can involve the weak interactions typically exhibit asymmetries in the distributions of the final-state particles. These asymmetries are typically sensitive to the ''difference'' in the interaction between particles and antiparticles, or between left-handed and right-handed particles. They can thus be used as a sensitive measurement of differences in interaction strength and/or to distinguish a small asymmetric signal from a large but symmetric background.\n*A '''forward-backward asymmetry''' is defined as A<sub>FB</sub>=(N<sub>F</sub>-N<sub>B</sub>)/(N<sub>F</sub>+N<sub>B</sub>), where N<sub>F</sub> is the number of events in which some particular final-state particle is moving \"forward\" with respect to some chosen direction (e.g., a final-state electron moving in the same direction as the initial-state electron beam in electron-positron collisions), while N<sub>B</sub> is the number of events with the final-state particle moving \"backward\". Forward-backward asymmetries were used by the [[LEP]] experiments to measure the difference in the interaction strength of the [[Z boson]] between left-handed and right-handed fermions, which provides a precision measurement of the [[weak mixing angle]].\n*A '''left-right asymmetry''' is defined as A<sub>LR</sub>=(N<sub>L</sub>-N<sub>R</sub>)/(N<sub>L</sub>+N<sub>R</sub>), where N<sub>L</sub> is the number of events in which some initial- or final-state particle is left-polarized, while N<sub>R</sub> is the corresponding number of right-polarized events. Left-right asymmetries in Z boson production and decay were measured at the [[Stanford Linear Collider]] using the event rates obtained with left-polarized versus right-polarized initial electron beams. Left-right asymmetries can also be defined as asymmetries in the polarization of final-state particles whose polarizations can be measured; e.g., [[tau lepton]]s.\n*A '''charge asymmetry''' or particle-antiparticle asymmetry is defined in a similar way. This type of asymmetry has been used to constrain the [[parton (particle physics)|parton distribution functions]] of protons at the [[Tevatron]] from events in which a produced [[W boson]] decays to a charged lepton. The asymmetry between positively and negatively charged leptons as a function of the direction of the W boson relative to the proton beam provides information on the relative distributions of up and down quarks in the proton.
