She was sent to an isolation unit and was discharged after three months there. As a result of her hospitalisation, she missed Christmas and celebrated both Christmas and her birthday later, in March 1920; her mother even sourced a Christmas tree for the occasion.\n\nHer mother was very protective of her as a result of her spell in hospital, not allowing her to visit friends or play in the street for a long time afterwards. Lynn recalled her mother was not as strict to her elder brother Roger as she was to her.\n\nShe began performing publicly at the age of seven and adopted her maternal grandmother Margaret Lynn's maiden name as her stage name when she was eleven.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lynn|first1=Vera|title=Some Sunny Day|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2009|location=London, UK|page= 43|isbn=978-0-00-731815-5}}</ref> Her first radio broadcast, with the [[Joe Loss]] Orchestra, was in 1935.

Her last single, \"[[I Love This Land]]\", was released to mark the end of the [[Falklands War]]. In 2009, at the age of 92, she became the oldest living artist to top the [[UK Albums Chart]], with compilation album ''[[We'll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn]]''.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Lynn also scored a number one in 2014, when she was 97, with the collection ''Vera Lynn: National Treasure'', and remains the oldest person to top the album charts. Further, she released the [[compilation album]]  of hits ''[[Vera Lynn 100]]'' in 2017, to commemorate her centennial year, and it was a number-3 hit, making her the first centenarian performer to have an album in the charts.\n\nShe has devoted much time and energy to charity work connected with ex-servicemen, disabled children, and breast cancer. She is held in great affection by veterans of the [[Second World War]] and in 2000 was named the Briton who best exemplified the spirit of the 20th century.\n\n==Early life==\nVera Margaret Welch was born in [[East Ham]], now part of the London Borough of  [[Newham]]<!-- Do not change to London, East Ham was in Essex in 1917 -->, on 20 March 1917, the daughter of Bertram Samuel Welch (1883\u20131955) and Annie Martin (1889\u20131975), who had married in 1913.<ref>\"Welch Bertram S. & Martin Annie\" in ''Register of Marriages for West Ham Registration District'', vol. 4a (March quarter, 1913), p. 43</ref> Her elder brother Roger Welch (4 March 1914 \u2013 3 March 2017) also became a centenarian.\n\nIn 1919, when Lynn was two years old, she fell ill with diphtheritic croup and nearly died as a result. She was sent to an isolation unit and was discharged after three months there. As a result of her hospitalisation, she missed Christmas and celebrated both Christmas and her birthday later, in March 1920; her mother even sourced a Christmas tree for the occasion.\n\nHer mother was very protective of her as a result of her spell in hospital, not allowing her to visit friends or play in the street for a long time afterwards. Lynn recalled her mother was not as strict to her elder brother Roger as she was to her.\n\nShe began performing publicly at the age of seven and adopted her maternal grandmother Margaret Lynn's maiden name as her stage name when she was eleven.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lynn|first1=Vera|title=Some Sunny Day|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2009|location=London, UK|page= 43|isbn=978-0-00-731815-5}}</ref> Her first radio broadcast, with the [[Joe Loss]] Orchestra, was in 1935.
