Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in {{nobr|October 2017.}} While waiting for dinner, he observed that the other patrons were all staring at a television while an episode of [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night telling him he needed to come in the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.

He has extensively published works in the field of the [[Learning Sciences]] and on learning technology design, and made significant contributions since 1981 to the understanding of how people learn with technology.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nPea was born in [[Highland Park, Michigan]] on July 5, 1952. He received a dual major B.A. in [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] from [[Michigan State University]] with an independently declared major in Cognition (1974) working with his mentor and friend [[Stephen Toulmin]], and later, a D.Phil. in [[developmental psychology]] from [[Oxford University]] (1978), while studying as a [[Rhodes Scholar]], working with his advisor [[Jerome Bruner]]. After studying child language and cognitive development from 1975 to 1980, his research concerns were attracted to understanding how innovations in computing and communications technologies can significantly influence learning, thinking, collaboration, and educational systems.\n\n=== Development of the learning sciences ===\n\nPea is a key figure in the development of the [[learning sciences]] as a recognized field of research and graduate study. He founded and served as the first director of the first learning sciences doctoral program, at [[Northwestern University]] (1991), directing the NSF-funded field-building [[Center for Innovative Learning Technologies]] [http://cilt.concord.org/], and launching in 2002 the Learning Sciences and Technology Design (LSTD: http://ed.stanford.edu/academics/doctoral/lstd) program at [[Stanford University]]. In 2004\u20132005, Pea was President of the [[International Society for the Learning Sciences]].\n\nPea was one of the first research scientists to build the [[Bank Street College]] Center for Children in Technology (1981\u20131986), the first social sciences center devoted to studying children's learning with technology. Later, recruited by [[John Seely Brown]] and [[Jim Greeno]] to contribute to the development of the intellectual agenda of the Palo Alto, California\u2013based think-tank, The [[Institute for Research on Learning]] (1988\u20131991), he developed their K-12 learning technologies emphasis, with pioneering work on distributed intelligence [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=m8Yna0cjxAgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA47&ots=-sxx-MpVFw&sig=uIf7RN8iIvJMlO2gc_B4HXx6NhM#v=onepage&q&f=false], learning by multimedia authoring [https://stanford.academia.edu/RoyPea/Papers/261515/Learning_Through_Multimedia], and science learning with dynamic diagramming tools [http://www.stanford.edu/~roypea/HTML1%20Folder/Dynagrams.html].\n\n=== Research centers and industry advisor ===\n\nIn 1996, after a year at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, Pea was recruited to [[SRI International]], where he worked with colleagues to build a major national [[Center for Technology in Learning]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctl.sri.com/|title=Center for Technology in Learning|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> until recruited to Stanford University in 2001. At Stanford, Pea co-founded Stanford's ''H-STAR Institute'' (Human Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research) with [[Byron Reeves]], and is now H-STAR Institute Director.<ref>[http://hstar.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/ H-STAR Institute]</ref> He is also co-director of the National Science Foundation-funded ''LIFE Center'',<ref>[http://life-slc.org LIFE Center]</ref> one of six national [[Science of Learning Centers]], whose studies seek to inform better bridging of the sciences of informal and formal learning.\n\nIn addition to serving as founding editor of the Cambridge University Press Series [[Learning in Doing: Cognitive, Social and Computational Perspectives]] since 1987,<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/aus/series/sSeries.asp?code=LID]</ref> Pea was co-author of the 2000 National Academy Press volume ''How People Learn'',<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309070368]</ref> Co-Editor of the 2007 Book ''Video Research in the Learning Sciences'',<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Video-Research-Learning-Sciences-Goldman/dp/080585360X]</ref> and co-author of the 2010 US National Educational Technology Plan.<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/technology/netp-2010]</ref>\n\nPea served from 1999 to 2009 as a founding director for [[Teachscape]],<ref>[http://www.teachscape.com/html/ts/nps/index.html]</ref> a company he co-founded with Mark Atkinson in 1999 that provides comprehensive K-12 teacher professional development services incorporating web-based video case studies of standards-based teaching and communities of learners. In addition to academic research and teaching, he advises a number of companies, non-profits, research centers, projects and federal agencies or foundations involved in learning with technologies.

He has extensively published works in the field of the [[Learning Sciences]] and on learning technology design, and made significant contributions since 1981 to the understanding of how people learn with technology.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nPea was born in [[Highland Park, Michigan]] on July 5, 1952. He received a dual major B.A. in [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] from [[Michigan State University]] with an independently declared major in Cognition (1974) working with his mentor and friend [[Stephen Toulmin]], and later, a D.Phil. in [[developmental psychology]] from [[Oxford University]] (1978), while studying as a [[Rhodes Scholar]], working with his advisor [[Jerome Bruner]]. After studying child language and cognitive development from 1975 to 1980, his research concerns were attracted to understanding how innovations in computing and communications technologies can significantly influence learning, thinking, collaboration, and educational systems.\n\n=== Development of the learning sciences ===\n\nPea is a key figure in the development of the [[learning sciences]] as a recognized field of research and graduate study. He founded and served as the first director of the first learning sciences doctoral program, at [[Northwestern University]] (1991), directing the NSF-funded field-building [[Center for Innovative Learning Technologies]] [http://cilt.concord.org/], and launching in 2002 the Learning Sciences and Technology Design (LSTD: http://ed.stanford.edu/academics/doctoral/lstd) program at [[Stanford University]]. In 2004\u20132005, Pea was President of the [[International Society for the Learning Sciences]].\n\nPea was one of the first research scientists to build the [[Bank Street College]] Center for Children in Technology (1981\u20131986), the first social sciences center devoted to studying children's learning with technology. Later, recruited by [[John Seely Brown]] and [[Jim Greeno]] to contribute to the development of the intellectual agenda of the Palo Alto, California\u2013based think-tank, The [[Institute for Research on Learning]] (1988\u20131991), he developed their K-12 learning technologies emphasis, with pioneering work on distributed intelligence [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=m8Yna0cjxAgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA47&ots=-sxx-MpVFw&sig=uIf7RN8iIvJMlO2gc_B4HXx6NhM#v=onepage&q&f=false], learning by multimedia authoring [https://stanford.academia.edu/RoyPea/Papers/261515/Learning_Through_Multimedia], and science learning with dynamic diagramming tools [http://www.stanford.edu/~roypea/HTML1%20Folder/Dynagrams.html].\n\n=== Research centers and industry advisor ===\n\nIn 1996, after a year at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, Pea was recruited to [[SRI International]], where he worked with colleagues to build a major national [[Center for Technology in Learning]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctl.sri.com/|title=Center for Technology in Learning|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> until recruited to Stanford University in 2001. At Stanford, Pea co-founded Stanford's ''H-STAR Institute'' (Human Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research) with [[Byron Reeves]], and is now H-STAR Institute Director.<ref>[http://hstar.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/ H-STAR Institute]</ref> He is also co-director of the National Science Foundation-funded ''LIFE Center'',<ref>[http://life-slc.org LIFE Center]</ref> one of six national [[Science of Learning Centers]], whose studies seek to inform better bridging of the sciences of informal and formal learning.\n\nIn addition to serving as founding editor of the Cambridge University Press Series [[Learning in Doing: Cognitive, Social and Computational Perspectives]] since 1987,<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/aus/series/sSeries.asp?code=LID]</ref> Pea was co-author of the 2000 National Academy Press volume ''How People Learn'',<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309070368]</ref> Co-Editor of the 2007 Book ''Video Research in the Learning Sciences'',<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Video-Research-Learning-Sciences-Goldman/dp/080585360X]</ref> and co-author of the 2010 US National Educational Technology Plan.<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/technology/netp-2010]</ref>\n\nPea served from 1999 to 2009 as a founding director for [[Teachscape]],<ref>[http://www.teachscape.com/html/ts/nps/index.html]</ref> a company he co-founded with Mark Atkinson in 1999 that provides comprehensive K-12 teacher professional development services incorporating web-based video case studies of standards-based teaching and communities of learners. In addition to academic research and teaching, he advises a number of companies, non-profits, research centers, projects and federal agencies or foundations involved in learning with technologies. Pea is also a learning sciences advisor to [[HIV/AIDS]] education nonprofit [[TeachAIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|title=TeachAIDS: Team|url=http://teachaids.org/team.php|work=[[TeachAIDS]]|date=16 December 2010|accessdate=16 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610080734/http://www.teachaids.org/team.php|archivedate=10 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe is a Fellow of the [[National Academy of Education]] [http://www.naeducation.org/], [[Association for Psychological Science]], The [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], the [[American Educational Research Association]], and the [[International Society for the Learning Sciences]] [https://www.isls.org/about/isls-fellows].\n\n==Select publications==\n* Approximately 230 papers in academic journals, 6 co-edited volumes\n* Nasir, N., Lee, C., Pea, R., & De Royston, M.M.

It was founded by [[Steve Chen]], [[Chad Hurley]] and [[Jawed Karim]] in February 2005, and the first video was \"[[Me at the zoo]]\" uploaded by Karim on his channel in April 2005. Although the most-viewed videos were initially [[viral video]]s, such as \"[[Judson Laipply#\"Evolution of Dance\"|Evolution of Dance]]\" and \"[[Charlie Bit My Finger]]\", the most-viewed videos were increasingly related to [[music videos]]. In fact, since [[Lady Gaga]]'s \"[[Bad Romance]]\", every video that has reached the top of the \"most-viewed YouTube videos\" list has been a music video. Although some of the previously most-viewed videos are no longer listed on the site, reaching the top of the list is still considered a tremendous feat.\n\nIn November 2005, a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertisement featuring Brazilian football player [[Ronaldinho]] became the first video to reach one million views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/03/31/2005-nike-video-featuring-ronaldinho-becomes-first-youtube-film-reach-one-million|title=2005: Nike video featuring Ronaldinho becomes first YouTube film to reach one million views}}</ref>\n\n==Billion View Club==\nAn early metric of a video's popularity was the so-called Billion View Club, videos which had succeeded in reaching over 1 billion views since their initial upload.<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-billion-view-club-youtubes-most-watched-music-videos-162074/|title=The Billion View Club: YouTube's Most Watched Music Videos|first=Brittany|last=Spanos|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2012, \"[[Gangnam Style (music video)|Gangnam Style]]\" became the first video to reach one billion views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/1481275/psys-gangnam-style-hits-1-billion-views-on-youtube|title=PSY's 'Gangnam Style' Hits 1 Billion Views on YouTube}}</ref> By June 2015, only \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)#Music video|Baby]]\" had managed to pass this threshold; but, by October 2015, a total of ten videos had done so,<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> and the number grew further to 100 in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/02/21/there-are-now-over-100-youtube-videos-with-at-least-a-billion-views/#1758c6056415|title=There Are Now Over 100 YouTube Videos With At Least A Billion Views}}</ref> Considering older videos that pre-dated YouTube's creation in 2005 but were added later:\n* \"[[November Rain]]\" by [[Guns N' Roses]] became the first video made prior to YouTube's creation to reach this threshold by July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/guns-n-roses-november-rain-first-90s-video-1-billion-views-youtube/|title=Guns N' Roses' 'November Rain' Is First '90s Video to Top 1 Billion YouTube Views|first=Michael|last=Christopher|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Loudwire]]}}</ref>\n* \"[[Numb (Linkin Park song)|Numb]]\" by [[Linkin Park]] was the first 2000s video predating YouTube to reach 1 billion views in November 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/linkin-parks-numb-video-has-reached-1-billion-views-on-youtube|title=Linkin Park's 'Numb' video has reached 1 billion views on YouTube}}</ref>\n* \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] was the first 1970s video (and pre-1990s video) to reach 1 billion views in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/22/bohemian-rhapsody-becomes-first-pre-1990s-song-rack-billion/|title=Bohemian Rhapsody becomes first pre-1990s song to rack up billion hits on YouTube, site announces|first=Jessica|last=Carpani|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n* Guns N' Roses' \"[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]\" was the first 1980s video to reach 1 billion views in October 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/guns-n-roses-sweet-child-o-mine-1-billion-views-1203371701/|title=Guns N' Roses' 'Sweet Child O' Mine' Becomes First '80s Music Video's to Hit 1 Billion YouTube Views|first=Breanna|last=Bell|date=October 15, 2019|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nWith numerous videos readily clearing one billion views by 2018, more interest has been on two and three-billion views and higher metrics.
