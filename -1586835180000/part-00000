The ambassadors were working on plans for Elizabeth's marriage to [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]]. The \"Foster Children\" laid siege to the \"Fortress of Perfect Beautie\". After two days of challenges the Children admitted defeat. The entertainment was understood to convey the idea that Elizabeth was unattainable, devised by the opposition to the French marriage.<ref>Janet Dickinson, ''Court Politics and the Earl of Essex'' (Abingdon, 2016), pp. 29\u201330.</ref>\n\nGreville, Philip Sidney and [[Sir Edward Dyer]] were members of the \"[[Areopagus (poetry)|Areopagus]]\", the literary clique which, under the leadership of [[Gabriel Harvey]], supported the introduction of classical metres into English verse.

Haywood then turned the knife on himself. Greville's physicians treated his wounds by filling them with pig fat. Rather than disinfecting them, the pig fat turned rancid and infected the wounds, and he died in agony four weeks after the attack. His body was brought back to Warwick, and he was buried in the [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]], and on his tomb was inscribed the epitaph he had composed:\n<center>Folk Grevill<br>Servant to Queene Elizabeth<br>Conceller to King James<br>and Frend to Sir Philip Sidney.<br>Trophaeum Peccati.<ref name=\"Tudor Place\">{{cite web|title=Fulke GREVILLE  (1\u00ba B.

The ambassadors were working on plans for Elizabeth's marriage to [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]]. The \"Foster Children\" laid siege to the \"Fortress of Perfect Beautie\". After two days of challenges the Children admitted defeat. The entertainment was understood to convey the idea that Elizabeth was unattainable, devised by the opposition to the French marriage.<ref>Janet Dickinson, ''Court Politics and the Earl of Essex'' (Abingdon, 2016), pp. 29-30.</ref>\n\nGreville, Philip Sidney and [[Sir Edward Dyer]] were members of the \"[[Areopagus (poetry)|Areopagus]]\", the literary clique which, under the leadership of [[Gabriel Harvey]], supported the introduction of classical metres into English verse.

Haywood then turned the knife on himself. Greville's physicians treated his wounds by filling them with pig fat. Rather than disinfecting them, the pig fat turned rancid and infected the wounds, and he died in agony four weeks after the attack.

Her historical scholarship appears in her book ''[[Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848]]'' (Harvard University Press, 2005). This anthropologically influenced cultural history examines how understandings of medicine, religion, race, and the body informed how Westerners in both Europe and later the U.S. understood and responded to the Chinese and their healing traditions from the thirteenth century through 1848.\n\nMore recently, she published ''Chinese Medicine and Healing: An Illustrated History'' (co-edited with [[TJ Hinrichs]], Harvard University Press, 2013). She is currently writing a book on the cultural and social history of Chinese medicine and healing traditions in the United States, beginning in 1849 and continuing up through the present. As part of this project, Dr. Barnes has conducted fieldwork funded by the [[National Library of Medicine]], and gathered hundreds of oral histories in regions throughout the United States, while also building an archive of related source materials.\n\nA second major scholarly area to which Barnes has contributed is the interdisciplinary and cross-cultural study of relationships between religious, medical, and therapeutic traditions. She founded the \u201cReligions, Medicines, and Healing Group\u201d program unit of the American Academy of Religion (AAR) in 2002, and served as co-chair until 2010, when she moved to the group's Steering Committee.

Before the arrival of St. Kevin this glen would have been desolate and remote and would have been ideal for a secluded retreat.\n\n===Hermitage===\n[[File:S.kevin's bed.jpg|thumb|St. Kevin's bed]]\nKevin was ordained by Bishop Lugidus and, following his ordination, he moved on to Glendalough in order to avoid the company of his followers. He lived as a hermit in a cave (a [[Bronze Age]] tomb now known as St. Kevin's Bed), to which he was led, in the account of the ''Vita'', by an angel. \n\nSt. Kevin's Bed can best be described as a man-made cave cut in the rock face very close to the edge of the mountain. It overlooks the [[Glendalough Upper Lake|upper lake]] from a height of about 30 feet (10 metres). The approach to the cave is very difficult, with access to it through a rectangular space and a short passageway 3&nbsp;ft. (1 metre) high and 2\u00bd ft. wide. The inner or main part of the cave is just 4&nbsp;ft. wide (1.5 metres) and less than 3&nbsp;ft.(1 metre) high. It is reasonable to assume that the cave could only have been used as a sleeping place, and would have been impossible for an adult to stand upright in, so it is quite likely that St Kevin only used it as his bed, or a place for pious prayer or [[meditation]]. Dr. Leask expresses the opinion that this cave was constructed long before Kevin's time and it was probably the first and oldest piece of work to be undertaken by man in the glen.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere is a legend which claims that [[Lorc\u00e1n Ua Tuathail|St Laurence O'Toole]] used the \"bed\" as he frequently made penitential visits to Glendalough, especially during the season of [[Lent]]. [[Michael Dwyer]], the famous Wicklow rebel, is reputed to have taken shelter in the \"bed\" while he was on the run from British soldiers. The story goes that he escaped capture one morning by diving into the lake and swimming to the opposite side. Today, it is highly dangerous to try to approach the \"bed\" from the side of Lugduff mountain. Visitors, in the interests of their own safety, should be content with a distant view of it.\n\n===Monastery===\n[[Image:St Kevin - Glendalough.jpg|thumb|right|The chapel of St Kevin at [[Glendalough]]]]\nKevin lived the life of a hermit there with an extraordinary closeness to nature. His companions were the animals and birds all around him. He lived as a hermit for seven years wearing only animal skins, sleeping on stones and eating very sparingly.\n\nHe went barefoot and spent his time in prayer. Disciples were soon attracted to Kevin and a further settlement enclosed by a wall, called Kevin's Cell, was established nearer the lakeshore. By 540 Saint Kevin's fame as a teacher and holy man had spread far and wide. Many people came to seek his help and guidance. In time Glendalough grew into a renowned seminary of saints and scholars and the parent of several other monasteries.\n\nIn 544, Kevin went to the Hill of Uisneach in [[County Westmeath]] to visit the holy abbots, Sts. [[Columba]], [[Comgall]] and Cannich. He then proceeded to [[Clonmacnoise]], where [[Cieran|St. Cieran]] had died three days before. Having firmly established his community, he retired into solitude for four years, and only returned to Glendalough at the earnest entreaty of his monks.<ref name=edmonds/> Until his death around 618, Kevin presided over his monastery in Glendalough, living his life by fasting, praying and teaching.\nSt Kevin is one of the patron saints of the diocese of Dublin.\n\nHe belonged to the second order of Irish saints.<ref name=edmonds/> Eventually, Glendalough, with its seven churches, became one of the chief [[pilgrimage]] destinations in Ireland.\n\n[[Image:Stkevinschurch2.jpg|thumb|right|St Kevin's Church, with the Round Tower of Glendalough in the background at right.]]\n\n==Legacy and veneration==\nKevin of Glendalough was canonized by [[Pope Pius X]] on 9 December 1903 ([[cultus confirmation]]). \n\nOne of the most widely known poems of the Nobel prizewinner [[Seamus Heaney]], 'St Kevin and the Blackbird', relates the story of Kevin holding out his hand with trance-like stillness while a blackbird builds a nest in it, lays eggs, the eggs hatch and the chicks fledge.<ref>Heaney, Seamus, ''The Spirit Level'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1996), pp20-1.</ref>\nA  series of paintings by the Welsh artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] around 2009 depicted the story of Kevin and the blackbird, by way of Heaney's poem.<ref>\"The saint's arm is held outward like half of a crucifixion, reaching towards infinity, but on the open palm is one of the great works of time: a nest with three eggs.\" [[Marly Youmans]], 'Fire in the Labyrinth' in Simon Callow, Andrew Green, Rex Harley, Clive Hicks-Jenkins, Kathe Koja, Anita Mills, Montserrat Prat, Jacqueline Thalmann, Damian Walford Davies and Marly Youmans, Clive Hicks-Jenkins (2011: Lund Humphries) {{ISBN|978-1-84822-082-9}}, pp. 99\u2013123</ref>\n\nKevin is remembered in popular culture as an [[ascetic]]. This is commemorated in a [[folk song]] about him which describes a legend claiming that he drowned a woman who attempted to seduce him. This was recorded and made popular by [[The Dubliners]]. The opening verse is as follows: \"In Glendalough, there lived an auld saint, renowned for his learning and piety, his manners were curious and quaint, and he looked upon girls with disparity.\"\n\nThe alternate version of this event has St Kevin pushing the girl into a pond of freezing water which startles her into a moral and religious epiphany after which she is known as St Bridget. Her transformation from a woman of loose morals into Ireland's first female saint echoing the similar transformation of Mary Magdalen by Christ.   \n\nThe independent film-maker [[Kevin Smith]] refers irreverently to his namesake \"Saint Kevin\" and the key events of his life in the introduction to ''[[Sold Out: A Threevening with Kevin Smith]]'', his 2008 live Q & A show.\n\nKevin is referenced several times in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' by [[James Joyce]].
