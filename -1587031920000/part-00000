Some have suggested that it should be open for the poor but not the rich. Looking at it from an ethical perspective, it is unfair that less unfortunate people will miss opportunities. Ethically, everybody should get a chance to acquire an education. As Maria Castle puts it, everyone should be allowed to qualify. For instance, all persons should be able to be qualified to work as a police officer, even though blind or deaf people are not promised such an opportunity. Free education, especially the higher leaning level, should be free for everyone so that they are open up for opportunities, although the opportunities are not assured.\n\nEveryone needs education. Since education is vital for the well being and survival in almost every field like academics, social, and even politics, everyone needs to acquire it. To solve the current world problems like poverty, anger, and malnutrition, everyone has to receive education, and there is a need for making education free and accessible to everyone. It is, therefore, vital to make it free for everyone so that we move forward towards one direction as a nation (Danny). In the following paragraphs, we are going to have a look at the importance of education in various fields and why it should be free for everyone.\n\nJust like any other topic with cons and pros, providing free education for all also has its drawbacks. With the provision of free education for all, the financials used will have to come from somewhere. And the most likely place is from taxes, this will lead to an increase in taxes for everyone, which may become a burden also. As Anderson puts it, providing free education for all will not allow the younger generation to know how to manage their finances. Of all the experiences that students learn in college, budgeting for their funds is one of them. With the loans that students get in college, they will be able to learn how to save so that they can pay off the loans in time (Carl). This experience will not be existing if education was free.\n\nMost students work hard in college since they want to spend every coin that their parents have paid. This makes college valuable. Making education free will devalue the degree acquired in college, for students will not see the importance of working hard since they are not paying anything. With free education, people try to finish college to avoid more depts. With more people being enrolled in schools, more finances will have to be allocated to schools. This will increase the taxes that will cater for education-related purposes. The cons of free education for all do not seem to hold a lot of weight as the pros seem to solve a large number of issues (Anderson).\n\nEducation plays a crucial role in the elimination of poverty. From recent estimates, 10 percent of the world's population survived on less than 1.9 dollars a day. This was a significant improvement from the 1990 estimates, where 36 percent of the people lived in extreme poverty. This exceptional contribution is as a result of making education available for everyone. With the provision of free education to everyone, a total of 171 million people could be saved from extreme poverty. This is equal to a 12 percent decrease in the world total (world bank). Targeting the poor and the marginalized to educate them can be a solution to development among the communities. With education, there will be no transmission of poverty from one generation to another. In a speech by Vila Kulild, he states how the provision of education to marginalized communities can solve the poverty problems. He says that parents in the marginalized communities invest all their income in educating their kids since they believe that education is the key to opportunities.\n\nEducation is responsible for breaking the circle of poverty. It has several impacts on the society that seem unrelated, and such effects are the girl's education, this has helped to lower the number of prenatal deaths.\u00a0 With education, people will be able to make better choices and decisions that will help their families and community at large. In India, for instance, a lack of individuals to take part in educational activities carried out by the government contributes to their extreme poverty. Some who have recognized the importance of these programs have taken part in the participation. Thus, they have acquired an education that has enabled them to get employment, therefore, alleviating their poverty status. It is essential to learn necessary literacy skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic since they would help them carry out their jobs with satisfaction (Kapur). All this will happen if education was made free for them (the world bank).\n\nAccording to a study, Americans with more education have a longer lifespan and live a healthier life than those who have spent a few years in school. The links between health and education are not only sophisticated but also related to the skills and opportunities that the individual has had. Education has a direct and indirect impact on health. For instance, with better education, an individual is likely to get a job that provides health benefits such as health insurance policy and paid retirement. Individuals with less knowledge are more likely to get a job with fewer benefits. People who are educated tend to earn more than the uneducated. Thus, they lead a healthier life.\n\nWe can, therefore, conclude that families with education, take healthy foods, have time to do exercise, and can pay for health services. On the contrary, individuals with no education are prone to getting illnesses in hard times. With lower education comes low income, individuals who did not have the opportunity to get an education are likely to lack an insurance cover and have a lower salary. A research carried out in 2010, more than 27% of adults who did not get high school education reported having been unable to see a clinician due to the cost that came with it. The ability to access healthcare services determine how one can manage chronic illnesses such as diabetes. From CDC reports, adults who completed high school education were updated about cancer screening as compared to their counterparts.\n\nEducation also plays a key role in the economic development of a nation. As there is no country that can achieve its economic success without educating its people. Education opens the people's understanding of themselves and the world at large. With education for all people are able to be creative and come up with ideas that will propel the nation forward. Education determines the standards of living of a nation, and also its productivity. It ensures that the country is at par with other countries in the world market. Therefore, by ensuring that education is free for all, will not only benefit the citizens but also the nation involved (Ilhan).\n\nEducation should be free for everybody since it has social and phycological benefits. People who have better education are spared of the social and economic hardships. Those who did not get the chance to acquire education have less social support, lack a sense of control over their lives, and often have low self-esteem. Individuals with less knowledge are prone to what studies have called \"allosteric load.\" This means the results that come when an individual has been continuously exposed to phycological stress. People with no education or less education are more likely to be exposed to higher allosteric load, which may rule them to acquire diseases such as cardiovascular disease and infections. Thus, they are associated with a higher death rate. With education, one gets to learn skills that are not thought in classrooms, such as flexibility, creating relationships, and the ability to negotiate. With the large social networks formed in school, they are able to create connections that may benefit them financially, economically, or emotionally.\n\nAccording to Albert, a health expert, poor neighborhoods are most likely to lead to poor schools, which will lead to poor education, poor education will lead to the weak workforce, with poor work will lead back to the start, which is poor neighborhoods. With less knowledge, people are likely to live in a poor community that lacks or has limited resources. In the United States, stores with healthy foods are less likely to be found in fewer college-educated individuals than in tracts with college-educated persons. With education, people tend to live in neighborhoods that are friendly, that have sidewalks and parks to encourage physical activities such as cycling. With lower crime rates in the educated neighborhood, residents are at a lower risk of death threats from violence and the stress of living in an unsafe place. With lower education, people tend to pollute the environment as less political influence is often targeted in the areas.\n\nIn countries such as the United States, education for every kid is a right that one should not be denied. While in other parts of the world, kids cannot go to school due to factors such as conflict, disaster, and poor living conditions. Despite the excellent conditions provided by the US government, approximately 6.2 million students dropped out of school who were aged between 16 to 24 years in 2007(Russell 1-130). Most of these students would have ended in jobs such as nursing or teachers (these jobs are of high demand) they end up in being drug dealers or working in very low paying jobs. Conflicts happen everywhere. It is through education that individuals escape their homes where there is conflict. As Dr Edwin puts it, knowledge does not only save a life but also sustains it.\n\nSome argue that education will be meaningless if it was free. They suggest that people can use education as a way of getting out of work and doing nothing. High school students cannot get jobs; thus, their education should be free. However, when an individual can acquire employment and can live their lives, there is no need to educate them as they will not get the chance to feel the agony of paying thousands of fees. By allowing them to pay their fees, they are able to learn better decision making and thinking skills. \u00a0If all education is free, then less thought will be required, and students may use taxpayers' money to pursue courses that do not suit them. With this argument, the individuals who are genuinely financially disadvantaged may tend to be left out. The government should support many scholarship programs for the less privileged students to make sure that they get educated. Also, these programs can cater for the older people who never got a chance to go to school so that they get equipped with essential skills that will see them through to another day.\n\nEducation should be made free for all but on conditions that will maintain its quality. Governments and bodies should create policies that will monitor every individual to make sure that they get access to education and complete their education. Providing education for everyone will not only ensure an excellent lifestyle for individuals but also a longer lifespan. Mothers with good education tend to have few children and are often married later in their lives. Educated people tend to make better health choices. According to a study, educated individuals have shown great success in carrying out self-care services in managing their chronic illnesses. Thus, ensuring that education is free and accessible for all is vital for the well-being of any nation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fallout of the 2009 Irish government budget]]\n* [[2010 student protest in Dublin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n# Sav ich, Carl. \"Inclusion: The Pros and Cons--A Critical Review.\" Online Submission, (2008).\n# Perry, Guillermo E., et al.

The class as a whole is denoted by the WAG-9i prefix in its model number, although there is a technical variant of this class named WAG-9H, with the \"H\" meaning \"Heavy\".\n\nThe WAG-9H/9Hi locomotives are the second heaviest in regular service in India, the only freight-dedicated three-phase AC locomotives in the country, and the only electric locomotives in India fitted with IGBT. They are also the freight locomotives with the highest operational speed in India.\n[[File:BHILAI based WAG9H 31283 standing in Katihar goods yard.jpg|thumb|Bhilai based WAG9H standing at Katihar goods yard]]\n[[File:LDH_based_WAG9HC_32523_with_BCNA_entering_Katihar.jpg|thumb|Ludhiana based WAG9HC with BCNA entering Katihar]]\n[[File:Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake.jpg|thumb|280px|Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake]]\n[[File:WAG9-31179.jpg|thumb|280px|Indian Railways WAG-9 class AC electric locomotive no. 31179 pauses at Agra Fort railway station (Indian Railways station code AF), at the head of a heavily laden eastbound coal train.]]\n[[File:LGD based WAG-9 Locomotives at Ghatkesar 02.JPG|thumb|280px|[[Lallaguda]] based WAG-9 Locomotives at [[Ghatkesar]]]]\n[[File:WAG 9 - Navshatak.JPG|thumb|280px|WAG 9 - Navshatak]]\n[[File:WAG 9 at Vasai Road Station.jpg|thumb|280px|WAG 9 at [[Vasai Road railway station|Vasai Road]]]]\n\n==Introduction==\nThe WAG-9 [[locomotive]] is referred to as the \"Heavy Haul\" freight locomotive of the Indian Railways (IR). It was conceived in response to the extreme growth in the rail freight transportation sector, which is considered to be of great importance to the growth of the [[economy of India]]. The need for more [[electrification]] and electric locomotives in India had increased. Around 60-65% of the freight haulage of the IR takes place on the electrified section of the Golden Quadrilateral (Indian Railways) and diagonals (which account for 25% of the route). These are very busy routes, so clearance is a necessity. Electrical powers give it a great sectional clearance ability. Thus, these locomotives are important for the Indian Railways.\n\nThese locomotives have entered the [[Western Railway zone]] of [[Mumbai]]. The first 22 units were imported from [[Adtranz]] (ABB). Of these, the first six were fully assembled and rest were in kit form. Again in the kit form, seven were completely knocked down and the rest were partially assembled. CLW started producing these traction motors on 1 November 1999. The units built by ABB have double-pan [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]] while the CLW built units have single pan pantographs which are common in India. This class had a capacity to MU several units, but IR restricts them to two, because of dynamic loading restriction on most bridges. Regenerative brakes provide about 260&nbsp;kN of braking effort.\n\nThe WAG-9H also has different application software than the WAG-9. The first WAG-9H was commissioned on 30 June 2000. The #30130 prototype was housed at [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh railway station|Gomoh]] (GMO). This was then converted back to standard WAG-9 in 2002. This unit has a livery of twin white stripes on green, instead of yellow stripe on green, seen on the other WAG-9(x)s.\n\nThe WAG-9i was introduced in 2010, and was #31215. It was homed at the GMO shed. With IGBT, even if one traction motor failed, other traction motors can function with a total output of 5500&nbsp;hp.\n\nNewer WAG-9 units have \"CLW Glorious 50 years\" marked on their sides. Some WAG-9(x)s are fitted with a solid cowcatcher while others are fitted with grilled cowcatchers. Some have American style flasher lamps while others have Indian style flasher lamps. http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/Study_Material/TSD_3Ph.pdf.\n\n== Operations ==\nWAG-9 has quickly become one of the important locos in the Indian railways. With its higher power, this locomotive has replaced WAG-7 which was the main electric loco before WAG-9's arrival. Applications where twin WAG-7s were required are now handled by a single WAG-9. This includes both leading a long consist and for banking operations.  The regenerative braking capabilities of WAG-9 has also helped reduce the electricity consumption. The original WAG-9 had some wheel slippage incidents while hauling heavy load. This was rectified through the introduction of WAG-9H and subsequently using WAG-9i. This has significantly reduced the issue that were associated with the original version.\n\n<br /> Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) turned out its first 9,000&nbsp;hp WAG-9 freight locomotive on 31 March 2019, the last day of the financial year. This 9,000&nbsp;hp version of the WAG-9H has been classified by IR as WAG-9 HH. The first H stands for higher axle load and the second H stands for the higher power rating. The class has been allocated a block of serial numbers starting with 90001, the number of the first unit. The decision to upgrade the power output of the WAG-9 was taken to partly meet the demands of the upcoming electrified Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC). The upgraded locomotive class will also augment hauling capacity on the existing network of the Indian Railways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railpost.in/new-9000-hp-wag-9-hh-locomotive-rolls-out-of-clw/|title=New 9,000 hp WAG-9 HH Locomotive Rolls Out of CLW|last=|first=|last2=|date=2019-04-02|website=RailPost.in - Indian Railways News & Analysis|accessdate=2019-04-05|last3=|first3=|last4=|last5=|first5=}}</ref>\n\n== Future Developments ==\nWAG-9s are modified to have high-reach pantographs. This is to enable them carry double-stack containers in electrified sections. In such sections, the Overhead wires are placed in a higher position. Another version with 9000&nbsp;hp is also under development.\n\n==Technical specifications==\nThe WAG-9 technical specifications are:<ref>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco Indian AC electric loco information]</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|ABB's 6FRA 6068 (850&nbsp;kW, 2180V, 1283/2484 rpm, 270/310A.

It is similar to the [[Indian locomotive class WAP-7|WAP-7]] class locomotive but features a different [[gear ratio]], which makes it suitable for heavy freight operations. In November 1998, the [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] (CLW) started producing these with indigenous components. The first of which, named '''Navyug (New Era)''', was produced on 14 November 1998. Like the [[Indian Locomotive Class WAP-5|WAP-5 units]], the WAG-9 has GTO [[thyristor]] converters and three-phase asynchronous motors.\n\nNewer versions of the WAG-9 feature full [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) traction control; the debut model was the ''WAG-9 31248''. The class as a whole is denoted by the WAG-9i prefix in its model number, although there is a technical variant of this class named WAG-9H, with the \"H\" meaning \"Heavy\".\n\nThe WAG-9H/9Hi locomotives are the second heaviest in regular service in India, the only freight-dedicated three-phase AC locomotives in the country, and the only electric locomotives in India fitted with IGBT. They are also the freight locomotives with the highest operational speed in India.\n[[File:BHILAI based WAG9H 31283 standing in Katihar goods yard.jpg|thumb|Bhilai based WAG9H standing at Katihar goods yard]]\n[[File:LDH_based_WAG9HC_32523_with_BCNA_entering_Katihar.jpg|thumb|Ludhiana based WAG9HC with BCNA entering Katihar]]\n[[File:Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake.jpg|thumb|280px|Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake]]\n[[File:WAG9-31179.jpg|thumb|280px|Indian Railways WAG-9 class AC electric locomotive no. 31179 pauses at Agra Fort railway station (Indian Railways station code AF), at the head of a heavily laden eastbound coal train.]]\n[[File:LGD based WAG-9 Locomotives at Ghatkesar 02.JPG|thumb|280px|[[Lallaguda]] based WAG-9 Locomotives at [[Ghatkesar]]]]\n[[File:WAG 9 - Navshatak.JPG|thumb|280px|WAG 9 - Navshatak]]\n[[File:WAG 9 at Vasai Road Station.jpg|thumb|280px|WAG 9 at [[Vasai Road railway station|Vasai Road]]]]\n\n==Introduction==\nThe WAG-9 [[locomotive]] is referred to as the \"Heavy Haul\" freight locomotive of the Indian Railways (IR). It was conceived in response to the extreme growth in the rail freight transportation sector, which is considered to be of great importance to the growth of the [[economy of India]]. The need for more [[electrification]] and electric locomotives in India had increased. Around 60-65% of the freight haulage of the IR takes place on the electrified section of the Golden Quadrilateral (Indian Railways) and diagonals (which account for 25% of the route). These are very busy routes, so clearance is a necessity. Electrical powers give it a great sectional clearance ability. Thus, these locomotives are important for the Indian Railways.\n\nThese locomotives have entered the [[Western Railway zone]] of [[Mumbai]]. The first 22 units were imported from [[Adtranz]] (ABB). Of these, the first six were fully assembled and rest were in kit form. Again in the kit form, seven were completely knocked down and the rest were partially assembled. CLW started producing these traction motors on 1 November 1999. The units built by ABB have double-pan [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]] while the CLW built units have single pan pantographs which are common in India. This class had a capacity to MU several units, but IR restricts them to two, because of dynamic loading restriction on most bridges. Regenerative brakes provide about 260&nbsp;kN of braking effort.\n\nThe WAG-9H also has different application software than the WAG-9. The first WAG-9H was commissioned on 30 June 2000. The #30130 prototype was housed at [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh railway station|Gomoh]] (GMO). This was then converted back to standard WAG-9 in 2002. This unit has a livery of twin white stripes on green, instead of yellow stripe on green, seen on the other WAG-9(x)s.\n\nThe WAG-9i was introduced in 2010, and was #31215. It was homed at the GMO shed. With IGBT, even if one traction motor failed, other traction motors can function with a total output of 5500&nbsp;hp.\n\nNewer WAG-9 units have \"CLW Glorious 50 years\" marked on their sides. Some WAG-9(x)s are fitted with a solid cowcatcher while others are fitted with grilled cowcatchers. Some have American style flasher lamps while others have Indian style flasher lamps. http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/Study_Material/TSD_3Ph.pdf.\n\n== Operations ==\nWAG-9 has quickly become one of the important locos in the Indian railways. With its higher power, this locomotive has replaced WAG-7 which was the main electric loco before WAG-9's arrival. Applications where twin WAG-7s were required are now handled by a single WAG-9. This includes both leading a long consist and for banking operations.  The regenerative braking capabilities of WAG-9 has also helped reduce the electricity consumption. The original WAG-9 had some wheel slippage incidents while hauling heavy load. This was rectified through the introduction of WAG-9H and subsequently using WAG-9i. This has significantly reduced the issue that were associated with the original version.\n\n<br /> Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) turned out its first 9,000&nbsp;hp WAG-9 freight locomotive on 31 March 2019, the last day of the financial year. This 9,000&nbsp;hp version of the WAG-9H has been classified by IR as WAG-9 HH. The first H stands for higher axle load and the second H stands for the higher power rating. The class has been allocated a block of serial numbers starting with 90001, the number of the first unit. The decision to upgrade the power output of the WAG-9 was taken to partly meet the demands of the upcoming electrified Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC). The upgraded locomotive class will also augment hauling capacity on the existing network of the Indian Railways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railpost.in/new-9000-hp-wag-9-hh-locomotive-rolls-out-of-clw/|title=New 9,000 hp WAG-9 HH Locomotive Rolls Out of CLW|last=|first=|last2=|date=2019-04-02|website=RailPost.in - Indian Railways News & Analysis|accessdate=2019-04-05|last3=|first3=|last4=|last5=|first5=}}</ref>\n\n== Future Developments ==\nWAG-9s are modified to have high-reach pantographs. This is to enable them carry double-stack containers in electrified sections. In such sections, the Overhead wires are placed in a higher position. Another version with 9000&nbsp;hp is also under development.\n\n==Technical specifications==\nThe WAG-9 technical specifications are:<ref>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco Indian AC electric loco information]</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|ABB's 6FRA 6068 (850&nbsp;kW, 2180V, 1283/2484 rpm, 270/310A.

Infertility affects women from around the world, and the cultural and social stigma surrounding it varies.\n\n==Cause==\nCauses or factors of female infertility can basically be classified regarding whether they are [[Acquired disorder|acquired]] or genetic, or strictly by location.\n\nAlthough factors of female infertility can be classified as either acquired or genetic, female infertility is usually more or less a combination of [[nature and nurture]]. Also, the presence of any single [[risk factor]] of female infertility (such as smoking, mentioned further below) does not necessarily cause infertility, and even if a woman is definitely infertile, the infertility cannot definitely be blamed on any single risk factor even if the risk factor is (or has been) present.\n\n===Acquired===\nAccording to the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] (ASRM), age, smoking, sexually transmitted infections, and being overweight or underweight can all affect fertility.<ref>http://www.fertilityfaq.org/_pdf/magazine1_v4.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn broad sense, acquired factors practically include any factor that is not based on a [[genetic mutation]], including any [[Environmental toxins in pregnancy|intrauterine exposure to toxins during fetal development]], which may present as infertility many years later as an adult.\n\n====Age====\n{{Main|Age and female fertility}}\nA woman's fertility is affected by her age.

The chances of a couple to successfully conceive at an advanced age depend on many factors, including the general health of a woman and the fertility of the male partner.\n\n====Tobacco smoking====\n{{See also|Women and smoking#Unique gender differences and health effects for Females}}\n[[Tobacco smoking]] is harmful to the ovaries, and the degree of damage is dependent upon the amount and length of time a woman smokes or is exposed to a smoke-filled environment.

If initial treatments are unsuccessful, referral is usually made to physicians who are [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] trained as [[reproductive endocrinologist]]s.  Reproductive endocrinologists are usually obstetrician/gynecologists with advanced training in reproductive endocrinology and infertility (in North America). These physicians treat reproductive disorders affecting not only women but also men, children, and teens.\n\nUsually reproductive endocrinology & infertility medical practices do not see women for general [[maternity care]]. The practice is primarily focused on helping their women to conceive and to correct any issues related to recurring pregnancy loss.\n\n===Definition===\nThere is no unanimous definition of female infertility, because the definition depends on social and physical characteristics which may vary by culture and situation.  [[NICE guidelines]] state that: \"A woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the absence of any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner.\"<ref name=nice2013>[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems].

Excessive exercise, consumption of [[caffeine]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[smoking]] have all been  associated with decreased fertility.  Eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet, with plenty of fresh [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, and maintaining a normal weight, on the other hand, have been associated with better fertility prospects. \n* ''Treating or preventing existing diseases.''  Identifying and controlling chronic diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[hypothyroidism]] increases fertility prospects.  Lifelong practice of [[safer sex]] reduces the likelihood that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s will impair fertility; obtaining prompt treatment for sexually transmitted diseases reduces the likelihood that such infections will do significant damage.  Regular [[physical examination]]s (including pap smears) help detect early signs of infections or abnormalities.\n* ''Not delaying parenthood.''

A woman can freeze her eggs preserve her fertility. By using [[egg freezing]] while in the peak reproductive years, a woman's [[oocytes]] are cryogenically frozen and ready for her use later in life, reducing her chances of female infertility.\n\n==Treatment==\nThere is no method to reverse [[advanced maternal age]], but there are [[assisted reproductive technologies]] for many causes of infertility in pre-menopausal women, including:\n*[[Ovulation induction]] for [[anovulation]]\n*[[In vitro fertilization]] in for example tubal abnormalities\n\n<br />\n\n==Epidemiology==\nFemale infertility varies widely by geographic location around the world.  In 2010, there was an estimated 48.5 million infertile couples worldwide, and from 1990 to 2010 there was little change in levels of infertility in most of the world.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>\nIn 2010, the countries with the lowest rates of female infertility included the South American countries of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, as well as in Poland, Kenya, and Republic of Korea.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>  The highest rate regions included Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>  The prevalence of primary infertility has increased since 1990, but secondary infertility has decreased overall.  Rates decreased (although not prevalence) of female infertility in high-income, Central/Eastern Europe, and Central Asia regions.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>\n\n===Africa===\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has had decreasing levels of primary infertility from 1990 to 2010.  Within the Sub-Saharan region, rates were lowest in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Rwanda, while the highest rates were in Guinea, Mozambique, Angola, Gabon, and Cameroon along with Northern Africa near the Middle East.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>  According to a 2004 DHS report, rates in Africa were highest in Middle and Sub-Saharan Africa, with East Africa\u2019s rates close behind.<ref name=\"Rutstein 2004\" />\n\n===Asia===\n\nIn Asia, the highest rates of combined secondary and primary infertility was in the South Central region, and then in the Southeast region, with the lowest rates in the Western areas.<ref name=\"Rutstein 2004\" />\n\n===Latin America and Caribbean===\n\nThe prevalence of female infertility in the Latin America/Caribbean region is typically lower than the global prevalence.  However, the greatest rates occurred in Jamaica, Suriname, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago.  Central and Western Latin America has some of the lowest rates of prevalence.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>  The highest regions in Latin America and the Caribbean was in the Caribbean Islands and in less developed countries.<ref name=\"Rutstein 2004\" />\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Social stigma===\n\nSocial stigma due to [[infertility]] is seen in many cultures throughout the world in varying forms.

The increase of sexual partners can potentially result with the spread of disease including [[HIV/AIDS]], and can actually contribute to future generations of infertility.<ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/>\n\n===Domestic abuse===\n\nThe emotional strain and stress that comes with infertility in the household can lead to the mistreatment and [[domestic abuse]] of a woman.  \nThe devaluation of a wife due to her inability to conceive can lead to domestic abuse and emotional trauma such as [[victim blaming]].  Women are sometimes or often blamed as the cause of a couples' infertility, which can lead to [[emotional abuse]], anxiety, and shame.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/>  In addition, blame for not being able to conceive is often put on the female, even if it is the man who is infertile.<ref name=\"WHO 2010\"/> Women who are not able to conceive can be starved, beaten, and may be neglected financially by her husband as if she had no child bearing use to him.<ref name=\"Dyer, S.

Infertility affects women from around the world, and the cultural and social stigma surrounding it varies.\n\n==Cause==\nCauses or factors of female infertility can basically be classified regarding whether they are [[Acquired disorder|acquired]] or genetic, or strictly by location.\n\nAlthough factors of female infertility can be classified as either acquired or genetic, female infertility is usually more or less a combination of [[nature and nurture]]. Also, the presence of any single [[risk factor]] of female infertility (such as smoking, mentioned further below) does not necessarily cause infertility, and even if a woman is definitely infertile, the infertility cannot definitely be blamed on any single risk factor even if the risk factor is (or has been) present.\n\n===Acquired===\nAccording to the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] (ASRM), age, smoking, sexually transmitted infections, and being overweight or underweight can all affect fertility.<ref>http://www.fertilityfaq.org/_pdf/magazine1_v4.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn broad sense, acquired factors practically include any factor that is not based on a [[genetic mutation]], including any [[Environmental toxins in pregnancy|intrauterine exposure to toxins during fetal development]], which may present as infertility many years later as an adult.\n\n====Age====\n{{Main|Age and female fertility}}\nA woman's fertility is affected by her age.

Identifying and controlling chronic diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[hypothyroidism]] increases fertility prospects.

O. 2003\"/>  This is also seen in some Muslim societies including [[Egypt]] <ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/> and Pakistan.<ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/>\n\nWealth is sometimes measured by the number of children a woman has, as well as inheritance of property.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/><ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\">Dyer, S. J. (2012). \"The economic impact of infertility on women in developing countries \u2013 a systematic review.\" FVV in ObGyn: 38-45.</ref>  Children can influence financial security in many ways.  In Nigeria and [[Cameroon]], [[Land claim|land claims]] are decided by the number of children.  Also, in some Sub-Saharan countries women may be denied [[inheritance]] if she did not bear any children <ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/>  In some African and Asian countries a husband can deprive his infertile wife of food, shelter and other basic necessities like clothing.<ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/>  In Cameroon, a woman may lose access to land from her husband and left on her own in old age.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/>\n\nIn many cases, a woman who cannot bear children is excluded from social and cultural events including traditional ceremonies.  This stigmatization is seen in [[Mozambique]] and Nigeria where infertile women have been treated as outcasts to society.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/> This is a humiliating practice which devalues infertile women in society.<ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/><ref name=\"Whiteford, L. M. 1995\">Whiteford, L. M. (1995). \"STIGMA: THE HIDDEN BURDEN OF INFERTILITY.\" Sot. Sci. Med. (40;1): 27-36.</ref> In the [[Makua people|Makua]] tradition, pregnancy and birth are considered major life events for a woman, with the ceremonies of nthaa\u00b4ra and ntha\u00b4ara no mwana, which can only be attended by women who have been pregnant and have had a baby.<ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/>\n\nThe effect of infertility can lead to social shaming from internal and [[social norms]] surrounding pregnancy, which affects women around the world.<ref name=\"Whiteford, L. M. 1995\"/> When pregnancy is considered such an important event in life, and considered a \u201csocially unacceptable condition\u201d, it can lead to a search for treatment in the form of traditional healers and expensive Western treatments.<ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/> The limited access to treatment in many areas can lead to extreme and sometimes illegal acts in order to produce a child.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/><ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/>\n\n===Marital role===\n\nMen in some countries may find another wife when their first cannot produce a child, hoping that by sleeping with more women he will be able to produce his own child.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\">Araoye, M. O. (2003). \"Epidemiology of infertility: social problems of the infertile couples.\" West African journal of medicine (22;2): 190-196.</ref><ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\">Inhorn, M. C. (2003). \"Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: illustrations from Egypt.\" Social Science & Medicine (56): 1837 - 1851.</ref><ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/> This can be prevalent in some societies, including Cameroon,<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/><ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/> Nigeria,<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/>  Mozambique,<ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/> Egypt,<ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/> Botswana,<ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/> and Bangladesh,<ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/> among many more where polygamy is more common and more socially acceptable.\n\nIn some cultures, including Botswana <ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/> and Nigeria,<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/> women can select a woman with whom she allows her husband to sleep with in hopes of conceiving a child.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/> Women who are desperate for children may compromise with her husband to select a woman and accept duties of taking care of the children to feel accepted and useful in society.<ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\">Mogobe, D. K. (2005). \"Denying and Preserving Self: Batswana Women's Experiences of Infertility.\" African Journal of Reproductive Health (9;2): 26-37.</ref>\n\nWomen may also sleep with other men in hopes of becoming pregnant.<ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\">Gerrits, T. (1997). \"Social and cultural aspects of infertility in Mozambique.\" Patient Education and Counseling (31): 39-48.</ref> This can be done for many reasons including advice from a traditional healer, or finding if another man was \"more compatible\".  In many cases, the husband was not aware of the extra sexual relations and would not be informed if a woman became pregnant by another man.<ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/> This is not as culturally acceptable however, and can contribute to the gendered suffering of women who have fewer options to become pregnant on their own as opposed to men.<ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/>\n\nMen and women can also turn to [[divorce]] in attempt to find a new partner with whom to bear a child.  Infertility in many cultures is a reason for divorce, and a way for a man or woman to increase his/her chances of producing an heir.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/><ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/><ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/><ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/> When a woman is divorced, she can lose her security that often comes with land, wealth, and a family.<ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/> This can ruin marriages and can lead to distrust in the marriage.  The increase of sexual partners can potentially result with the spread of disease including [[HIV/AIDS]], and can actually contribute to future generations of infertility.<ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/>\n\n===Domestic abuse===\n\nThe emotional strain and stress that comes with infertility in the household can lead to the mistreatment and [[domestic abuse]] of a woman.  \nThe devaluation of a wife due to her inability to conceive can lead to domestic abuse and emotional trauma such as [[victim blaming]].  Women are sometimes or often blamed as the cause of a couples' infertility, which can lead to [[emotional abuse]], anxiety, and shame.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/>  In addition, blame for not being able to conceive is often put on the female, even if it is the man who is infertile.<ref name=\"WHO 2010\"/> Women who are not able to conceive can be starved, beaten, and may be neglected financially by her husband as if she had no child bearing use to him.<ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/> The physical abuse related to infertility may result from this and the [[emotional stress]] that comes with it.  In some countries, the emotional and physical abuses that come with infertility can potentially lead to [[assault]], [[murder]], and [[suicide]].<ref name=\"Omberlet, W. 2012\">Omberlet, W. (2012). \"Global access to infertility care in developing countries: a case of human rights, equity and social justice \" FVV in ObGyn: 7-16.</ref>\n\n===Mental and psychological impact===\n\nMany infertile women tend to cope with immense stress and [[social stigma]] behind their condition, which can lead to considerable [[mental distress]].<ref name=\"McQuillian, J. 2003\">McQuillian, J., Greil, A.L., White, L., Jacob, M.C. (2003). \"Frustrated Fertility: Infertility and Psychological Distress among Women.\" Journal of Marriage and Family (65;4): 1007-1018.</ref> The long-term stress involved in attempting to conceive a child and the social pressures behind giving birth can lead to emotional distress that may manifest as [[mental disease]].<ref name=\" Reproductive Health Outlook 2002\">Reproductive Health Outlook (2002). \"Infertility: Overview and lessons learned.\"</ref> Women who suffer from infertility might deal with psychological stressors such as denial, anger, grief, guilt, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name=\"Matthews, A.
