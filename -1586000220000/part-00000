He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953.<ref>Pendo, Stephen.

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>'Crystal Hale' obituary, in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]].

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941.<ref>[http://www.carolinemdavies.co.uk/2012/06/07/collected-poems-john-pudney/ Davies, Caroline.

These collections sold over a quarter of a million copies between them.<ref name=white>White, Michael. 'Johnny Head-in-Air', in ''The Guardian'', 6 April, 1972, p 10</ref> One contemporary reviewer, noting that these poems were \"immediately topical and intended to reach a less poetically sophisticated audience\", showed \"how completely he has succeeded in combining the journalist and the poet. That is no easy matter, for the one usually swamps the other\".<ref>''The Listener'', 23 September 1943, p 357</ref>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as a journalist and editor. He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953.<ref>Pendo, Stephen.

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>'Crystal Hale' obituary, in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> That process became a subject for his writing. ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain.
