{"title_page": "Electron affinity", "text_new": "The '''electron affinity''' (''E''<sub>ea</sub>) of an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] is defined as the amount of energy ''released'' when an electron is attached to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.<ref name=\"Compendiumof\">{{GoldBookRef |title=Electron affinity |file=E01977}}</ref>\n::X(g) + e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192  X<sup>\u2212</sup>(g) + energy\n\nWe have studied that to remove an electron from an atom , energy is required . Similarly , when an extra '''''<u>electron</u>''''' is added to an atom, energy is released ....\nNote that this is not the same as  the [[enthalpy]] change of [[electron capture ionization]], which is defined as negative when energy is released. In other words, this enthalpy change and the electron affinity differ by a negative sign. Overall we can say that electron affinity is property of an atom or molecule to gain electron and measure in negative sign of released energy.\n\nIn [[solid state physics]], the electron affinity for a surface is defined somewhat differently (see below).\n\n==Measurement and use of electron affinity==\n\nThis  property is used to measure atoms and molecules in the gaseous state only, since in a solid or liquid state their [[energy level]]s would be changed by contact with other atoms or molecules.                                                 \n\nA list of the electron affinities was used by [[Robert S. Mulliken]] to develop an [[electronegativity]] scale for atoms, equal to the average of the electron affinity and [[ionization potential]].<ref>Robert S. Mulliken, [[Journal of Chemical Physics]], '''1934''', ''2'', 782.</ref><ref>Modern Physical Organic Chemistry, Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty, University Science Books, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-891389-31-3}}</ref> Other theoretical concepts that use electron affinity include electronic chemical potential and [[chemical hardness]]. Another example, a molecule or atom that has a more positive value of electron affinity than another is often called an [[electron acceptor]] and the less positive an [[electron donor]]. Together they may undergo [[Intervalence charge transfer|charge-transfer]] reactions.\n\n===Sign convention===\nTo use electron affinities properly, it is essential to keep track of sign. For any reaction that ''releases'' energy, the ''change'' \u0394''E'' in [[total energy]] has a negative value and the reaction is called an [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic process]]. Electron capture for almost all non-[[noble gas]] atoms involves the release of energy<ref>Chemical Principles the Quest for Insight, Peter Atkins and Loretta Jones, Freeman, New York, 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-4292-1955-6}}</ref> and thus are exothermic. The positive values that are listed in tables of ''E''<sub>ea</sub> are amounts or magnitudes. It is the word \"released\" within the definition \"energy released\" that supplies the negative sign to \u0394''E''. Confusion arises in mistaking ''E''<sub>ea</sub> for a change in energy, \u0394''E'', in which case the positive values listed in tables would be for an endo- not exo-thermic process. The relation between the two is ''E''<sub>ea</sub> = \u2212\u0394''E''(attach).\n\nHowever, if the value assigned to ''E''<sub>ea</sub> is negative, the negative sign implies a reversal of direction, and energy is ''required'' to attach an electron. In this case, the electron capture is an [[endothermic]] process and the relationship, ''E''<sub>ea</sub> = \u2212\u0394''E''(attach) is still valid. Negative values typically arise for the capture of a second electron, but also for the nitrogen atom.\n\nThe usual expression for calculating ''E''<sub>ea</sub> when an electron is attached is\n\n::{{math|size=120%|1=''E''<sub>ea</sub> = (''E''<sub>initial</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''E''<sub>final</sub>)<sub>attach</sub> = \u2212\u0394''E''(attach)}}\n\nThis expression does follow the convention \u0394''X'' = ''X''(final) \u2212 ''X''(initial) since \u2212\u0394''E'' = \u2212(''E''(final) \u2212 ''E''(initial)) = ''E''(initial) \u2212 ''E''(final).\n\nEquivalently, electron affinity can also be defined as the amount of energy ''required'' to detach an electron from the atom while it holds a [[Electric charge|single-excess-electron]] thus making the atom a [[ion|negative ion]],<ref name=\"Compendiumof\" /> i.e. the energy change for the process\n\n::X<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 X + e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nIf the same table is employed for the forward and reverse reactions, ''without switching signs'', care must be taken to apply the correct definition to the corresponding direction, attachment (release) or detachment (require). Since almost all detachments ''(require +)'' an amount of energy listed on the table, those detachment reactions are endothermic, or \u0394''E''(detach) > 0.\n\n::{{math|size=120%|1=''E''<sub>ea</sub> = (''E''<sub>final</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>initial</sub>)<sub>detach</sub> = \u0394''E''(detach) = \u2212\u0394''E''(attach)}}.\n\n==Electron affinities of the elements==\n[[File:Electron affinity of the elements.svg|thumb|right|200px|Electron affinity (E<sub>ea</sub>) vs atomic number (Z). Note the sign convention explanation in the previous section.]]\n{{Main|Electron affinity (data page)}}\nAlthough ''E''<sub>ea</sub> varies greatly across the periodic table, some patterns emerge. Generally, [[nonmetals]] have more positive ''E''<sub>ea</sub> than [[metal]]s. Atoms whose anions are more stable than neutral atoms have a greater ''E''<sub>ea</sub>. [[Chlorine]] most strongly attracts extra electrons; [[neon]] most weakly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been conclusively measured, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.\n\n''E''<sub>ea</sub> generally increases across a period (row) in the periodic table prior to reaching group 18. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a [[halogen|group 17]] atom releases more energy than a [[Group 1 element|group 1]] atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled [[electron shell|valence shell]] and therefore is more stable. In group 18, the valence shell is full, meaning that added electrons are unstable, tending to be ejected very quickly.\n\nCounterintuitively,  ''E''<sub>ea</sub> does ''not'' decrease when progressing down the rows of the periodic table, as can be clearly seen in the [[Group 2 element|group 2]] data. Thus, electron affinity follows the same \"left-right\" trend as electronegativity, but not the \"up-down\" trend.\n\nThe following data are quoted in [[Joule per mole|kJ/mol]].\n\n<center>{{periodic table (electron affinities)}}</center>\n\n==Molecular electron affinities==\nThe electron affinity of molecules is a complicated function of their electronic structure.\nFor instance the electron affinity for [[benzene]] is negative, as is that of [[naphthalene]], while those of [[anthracene]], [[phenanthrene]] and [[pyrene]] are positive. ''[[In silico]]'' experiments show that the electron affinity of [[hexacyanobenzene]] surpasses that of [[fullerene]].<ref>''Remarkable electron accepting properties of the simplest benzenoid cyanocarbons: hexacyanobenzene, octacyanonaphthalene and decacyanoanthracene'' Xiuhui Zhang, Qianshu Li, Justin B.

Albert Cotton]] [[Chemical Communications]], '''2006''', 758\u2013760 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b515843e Abstract]</ref>\n\n==\"Electron affinity\" as defined in solid state physics==\n\n[[File:Semiconductor vacuum junction.svg|thumb|[[Band diagram]] of semiconductor-vacuum interface showing electron affinity ''E''<sub>EA</sub>, defined as the difference between near-surface vacuum energy ''E''<sub>vac</sub>, and near-surface [[conduction band]] edge ''E''<sub>C</sub>. Also shown: [[Fermi level]] ''E''<sub>F</sub>, [[valence band]] edge ''E''<sub>V</sub>, [[work function]] ''W''.]]\n\nIn the field of [[solid state physics]], the electron affinity is defined differently than in chemistry and atomic physics. For a semiconductor-vacuum interface (that is, the surface of a semiconductor), electron affinity, typically denoted by ''E''<sub>EA</sub> or ''\u03c7'', is defined as the energy obtained by moving an electron from the vacuum just outside the semiconductor to the bottom of the [[conduction band]] just inside the semiconductor:<ref>{{cite web|first = Raymond T. |last =  Tung | url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/tung/Schottky/surface.htm|title=Free Surfaces of Semiconductors|work= Brooklyn College}}</ref>\n:<math>E_{\\rm EA} \\equiv E_{\\rm vac} - E_{\\rm C}</math>\nIn an intrinsic semiconductor at [[absolute zero]], this concept is functionally analogous to the chemistry definition of electron affinity, since an added electron will spontaneously go to the bottom of the conduction band. At nonzero temperature, and for other materials (metals, semimetals, heavily doped semiconductors), the analogy does not hold since an added electron will instead go to the [[Fermi level]] on average. In any case, the value of the electron affinity of a solid substance is very different from the chemistry and atomic physics electron affinity value for an atom of the same substance in gas phase. For example, a silicon crystal surface has electron affinity 4.05&nbsp;eV, whereas an isolated silicon atom has electron affinity 1.39&nbsp;eV.\n\nThe electron affinity of a surface is closely related to, but distinct from, its [[work function]]. The work function is the [[thermodynamic work]] that can be obtained by reversibly, isothermally moving an electron from the vacuum to the material; this thermodynamic electron goes to the ''[[Fermi level]]'' on average, not the conduction band edge: <math> W = E_{\\rm vac} - E_{\\rm F}</math>. While the [[work function]] of a semiconductor can be changed by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]], the electron affinity ideally does not change with doping and so it is closer to being a material constant. However, like work function the electron affinity does depend on the surface termination (crystal face, surface chemistry, etc.) and is strictly a surface property.\n\nIn semiconductor physics, the primary use of the electron affinity is not actually in the analysis of semiconductor\u2013vacuum surfaces, but rather in heuristic [[electron affinity rule]]s for estimating the [[band bending]] that occurs at the interface of two materials, in particular [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]s and semiconductor [[heterojunction]]s.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the electron affinity may become negative.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Himpsel | first1 = F. | last2 = Knapp | first2 = J. | last3 = Vanvechten | first3 = J. | last4 = Eastman | first4 = D. | title = Quantum photoyield of diamond(111)\u2014A stable negative-affinity emitter | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.20.624 | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 624 | year = 1979 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1979PhRvB..20..624H }}</ref> Often negative electron affinity is desired to obtain efficient [[cathode]]s that can supply electrons to the vacuum with little energy loss.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 11, 1999, stating in a promo that it is the official series premiere of the show. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin]] as he teaches his daughter [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] how to drive. Due to his horrible advice they crash into a [[satellite dish]], knocking out the city's cable. Peter begins to suffer from television withdrawal but finds new life in outdoor activities, driving his family to exhaustion. Meanwhile, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] plots to destroy the world's supply of broccoli with a [[weather control]] device so [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] cannot force him to eat the vegetable.\n\n\"I Never Met the Dead Man\" was written by [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]] and directed by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]], both firsts in the ''Family Guy'' series. Much of the episode's humor, in standard ''Family Guy'' fashion, is structured around [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]] sequences that parody popular culture, including those centered on [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]], ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', and ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''. The title \"I Never Met the Dead Man\" was derived from 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'', which featured several elements pertaining to death and murder. The episode featured guest performances by [[Erik Estrada]], [[Butch Hartman]], [[Aaron Lustig]] and [[Joey Slotnick]], along with several recurring voice actors for the series. This episode was rated TV-14.\n\nCritical responses to the episode were favorable; several television critics singled it out as among the \"most memorable\" episodes in the series.\n\n==Plot==\nBefore the intro starts, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] plays with the [[Sesame Street]] telephone. As the telephone says to count to three, Stewie uses his laser gun to destroy the telephone three times.\n \nAnnoyed that [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] spends more time watching television than with his own family, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] suggests he teach [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] how to drive. Peter reluctantly agrees, and unwittingly gives Meg a series of bad driving tips, including instructing her to \"rev\" her engine twice at [[Traffic light|stop lights]] and challenge other drivers to a race, which causes her to ultimately fail her [[driving test]]. As Peter drives them home from the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] he notices that a show he wanted to watch is on television in a nearby house. Distracted by the show, he crashes the car into the main cable [[television transmitter]], knocking out reception for the whole entire town of [[Quahog, Rhode Island|Quahog]]. As Peter and Meg realize this angry citizens of Quahog approach. Panicking, Peter makes a promise to Meg so that if she takes the blame for knocking down the cable transmitter, she would get a new [[convertible]] when she finally gets her licence. Once they arrive home with the transmitter still attached to the car, Lois becomes furious with Peter for placing the blame on his own daughter. Meg, of course, is blamed, and is about to admit the truth, but then decides to keep quiet, reflecting with an inner voice, a reference to ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', at school. This shows an incredible lack of good judgment and morals by Peter. Meanwhile, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], (seeing the opportunity of the dish attached to the car), steals the satellite dish in a plan to create a [[Weather modification|weather control]] device capable of destroying the world's supply of broccoli, since Lois had forced him to eat the vegetable earlier that day.\n\nSuffering [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]] from the lack of cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a [[Television show|television program]]. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one [[Outdoor recreation|outdoor activity]] after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with [[William Shatner]], who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a [[flat tire]], to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge [[rain]]storm. The storm's [[lightning strike]] destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.\n\nDuring the credits, Stewie tries (and fails) to make believe he is eating his [[broccoli]] by pouring it onto Brian's plate.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Michael Dante DiMartino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white photograph of a man with a small beard and a bald head, wearing glasses.|150px|[[Michael Dante DiMartino]] directed the episode]]\n\"I Never Met the Dead Man\" was the first episode of ''Family Guy'' for both writer [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]] and director [[Michael Dante DiMartino]].<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/episode/1544/castcrew |title=Family Guy&nbsp;\u2014 I Never Met the Dead Man Cast and Crew |work=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 11, 1999, stating in a promo that it is the official series premiere of the show. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin]] as he teaches his daughter [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] how to drive. Due to his horrible advice they crash into a [[satellite dish]], knocking out the city's cable. Peter begins to suffer from television withdrawal but finds new life in outdoor activities, driving his family to exhaustion. Meanwhile, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] plots to destroy the world's supply of broccoli with a [[weather control]] device so [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] cannot force him to eat the vegetable.\n\n\"I Never Met the Dead Man\" was written by [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]] and directed by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]], both firsts in the ''Family Guy'' series. Much of the episode's humor, in standard ''Family Guy'' fashion, is structured around [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]] sequences that parody popular culture, including those centered on [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]], ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', and ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''. The title \"I Never Met the Dead Man\" was derived from 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'', which featured several elements pertaining to death and murder. The episode featured guest performances by [[Erik Estrada]], [[Butch Hartman]], [[Aaron Lustig]] and [[Joey Slotnick]], along with several recurring voice actors for the series. This episode was rated TV-14.\n\nCritical responses to the episode were favorable; several television critics singled it out as among the \"most memorable\" episodes in the series.\n\n==Plot==\nBefore the intro starts, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] plays with the [[Sesame Street]] telephone. As the telephone says to count to three, Stewie uses his laser gun to destroy the telephone three times.\n \nAnnoyed that [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] spends more time watching television than with his own family, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] suggests he teach [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] how to drive. Peter reluctantly agrees, and unwittingly gives Meg a series of bad driving tips, including instructing her to \"rev\" her engine twice at [[Traffic light|stop lights]] and challenge other drivers to a race, which causes her to ultimately fail her [[driving test]]. As Peter drives them home from the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] he notices that a show he wanted to watch is on television in a nearby house. Distracted by the show, he crashes the car into the main cable [[television transmitter]], knocking out reception for the whole entire town of [[Quahog, Rhode Island|Quahog]]. As Peter and Meg realize this angry citizens of Quahog approach. Panicking, Peter makes a promise to Meg so that if she takes the blame for knocking down the cable transmitter, she would get a new [[convertible]] when she finally gets her licence. Once they arrive home with the transmitter still attached to the car, Lois becomes furious with Peter for placing the blame on his own daughter. Meg, of course, is blamed, and is about to admit the truth, but then decides to keep quiet, reflecting with an inner voice, a reference to [[The Wonder Years|''The Wonder Years'']], at school. This shows an incredible lack of good judgment and morals by Peter. Meanwhile, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], (seeing the opportunity of the dish attached to the car), steals the satellite dish in a plan to create a [[Weather modification|weather control]] device capable of destroying the world's supply of broccoli, since Lois had forced him to eat the vegetable earlier that day.\n\nSuffering [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]] from the lack of cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a [[Television show|television program]]. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one [[Outdoor recreation|outdoor activity]] after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with [[William Shatner]], who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a [[flat tire]], to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge [[Rain|rainstorm]]. The storm's [[lightning strike]] destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter.

This episode aired in the United States on [[HBO]] on September 4, 2005 and in the United Kingdom on 2 & 9 November 2005 on [[BBC]].\n\nWith growing political tensions at home, [[Gaius Julius Caesar (Rome character)|Caesar]] needs a voice within the Senate, and [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] is not above accepting the gift of a bought office. Escorting the new \"Tribune of the People\" to Rome, [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Pullo]] return to their homes for the first time in years: Vorenus to his family, and Pullo to his vices. [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]] rewards those who return her lost son to her. In the back rooms of Rome powerful men strike bargains to strip Caesar of his growing power, and in growing political tensions of Rome the actions of the basest of men will shake the foundations of the city.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThis second episode is based on events that took place in 50 BC and 49 BC. [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[proconsul]]ship in [[Gaul]] is about to expire, which would mean a loss of the office's immunity against prosecution by his political enemies. He had faced the same situation five years prior, but at that time his command had been extended with the help of his allies [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Marcus Crassus]]. This time Caesar cannot count on his former allies, as Pompey has openly turned against him, and Crassus was killed in 53 BC at the [[battle of Carrhae]]. Caesar instead has to rely on [[Mark Antony]] for his political maneuvering: newly elected to the office of [[Tribune of the Plebs|Tribune of the People]] (''tribunus plebis''), Mark Antony has [[veto]] power in the [[Roman Senate]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Lucius Vorenus]], now a [[Primus Pilus|first file centurion]] (''centurio primi pili''), and [[Titus Pullo]] return to Rome. After dropping off [[Augustus|Gaius Octavian]] and having lunch with [[Atia of the Julii]], Vorenus returns to his wife, whom he hasn't seen in eight years since he left for Gaul, only to find her holding a fairly new baby in her arms. When Vorenus asks her whose child it is, she tells him it is his grandson by his eldest daughter who has just newly turned 14. Meanwhile, Pullo returns to soliciting prostitutes and gambling. He's already lost most of his money in a gambling den full of Pompey's supporters when he discovers that he is being cheated by one of his opponents. He stabs the man through the throat, but is injured in the fight that breaks out. Pullo manages to drag himself to Vorenus's home, where he receives [[trepanation]] (courtesy of Vorenus) from a Greek doctor.\n\nCaesar's political enemies, led by Pompey, plan to pass a motion in the Senate that would set an ultimatum for Caesar to surrender his command, or be declared a public enemy. Pompey enlists the help of [[Cato the Younger]], [[Metellus Scipio]] (Pompey's new father-in-law), and of the reluctant [[Cicero]]. Pompey wants the motion to pass by a large majority, so that Caesar will see that he is isolated and has no political supporters. However, Pompey also wants the motion to be immediately vetoed by Caesar's ally Mark Antony so that the blame for any subsequent escalation would rest with Caesar. The motion is passed but a brawl erupts on the Senate floor and Mark Antony's veto is not recorded, nor is the session formally adjourned. Pompey is taken by surprise, and arranges for the Senate session to be continued the next day so that the tribune's veto can be recorded. He also gives orders to his minions that Mark Antony must not be harmed in any way.\n\nUnaware of Pompey's orders and feeling threatened because of his association with Caesar, Mark Antony calls on the soldiers from Caesar's [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]] (''Legio XIII''), including Vorenus and Pullo, for protection. With Vorenus and Pullo walking beside him, Mark Antony makes his way to the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] in order to properly record his veto in the Senate.  Just as they are marching through a throng of Pompey's supporters, a friend of the man Pullo killed in the gambling den fight lunges from the crowd with a knife and attacks Pullo. Though the assailant is swiftly cut down, both sides believe that Mark Antony was the intended victim and a bloody fight erupts between the two mobs, just as Pompey emerges from the Senate House. Vorenus and Pullo escape with Antony, though the former is wounded and barely survives the return to Caesar's 13th Legion in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern Italy).\n\nHaving been declared an enemy of Rome by the Senate, Caesar marches his army south toward Rome, marking the beginning of the civil war. Caesar crosses the [[Rubicon]] River with the remainder of his army in January, 49 BC.  As the news is cried throughout the city, Niobe [[breast feeding|breast feeds]] the baby, indicating that it is really hers.\n\n==Historical and cultural background==\n*[[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[proconsul]]ship in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] was about to expire, which would mean a loss of immunity against prosecution by his political enemies. He had faced the same situation five years prior, but at that time his command had been extended with the help of his allies [[Pompey|Pompey Magnus]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Marcus Crassus]]. This time, however, Pompey was against him, and [[Battle of Carrhae|Crassus had been killed]] in 53 BC. Caesar instead has to rely on [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] for his political maneuvering: newly elected to the office of [[Tribune#Plebeian tribune|Tribune of the Plebs]] (''tribunus plebis'').\n* As part of his investiture as ''[[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunus plebis]]'', [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Antony]] sits a (very impatient) [[vigil]] in the temple of [[Jupiter Optimus Maximus]]. Given that this was the God of Laws, Social Order, and Rome itself, it seems an appropriate god to appeal for favor to when one is becoming a high government official.\n* During the fight in the Senate, Mark Antony appears to have been unharmed. This was because, as [[Tribune]], any attempt to harm Antony would have been considered a capital offense. Thus, when Antony and the Thirteenth are driven from Rome and Caesar recounts the events to his army, he says of the attack on Antony, \"Can you imagine a more terrible sacrilege?!\"\n* As Antony is about to wash his face before going out in public, Caesar stops him, telling him he looks like \"Leonidas at Thermopylae\". He is referring to the [[Sparta]]n king [[Leonidas I]], who fought the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in 480 BC\n*This was the year that Caesar finally moved openly against Rome, crossing the [[Rubicon]] in January of 49 BC, at the head of the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion (''Legio XIII Gemina'')]]. It is here he is said to have made the comment \"[[alea iacta est]]\" (\"The die is cast\"). There are some variations on what he actually said. [[Suetonius]] wrote that the comment was \"Iacta alea est\"<ref>Suetonius, ''Life of Caesar''</ref> and [[Plutarch]] wrote<ref>Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives''</ref> that he said in Greek, \"anerriphtho kubos\" (\"The die must be cast\" \u2013 Latin trans. \"iacta alea esto\"), a quote from a play by [[Menander]].<ref>Liddell & Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', s.v.

It is extremely difficult to estimate the exact value of the [[Denarius]], as it changed with the times (as do most currencies), and was part of an economy totally alien to us; however, the \"classical rule of thumb\" is that a [[Denarius]] was the daily wage of a skilled worker{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. This would mean that about 350 [[Denarius|Denarii]] would be a \"middle class\" working wage.  Lucius Vorenus has brought home approximately 25 years' wages of someone living at their standard of living. <!--THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIA In modern American terms, this is roughly equivalent to a [[blue collar worker]] suddenly bringing home a lump sum of [[United States Dollar|USD]] $1 million. -->\n* Regarding the monetary units frequently mentioned in the series, one [[Denarius]] (a silver coin) was equal to four [[Sestertius|sesterces]] (a bronze coin).

It then moved northeast along the entire length of the Harbin Creek and strengthened as it moved directly into the rural community of [[Retreat, South Carolina|Retreat]]. Trees and homes in this area suffered EF0 to EF1 damage as the tornado crossed over [[South Carolina Highway 11|SC 11]] and [[South Carolina Highway 24|24]]. EF1 damage continued as the tornado approached the Coneross Creek. Damage rapidly became more severe and widespread as the tornado crossed the creek and moved into more populated areas in the southwestern part of [[Seneca, South Carolina|Seneca]]. Reaching EF3 strength, the tornado first struck a [[BorgWarner]] plant at the end of Evalona Drive, inflicting major structural damage to the facility and scattering large amounts of debris throughout the area. A security guard on the property was killed when a concrete-block guard shack was completely destroyed. A block-foundation house in this area was swept away at high-end EF3 strength, and a vehicle parked at this residence was blown into the basement. The large tornado then crossed the Wells Highway and moved through residential areas of Seneca. Many homes in this area sustained EF2 to EF3 damage, with roofs ripped off and exterior walls collapsed. Detached garages were destroyed, a gas station awning was shredded, and numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the path. The tornado had grown to a half\u2013mile wide at this point, and less severe damage was inflicted to numerous other homes in Seneca. Damage severity began to lessen as the tornado passed north of [[Utica, South Carolina|Utica]] and directly through the [[Jordania, South Carolina|Jordania]] community. Mainly EF1 damage was noted as dozens of homes were damaged along this segment of the path, and many large trees were snapped or uprooted, some of which landed on structures. The tornado maintained EF1 strength as it as it crossed [[US 123]] and continued to the northeast, where EF1 damage was inflicted to numerous trees. The tornado than crossed [[Hartwell Lake]] northwest of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]] and produced some EF0 tree damage before lifting due-west of [[Central, South Carolina|Central]].\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for 14 minutes, traveled 16.66 miles, was 900 yards wide. Its final rating was high\u2013end EF3. There was one fatality, and numerous injuries ocurred.

It then moved northeast along the entire length of the Harbin Creek and strengthened as it moved directly into the rural community of [[Retreat, South Carolina|Retreat]]. Trees and homes in this area suffered EF0 to EF1 damage as the tornado crossed over [[South Carolina Highway 11|SC 11]] and [[South Carolina Highway 24|24]]. EF1 damage continued as the tornado approached the Coneross Creek. Damage rapidly became more severe and widespread as the tornado crossed the creek and moved into more populated areas in the southwestern part of [[Seneca, South Carolina|Seneca]]. Reaching EF3 strength, the tornado first struck a [[BorgWarner]] plant at the end of Evalona Drive, inflicting major structural damage to the facility and scattering large amounts of debris throughout the area. A security guard on the property was killed when a concrete-block guard shack was completely destroyed. A block-foundation house in this area was swept away at high-end EF3 strength, and a vehicle parked at this residence was blown into the basement. The large tornado then crossed the Wells Highway and moved through residential areas of Seneca. Many homes in this area sustained EF2 to EF3 damage, with roofs ripped off and exterior walls collapsed. Detached garages were destroyed, a gas station awning was shredded, and numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the path. The tornado had grown to a half\u2013mile wide at this point, and less severe damage was inflicted to numerous other homes in Seneca. Damage severity began to lessen as the tornado passed north of [[Utica, South Carolina|Utica]] and directly through the [[Jordania, South Carolina|Jordania]] community. Mainly EF1 damage was noted as dozens of homes were damaged along this segment of the path, and many large trees were snapped or uprooted, some of which landed on structures. The tornado maintained EF1 strength as it as it crossed [[US 123]] and continued to the northeast, where EF1 damage was inflicted to numerous trees. The tornado than crossed [[Hartwell Lake]] northwest of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]] and produced some EF0 tree damage before lifting due-west of [[Central, South Carolina|Central]].\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for 14 minutes, traveled 16.66 miles, was 900 yards wide. Its final rating was high\u2013end EF3. There was one fatality, and numerous injuries ocurred.

Volume 96 pp. 23\u201367</ref> known to the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the '''Great Heathen  Army''' ({{lang-ang|mycel h\u00e6\u00feen here}}), was a coalition of [[Norsemen|Norse]] warriors, originating in [[Denmark]] but including warbands from [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], who came together under a unified command to invade the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that constituted England in AD 865.\n\nSince the late 8th century, the Vikings had primarily engaged in \"hit-and-run\" raids on centres of wealth such as monasteries. The Great Heathen Army was distinct from these raids in that it was much larger and formed to occupy and conquer large territories.\n\nThe name Great Heathen Army is derived from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' of 865. Legend has it that the force was led by four of the five sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], including [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bjorn Ironside]] and possibly [[Ubba]].{{efn|name=sons|The Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] gives Ragnar no less than 10 sons; however, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that only three took part in the invasion.

Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind.\n\nThe invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865\u201366 at [[Thetford]], before marching north to capture [[Scandinavian York|York]] in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of [[Eboracum]] and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of [[Scandinavian York|Eoforwic]].\n\nDuring 867, the army marched deep into [[Mercia]] and wintered in [[Nottingham]].  The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868\u201369. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford.\n\nIn 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] paid them to leave.  The army then marched to [[London]] to overwinter in 871-2. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at [[Torksey]], on the Trent close to the Humber.<ref name=hadley23/> The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'a foolish king's thegn' was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at [[Repton]] on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex.<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian D. |author-link=Julian D.

In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time. [[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|The Tale of Ragnar's Sons]], on the other hand, mentions that the invasion of England by the Great Heathen Army was aimed at avenging the death of Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary Viking ruler of Sweden and Denmark.{{efn|name=son2|There is nothing in the annals to suggest that the brothers invaded England to avenge their father's killing. Also there is no reference to them being the sons of Ragnar.<ref name=munch357/>}} In the Viking saga, Ragnar is said to have conducted a raid on Northumbria during the reign of King \u00c6lla. The Vikings were defeated and Ragnar was captured by the Northumbrians. \u00c6lla then had Ragnar executed by throwing him into a pit of venomous snakes.

A combined army from Wessex and Mercia besieged the city of Nottingham with no clear result, so the Mercians settled on paying the Vikings off.

It seems they were partly discouraged by the defeat of Guthrum but also Alfred's success against the Vikings coincided with a period of renewed weakness in Francia. The Frankish emperor, Charles the Bald, died in 877 and his son shortly after, precipitating a period of political instability of which the Vikings were quick to take advantage.

Volume 96 pp. 23\u201367</ref> known to the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the '''Great Heathen  Army''' ({{lang-ang|mycel h\u00e6\u00feen here}}), was a coalition of [[Norsemen|Norse]] warriors, originating in [[Denmark]] but including warbands from [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], who came together under a unified command to invade the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that constituted England in AD 865.\n\nSince the late 8th century, the Vikings had primarily engaged in \"hit-and-run\" raids on centres of wealth such as monasteries. The Great Heathen Army was distinct from these raids in that it was much larger and formed to occupy and conquer large territories.\n\nThe name Great Heathen Army is derived from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' of 865. Legend has it that the force was led by four of the five sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], including [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bjorn Ironside]] and possibly [[Ubba]].{{efn|name=sons|The Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] gives Ragnar no less than 10 sons; however, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that only three took part in the invasion.

Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind.\n\nThe invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865\u201366 at [[Thetford]], before marching north to capture [[Scandinavian York|York]] in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of [[Eboracum]] and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of [[Scandinavian York|Eoforwic]].\n\nDuring 867, the army marched deep into [[Mercia]] and wintered in [[Nottingham]].  The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868\u201369. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford.\n\nIn 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] paid them to leave.  The army then marched to [[London]] to overwinter in 871-2. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at [[Torksey]], on the Trent close to the Humber.<ref name=hadley23/> The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'a foolish king's thegn' was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at [[Repton]] on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex.<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian D. |author-link=Julian D.

In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time. [[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|The Tale of Ragnar's Sons]], on the other hand, mentions that the invasion of England by the Great Heathen Army was aimed at avenging the death of Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary Viking ruler of Sweden and Denmark.{{efn|name=son2|There is nothing in the annals to suggest that the brothers invaded England to avenge their father's killing. Also there is no reference to them being the sons of Ragnar.<ref name=munch357/>}} In the Viking saga, Ragnar is said to have conducted a raid on Northumbria during the reign of King \u00c6lla. The Vikings were defeated and Ragnar was captured by the Northumbrians. \u00c6lla then had Ragnar executed by throwing him into a pit of venomous snakes.

The lower reaches of the rivers and the coastal regions were left largely undefended. Religious communities in these areas, however, chose to move inland away from the reaches of the Viking fleets. With the changes in Francia making raiding more difficult, the Vikings turned their attention to England.<ref name=sawyer9 />\n\n==Invasion of England==\nThe term ''vikingr'' simply meant pirate, and the Viking ''heres'' may well have included fighters of other nationalities than Scandinavians.<ref name=reuter266 /> The Viking leaders would often join together for mutual benefit and then dissolve once profit had been achieved.<ref name=reuter266 /> Several of the Viking leaders who had been active in Francia and Frisia joined forces to conquer the four kingdoms constituting [[Anglo-Saxon England]].

The [[Burgred of Mercia|king of Mercia]] requested help from the king of Wessex to help fight the Vikings. A combined army from Wessex and Mercia besieged the city of Nottingham with no clear result, so the Mercians settled on paying the Vikings off. The Vikings returned to Northumbria in autumn 868 and overwintered in York, staying there for most of 869. They returned to East Anglia and spent the winter of 869\u201370 at Thetford. While in Thetford, they were attacked by [[Edmund the Martyr|Edmund]], king of East Anglia, with whom they had no peace agreement.

This was followed closely by what was described by Asser as the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], under which England was divided between the Anglo-Saxons of Wessex and the Vikings.

It seems they were partly discouraged by the defeat of Guthrum but also Alfred's success against the Vikings coincided with a period of renewed weakness in Francia. The Frankish emperor, Charles the Bald, died in 877 and his son shortly after, precipitating a period of political instability of which the Vikings were quick to take advantage.

Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine ''Miroir du Cyclisme'': \"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it. That's a promise.\"{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=168}} On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: \"Next year, it's you\", repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of {{ct|LVC|1985|nolink=yes}} that same evening.{{sfn|de Vis\u00e9|2019|pp=128\u2013129}} Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child's scooter, with Hinault saying \"Because you've been so good, I'll take you along next year on my handlebars\", to which LeMond replied: \"Thanks, Uncle Bernard.\"{{sfn|Abt|1990|p=96}} His first Tour victory the following year did not come to LeMond as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the [[1986 Tour de France]], only conceding defeat after the last time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=162\u2013170}} LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\"{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=186}}\n\nIn previous years, cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with toe-clips, allowing them to not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault had used [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clip-ins (clipless pedals)]], which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal. His victory in this Tour made these clip-ins popular.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdXCmwpk-SAC&pg=PA157|page=157|title=Historical Dictionary of Cycling|first1=Jeroen|last1=Heijmans|last2=Mallon|first2=Bill|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7175-5|series=Historical dictionaries of sports}}</ref>\n\nThere was some criticism that the time trials were too important.

The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}} The system for the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was changed for the 1987 Tour: in previous years, more points were earned in flat stages than in mountain stages, which gave sprinters an advantage in this classification; in 1984 all stages gave 25 points for the winner.<ref name=\"kbnl\">{{cite news|url=http://kranten.kb.nl/view/article/id/ddd%3A010962071%3Ampeg21%3Ap021%3Aa0310|title=Ruim ton voor winnaar|language=Dutch|publisher=Koninklijke Bibliotheek|work=Het Vrije Volk|date=28 June 1985|page=21|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]].

This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nThe sixth individual classification was the [[intermediate sprints classification in the Tour de France|intermediate sprints classification]]. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow [[Casquette|caps]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]], in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each [[Mass start|mass-start]] stage to the cyclist they considered most combative.

Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine ''Miroir du Cyclisme'': \"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it. That's a promise.\"{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=168}} On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: \"Next year, it's you\", repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of {{ct|LVC|1985|nolink=yes}} that same evening.{{sfn|de Vis\u00e9|2019|pp=128\u2013129}} Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child's scooter, with Hinault saying \"Because you've been so good, I'll take you along next year on my handlebars\", to which LeMond replied: \"Thanks, Uncle Bernard.\"{{sfn|Abt|1990|p=96}} His first Tour victory the following year did not come to LeMond as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the [[1986 Tour de France]], only conceding defeat after the last time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=162\u2013170}} LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\"{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=186}}\n\nIn previous years, cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with toe-clips, allowing them to not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault had used [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clip-ins (clipless pedals)]], which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal. His victory in this Tour made these clip-ins popular.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdXCmwpk-SAC&pg=PA157|page=157|title=Historical Dictionary of Cycling|first1=Jeroen|last1=Heijmans|last2=Mallon|first2=Bill|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7175-5|series=Historical dictionaries of sports}}</ref>\n\nThere was some criticism that the time trials were too important.

After spelling a couple of words, Cartman believes he will have a chance to win the spelling bee. While at the spelling bee, the children face stiff competition from two [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswalds. Cartman asks the monkey to help him spell his word, ''chair'', but Phonics Monkey is [[masturbation|masturbating]], and Cartman misspells it as \"C-H-A-R-E\"; angered, he runs off to chase the monkey. In the final round, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is unable to spell his word, \"''Kroxldyphivc''\" (which in reality isn't an actual word), correctly and Rebecca and Mark are declared the champions. Although Kyle is annoyed at having been beaten, he ends up developing a crush on Rebecca.\n\nMark becomes intrigued by the interactions he sees between Cartman, Kyle, and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and begs his father to be allowed to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. His father objects due to how dangerous public schools can be, but reluctantly relents. At the school, Mark, placed in a largely protective [[hamster ball]] by his overpossesive/overprotective father, is tormented for his [[wiktionary:haughty|haughty]] attitude and superior knowledge, and ends up duct taped to a bench by the other boys. This prompts Mark's father to speak with the adults in Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails about the incident and the fact that Kyle has become smitten with Rebecca and should stop pursuing her. The adults are quick to dislike him as much as the kids dislike Mark; after learning that he does not drink beer but prefers [[wine coolers]], they proceed to duct tape Mark's father to one of the bar's benches.\n\nAfter questioning Mark about why he has never been seen before and why he does not attend school like the other children, Cartman is introduced to the concept of home schooling. The idea of never having to go to school appeals to him greatly, and, using [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] condescending remarks towards him as an excuse, demands to be home schooled himself. To him, this involves a regimen of sleeping in and sitting in bed while snacking and watching [[television]], while his mother unsuccessfully attempts to get him to study. When Stan and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] come to visit to tell him about the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] Memorial Dance, Phonics Monkey kills Kenny.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle makes many efforts to make his feelings known to Rebecca, although several end up humorously unsuccessful. Ultimately he convinces her to explore the world of public schooling, and she agrees to go to the South Park dance with him. He also explains what love is to her and, out of curiosity, she asks Kyle if she can experiment a kiss with him, to which he agrees. After kissing him, Rebecca immediately changes when she agrees to Kyle's dance proposal (\"You bet your sweet ass I'll go.\")\n\nAt the dance, the band [[Dio (band)|Dio]] plays their song \"[[Holy Diver (song)|Holy Diver]]\". The boys of the school hatch a plan to [[duct tape]] Mark to the flagpole while the adults also hatch a similar plan for Mark's father. When Rebecca enters the dance dressed up promiscuously and kissing every boy in sight, Mark is outraged and attacks Kyle for turning his sister \"into a [[slut]].\" The other boys perceive his beating up Kyle as cool and finally accept him; [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] breaks up the fight, with Mark warning Kyle he's not through with him. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswald arrive and interrupt the dance, looking for their children so they could leave. Mark gets onstage and makes a speech to his parents (particularly to his father) about the benefits of public schools - \"...it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves.\" Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss. Mark's father, however, is then duct taped to the flagpole in front of the school by the adults, regardless of his change in attitude and opinion. Dio restarts and plays \"Holy Diver\" over the end credits, with Phonics Monkey joining in on drums.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe character of Rebecca is based on [[Rebecca Sealfon]] who won the 1997 [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]]. She is one of the most well-known spelling bee winners, spelling her final word, \"[[wiktionary:euonym|euonym]],\" by screaming out each letter. She also displayed the odd habit of covering her mouth and whispering each letter before saying it, which was parodied in the episode as well.<ref name=\"abc\">{{cite news |title=Spelling Bee Champs: Where Are They Now? |first=Jonann |last=Brady |newspaper= [[ABC News]]|date=1 June 2006|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2026770 |accessdate=9 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\nKyle's speech to Rebecca about love parodies the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]\"; a musical cue often used in romantic scenes during ''The Original Series'' can also be heard during this scene.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/05/ign-tvs-10-favorite-south-park-episodes</ref> Kyle's love confession and kiss with Rebecca parodies a scene between Judah Ben-Hur and Esther in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n\nWhen [[Ronnie James Dio]] was asked how he felt about ''South Park'''s parody of him, he said \"I thought it was wonderful.

When Stan and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] come to visit to tell him about the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] Memorial Dance, Phonics Monkey kills Kenny.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle makes many efforts to make his feelings known to Rebecca, although several end up humorously unsuccessful. Ultimately he convinces her to explore the world of public schooling, and she agrees to go to the South Park dance with him. He also explains what love is to her and, out of curiosity, she asks Kyle if she can experiment a kiss with him, to which he agrees. After kissing him, Rebecca immediately changes when she agrees to Kyle's dance proposal (\"You bet your sweet ass I'll go.\")\n\nAt the dance, the band [[Dio (band)|Dio]] plays their song \"[[Holy Diver (song)|Holy Diver]]\". The boys of the school hatch a plan to [[duct tape]] Mark to the flagpole while the adults also hatch a similar plan for Mark's father. When Rebecca enters the dance dressed up promiscuously and kissing every boy in sight, Mark is outraged and attacks Kyle for turning his sister \"into a [[slut]].\" The other boys perceive his beating up Kyle as cool and finally accept him; [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] breaks up the fight, with Mark warning Kyle he's not through with him. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswald arrive and interrupt the dance, looking for their children so they could leave. Mark gets onstage and makes a speech to his parents (particularly to his father) about the benefits of public schools - \"...it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves.\" Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss. Mark's father, however, is then duct taped to the flagpole in front of the school by the adults, regardless of his change in attitude and opinion. Dio restarts and plays \"Holy Diver\" over the end credits, with Phonics Monkey joining in on drums.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe character of Rebecca is based on [[Rebecca Sealfon]] who won the 1997 [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]]. She is one of the most well-known spelling bee winners, spelling her final word, \"[[wiktionary:euonym|euonym]],\" by screaming out each letter. She also displayed the odd habit of covering her mouth and whispering each letter before saying it, which was parodied in the episode as well.<ref name=\"abc\">{{cite news |title=Spelling Bee Champs: Where Are They Now? |first=Jonann |last=Brady |newspaper= [[ABC News]]|date=1 June 2006|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2026770 |accessdate=9 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\nKyle's speech to Rebecca about love parodies the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]\"; a musical cue often used in romantic scenes during ''The Original Series'' can also be heard during this scene.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/05/ign-tvs-10-favorite-south-park-episodes</ref> Kyle's love confession and kiss with Rebecca parodies a scene between Judah Ben-Hur and Esther in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n\nWhen [[Ronnie James Dio]] was asked how he felt about ''South Park'''s parody of him, he said \"I thought it was wonderful. I initially didn't want to let it be done because I felt that they were just going to crucify me [and] that I would end up being like [[Are You There God?

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2019|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707033751/https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|archive-date=2019-07-07|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2019|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707033751/https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|archive-date=2019-07-07|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

Francis tells Peter he is a failure as a worker and a father, with this Peter gets tired of trying to please his father and at first does not know what to do, but then sees on the news that the [[Pope]] is visiting [[Boston]]. Peter decides to drive to Boston and \"[[kidnapping|kidnap]]\" the Pope so that he could tell Francis what a good father and person he is. Peter takes the Pope to his house; when Lois sees him she is terrified that Peter kidnapped him. Although he kidnapped him, the Pope agrees to tell Francis what a good person Peter is. Before they go, Peter fixes the problems Francis had created for his grandchildren; he tells Chris that what happens in the bathroom is between him and God, and to Meg that it is okay at her age to go out with boys, and tells Stewie about how loving God is.\n\nPeter takes the Pope to the toy factory, where he tells Francis that Peter is a good man and father. After hearing this Francis accuses the Pope of being soft; the Pope takes great offense at Francis's claim and starts yelling at him, threatening to [[Excommunication|excommunicate]] him. Peter intervenes, and when he reveals he wanted his father's love, Francis says that albeit he does not like Peter's personality, he loves his son, and Peter reconciles with his father. Francis is forgiven by the Pope and is hired for a job as a [[security guard]] for his tour of the [[United States]]. At the end of the episode, Peter's mother shows up at the door and wishes to live with the family, prompting them to jump in an escape pod.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mike Henry by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|left|160px|alt=A man with close-shaven hair, and a slight beard, looks to his left, with his body turned.|[[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] acted as a staff writer for this episode.]]\n\n\"Holy Crap\" was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and directed by [[Neil Affleck]].
