The film was directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and stars [[Peter Sellers]], [[George C. Scott]], [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Slim Pickens]]. Production took place in the United Kingdom. The film is loosely based on [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958).\n\nThe story concerns an unhinged [[United States Air Force]] general who orders a [[first strike]] [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on the Soviet Union. It separately follows the [[President of the United States]], his advisors, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) exchange officer as they attempt to prevent the crew of a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] plane (who were ordered by the general) from nuking the Soviets and starting an atomic holocaust.\n\nThe film is often considered one of the best comedies ever made, and, not so frequently, one of the greatest films of all time. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it twenty-sixth in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|its list of the best American movies]] (in the 2007 edition, the film ranked thirty-ninth), and in 2000, it was listed as number three on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|its list of the funniest American films]]. \n\nIn 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] included ''Dr. Strangelove'' as one of the first twenty-five films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[United States Air Force]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Jack D. Ripper is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) 843rd Bomb Wing, flying [[B-52 bomber]]s armed with [[hydrogen bomb]]s. The 843rd Wing is flying on airborne alert, two hours from their targets inside the [[USSR]].\n\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Ripper and Mandrake.png|thumb|left|Ripper tells Mandrake that he discovered the Communist plot to pollute all Americans' \"precious bodily fluids\" during \"the physical act of love\".]]\n\nGeneral Ripper orders his [[Executive officer#Military|executive officer]], [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake of the UK [[Royal Air Force]], to put the base on alert, and to issue \"Wing Attack Plan R\" to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. \"King\" Kong. All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on the [[USSR]] and set their radios to allow communications only through their [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|CRM 114 discriminator]]s, which was designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and he tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the [[Water_fluoridation_controversy#Communist_conspiracy_theory_(1940s\u20131960s)|Soviets have been using fluoridation]] of the American water supplies to pollute the \"precious bodily fluids\" of Americans. Mandrake realizes that Ripper has gone insane.\n\nIn the [[Joint War Room|War Room]] at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how Plan R enables a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if [[decapitation strike|all superiors have been killed in a first strike]] on the United States. Turgidson reports that his men are trying every possible three-letter CRM code to issue the stand-down order, but that could take over two days and the planes are due to reach their targets in a couple of hours. Muffley orders the [[U.S. Army]] to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson then attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue, but Muffley refuses to be party to a nuclear [[first strike]]. Instead, he brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone [[Soviet Premier]] Dimitri Kissov on the \"[[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|hot line]]\". Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the positions of the [[bomber]]s and targets so that the Soviets can protect themselves.\n\nAfter a heated discussion in Russian with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union has created a [[Doomsday device|doomsday machine]], which consists of many buried [[cobalt bomb|bombs jacketed with \"cobalt-thorium G\"]] connected to a computer network set to detonate them automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. Within two months after detonation, the cobalt-thorium G would encircle the planet in a radioactive \"doomsday shroud\", wiping out all human and animal life, rendering the surface of the Earth uninhabitable for about 93 years. The device cannot be dismantled or \"untriggered\", as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. When the President's wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, the former [[Nazi German]] Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it, de Sadeski replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week.\n\nMeanwhile, [[U.S. Army]] troops arrive at Burpelson, still sealed by Ripper's order, to take over the base after a heated firefight with Air Force security policemen. General Ripper then shoots and kills himself, while Mandrake identifies Ripper's CRM code from his desk blotter (\"OPE,\" a variant of both ''Peace on Earth'' and ''Purity of Essence'')<ref name=Kramer>{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Peter|title=Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1844577798|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GQkoBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT53&q=dr%20strangelove%20ope%20recall%20code%20%22peace%20on%20earth%22|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> and relays this code to the Pentagon. Using the recall code, SAC successfully recalls all of the bombers but one. No one in the War Room knows that a Soviet [[surface-to-air missile]] has damaged the fuel tanks of that plane and destroyed its radio equipment, making it impossible to recall this particular plane even with the correct recall code.\n\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Riding the Bomb.png|thumb|Bomber commander Major T. J. Kong riding the bomb down.]]\nMuffley discloses the plane's target to help the Soviets find it, but its commanding officer, Major Kong, with his fuel dwindling, has switched to a closer backup target instead. As the plane approaches the new target, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Kong enters the [[bomb bay]] and repairs the broken electrical wiring while sitting on the [[H-bomb]], whereupon the doors open and the bomb is dropped. With Kong straddling it as a cowboy would a [[bucking bull]], the bomb falls and detonates over a Soviet [[ICBM]] site.\n\nBack in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove, resisting the urge to fall into Nazi habits of saluting and referring to the President as \"Mein Fuhrer\", recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once the radiation has subsided. Turgidson, worried that the Soviets will do the same, warns about a \"[[missile gap|mineshaft gap]]\", while Alexei secretly photographs the war room, something Turgidson had earlier attempted to frame him for doing. Dr. Strangelove declares he has a plan, but then rises from his wheelchair and announces \"Mein F\u00fchrer, I can walk!\" as the Doomsday Machine activates. The film ends with a montage of many nuclear explosions, accompanied by [[Vera Lynn]]'s version of the popular World War II song \"[[We'll Meet Again]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as:\n** [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake, a British [[RAF]] [[exchange officer]]\n** President Merkin Muffley, the [[President of the United States]]\n** Dr. Strangelove, the wheelchair-bound [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] expert and former [[Nazi]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/03/who_was_dr_strangelove.html|title=Who Was Dr. Strangelove? |date= March 9, 1999|website=Slate (magazine)|access-date=February 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[George C.

Ace Owens, the co-pilot of the B-52\n\n===Peter Sellers's multiple roles===\n[[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to finance the film if [[Peter Sellers]] played at least four major roles. The condition stemmed from the studio's opinion that much of the success of Kubrick's previous film ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) was based on Sellers's performance in which his single character assumes a number of identities. Sellers had also played three roles in ''[[The Mouse That Roared (film)|The Mouse That Roared]]'' (1959). Kubrick accepted the demand, later explaining that \"such crass and grotesque stipulations are the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the motion-picture business\".<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2>Lee Hill, [http://www.altx.com/int2/terry.southern.html \"Interview with a Grand Guy\"]: interview with Terry Southern</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| direction=vertical\n| width=220\n| header=Peter Sellers's roles\n| image1=Dr. Strangelove - Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.png|caption1=Group Captain Mandrake sitting at an [[IBM 7090]] console<ref>Tulsa TV Memories.

He had been expected to play Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] aircraft commander, but from the beginning, Sellers was reluctant. He felt his workload was too heavy, and he worried he would not properly portray the character's [[Texas accent]]. Kubrick pleaded with him, and he asked the screenwriter [[Terry Southern]] (who had been raised in Texas) to record a tape with Kong's lines spoken in the correct accent. Using Southern's tape, Sellers managed to get the accent right, and he started acting in the scenes in the aircraft, but then sprained his ankle and he could not work in the cramped cockpit set.<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2/><ref>In the fictionalized [[biopic]] ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', it is suggested that Sellers faked the injury as a way to force Kubrick to release him from the contractual obligation to play this fourth role.</ref>\n\nSellers is said to have [[ad libitum|improvised much of his dialogue]], with Kubrick incorporating the ad-libs into the written screenplay so the improvised lines became part of the canonical screenplay, a practice known as [[retroscripting]].<ref name=Inside>\"Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove,\" a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film</ref><!-- 15m 31s Alexander Walker, 17m 50s Pamela Carlton --> <!-- Vincent LoBrutto's book on Stanley Kubrick? -->{{clarify|reason=What is canonical and what is retroscripting? Plaese explain here!|date=August 2019}}\n\n====Group Captain Lionel Mandrake====\nAccording to film critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]], the author of biographies of both Sellers and Kubrick, the role of [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake was the easiest of the three for Sellers to play, since he was aided by his experience of mimicking his superiors while serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=Inside/><!-- 15m 58s --> There is also a heavy resemblance to Sellers' friend and occasional co-star [[Terry-Thomas]] and the [[prosthetic]]-limbed RAF ace Sir [[Douglas Bader]].\n\n====President Merkin Muffley====\nFor his performance as President Merkin Muffley, Sellers assumed the accent of an American [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]]. Sellers drew inspiration for the role from [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]],<ref name=Inside/><!-- 16m 54s, Alexander Walker --> a former [[Illinois]] governor who was the Democratic candidate for the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential elections]] and the U.N. ambassador during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\nIn early takes, Sellers faked [[common cold|cold]] symptoms to emphasize the character's apparent weakness. That caused frequent laughter among the film crew, ruining several takes. Kubrick ultimately found this comic portrayal inappropriate, feeling that Muffley should be a serious character.<ref name=Inside/><!-- 16m 25s Ken Adam, 16m 54s Alexander Walker --> In later takes Sellers played the role straight, though the President's cold is still evident in several scenes.\n\nIn keeping with Kubrick's satirical character names, a \"[[merkin]]\" is a pubic hair wig. The president is bald, and his last name is \"Muffley\"; both are additional homages to a merkin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oed.com/start;jsessionid=361B5C597576A1700D333C6EE7CE8746?authRejection=true&url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F116815%3Frskey%3DjIHCjp%26result%3D1|title=Oxford English Dictionary: Merkin|website=www.oed.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\n====Dr. Strangelove====\nDr. Strangelove is an ex-[[Nazism|Nazi]] scientist, suggesting [[Operation Paperclip]], the US effort to recruit top German technical talent at the end of World War II.<ref>Dan Geddes, \"[http://www.thesatirist.com/films/DoctorStrangelove.html Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)]\"; ''The Satirist'', December 2011.</ref><ref>Beverly Merrill Kelley, ''Reelpolitik II: Political Ideologies in '50s and '60s Films''; Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield, 2004; p.

The [[black and white]] cinematography was by [[Gilbert Taylor]], and the film was edited by [[Anthony Harvey]] and an uncredited Kubrick. The original musical score for the film was composed by [[Laurie Johnson]] and the special effects were by Wally Veevers. The theme of the chorus from the bomb run scene is a modification of ''[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]''.

One side of the room was covered with gigantic strategic maps reflecting in a shiny black floor inspired by dance scenes in [[Fred Astaire]] films. In the middle of the room there was a large circular table lit from above by a circle of lamps, suggesting a poker table.

The B-52 was state-of-the-art in the 1960s, and its cockpit was off-limits to the film crew.

Although ''Fail Safe'' was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his film's box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' (on which the film is based) is so similar to ''Red Alert'' that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebookmall.com/ebook/72987-ebook.htm|title=Red Alert\u2014Peter Bryant\u2014Microsoft Reader eBook|accessdate=November 27, 2006|publisher=eBookMall, Inc.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225054/http://www.ebookmall.com/ebook/72987-ebook.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \nWhat worried Kubrick the most was that ''Fail Safe'' boasted the acclaimed director [[Sidney Lumet]] and the first-rate dramatic actors [[Henry Fonda]] as the American president and [[Walter Matthau]] as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into ''Fail Safe''{{'}}s production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary ''Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove'': \"We started casting. Fonda was already set&nbsp;... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter [Bernstein, the screenwriter] was set&nbsp;... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures.\"\n\nKubrick argued that ''Fail Safe''{{'}}s own source novel ''Fail-Safe'' (1960) had been plagiarized from Peter George's ''Red Alert'', to which Kubrick owned creative rights. He pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between the characters Groeteschele and Strangelove. The plan worked, and ''Fail Safe'' opened eight months after ''Dr. Strangelove'', to critical acclaim but mediocre ticket sales.\n\n===Ending===\nThe end of the film shows Dr. Strangelove exclaiming, \"''Mein F\u00fchrer,'' I can walk!\" before cutting to footage of nuclear explosions, with [[Vera Lynn]] and her audience singing \"[[We'll Meet Again]]\".

Military strategist and former physicist [[Herman Kahn]], in the book ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]'' (1960), used the theoretical example of a \"[[Doomsday device|doomsday machine]]\" to illustrate the limitations of MAD, which was developed by [[John von Neumann]].\n\nThe concept of such a machine is consistent with MAD doctrine when it is logically pursued to its conclusion. It thus worried Kahn that the military might like the idea of a doomsday machine and build one.<ref>''On Thermonuclear War'' pp. 144\u2013155</ref> Kahn, a leading critic of MAD and [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower's administration]]'s doctrine of [[massive retaliation]] upon the slightest provocation by the USSR, considered MAD to be foolish bravado, and urged America to instead plan for [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], and thus even a limited nuclear war. With this logical reasoning, Kahn became one of the architects of the [[flexible response]] doctrine, which, while superficially resembling MAD, allowed for responding to a limited nuclear strike with a proportional, or calibrated, return of fire (see ''[[On Escalation]]'').\n\nKahn educated Kubrick on the concept of the semirealistic [[cobalt bomb|\"cobalt-thorium G\"]] doomsday machine, and then Kubrick used the concept for the film. Kahn in his writings and talks would often come across as cold and calculating, for example, with his use of the term \"[[megadeath]]s\" and in his willingness to estimate how many human lives the United States could lose and still rebuild economically.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, Volume 1 |last= |first= |authorlink= |vauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=978-0-684-80657-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam03deco/page/471 471] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam03deco/page/471 |accessdate= |url-access=registration }}</ref> Kahn's cold analytical attitude towards millions of deaths is reflected in Turgidson's remark to the president about the outcome of a preemptive nuclear war: \"Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks.\" Turgidson has a binder that is labelled \"World Targets in Megadeaths\", a term coined in 1953 by Kahn and popularized in his 1960 book ''On Thermonuclear War''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The age of radiance : the epic rise and dramatic fall of the atomic era|last=Craig|first=Nelson|year=2014|isbn=978-1451660432|pages=290, 291|oclc=852226548}}</ref>\n\nThe [[wikt:post hoc|post-hoc]] planning in the film, by Dr. Strangelove, done {{em|after}} the MAD policy has clearly broken down, to keep the human race alive and to regenerate from populations sheltered in [[mineshaft]]s, is a parody of those strict adherents of the MAD doctrine who are opposed to the prior creation of [[fallout shelter]]s on ideological grounds. To such adherents, talk of survival takes the \"Assured Destruction\" out of \"Mutual Assured Destruction\", hence no preparations should be conducted for fear of \"destabilizing\" the MAD doctrine. Moreover, it is also somewhat of a parody of [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Edward Teller]], Herman Kahn, and [[Chet Holifield]]'s November 1961 popularization of a similar plan to spend billions of dollars on a nationwide network of [[radiation shielding|highly protective]] concrete-lined underground fallout shelters, capable of holding millions of people and to be built {{em|before}} any such nuclear exchange began.<ref>''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine November 1961 pages 112\u2013115 et al.</ref> These extensive and therefore wildly expensive preparations were the fullest conceivable implementation of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s, month prior, September 1961 advocacy in favor of the comparatively more modest, individual and community [[fallout shelter]]s, as it appeared in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.em.doe.gov/Publications/timeline_sep1961.aspx|title=Office of Environmental Management - Department of Energy|website=www.em.doe.gov|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}</ref> which was in the context of [[The Shelter (The Twilight Zone)#Context|shelters being on the minds of the public at the time]] due to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. The Kennedy administration would later go on to expand the nascent [[United States civil defense]] efforts, including the [[Duck and cover#Delayed nuclear radiation, \"fallout\"|assessment of millions of homes]] and to create a network of thousands of well known, black and yellow plaqued, community fallout shelters. This was done, not with a massive construction effort but by the relatively cheap re-purposing of existing buildings and stocking them with [[CD V-700|CD V-700 geiger counters]] etc. In 1962 the Kennedy administration would found the [[American Civil Defense Association]] to organize this, comparatively far more [[Civil defense#Atomic Age|cost-effective, shelter effort]].\n\nThe fallout-shelter-network proposal, mentioned in the film, with its inherently high [[radiation protection]] characteristics, has similarities and contrasts to that of the very real and robust [[Military of Switzerland#Military and civil defence|Swiss civil defense]] network. Switzerland has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the country's population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=June 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=February 10, 2007}}</ref> If the US did that, it would violate the spirit of MAD and according to MAD adherents, allegedly destabilize the situation because the US could launch a [[first strike]] and its population would largely survive a retaliatory second strike (see [[Mutual assured destruction#Theory|MAD \u00a7 Theory]]).\n\nTo refute early 1960s novels and Hollywood films like ''Fail-Safe'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'', which raised questions about US control over nuclear weapons, the Air Force produced a documentary film, ''SAC Command Post'', to demonstrate its responsiveness to presidential command and its tight control over nuclear weapons.<ref>''[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb304/film03.htm SAC Command Post]''</ref> However, later academic research into declassified documents showed that U.S. military commanders had been given presidentially-authorized pre-delegation for the use of nuclear weapons during the early Cold War, showing that that aspect of the film's plot was plausible.<ref name=diplomat-20180105>{{cite magazine |url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/dr-strangelove-and-the-insane-reality-of-nuclear-command-and-control/ |title=Dr. Strangelove and the Insane Reality of Nuclear Command-and-Control |last=Gady |first=Franz-Stefan |magazine=The Diplomat |date=5 January 2018 |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe characters of Buck Turgidson and Jack Ripper both deride the real-life Gen.

The film was directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and stars [[Peter Sellers]], [[George C. Scott]], [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Slim Pickens]]. Production took place in the United Kingdom. The film is loosely based on [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958).\n\nThe story concerns an unhinged [[United States Air Force]] general who orders a [[first strike]] [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on the Soviet Union. It separately follows the [[President of the United States]], his advisors, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) exchange officer as they attempt to prevent the crew of a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] plane (who were ordered by the general) from nuking the Soviets and starting an atomic holocaust.\n\nThe film is often considered one of the best comedies ever made, and, not so frequently, one of the greatest films of all time. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it twenty-sixth in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|its list of the best American movies]] (in the 2007 edition, the film ranked thirty-ninth), and in 2000, it was listed as number three on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|its list of the funniest American films]]. \n\nIn 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] included ''Dr. Strangelove'' as one of the first twenty-five films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[United States Air Force]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Jack D. Ripper is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) 843rd Bomb Wing, flying [[B-52 bomber]]s armed with [[hydrogen bomb]]s. The 843rd Wing is flying on airborne alert, two hours from their targets inside the [[USSR]].\n\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Ripper and Mandrake.png|thumb|left|Ripper tells Mandrake that he discovered the Communist plot to pollute all Americans' \"precious bodily fluids\" during \"the physical act of love\".]]\n\nGeneral Ripper orders his [[Executive officer#Military|executive officer]], [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake of the UK [[Royal Air Force]], to put the base on alert, and to issue \"Wing Attack Plan R\" to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. \"King\" Kong. All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on the [[USSR]] and set their radios to allow communications only through their [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|CRM 114 discriminator]]s, which was designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and he tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the [[Water_fluoridation_controversy#Communist_conspiracy_theory_(1940s\u20131960s)|Soviets have been using fluoridation]] of the American water supplies to pollute the \"precious bodily fluids\" of Americans. Mandrake realizes that Ripper has gone insane.\n\nIn the [[Joint War Room|War Room]] at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how Plan R enables a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if [[decapitation strike|all superiors have been killed in a first strike]] on the United States. Turgidson reports that his men are trying every possible three-letter CRM code to issue the stand-down order, but that could take over two days and the planes are due to reach their targets in a couple of hours. Muffley orders the [[U.S. Army]] to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson then attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue, but Muffley refuses to be party to a nuclear [[first strike]]. Instead, he brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone [[Soviet Premier]] Dimitri Kissov on the \"[[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|hot line]]\". Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the positions of the [[bomber]]s and targets so that the Soviets can protect themselves.\n\nAfter a heated discussion in Russian with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union has created a [[Doomsday device|doomsday machine]], which consists of many buried [[cobalt bomb|bombs jacketed with \"cobalt-thorium G\"]] connected to a computer network set to detonate them automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. Within two months after detonation, the cobalt-thorium G would encircle the planet in a radioactive \"doomsday shroud\", wiping out all human and animal life, rendering the surface of the Earth uninhabitable for about 93 years. The device cannot be dismantled or \"untriggered\", as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. When the President's wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, the former [[Nazi German]] Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it, de Sadeski replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week.\n\nMeanwhile, [[U.S. Army]] troops arrive at Burpelson, still sealed by Ripper's order, to take over the base after a heated firefight with Air Force security policemen. General Ripper then shoots and kills himself, while Mandrake identifies Ripper's CRM code from his desk blotter (\"OPE,\" a variant of both ''Peace on Earth'' and ''Purity of Essence'')<ref name=Kramer>{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Peter|title=Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1844577798|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GQkoBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT53&q=dr%20strangelove%20ope%20recall%20code%20%22peace%20on%20earth%22|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> and relays this code to the Pentagon. Using the recall code, SAC successfully recalls all of the bombers but one. No one in the War Room knows that a Soviet [[surface-to-air missile]] has damaged the fuel tanks of that plane and destroyed its radio equipment, making it impossible to recall this particular plane even with the correct recall code.\n\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Riding the Bomb.png|thumb|Bomber commander Major T. J. Kong riding the bomb down.]]\nMuffley discloses the plane's target to help the Soviets find it, but its commanding officer, Major Kong, with his fuel dwindling, has switched to a closer backup target instead. As the plane approaches the new target, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Kong enters the [[bomb bay]] and repairs the broken electrical wiring while sitting on the [[H-bomb]], whereupon the doors open and the bomb is dropped. With Kong straddling it as a cowboy would a [[bucking bull]], the bomb falls and detonates over a Soviet [[ICBM]] site.\n\nBack in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove, resisting the urge to fall into Nazi habits of saluting and referring to the President as \"Mein Fuhrer\", recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once the radiation has subsided. Turgidson, worried that the Soviets will do the same, warns about a \"[[missile gap|mineshaft gap]]\", while Alexei secretly photographs the war room, something Turgidson had earlier attempted to frame him for doing. Dr. Strangelove declares he has a plan, but then rises from his wheelchair and announces that he can walk again. Soon, the Doomsday Machine kicks into operation, and the film ends with a montage of many nuclear explosions, accompanied by [[Vera Lynn]]'s version of the popular World War II song \"[[We'll Meet Again]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as:\n** [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake, a British [[RAF]] [[exchange officer]]\n** President Merkin Muffley, the [[President of the United States]]\n** Dr. Strangelove, the wheelchair-bound [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] expert and former [[Nazi]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/03/who_was_dr_strangelove.html|title=Who Was Dr. Strangelove? |date= March 9, 1999|website=Slate (magazine)|access-date=February 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[George C.

Ace Owens, the co-pilot of the B-52\n\n===Peter Sellers's multiple roles===\n[[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to finance the film if [[Peter Sellers]] played at least four major roles. The condition stemmed from the studio's opinion that much of the success of Kubrick's previous film ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) was based on Sellers's performance in which his single character assumes a number of identities. Sellers had also played three roles in ''[[The Mouse That Roared (film)|The Mouse That Roared]]'' (1959). Kubrick accepted the demand, later explaining that \"such crass and grotesque stipulations are the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the motion-picture business\".<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2>Lee Hill, [http://www.altx.com/int2/terry.southern.html \"Interview with a Grand Guy\"]: interview with Terry Southern</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| direction=vertical\n| width=220\n| header=Peter Sellers's roles\n| image1=Dr. Strangelove - Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.png|caption1=Group Captain Mandrake sitting at an [[IBM 7090]] console<ref>Tulsa TV Memories.

He had been expected to play Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] aircraft commander, but from the beginning, Sellers was reluctant. He felt his workload was too heavy, and he worried he would not properly portray the character's [[Texas accent]]. Kubrick pleaded with him, and he asked the screenwriter [[Terry Southern]] (who had been raised in Texas) to record a tape with Kong's lines spoken in the correct accent. Using Southern's tape, Sellers managed to get the accent right, and he started acting in the scenes in the aircraft, but then sprained his ankle and he could not work in the cramped cockpit set.<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2/><ref>In the fictionalized [[biopic]] ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', it is suggested that Sellers faked the injury as a way to force Kubrick to release him from the contractual obligation to play this fourth role.</ref>\n\nSellers is said to have [[ad libitum|improvised much of his dialogue]], with Kubrick incorporating the ad-libs into the written screenplay so the improvised lines became part of the canonical screenplay, a practice known as [[retroscripting]].<ref name=Inside>\"Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove,\" a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film</ref><!-- 15m 31s Alexander Walker, 17m 50s Pamela Carlton --> <!-- Vincent LoBrutto's book on Stanley Kubrick? -->{{clarify|reason=What is canonical and what is retroscripting? Plaese explain here!|date=August 2019}}\n\n====Group Captain Lionel Mandrake====\nAccording to film critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]], the author of biographies of both Sellers and Kubrick, the role of [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake was the easiest of the three for Sellers to play, since he was aided by his experience of mimicking his superiors while serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=Inside/><!-- 15m 58s --> There is also a heavy resemblance to Sellers' friend and occasional co-star [[Terry-Thomas]] and the [[prosthetic]]-limbed RAF ace Sir [[Douglas Bader]].\n\n====President Merkin Muffley====\nFor his performance as President Merkin Muffley, Sellers assumed the accent of an American [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]]. Sellers drew inspiration for the role from [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]],<ref name=Inside/><!-- 16m 54s, Alexander Walker --> a former [[Illinois]] governor who was the Democratic candidate for the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential elections]] and the U.N. ambassador during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\nIn early takes, Sellers faked [[common cold|cold]] symptoms to emphasize the character's apparent weakness. That caused frequent laughter among the film crew, ruining several takes. Kubrick ultimately found this comic portrayal inappropriate, feeling that Muffley should be a serious character.<ref name=Inside/><!-- 16m 25s Ken Adam, 16m 54s Alexander Walker --> In later takes Sellers played the role straight, though the President's cold is still evident in several scenes.\n\nIn keeping with Kubrick's satirical character names, a \"[[merkin]]\" is a pubic hair wig. The president is bald, and his last name is \"Muffley\"; both are additional homages to a merkin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oed.com/start;jsessionid=361B5C597576A1700D333C6EE7CE8746?authRejection=true&url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F116815%3Frskey%3DjIHCjp%26result%3D1|title=Oxford English Dictionary: Merkin|website=www.oed.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\n====Dr. Strangelove====\nDr. Strangelove is an ex-[[Nazism|Nazi]] scientist, suggesting [[Operation Paperclip]], the US effort to recruit top German technical talent at the end of World War II.<ref>Dan Geddes, \"[http://www.thesatirist.com/films/DoctorStrangelove.html Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)]\"; ''The Satirist'', December 2011.</ref><ref>Beverly Merrill Kelley, ''Reelpolitik II: Political Ideologies in '50s and '60s Films''; Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield, 2004; p.

''Mad, Bad, and Dangerous?: The Scientist and the Cinema''. London: Reaktion, 2006. p.26</ref> According to Alexander Walker, Sellers improvised Dr. Strangelove's lapse into the [[Nazi salute]], borrowing one of Kubrick's black leather gloves for the uncontrollable hand that makes the gesture. Dr. Strangelove apparently suffers from [[alien hand syndrome]].

The [[black and white]] cinematography was by [[Gilbert Taylor]], and the film was edited by [[Anthony Harvey]] and an uncredited Kubrick. The original musical score for the film was composed by [[Laurie Johnson]] and the special effects were by Wally Veevers.

One side of the room was covered with gigantic strategic maps reflecting in a shiny black floor inspired by dance scenes in [[Fred Astaire]] films. In the middle of the room there was a large circular table lit from above by a circle of lamps, suggesting a poker table.

The B-52 was state-of-the-art in the 1960s, and its cockpit was off-limits to the film crew.

Indeed, the novel ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' (on which the film is based) is so similar to ''Red Alert'' that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebookmall.com/ebook/72987-ebook.htm|title=Red Alert\u2014Peter Bryant\u2014Microsoft Reader eBook|accessdate=November 27, 2006|publisher=eBookMall, Inc.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225054/http://www.ebookmall.com/ebook/72987-ebook.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \nWhat worried Kubrick the most was that ''Fail Safe'' boasted the acclaimed director [[Sidney Lumet]] and the first-rate dramatic actors [[Henry Fonda]] as the American president and [[Walter Matthau]] as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into ''Fail Safe''{{'}}s production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary ''Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove'': \"We started casting. Fonda was already set&nbsp;... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter [Bernstein, the screenwriter] was set&nbsp;... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures.\"\n\nKubrick argued that ''Fail Safe''{{'}}s own source novel ''Fail-Safe'' (1960) had been plagiarized from Peter George's ''Red Alert'', to which Kubrick owned creative rights. He pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between the characters Groeteschele and Strangelove. The plan worked, and ''Fail Safe'' opened eight months after ''Dr. Strangelove'', to critical acclaim but mediocre ticket sales.\n\n===Ending===\nThe end of the film shows Dr. Strangelove exclaiming, \"''Mein F\u00fchrer,'' I can walk!\" before cutting to footage of nuclear explosions, with [[Vera Lynn]] and her audience singing \"[[We'll Meet Again]]\".

Eisenhower|President Eisenhower's administration]]'s doctrine of [[massive retaliation]] upon the slightest provocation by the USSR, considered MAD to be foolish bravado, and urged America to instead plan for [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], and thus even a limited nuclear war. With this logical reasoning, Kahn became one of the architects of the [[flexible response]] doctrine, which, while superficially resembling MAD, allowed for responding to a limited nuclear strike with a proportional, or calibrated, return of fire (see ''[[On Escalation]]'').\n\nKahn educated Kubrick on the concept of the semirealistic [[cobalt bomb|\"cobalt-thorium G\"]] doomsday machine, and then Kubrick used the concept for the film. Kahn in his writings and talks would often come across as cold and calculating, for example, with his use of the term \"[[megadeath]]s\" and in his willingness to estimate how many human lives the United States could lose and still rebuild economically.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, Volume 1 |last= |first= |authorlink= |vauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=978-0-684-80657-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam03deco/page/471 471] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam03deco/page/471 |accessdate= |url-access=registration }}</ref> Kahn's cold analytical attitude towards millions of deaths is reflected in Turgidson's remark to the president about the outcome of a preemptive nuclear war: \"Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks.\" Turgidson has a binder that is labelled \"World Targets in Megadeaths\", a term coined in 1953 by Kahn and popularized in his 1960 book ''On Thermonuclear War''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The age of radiance : the epic rise and dramatic fall of the atomic era|last=Craig|first=Nelson|year=2014|isbn=978-1451660432|pages=290, 291|oclc=852226548}}</ref>\n\nThe [[wikt:post hoc|post-hoc]] planning in the film, by Dr. Strangelove, done {{em|after}} the MAD policy has clearly broken down, to keep the human race alive and to regenerate from populations sheltered in [[mineshaft]]s, is a parody of those strict adherents of the MAD doctrine who are opposed to the prior creation of [[fallout shelter]]s on ideological grounds. To such adherents, talk of survival takes the \"Assured Destruction\" out of \"Mutual Assured Destruction\", hence no preparations should be conducted for fear of \"destabilizing\" the MAD doctrine. Moreover, it is also somewhat of a parody of [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Edward Teller]], Herman Kahn, and [[Chet Holifield]]'s November 1961 popularization of a similar plan to spend billions of dollars on a nationwide network of [[radiation shielding|highly protective]] concrete-lined underground fallout shelters, capable of holding millions of people and to be built {{em|before}} any such nuclear exchange began.<ref>''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine November 1961 pages 112\u2013115 et al.</ref> These extensive and therefore wildly expensive preparations were the fullest conceivable implementation of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s, month prior, September 1961 advocacy in favor of the comparatively more modest, individual and community [[fallout shelter]]s, as it appeared in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.em.doe.gov/Publications/timeline_sep1961.aspx|title=Office of Environmental Management - Department of Energy|website=www.em.doe.gov|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}</ref> which was in the context of [[The Shelter (The Twilight Zone)#Context|shelters being on the minds of the public at the time]] due to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. The Kennedy administration would later go on to expand the nascent [[United States civil defense]] efforts, including the [[Duck and cover#Delayed nuclear radiation, \"fallout\"|assessment of millions of homes]] and to create a network of thousands of well known, black and yellow plaqued, community fallout shelters. This was done, not with a massive construction effort but by the relatively cheap re-purposing of existing buildings and stocking them with [[CD V-700|CD V-700 geiger counters]] etc. In 1962 the Kennedy administration would found the [[American Civil Defense Association]] to organize this, comparatively far more [[Civil defense#Atomic Age|cost-effective, shelter effort]].\n\nThe fallout-shelter-network proposal, mentioned in the film, with its inherently high [[radiation protection]] characteristics, has similarities and contrasts to that of the very real and robust [[Military of Switzerland#Military and civil defence|Swiss civil defense]] network. Switzerland has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the country's population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=June 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=February 10, 2007}}</ref> If the US did that, it would violate the spirit of MAD and according to MAD adherents, allegedly destabilize the situation because the US could launch a [[first strike]] and its population would largely survive a retaliatory second strike (see [[Mutual assured destruction#Theory|MAD \u00a7 Theory]]).\n\nTo refute early 1960s novels and Hollywood films like ''Fail-Safe'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'', which raised questions about US control over nuclear weapons, the Air Force produced a documentary film, ''SAC Command Post'', to demonstrate its responsiveness to presidential command and its tight control over nuclear weapons.<ref>''[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb304/film03.htm SAC Command Post]''</ref> However, later academic research into declassified documents showed that U.S. military commanders had been given presidentially-authorized pre-delegation for the use of nuclear weapons during the early Cold War, showing that that aspect of the film's plot was plausible.<ref name=diplomat-20180105>{{cite magazine |url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/dr-strangelove-and-the-insane-reality-of-nuclear-command-and-control/ |title=Dr. Strangelove and the Insane Reality of Nuclear Command-and-Control |last=Gady |first=Franz-Stefan |magazine=The Diplomat |date=5 January 2018 |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe characters of Buck Turgidson and Jack Ripper both deride the real-life Gen.

Benson of the Department of History of Art at [[Cornell University]] interpreting the film as being sexually-layered. The director wrote back to Benson and confirmed the interpretation, \"Seriously, you are the first one who seems to have noticed the sexual framework from intromission (the planes going in) to the last spasm (Kong's ride down and detonation at target).\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castle |first1=Alison |title=The Stanley Kubrick Archives |year=2008 |publisher=Taschen |isbn=978-3836508889 |page=359}}</ref>\n\nSexual metaphors often popped up when the nuclear analysts that Kubrick consulted were discussing strategy, such as when [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]] compared his not attacking cities/withhold plan following belligerent escalation to [[coitus interruptus]] in an internally circulated [[memorandum]] at the [[RAND Corporation]] (spoofed in the film as the \"BLAND Corporation\"), while he described the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] plan of [[massive retaliation]] as \"going all the way\". That led RAND scholar Herman Kahn, whom Kubrick consulted, to quip to an assembled group of \"massive retaliation\" SAC officers, \"Gentlemen, you do not have a [[war plan]]. You have a [[Schlesinger Doctrine#Wargasm|Wargasm!]]\".<ref>Kaplan, Fred ''The Wizards of Armageddon''.

''The Complete Book of Rugby'' (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 {{ISBN|1-86200-013-1}}) p79</ref>\n\n==History==\nNot unlike other neighbouring African countries, Zambian rugby has been a legacy of British colonialism. Traditionally rugby in Zambia was seen as an expatriate sport, however, over the last 20 years it has become a truly Zambian sport with the majority of its players coming up through the schools and local club system. \n\nFifteens (XVs) rugby in Zambia is played at a basic level compared to the major rugby playing nations.\n\nZambia has over the last seven years built its own highly respected 7s tournament in the form of the Lusaka Mosi International Sevens. Past winners include the Springbok under-23s and the British Army. Zambia has beaten a number of South African Super 14 teams who have participated.\n\nIt should be remembered that Northern Rhodesia played jointly with Southern Rhodesia as RHODESIA wearing the famous Green and White hooped jersey as their international strip. In 1924 a British side would played against the Rhodesias. On 14 July 1928, Rhodesia played in Bulawayo against New Zealand, losing 8 to 44.\n\nDuring their 1938 tour to South Africa, the British Lions played two matches against the Rhodesias. The first, taking place on 20 July saw the British win 25 to 11; three days later the British won again, 45 to 11; these matches were played in Salisbury and Bulawayo. The 1949 Rhodesian Rugby team, led by John Morkel, famously beat a touring All Blacks side led by Fred Allen in Bulawayo 10-8 on 27 July 1949. Three days later they drew with the mighty All Blacks in Salisbury 3-3. Thus the Rhodesias not only became and remain the only none test side country in the world to beat the All Blacks but also to be the only side in the world to be unbeaten in series rugby against them too. The Northern Rhodesians who played in the games were: flanker C Jones (Nchanga), scrum half W Viljoen (Copperbelt), Fly half E.U. Karg (Mufulira) and inside centre W.E. Brune (Mufulira)\n\nIn 1960, New Zealand returned to play a match on 2 July at Glamis Park, with Rhodesia losing 14 to 29, though gave the All Blacks a scare yet again, with the game being tied 6 all by half time. The 1962 tour of South Africa by the British Lions had Rhodesia as the opening fixture on the tour. The opening game of the Lions tour saw the visitors win in Bulawayo, beating Rhodesia 38 to 9 on 26 May. The next tour, in 1962, the Lions won in Salisbury, beating the side 32 to 6. \n\nThe famous Andy McDonald who played for the Springboks farmed just outside Livingstone. He once had shot at a lion which was attacking his cattle, but the lion turned on him and Andy fought against it bare fisted. The lion later pulled away and died of exhaustion! Colin Meades the All Blacks captain and known as a fearsome if not slightly unruly player said that McDonald was the strongest player he had ever played against, and for good reason.  Other players from that era were Ronnie Hill and Des van Jaarsveld who started their rugby careers in Northern Rhodesia before moving south Van Jaarsveld went on to captain the Springboks just the once against Scoltand and became the first Springbok captain who could not speak a word of Afrikaans!\n\nNorthern Rhodesia played against Southern Rhodesia in the Clarke Cup which Northern Rhodesia won more times than Southern Rhodesia. This was largely due to the number of excellent rugby players (Springboks amongst them) working on the Copperbelt at the time. The Northern Rhodesians played in a Royal Blue Jersey with two stripes (white and gold) whilst the Southerners played in Green with white trim. The Green/White hooped jersey was originally used by the joint Rhodesian side for international games.\n\n== National teams ==\nSevens rugby has become a strong point. The [[Zambia national rugby sevens team]] has beaten [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] and [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]],{{cn|date=April 2017}} and came within 30 seconds of upsetting [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], in the end narrowly losing 11-12. Zambia has appeared on the international stage, both at the [[South Africa Sevens]] and the [[Dubai Sevens]].\n\nZambia also competes in the [[Africa Cup]].<ref name=Completerugby/>\n\n==Club Competition==\nZambia has an active league that has recently been amended to consist of a Super 8 format with a second league comprising smaller clubs and second teams from the Super 8. The season runs from March to October and consists of a period of time for league matches, a break for [[rugby sevens|sevens rugby]]. \n\nMost clubs start training in the middle of January ready for the season to begin in March. League matches are played up until the start of June when a break is taken to allow concentration on [[rugby sevens|sevens]] events. During the months break there are a number of local 7s events including the Rhino Sevens in Ndola, the Mufulira Sevens (the first sevens tournament held in Zambia) and the Mosi Sevens in Lusaka. The league continues again in July and generally runs through to October when the knock out cup competition takes place.\n\nIn [[Lusaka]] there are four active rugby clubs. Lusaka Rugby Club,  Nkwazi rugby team , Green Buffaloes (the army team) and Red Arrows (the air force team) all play within Lusaka Showgrounds (see map on the Lusaka Rugby Club page) and both Lusaka Rugby Club and Red Arrows have an active club house with a number of facilities available for members and signed-in guests.\n\nOn the Great North Road between Lusaka and the [[Copperbelt]] is the town of [[Kabwe]], home of Green Eagles Rugby Club.\n\nIn the Copperbelt, rugby is most popular, near or surpassing football. Towns all have their own rugby teams with a varying degree of facilities available at each club. Diggers Rugby Club in [[Kitwe]] has over the past few years been the most successful of the Copperbelt clubs and is the most active in terms of the number of players and of social activities happening at the club. They even have another team, Diggers B, active in the B-League. Nchanga Rugby Club are in [[Chingola]], Roan Rugby Club are in [[Luanshya]], Konkola Rugby Club is in [[Chilalabombwe]] and [[Mufulira]] popularly known as 'Reggae Boys', [[Ndola]] 'Killer Bees' and [[Chibuluma]] each have their own rugby club. Other teams are Kanshanshi in [[Solwezi]], Prison Leopards in [[Kabwe]] while [[Kitwe]] Playing Fields and [[Chambeshi]] have clubs in their respective towns.\n\nThe Roan Antelope Club in [[Luanshya]] formerly held the record for highest goal posts in the world, and were recognised by the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' - they were 110&nbsp;ft, 6&nbsp;inches high.<ref name=RugbyDis107>Cotton, p107</ref>\n\n==Youth==\nRugby is becoming increasingly popular with it being very active in schools such as [[Mpelembe Secondary School]], Kitwe Boys, David Kaunda Technical School, Icengelo and  Lechwe, both of the latter are Trust Schools. Two annual tournaments sponsored First Quantum Minerals (FQM) are hosted, one for Fifteens and the other for Sevens. Mpelembe and Icengelo have been the two most successful. Mpelembe went on to get sponsorship from mobile service providing giant, MTN, which was recently withdrawn.\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n* In the 1990s, [[Ian Kirkpatrick]], late of the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] helped develop the game.<ref name=Completerugby/>\n* [[Corn\u00e9 Krige]] and [[George Gregan]], who respectively captained the {{nrut|South Africa}} and {{nrut|Australia}} teams in both the [[2002 Tri Nations Series|2002]] and [[2002 Tri Nations Series|2003]] [[Tri Nations Series]], were coincidentally born in the same hospital in [[Zambia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgegregan.com/george/ggprofile.html |title=George Gregan - Player Profile |publisher=Georgegregan.com |accessdate=2008-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109095618/http://www.georgegregan.com/george/ggprofile.html |archivedate=9 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Courageous\">[http://www.thegoal.com/players/rugby/krige_corne/captain.html \"Captain Courageous: Corn\u00e9 Krige\"], ''TheGoal.com'', retrieved 26 June 2006.</ref><ref name=\"SA World Cup 2003\">[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyworldcup2003/story/0,,1054302,00.html \"Rugby Union World Cup Special Reports: South Africa\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 October 2003.</ref> Krige's parents still live in Zambia.\n* [[Dafydd James]] of Wales and the [[2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2001]] [[British and Irish Lions]] was born in [[Mufulira]].<ref name=\"Dafydd James\">{{cite web| url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/news/7854.php| title= The British &amp; Irish Lions : Lions from foreign lands |publisher= British and Irish Lions| author= Rob Cole | date= 1 June 2009|accessdate= 13 June 2010}}</ref>\nBob Hesford, born in Luanshya played for England gaining his first cap against Scotland at Twickenham on 21 February 1981.

According to the UK newspaper the [[Daily Telegraph]], the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2009 to introduce rugby sevens to the [[Olympic Games]] \u201chas effectively halted the development of 15-a-side rugby in China.

Teams compete in one of four divisions, based on their location (e.g. the North China division or the South China division). At the end of the season, the top finisher in every division qualifies for the All China Rugby Cup. Meanwhile, the second-place team from each division lands in the four-team China Plate Final. \n\nThe 2017 All China Rugby Cup was won by the Shanghai Silver Dragons (of the Shanghai Rugby Football Club) against the Guangzhou Rams, 46-16.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/19011/shanghai-rugby-repeats-as-china-cup-champs|title=Shanghai Rugby Downs Guangzhou 46-16, Repeats as China Cup Champs|website=Thatsmag.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe social clubs are dominated by expatriates, including the Shanghai Rugby Football Club, the Beijing Devils, and the Hangzhou Harlequins.

However, between 2015 and 2019, the team was in Division 3 East of the [[Asian Rugby Championship]], alongside countries like Guam, Brunei and Laos.\n\nIn the [[2019 Asia Rugby Championship division tournaments]], China went unbeaten against India and Indonesia, with 137 points for and only 27 against, gaining promotion to Division 2 in the process.

The magazine noted that, in 2002, \"the Olympic Council of Asia decided that only the seven-a-side version of rugby, rugby sevens, rather than the traditional 15-a-side game, rugby union, would be played at future editions of the Asian Games \u2014 a decision that convinced the Chinese authorities to halt support for rugby union [XVs], according to Liu. 'This caused most of China\u2019s 15s teams to fade away,' says Liu ... 'The CRFA should be promoting the sport, but they\u2019re not,' says Liu. 'So, us diehard rugby fans are left to do it ourselves' ...

The [[evergreen]] [[leaf|leaves]] are approximately 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20133&nbsp;cm broad, produced in whorls of 4\u20137 starlike around the central stem. It climbs with tiny hooks at the leaves and stems. The flowers are small (3\u20135&nbsp;mm across), with five pale yellow petals, in dense [[raceme]]s, and appear from June to August, followed by small (4\u20136&nbsp;mm diameter) red to black [[berry (botany)|berries]]. The [[root]]s can be over a metre long, up to 12&nbsp;mm thick and the source of red [[dye]]s known as [[rose madder]] and '''[[Turkey red]]'''. It prefers [[loam]]y soils (sand and clay soil) with a constant level of moisture. Madder is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including the [[Macroglossum stellatarum|hummingbird hawk moth]].\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Naturally dyed skeins.jpg|thumb|Naturally dyed skeins made with madder root, Colonial Williamsburg, VA]]\n\nIt has been used since ancient times as a vegetable red [[dye]] for leather, wool, cotton and silk. For dye production, the roots are harvested after two years. The outer red layer gives the common variety of the dye, the inner yellow layer the refined variety. The dye is fixed to the cloth with help of a [[mordant]], most commonly [[alum]]. Madder can be fermented for dyeing as well (''Fleurs de garance''). In [[France]], the remains were used to produce a spirit{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}.\n\nThe roots contain the acid [[ruberthyrin]]. By drying, fermenting, or a treatment with acids, this is changed to sugar, [[alizarin]] and [[1,2,4-Trihydroxyanthraquinone|purpurin]], which were first isolated by the French chemist [[Pierre Jean Robiquet]] in 1826. Purpurin is normally not coloured, but is red when dissolved in alkaline solutions. Mixed with clay and treated with [[alum]] and [[ammonia]], it gives a brilliant red colourant ([[madder lake]]).\n\nThe pulverised roots can be dissolved in [[sulfuric acid]], which leaves a dye called ''[[garance]]'' (the [[French language|French]] name for madder) after drying. Another method of increasing the yield consisted of dissolving the roots in sulfuric acid after they had been used for dyeing. This produces a dye called ''[[garanceux]]''. By treating the pulverized roots with alcohol, [[colorin]] was produced. It contained 40\u201350 times the amount of [[alizarin]] of the roots.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe chemical name for the [[pigment]] is [[alizarin]], of the [[natural anthraquinone|anthraquinone]]-group, and was used to make the [[alizarine ink]] in 1855 by Professor Leonhardi of [[Dresden]], Germany. In 1869, the German chemists Graebe and Liebermann synthesised artificial alizarin, which was produced industrially from 1871 onwards, effectively ending the cultivation of madder. In the 20th century, madder was only grown in some areas of France.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe plant's roots contain several polyphenolic compounds, such as [[1,3-Dihydroxyanthraquinone]] (purpuroxanthin), [[1,4-Dihydroxyanthraquinone]] (quinizarin), [[1,2,4-Trihydroxyanthraquinone]] (purpurin) and 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone ([[alizarin]]). This last compound gives it its red colour to a textile dye known as [[Rose madder]]. It was also used as a colourant, especially for paint, that is referred to as madder lake. The substance was also derived from another species, ''[[Rubia cordifolia]]''.\n\n==History==\nEarly evidence of [[dyeing]] comes from [[India]] where a piece of cotton dyed with madder has been recovered from the archaeological site at [[Mohenjo-daro]] (3rd millennium BCE).<ref name=bhardwaj&jain>{{cite journal |author=H.

It was developed at US Rubber Co's Chicago plant by Bob Pooley and was simply called Royalite. US Rubber was later renamed Uniroyal - a blanket name to encapsulate their worldwide enterprises, which previously had separate names.

It was different in a number of ways from its successors (which are now familiar): it had an inclined engine with exposed valve gear featuring four valves per cylinder with 350&nbsp;cc and 500&nbsp;cc options. In 1933, a 250&nbsp;cc option was also added to the range.<ref name=\"Brown.\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roland|title=The History of British Bikes|publisher=Paragon|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7525-3153-3}}</ref> Its frame was also considerably different, having centre-spring girder front forks, being among a new range of models from Royal Enfield that featured them, along with a saddle-type fuel tank. However, common to motorcycles of this period, it had a rigid rear-end, necessitating a 'sprung' seat for the rider, which resulted in the iconic look of the motorcycle that is much replicated today, even though the sprung seat is unnecessary in modern models.\n\nAfter competition success the 350&nbsp;cc Royal Enfield Bullet was bought by the [[British Army]] for dispatch riders and 3,000 were also supplied to the [[RAF]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\n===1939&ndash;1949===\n{{Infobox Motorcycle\n|name=Royal Enfield Bullet\n|manufacturer=[[Royal Enfield]], UK\n|production=1939&ndash;1948\n|successor=Royal Enfield Bullet 350\n|engine=346&nbsp;cc single cylinder OHV\n}}\nThis model refreshed Royal Enfield's model line-up for 1939. It differed in cosmetic details, as well as in having two rocker boxes, which resulted in higher volumetric efficiency for the engine. The basic design with front girder forks was retained.\n\n===1949&ndash;1956===\n{{Infobox Motorcycle\n|name=Royal Enfield Bullet\n|manufacturer=[[Royal Enfield]], UK\n|production=1948&ndash;1956\n|successor=Royal Enfield Bullet 350/500\n|engine=346&nbsp;cc & 499&nbsp;cc single cylinder OHV\n}}\nA number of changes were implemented in order to bring the bike up-to-date. This model featured a vertical engine with alloy head and higher compression. The frame was changed to a fully sprung design using a swing-arm with non-adjustable hydraulic shockers at the rear, while the front used a brand-new telescopic fork of Royal Enfield's own design. This enabled the introduction of a bench seat made of simple foam and with no large springs. Power transmission was via the same four-speed Albion gearbox as the previous model, with a unique 'neutral-finder' lever the rider could press from any gear other than first to shift to neutral. The crankshaft continued to have a fully floating big-end bearing. The headlight assembly was enclosed with the speedometer and ammeter into a nacelle, which also served as the attachment of the front suspension as well as the handlebars. An otherwise similar model, but with engine displacement of 499&nbsp;cc, made its debut in 1953.\n\nThe prototype had done well in a performance trial and went on to win the trophy<ref name=\"RE-WEB\">{{cite web|url=http://speedtracktales.wordpress.com/2013/12/20/internationally-famous-royal-enfield-at-the-isdt-1948-1953/|title=The story of Royal Enfield in the ISDT}}</ref> at the 1948 [[International Six Days Enduro|International Six Days Trial]] and two Bullet riders won gold medals.<ref name=\"Kemp\">{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Andrew|author2=De Cet |others=Mirco|title=Classic British Bikes|publisher=Bookmart Ltd|year=2004|isbn=978-1-86147-136-9}}</ref> In 1952 [[Johnny Brittain]] won the [[Scottish Six Days Trial]] on a Royal Enfield Bullet and in 1953 he also won the International Six Days Trial without losing a single point.<ref name=\"Bullet\" />\n\nIn 1949, the [[Indian Army]] ordered Royal Enfield Bullets for border patrol use and the company decided to open a factory in [[Madras]]. In 1955, the 350&nbsp;cc Bullets were sent from the Redditch factory in kit form for assembly in India, but Enfield India Ltd. soon developed the factory and produced complete motorcycles independently under licence. The 1955 model remained almost unchanged for years and Madras produced over 20,000 Bullets annually.<ref name=\"Brown.\" />\n\n===1956&ndash;1969===\n{{Infobox Motorcycle\n|name=Royal Enfield Bullet\n|manufacturer= [[Royal Enfield]], UK\n|production=1956&ndash;1964\n|successor=Royal Enfield Bullet 350/500\n|engine=346&nbsp;cc & 499&nbsp;cc single cylinder OHV\n}}\nIn 1955, Royal Enfield carried out some retooling and redesign at their Redditch plant, in the UK, to modernise the Bullet, and in 1959 some changes were made to the gear ratios. These changes, however, were not incorporated by the Indian arm due to its commitment to supply the Indian Army. Thus the British and Indian lines diverged, never to meet again.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1960, the British Bullet was released in several models, including a 350&nbsp;cc Trials \"works replica\" version, a 350&nbsp;cc \"Clipper\" model and in 1958 the ''Airflow'' version.

Numerous technical improvements were also made, including moving to alternator charging (1956) and coil ignition (1960). The 350&nbsp;cc model continued in production, but the 500&nbsp;cc model was discontinued in 1961. In 1962, the UK company was sold and the Bullet discontinued and in 1967, the [[Redditch]] factory closed.

Look for a ten finned barrel on a Crusader and you will have found a New Bullet. By necessity the tool box air intake slot is also a little higher.{{cn|date=September 2015}} Other variations from the unit 250 include a 46 tooth rear sprocket, an outrigger bearing on the primary side crankcase a four plate clutch and wider gear cogs. The petrol tank is similar to the earlier unit range item (not the Clipper tank) but has a larger cut out on the underside to clear the taller motor making it 1/4 gallon light on capacity.

It was different in a number of ways from its successors (which are now familiar): it had an inclined engine with exposed valve gear featuring four valves per cylinder with 350&nbsp;cc and 500&nbsp;cc options. In 1933, a 250&nbsp;cc option was also added to the range.<ref name=\"Brown.\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roland|title=The History of British Bikes|publisher=Paragon|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7525-3153-3}}</ref> Its frame was also considerably different, having centre-spring girder front forks, being among a new range of models from Royal Enfield that featured them, along with a saddle-type fuel tank. However, common to motorcycles of this period, it had a rigid rear-end, necessitating a 'sprung' seat for the rider, which resulted in the iconic look of the motorcycle that is much replicated today, even though the sprung seat is unnecessary in modern models.\n\nAfter competition success the 350&nbsp;cc Royal Enfield Bullet was bought by the [[British Army]] for dispatch riders and 3,000 were also supplied to the [[RAF]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\n===1939&ndash;1949===\n{{Infobox Motorcycle\n|name=Royal Enfield Bullet\n|manufacturer=[[Royal Enfield]], UK\n|production=1939&ndash;1948\n|successor=Royal Enfield Bullet 350\n|engine=346&nbsp;cc single cylinder OHV\n}}\nThis model refreshed Royal Enfield's model line-up for 1939. It differed in cosmetic details, as well as in having two rocker boxes, which resulted in higher volumetric efficiency for the engine. The basic design with front girder forks was retained.\n\n===1949&ndash;1956===\n{{Infobox Motorcycle\n|name=Royal Enfield Bullet\n|manufacturer=[[Royal Enfield]], UK\n|production=1948&ndash;1956\n|successor=Royal Enfield Bullet 350/500\n|engine=346&nbsp;cc & 499&nbsp;cc single cylinder OHV\n}}\nA number of changes were implemented in order to bring the bike up-to-date. This model featured a vertical engine with alloy head and higher compression. The frame was changed to a fully sprung design using a swing-arm with non-adjustable hydraulic shockers at the rear, while the front used a brand-new telescopic fork of Royal Enfield's own design. This enabled the introduction of a bench seat made of simple foam and with no large springs. Power transmission was via the same four-speed Albion gearbox as the previous model, with a unique 'neutral-finder' lever the rider could press from any gear other than first to shift to neutral. The crankshaft continued to have a fully floating big-end bearing. The headlight assembly was enclosed with the speedometer and ammeter into a nacelle, which also served as the attachment of the front suspension as well as the handlebars. An otherwise similar model, but with engine displacement of 499&nbsp;cc, made its debut in 1953.\n\nThe prototype had done well in a performance trial and went on to win the trophy<ref name=\"RE-WEB\">{{cite web|url=http://speedtracktales.wordpress.com/2013/12/20/internationally-famous-royal-enfield-at-the-isdt-1948-1953/|title=The story of Royal Enfield in the ISDT}}</ref> at the 1948 [[International Six Days Enduro|International Six Days Trial]] and two Bullet riders won gold medals.<ref name=\"Kemp\">{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Andrew|author2=De Cet |others=Mirco|title=Classic British Bikes|publisher=Bookmart Ltd|year=2004|isbn=978-1-86147-136-9}}</ref> In 1952 [[Johnny Brittain]] won the [[Scottish Six Days Trial]] on a Royal Enfield Bullet and in 1953 he also won the International Six Days Trial without losing a single point.<ref name=\"Bullet\" />\n\nIn 1949, the [[Indian Army]] ordered Royal Enfield Bullets for border patrol use and the company decided to open a factory in [[Madras]]. In 1955, the 350&nbsp;cc Bullets were sent from the Redditch factory in kit form for assembly in India, but Enfield India Ltd. soon developed the factory and produced complete motorcycles independently under licence. The 1955 model remained almost unchanged for years and Madras produced over 20,000 Bullets annually.<ref name=\"Brown.\" />\n\n===1956&ndash;1969===\n{{Infobox Motorcycle\n|name=Royal Enfield Bullet\n|manufacturer= [[Royal Enfield]], UK\n|production=1956&ndash;1964\n|successor=Royal Enfield Bullet 350/500\n|engine=346&nbsp;cc & 499&nbsp;cc single cylinder OHV\n}}\nIn 1955, Royal Enfield carried out some retooling and redesign at their Redditch plant, in the UK, to modernise the Bullet, and in 1959 some changes were made to the gear ratios. These changes, however, were not incorporated by the Indian arm due to its commitment to supply the Indian Army. Thus the British and Indian lines diverged, never to meet again.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1960, the British Bullet was released in several models, including a 350&nbsp;cc Trials \"works replica\" version, a 350&nbsp;cc \"Clipper\" model and in 1958 the ''Airflow'' version. This model had full weather protection from a large fibreglass fairing and included panniers for touring.

Numerous technical improvements were also made, including moving to alternator charging (1956) and coil ignition (1960). The 350&nbsp;cc model continued in production, but the 500&nbsp;cc model was discontinued in 1961. In 1962, the UK company was sold and the Bullet discontinued and in 1967, the [[Redditch]] factory closed.
