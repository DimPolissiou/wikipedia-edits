Zulte Waregem|Zulte Waregem]] and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] the [[Burundi national football team|Burundi national team]].\n\nHaving fled his native Burundi as a child, he received [[political asylum]] in [[Birmingham]], and credits football with helping him integrate into English society. Berahino joined [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at the age of 11 and turned professional seven years later. He spent time out on loan at [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs [[Northampton Town]], [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].\n\nBerahino made his first starts for West Bromwich Albion in the [[2013\u201314 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season|2013\u201314 season]], with highlights of that campaign including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], and the winning goal at [[Old Trafford]] against [[Manchester United]]. In his [[2014\u201315 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season|second full season]], he recorded 20 goals in 45 matches across all competitions. Following that campaign, Berahino became involved in a lengthy [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] saga involving [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], straining his relationships with manager [[Tony Pulis]] and chairman [[Jeremy Peace]]. He was criticised for his conduct and fell out of favour, scoring only 7 goals in the [[2015\u201316 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season|2015\u201316 season]]; he did not score a competitive goal from 27 February 2016 to 28 August 2018, a goal drought of 913 days. In January 2017, he joined Stoke City for a fee of \u00a312&nbsp;million, potentially rising to \u00a315&nbsp;million. Stoke were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2017\u201318 season and after a single season in the [[EFL Championship]], Berahino was released by Stoke with three years left on his contract.\n\nBerahino represented England at all youth levels from [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]] to [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]], and was part of their [[England national under-17 football team|under-17 team]] which won the [[2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship|2010 European Championship]]. He was called up for the first time to the [[England national football team|senior team]] in November 2014 but did not play. He switched his international allegiance to [[Burundi national football team|Burundi]] in August 2018 and scored on his international debut in September, later captaining the side at the [[2019 Africa Cup of Nations]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in 1993 in [[Bujumbura]], the then-capital of Burundi,<ref name=sway/> Berahino played football as a child with a ball of plastic bags tied up with laces.<ref name=hytner/> His father was killed in 1997 during the [[Burundian Civil War]].<ref name=winter>{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Henry|title=Saido Berahino's sad story is heading for a happy ending with West Brom and England|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-bromwich-albion/10357219/Saido-Berahinos-sad-story-is-heading-for-a-happy-ending-with-West-Brom-and-England.html|accessdate=22 March 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 October 2013}}</ref> He travelled to England alone at the age of 10,<ref name=rescue>{{cite news|title=Northampton Town: Football to the rescue for Burundi boy Saido|url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/sport/northampton-town-football-to-the-rescue-for-burundi-boy-saido-1-3224509|work=[[Northampton Chronicle & Echo]]|date=8 November 2011|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/47595/The_next_big_thing_at_West_Bromwich_Albion_Saido_Berahino.aspx|title=The next big thing at West Bromwich Albion: Saido Berahino |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> fleeing the ongoing war to join his mother, brother and sisters who had already been granted asylum in [[Newtown, Birmingham]].

Zulte Waregem|Zulte Waregem]] and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] the [[Burundi national football team|Burundi national team]].\n\nHaving fled his native Burundi as a child, he received [[political asylum]] in [[Birmingham]], and credits football with helping him integrate into English society. Berahino joined [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at the age of 11 and turned professional seven years later. He spent time out on loan at [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs [[Northampton Town]], [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].\n\nBerahino made his first starts for West Bromwich Albion in the [[2013\u201314 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season|2013\u201314 season]], with highlights of that campaign including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], and the winning goal at [[Old Trafford]] against [[Manchester United]]. In his [[2014\u201315 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season|second full season]], he recorded 20 goals in 45 matches across all competitions. Following that campaign, Berahino became involved in a lengthy [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] saga involving [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], straining his relationships with manager [[Tony Pulis]] and chairman [[Jeremy Peace]]. He was criticised for his conduct and fell out of favour, scoring only 7 goals in the [[2015\u201316 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season|2015\u201316 season]]; he did not score a competitive goal from 27 February 2016 to 28 August 2018, a goal drought of 913 days. In January 2017, he joined Stoke City for a fee of \u00a312&nbsp;million, potentially rising to \u00a315&nbsp;million. Stoke were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2017\u201318 season and after a single season in the [[EFL Championship]], Berahino was released by Stoke with three years left on his contract.\n\nBerahino represented England at all youth levels from [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]] to [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]], and was part of their [[England national under-17 football team|under-17 team]] which won the [[2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship|2010 European Championship]]. He was called up for the first time to the [[England national football team|senior team]] in November 2014 but did not play. He switched his international allegiance to [[Burundi national football team|Burundi]] in August 2018 and scored on his international debut in September, later captaining the side at the [[2019 Africa Cup of Nations]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in 1993 in [[Bujumbura]], the then-capital of Burundi,<ref name=sway/> Berahino played football as a child with a ball of plastic bags tied up with laces.<ref name=hytner/> His father was killed in 1997 during the [[Burundian Civil War]].<ref name=winter>{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Henry|title=Saido Berahino's sad story is heading for a happy ending with West Brom and England|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-bromwich-albion/10357219/Saido-Berahinos-sad-story-is-heading-for-a-happy-ending-with-West-Brom-and-England.html|accessdate=22 March 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 October 2013}}</ref> He travelled to England alone at the age of 10,<ref name=rescue>{{cite news|title=Northampton Town: Football to the rescue for Burundi boy Saido|url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/sport/northampton-town-football-to-the-rescue-for-burundi-boy-saido-1-3224509|work=[[Northampton Chronicle & Echo]]|date=8 November 2011|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/47595/The_next_big_thing_at_West_Bromwich_Albion_Saido_Berahino.aspx|title=The next big thing at West Bromwich Albion: Saido Berahino |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> fleeing the ongoing war to join his mother, brother and sisters who had already been granted asylum in [[Newtown, Birmingham]].

The team was officially known as the '''Quebec Hockey Club''',<ref>Farrell, pg. 77</ref> and later as the '''Quebec Athletic Club.''' One of the first organized ice hockey clubs, the club debuted in 1878 with the opening of the [[Quebec Skating Rink]]. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908. The club would play in the [[National Hockey Association]] (the forerunner to the NHL) and the [[National Hockey League]]. In 1920, the team moved to [[Hamilton, Ontario]] and became the [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]].\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Amateur roots, 1878\u20131909===\n[[File:Quebec Hockey Club 1891-92.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quebec Hockey Club in 1891\u201392. Players are Bertram Patton, Herbert Bignell, Arthur Dickson Scott, Charles Smith, Arthur Edward Scott, Herbert Scott, Robert Davidson and [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]].]]The Quebec Hockey Club was founded in 1878, after the construction of the Quebec Skating Rink in 1877.<ref name=\"battfields-1878\"/> The club consisted of Anglo-Canadian players. Play was by exhibition only, against teams drawn from the club members or visiting teams from Montreal. In 1883, the club played in the [[Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments|Montreal Winter Carnival]], and joined the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] (AHAC) in 1888 and were members until 1898. After the AHAC, Quebec played in the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] from 1899 to 1905, and the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] from 1906 to 1909. One player that went through the ranks of the Quebec Hockey Club was [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]] (1869\u20131922), a journalist and newspaper owner who fought as a Major-General in [[World War I]]. Watson played for the Quebec HC as a cover point (an offensive defenceman) in the AHAC through the course of the 1890s.\n\nThe club came close to winning the Stanley Cup on two occasions. In the [[1894 AHAC season|1894 season]] Quebec tied for the AHAC regular season lead with three other clubs. The AHAC drew up plans to hold the playoff solely in Montreal. Quebec declined to play in Montreal without one game in Quebec and the championship was eventually won by the [[Montreal Hockey Club]]. In 1904, Quebec won the CAHL outright. In a dispute, the club did not win the [[Stanley Cup]] or challenge for it. The [[Ottawa Hockey Club]] was the defending champions in [[1904 CAHL season|1903\u201304]], but withdrew from the league. Quebec went on to win the CAHL and expected to receive the Stanley Cup as league champions. The trustees of the Cup instead ruled that the Cup went to Ottawa.\n\nTwo significant players on the Quebec Hockey Club during the later part of the first decade of the 1900s were [[Charles Gavan Power|Chubby]] and [[Joe Power (ice hockey)|Joe Power]], who both later would be serve as politicians in Quebec. A third Power brother, [[James Power (ice hockey)|Rockett Power]], also represented the club.\n\n===National Hockey Association===\n\nIn late 1909, Quebec became a founding member of the [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909\u20131910)|Canadian Hockey Association]] (CHA) in 1909. The CHA, however, would only last one month before being absorbed into the much more powerful [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA). Rejected by the new league, the Bulldogs sat out the inaugural [[1910 NHA season|1910]] season. The following season, [[1910\u201311 NHA season|1910\u201311]], the Bulldogs took over the defunct [[Cobalt Silver Kings]] franchise, but had a rough initiation, finishing dead last with four wins and 12 losses in a 16-game season. On a positive note, and a sign of things to come, [[Jack Patrick McDonald|Jack McDonald]] scored 14 goals and [[Tommy Dunderdale]] scored 13.\n\nFor [[1911\u201312 NHA season|1911\u201312]], the Bulldogs went from worst to first, with [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] having a spectacular season, to win the [[O'Brien Trophy (ice hockey)|O'Brien Cup]] as champions of the NHA and the [[Stanley Cup]]. The Dogs' record improved to 10 wins and eight losses while Malone scored 21 goals and Jack McDonald scored 18. In a Stanley Cup challenge, they crushed the [[Moncton Victorias]] in two games, 9\u20133 and 8\u20130, in the best-of-three [[playoff]].\n\n[[Image:Quebec Bulldogs, 1911 logo.png|right|thumb|150px|Logo used (1911\u20131913).]]\nIn their third season ([[1912\u201313 NHA season|1912\u201313]]), Quebec would again finish first overall with a record of 16-4 losses to retain the championship. Joe Malone won the scoring race with an unprecedented 43 goals. His teammate, [[Tommy Smith (ice hockey)|Tommy Smith]], was a close second with 39. In a Stanley Cup challenge after the season the team easily beat the [[Sydney Millionaires (MaPHL)|Sydney Millionaires]] in two games by a combined score of 20-5.\n\nThe [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] next challenged the Bulldogs. The powerhouse Bulldogs expected to bowl over the Aristocrats, but were shocked after splitting the first two games and then losing 6\u20131 in the decisive third game. However, the Stanley Cup Board of trustees did not recognise the challenge because it should have been played in Quebec. PCHA leader Lester Patrick refused. The Bulldogs were able to keep the Cup.\n\nIn December 1913, the Bulldogs moved to the new [[Quebec Arena]].<ref name=\"times-arena\"/> The following seasons would see the Bulldogs drop from the top of the league. They would finish third overall in each of the next three seasons and in the last NHA season ([[1916\u201317 NHL season|1916\u201317]]) went second overall. After their two Stanley Cup wins, though, they would never again challenge for the Cup.\n\n===National Hockey League and the move to Hamilton 1917\u20131925===\nThe Bulldogs, along with the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Montreal Wanderers]] and [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], were frustrated with [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]]'s acrimonious dealings.  However, they discovered that the league constitution did not allow them to simply vote Livingstone out.  Instead, the four clubs joined in founding the [[National Hockey League]] in 1917, and did not invite Livingstone to join them. Quebec's long-time manager [[Mike Quinn (ice hockey)|Mike Quinn]] had retired due to ill health.  The other directors of the Bulldogs were unable to get enough financing to make the move to the NHL\u2014no small consideration given that Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the league.  They opted to suspend operations for the league's [[1917\u201318 NHL season|inaugural season]].{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=76}} To balance out the schedule, the remaining three clubs granted a temporary franchise to the Toronto Arena Company; the direct ancestors of today's [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].\n\nIn 1918, the franchise was sold in principle to [[Percy Quinn]]. However, Quinn's actual intent was to use the Bulldogs to help resurrect the NHA.  However, the other owners called Quinn's bluff by demanding a firm commitment to ice a team in the NHL for the [[1918\u201319 NHL season|1918\u201319 season]].  When Quinn refused to do so, the NHL canceled the franchise.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=78}} When no other Quebec-based group came forward, the Bulldogs sat out the 1918\u201319 season as well.\n\nIn May 1919, NHL president Calder and Mike Quinn made efforts to return Quebec to the league. Calder suggested that Quinn apply to the league for a new franchise. On December 2, 1919, the NHL approved the application of the Quebec Athletic Club for an NHL franchise.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=78}} Newspapers at the time now referred to the team as the ''Quebec Athletics''<ref>{{cite book |title=The Official National Hockey League 75th anniversary commemorative book |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |location=Toronto |last=Diamond |first=Dan |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/officialnational0000unse/page/26 26] |isbn=0-7710-6727-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/officialnational0000unse/page/26 }}</ref> rather than ''Bulldogs''.\n\nWhile the team had been suspended, their star player, [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]], played for the Canadiens. Malone rejoined the franchise, and won the scoring championship that year with 39 goals. Despite Malone's scoring and the presence of players like [[Harry Mummery]], Quebec had a dismal season, finishing last, with 4 wins and 20 losses.\n\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season, the NHL took back the franchise, and sold it to new owners who moved the team to Hamilton, where it became the Tigers. This helped to head off a potential competing league organized by Livingstone from setting up in Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deceptions and Doublecross: How the NHL conquered hockey |last=Holzman | first=Morey | year=2001 | publisher=Dundurn Press}}</ref>\n\nThe Tigers played in the NHL from [[1920\u201321 NHL season|1920]] to [[1924\u201325 NHL season|1925]]. Due in large part to a team players' strike in the 1925 NHL playoffs, the franchise was revoked a second time that summer, this time for good.  The entire Tigers roster was then sold to [[Bill Dwyer (gangster)|Bill Dwyer]], owner of the expansion [[New York Americans]] franchise. However, the NHL does not reckon the Americans as a continuation of the Bulldogs/Tigers franchise.  The Americans would play in the NHL from [[1925\u201326 NHL season|1925]] to [[1941\u201342 NHL season|1942]].\n\nThe last active Bulldogs player in major-league hockey was [[Dave Ritchie (ice hockey)|Dave Ritchie]], who retired in 1926. The last active Bulldog player was [[Eddie Oatman]], who played pro hockey until 1939 and played against the CAHL Quebec Beavers in 1929.\n\nOver time, various hockey teams played in Quebec, including the minor-pro [[Quebec Castors]] and [[Quebec Aces]]. Big-league hockey would not return to Quebec City until the [[Quebec Nordiques]] were founded in 1972 as part of the new [[World Hockey Association]]. They joined the NHL in 1979. However, as with the Bulldogs, they found the going difficult playing in the league's smallest market.  They moved to [[Denver]] in 1995 as the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. A [[potential National Hockey League expansion]] bid for Quebec City has been tabled by the league's board of governors since 2015.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n* 1888\u20131898 \u2013 [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]]\n* 1899\u20131905 \u2013 [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]]\n* 1906\u20131909 \u2013 [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]]\n* Jan. 1910 \u2013 [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909\u20131910)|Canadian Hockey Association]]\n* 1910\u20131917 \u2013 [[National Hockey Association]]\n* 1919\u20131920 \u2013 [[National Hockey League]]\n\n'''''Note:''' GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against''\n{| cellpadding=5\n|- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n!

The team was officially known as the '''Quebec Hockey Club''',<ref>Farrell, pg. 77</ref> and later as the '''Quebec Athletic Club.''' One of the first organized ice hockey clubs, the club debuted in 1878 with the opening of the [[Quebec Skating Rink]]. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908. The club would play in the [[National Hockey Association]] (the forerunner to the NHL) and the [[National Hockey League]]. In 1920, the team moved to [[Hamilton, Ontario]] and became the [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]].\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Amateur roots, 1878\u20131909===\n[[File:Quebec Hockey Club 1891-92.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quebec Hockey Club in 1891\u201392. Players are Bertram Patton, Herbert Bignell, Arthur Dickson Scott, Charles Smith, Arthur Edward Scott, Herbert Scott, Robert Davidson and [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]].]]The Quebec Hockey Club was founded in 1878, after the construction of the Quebec Skating Rink in 1877.<ref name=\"battfields-1878\"/> The club consisted of Anglo-Canadian players. Play was by exhibition only, against teams drawn from the club members or visiting teams from Montreal. In 1883, the club played in the [[Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments|Montreal Winter Carnival]], and joined the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] (AHAC) in 1888 and were members until 1898. After the AHAC, Quebec played in the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] from 1899 to 1905, and the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] from 1906 to 1909. One player that went through the ranks of the Quebec Hockey Club was [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]] (1869\u20131922), a journalist and newspaper owner who fought as a Major-General in [[World War I]]. Watson played for the Quebec HC as a cover point (an offensive defenceman) in the AHAC through the course of the 1890s.\n\nThe club came close to winning the Stanley Cup on two occasions. In the [[1894 AHAC season|1894 season]] Quebec tied for the AHAC regular season lead with three other clubs. The AHAC drew up plans to hold the playoff solely in Montreal. Quebec declined to play in Montreal without one game in Quebec and the championship was eventually won by the [[Montreal Hockey Club]]. In 1904, Quebec won the CAHL outright. In a dispute, the club did not win the [[Stanley Cup]] or challenge for it. The [[Ottawa Hockey Club]] was the defending champions in [[1904 CAHL season|1903\u201304]], but withdrew from the league. Quebec went on to win the CAHL and expected to receive the Stanley Cup as league champions. The trustees of the Cup instead ruled that the Cup went to Ottawa.\n\nTwo significant players on the Quebec Hockey Club during the later part of the first decade of the 1900s were [[Charles Gavan Power|Chubby]] and [[Joe Power (ice hockey)|Joe Power]], who both later would be serve as politicians in Quebec. A third Power brother, [[James Power (ice hockey)|Rockett Power]], also represented the club.\n\n===National Hockey Association===\n\nIn late 1909, Quebec became a founding member of the [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909\u20131910)|Canadian Hockey Association]] (CHA) in 1909. The CHA, however, would only last one month before being absorbed into the much more powerful [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA). Rejected by the new league, the Bulldogs sat out the inaugural [[1910 NHA season|1910]] season. The following season, [[1910\u201311 NHA season|1910\u201311]], the Bulldogs took over the defunct [[Cobalt Silver Kings]] franchise, but had a rough initiation, finishing dead last with four wins and 12 losses in a 16-game season. On a positive note, and a sign of things to come, [[Jack Patrick McDonald|Jack McDonald]] scored 14 goals and [[Tommy Dunderdale]] scored 13.\n\nFor [[1911\u201312 NHA season|1911\u201312]], the Bulldogs went from worst to first, with [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] having a spectacular season, to win the [[O'Brien Trophy (ice hockey)|O'Brien Cup]] as champions of the NHA and the [[Stanley Cup]]. The Dogs' record improved to 10 wins and eight losses while Malone scored 21 goals and Jack McDonald scored 18. In a Stanley Cup challenge, they crushed the [[Moncton Victorias]] in two games, 9\u20133 and 8\u20130, in the best-of-three [[playoff]].\n\n[[Image:Quebec Bulldogs, 1911 logo.png|right|thumb|150px|Logo used (1911\u20131913).]]\nIn their third season ([[1912\u201313 NHA season|1912\u201313]]), Quebec would again finish first overall with a record of 16-4 losses to retain the championship. Joe Malone won the scoring race with an unprecedented 43 goals. His teammate, [[Tommy Smith (ice hockey)|Tommy Smith]], was a close second with 39. In a Stanley Cup challenge after the season the team easily beat the [[Sydney Millionaires (MaPHL)|Sydney Millionaires]] in two games by a combined score of 20-5.\n\nThe [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] next challenged the Bulldogs. The powerhouse Bulldogs expected to bowl over the Aristocrats, but were shocked after splitting the first two games and then losing 6\u20131 in the decisive third game. However, the Stanley Cup Board of trustees did not recognise the challenge because it should have been played in Quebec. PCHA leader Lester Patrick refused. The Bulldogs were able to keep the Cup.\n\nIn December 1913, the Bulldogs moved to the new [[Quebec Arena]].<ref name=\"times-arena\"/> The following seasons would see the Bulldogs drop from the top of the league. They would finish third overall in each of the next three seasons and in the last NHA season ([[1916\u201317 NHL season|1916\u201317]]) went second overall. After their two Stanley Cup wins, though, they would never again challenge for the Cup.\n\n===National Hockey League and the move to Hamilton 1917\u20131925===\nThe Bulldogs, along with the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Montreal Wanderers]] and [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], were frustrated with [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]]'s acrimonious dealings.  However, they discovered that the league constitution did not allow them to simply vote Livingstone out.  Instead, the four clubs joined in founding the [[National Hockey League]] in 1917, and did not invite Livingstone to join them. Quebec's long-time manager [[Mike Quinn (ice hockey)|Mike Quinn]] had retired due to ill health.  The other directors of the Bulldogs were unable to get enough financing to make the move to the NHL\u2014no small consideration given that Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the league.  They opted to suspend operations for the league's [[1917\u201318 NHL season|inaugural season]].{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=76}} To balance out the schedule, the remaining three clubs granted a temporary franchise to the Toronto Arena Company; the direct ancestors of today's [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].\n\nIn 1918, the franchise was sold in principle to [[Percy Quinn]]. However, Quinn's actual intent was to use the Bulldogs to help resurrect the NHA.  However, the other owners called Quinn's bluff by demanding a firm commitment to ice a team in the NHL for the [[1918\u201319 NHL season|1918\u201319 season]].  When Quinn refused to do so, the NHL canceled the franchise.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=78}} When no other Quebec-based group came forward, the Bulldogs sat out the 1918\u201319 season as well.\n\nIn May 1919, NHL president Calder and Mike Quinn made efforts to return Quebec to the league. Calder suggested that Quinn apply to the league for a new franchise. On December 2, 1919, the NHL approved the application of the Quebec Athletic Club for an NHL franchise.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=78}} Newspapers at the time now referred to the team as the ''Quebec Athletics''<ref>{{cite book |title=The Official National Hockey League 75th anniversary commemorative book |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |location=Toronto |last=Diamond |first=Dan |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/officialnational0000unse/page/26 26] |isbn=0-7710-6727-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/officialnational0000unse/page/26 }}</ref> rather than ''Bulldogs''.\n\nWhile the team had been suspended, their star player, [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]], played for the Canadiens. Malone rejoined the franchise, and won the scoring championship that year with 39 goals. Despite Malone's scoring and the presence of players like [[Harry Mummery]], Quebec had a dismal season, finishing last, with 4 wins and 20 losses.\n\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season, the NHL took back the franchise, and sold it to new owners who moved the team to Hamilton, where it became the Tigers. This helped to head off a potential competing league organized by Livingstone from setting up in Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deceptions and Doublecross: How the NHL conquered hockey |last=Holzman | first=Morey | year=2001 | publisher=Dundurn Press}}</ref>\n\nThe Tigers played in the NHL from [[1920\u201321 NHL season|1920]] to [[1924\u201325 NHL season|1925]]. Due in large part to a team players' strike in the 1925 NHL playoffs, the franchise was revoked a second time that summer, this time for good.  The entire Tigers roster was then sold to [[Bill Dwyer (gangster)|Bill Dwyer]], owner of the expansion [[New York Americans]] franchise. However, the NHL does not reckon the Americans as a continuation of the Bulldogs/Tigers franchise.  The Americans would play in the NHL from [[1925\u201326 NHL season|1925]] to [[1941\u201342 NHL season|1942]].\n\nThe last active Bulldogs player in major-league hockey was [[Dave Ritchie (ice hockey)|Dave Ritchie]], who retired in 1926. The last active Bulldog player was [[Eddie Oatman]], who played pro hockey until 1939 and played against the CAHL Quebec Beavers in 1929.\n\nOver time, various hockey teams played in Quebec, including the minor-pro [[Quebec Castors]] and [[Quebec Aces]]. Big-league hockey would not return to Quebec City until the [[Quebec Nordiques]] were founded in 1972 as part of the new [[World Hockey Association]]. They joined the NHL in 1979. However, as with the Bulldogs, they found the going difficult playing in the league's smallest market.  They moved to [[Denver]] in 1995 as the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. A [[potential National Hockey League expansion]] bid for Quebec City has been tabled by the league's board of governors since 2015.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n* 1888\u20131898 \u2013 [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]]\n* 1899\u20131905 \u2013 [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]]\n* 1906\u20131909 \u2013 [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]]\n* Jan. 1910 \u2013 [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909\u20131910)|Canadian Hockey Association]]\n* 1910\u20131917 \u2013 [[National Hockey Association]]\n* 1919\u20131920 \u2013 [[National Hockey League]]\n\n'''''Note:''' GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against''\n{| cellpadding=5\n|- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n!

This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.\n\nAs many as three million people may have been taken as [[slavery|slaves]] from this general region during the three centuries that the [[transatlantic slave trade]] operated. It is not known how many people were taken as slaves by intertribal wars or Muslim traders before the transatlantic slave trade began. Most of those taken were sold by other Africans to Europeans: some were prisoners of intertribal wars; some were victims sold because of unpaid debts; and many others were simply victims of kidnapping.<ref>Park, Mungo ''Travels in the Interior of Africa'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5305 v.

From 1965 to 1994, the country was ostensibly a multi-party [[liberal democracy]]. It was ruled by [[Dawda Jawara]] and his [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP). However, the country never experienced political turnover during this period and its commitment to succession by the ballot box was never tested.<ref>Edie, p. 162</ref> In 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] propelled a commission of military officers to power, known as the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC). After two years of direct rule, a new constitution was written and in 1996, the leader of the AFPRC, [[Yahya Jammeh]], was elected as President. He ruled in an authoritarian style until the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], which was won by [[Adama Barrow]], backed by a coalition of opposition parties.\n\n=== Political history ===\nDuring the Jawara era, there were initially four political parties, the PPP, the [[United Party (Gambia)|United Party]] (UP), the [[Democratic Party (Gambia)|Democratic Party]] (DP), and the [[Muslim Congress Party]] (MCP). The 1960 constitution had established a [[House of Representatives of the Gambia|House of Representatives]], and in the [[Gambian legislative election, 1960|1960 election]] no party won a majority of seats. However, in 1961 the British Governor chose UP leader [[Pierre Sarr N'Jie]] to serve as the country's first head of government, in the form of a Chief Minister. This was an unpopular decision, and the [[Gambian legislative election, 1962|1962 election]] was notable as parties were able to appeal to ethnic and religious differences across The Gambia. The PPP won a majority, and formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Congress Alliance]] (DCA; a merger of the DP and MCP). They invited the UP to the coalition in 1963, but it left in 1965.<ref name=\":0\">Edie, pp. 162\u2013164</ref>\n\nThe UP was seen as the main opposition party, but it lost power from 1965 to 1970. In 1975, the [[National Convention Party (Gambia)|National Convention Party]] (NCP) was formed by [[Sheriff Mustapha Dibba]], and became the new main opposition party to the PPP's dominance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the PPP and NCP were ideologically similar, so in the 1980s a new opposition party emerged, in the form of the radical socialist [[People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism]] (PDOIS). However, between the 1966 and 1992 elections, the PPP was \"overwhelmingly dominant\", winning between 55% and 70% of the vote in each election and a large majority of seats continually.<ref>Edie, p. 165</ref>\n\nIn principle, competitive politics existed during the Jawara era, however, it was stated that there was in reality a \"one-party monopoly of state power centred around the dominant personality of Dawda Jawara.\" Civil society was limited post-independence, and opposition parties were weak and at the risk of being declared subversive. The opposition did not have equal access to resources, as the business class refused to finance them. The government had control over when they could make public announcements and press briefings, and there were also allegations of [[Electoral fraud|vote-buying]] and improprieties in the preparation of the [[Electoral roll|electoral register]]. A 1991 court challenge by the PDOIS against irregularities on the electoral register in Banjul was dismissed on a technicality.<ref>Edie, pp. 168\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn July 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought an end to the Jawara era. The [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC), led by [[Yahya Jammeh]], ruled dictatorially for two years. The council suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the populace.<ref>Edie, p. 182</ref> A transition back to democracy occurred in 1996, and a new constitution was written, though the process was manipulated to benefit Jammeh.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\">Edie, p. 185</ref> In a 1996 referendum, 70% of voters approved the constitution, and in December 1996 Jammeh was elected as President. All but PDOIS of the pre-coup parties were banned, and former ministers were barred from public office.<ref>Edie, p. 186</ref>\n\nDuring Jammeh's rule, the opposition was again fragmented. An example was the infighting between members of the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD) that was formed in 2005. Jammeh used the police forces to harass opposition members and parties. Jammeh was also accused of human rights abuses, especially towards human rights activists, civil society organisations, political opponents, and the media. Their fates included being sent into exile, harassment, arbitrary imprisonment, murder, and forced disappearance. Particular examples include the murder of journalist [[Deyda Hydara]] in 2004, a [[April 2000 Gambian student massacre|student massacre at a protest]] in 2000, public threats to kill human rights defenders in 2009, and public threats towards homosexuals in 2013.

They describe a \"fragile peace\" with tensions in rural areas between farmers and the larger communities. They also reported on tensions between ethnic groups developing. An example is that in February 2017, 51 supporters of Jammeh were arrested for harassing supporters of Barrow. Although his election was initially met with enthusiasm, the Centre notes that this has been dampened by Barrow's initial constitutional faux pas with his Vice President, the challenge of inclusion, and high expectations post-Jammeh.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe Gambia has had a number of constitutions in its history. The two most significant are the 1970 constitution, which established The Gambia as a presidential republic, and the 1996 constitution, which served as a basis for Jammeh's rule and was kept following Barrow's victory in 2016. Jammeh manipulated the 1996 constitutional reform process to benefit himself. No reference was made to term limits, indicating Jammeh's preference to stay in power for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\"/> According to the 1996 constitution, the President is the head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

The office of Prime Minister was abolished in 1970. Total executive power is vested in the president. They can also appoint five members of the National Assembly, the judges of the superior courts, regional governors, and district chiefs. In terms of the civil service, they can appoint the Public Service Commission, the ombudsman, and the Independent Electoral Commission. The president is directly elected for five-year terms based on a simple majority of votes.

It maintained close relations with the United Kingdom, Senegal, and other African countries. The July 1994 coup strained The Gambia's relationship with Western powers, particularly the United States, which until 2002 suspended most non-humanitarian assistance in accordance with Section 508 of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]].

It originally consisted of the Gambia National Army (GNA), trained by the British, and Gambia National Gendarmerie (GNG), trained by the Senegalese. The GNG was merged into the police in 1992, and in 1997 Jammeh created a Gambia Navy (GN). Attempts to create a [[Gambian Air Force|Gambia Air Force]] in the mid 2000s ultimately fell through. In 2008, Jammeh created a National Republican Guard, composed of special forces units. The GNA has a strength of roughly 900, in two infantry battalions and an engineering company. It makes use of [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] and [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured cars. The GN is equipped with patrol vessels, and [[Taiwan]] donated a number of new vessels to the force in 2013.\n\nSince the GAF was formed in 1985, it has been active in UN and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions. It has been classed as a Tier 2 peacekeeping contributor<ref name=\"BellamyWilliams\">Bellamy, Alex J. and Williams, Paul D.

It has since contributed troops to [[ECOMIL]], [[United Nations Mission in Liberia|UNMIL]], and [[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]. Responsibility for the military has rested directly with the President since Jammeh seized power at the head of a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup in 1994]]. Jammeh also created the role of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (The Gambia)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], who is the senior military officer responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Gambia Armed Forces. Between 1958 and 1985, the Gambia did not have a military, but the Gambia Field Force existed as a paramilitary wing of the police. The military tradition of the Gambia can be traced to the [[Gambia Regiment]] of the [[British Army]], that existed from 1901 to 1958 and fought in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In 2017, Gambia signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Gambia Armed Forces is and has been the recipient of a number of equipment and training agreements with other countries. In 1992, a contingent of Nigerian soldiers helped lead the GNA. Between 1991 and 2005, the Turkish armed forces helped train Gambian soldiers.

The national borders outline a narrow strip on either side of the River Gambia, a body of water that has played a vital part in the nation's destiny and is known locally simply as \"the River\". Without natural barriers, the Gambia has become home to most of the ethnic groups that are present throughout western Africa, especially those in Senegal.\n\nEuropeans also figure prominently in Gambian history because the River Gambia is navigable deep into the continent, a geographic feature that made this area one of the most profitable sites for the slave trade from the 15th through the 17th centuries. (It also made it strategic to the halt of this trade once it was outlawed in the 19th century.) Some of this history was popularised in the [[Alex Haley]] book and TV series ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'', which was set in the Gambia.\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Further|Music of the Gambia}}\n\nThe music of the Gambia is closely linked musically with [[Music of Senegal|that of its neighbour, Senegal]], which surrounds its inland frontiers completely.

The British Empire occupied the Gambia when an expedition led by [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] landed there following the [[Capture of Senegal]] in 1758. The 1783 [[Peace of Paris (1783)|First Treaty of Versailles]] gave Great Britain possession of the Gambia River, but the French retained a tiny enclave at [[Albreda]] on the river's north bank. This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.\n\nAs many as three million people may have been taken as [[slavery|slaves]] from this general region during the three centuries that the [[transatlantic slave trade]] operated. It is not known how many people were taken as slaves by intertribal wars or Muslim traders before the transatlantic slave trade began. Most of those taken were sold by other Africans to Europeans: some were prisoners of intertribal wars; some were victims sold because of unpaid debts; and many others were simply victims of kidnapping.<ref>Park, Mungo ''Travels in the Interior of Africa'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5305 v.

From 1965 to 1994, the country was ostensibly a multi-party [[liberal democracy]]. It was ruled by [[Dawda Jawara]] and his [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP). However, the country never experienced political turnover during this period and its commitment to succession by the ballot box was never tested.<ref>Edie, p. 162</ref> In 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] propelled a commission of military officers to power, known as the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC). After two years of direct rule, a new constitution was written and in 1996, the leader of the AFPRC, [[Yahya Jammeh]], was elected as President. He ruled in an authoritarian style until the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], which was won by [[Adama Barrow]], backed by a coalition of opposition parties.\n\n=== Political history ===\nDuring the Jawara era, there were initially four political parties, the PPP, the [[United Party (Gambia)|United Party]] (UP), the [[Democratic Party (Gambia)|Democratic Party]] (DP), and the [[Muslim Congress Party]] (MCP). The 1960 constitution had established a [[House of Representatives of the Gambia|House of Representatives]], and in the [[Gambian legislative election, 1960|1960 election]] no party won a majority of seats. However, in 1961 the British Governor chose UP leader [[Pierre Sarr N'Jie]] to serve as the country's first head of government, in the form of a Chief Minister. This was an unpopular decision, and the [[Gambian legislative election, 1962|1962 election]] was notable as parties were able to appeal to ethnic and religious differences across The Gambia. The PPP won a majority, and formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Congress Alliance]] (DCA; a merger of the DP and MCP). They invited the UP to the coalition in 1963, but it left in 1965.<ref name=\":0\">Edie, pp. 162\u2013164</ref>\n\nThe UP was seen as the main opposition party, but it lost power from 1965 to 1970. In 1975, the [[National Convention Party (Gambia)|National Convention Party]] (NCP) was formed by [[Sheriff Mustapha Dibba]], and became the new main opposition party to the PPP's dominance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the PPP and NCP were ideologically similar, so in the 1980s a new opposition party emerged, in the form of the radical socialist [[People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism]] (PDOIS). However, between the 1966 and 1992 elections, the PPP was \"overwhelmingly dominant\", winning between 55% and 70% of the vote in each election and a large majority of seats continually.<ref>Edie, p. 165</ref>\n\nIn principle, competitive politics existed during the Jawara era, however, it was stated that there was in reality a \"one-party monopoly of state power centred around the dominant personality of Dawda Jawara.\" Civil society was limited post-independence, and opposition parties were weak and at the risk of being declared subversive. The opposition did not have equal access to resources, as the business class refused to finance them. The government had control over when they could make public announcements and press briefings, and there were also allegations of [[Electoral fraud|vote-buying]] and improprieties in the preparation of the [[Electoral roll|electoral register]]. A 1991 court challenge by the PDOIS against irregularities on the electoral register in Banjul was dismissed on a technicality.<ref>Edie, pp. 168\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn July 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought an end to the Jawara era. The [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC), led by [[Yahya Jammeh]], ruled dictatorially for two years. The council suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the populace.<ref>Edie, p. 182</ref> A transition back to democracy occurred in 1996, and a new constitution was written, though the process was manipulated to benefit Jammeh.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\">Edie, p. 185</ref> In a 1996 referendum, 70% of voters approved the constitution, and in December 1996 Jammeh was elected as President. All but PDOIS of the pre-coup parties were banned, and former ministers were barred from public office.<ref>Edie, p. 186</ref>\n\nDuring Jammeh's rule, the opposition was again fragmented. An example was the infighting between members of the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD) that was formed in 2005. Jammeh used the police forces to harass opposition members and parties. Jammeh was also accused of human rights abuses, especially towards human rights activists, civil society organisations, political opponents, and the media.

They describe a \"fragile peace\" with tensions in rural areas between farmers and the larger communities. They also reported on tensions between ethnic groups developing. An example is that in February 2017, 51 supporters of Jammeh were arrested for harassing supporters of Barrow. Although his election was initially met with enthusiasm, the Centre notes that this has been dampened by Barrow's initial constitutional faux pas with his Vice President, the challenge of inclusion, and high expectations post-Jammeh.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe Gambia has had a number of constitutions in its history. The two most significant are the 1970 constitution, which established The Gambia as a presidential republic, and the 1996 constitution, which served as a basis for Jammeh's rule and was kept following Barrow's victory in 2016. Jammeh manipulated the 1996 constitutional reform process to benefit himself. No reference was made to term limits, indicating Jammeh's preference to stay in power for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\"/> According to the 1996 constitution, the President is the head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

The office of Prime Minister was abolished in 1970. Total executive power is vested in the president. They can also appoint five members of the National Assembly, the judges of the superior courts, regional governors, and district chiefs. In terms of the civil service, they can appoint the Public Service Commission, the ombudsman, and the Independent Electoral Commission. The president is directly elected for five-year terms based on a simple majority of votes.

It maintained close relations with the United Kingdom, Senegal, and other African countries. The July 1994 coup strained The Gambia's relationship with Western powers, particularly the United States, which until 2002 suspended most non-humanitarian assistance in accordance with Section 508 of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]].

It originally consisted of the Gambia National Army (GNA), trained by the British, and Gambia National Gendarmerie (GNG), trained by the Senegalese. The GNG was merged into the police in 1992, and in 1997 Jammeh created a Gambia Navy (GN). Attempts to create a [[Gambian Air Force|Gambia Air Force]] in the mid 2000s ultimately fell through. In 2008, Jammeh created a National Republican Guard, composed of special forces units. The GNA has a strength of roughly 900, in two infantry battalions and an engineering company. It makes use of [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] and [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured cars. The GN is equipped with patrol vessels, and [[Taiwan]] donated a number of new vessels to the force in 2013.\n\nSince the GAF was formed in 1985, it has been active in UN and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions. It has been classed as a Tier 2 peacekeeping contributor<ref name=\"BellamyWilliams\">Bellamy, Alex J. and Williams, Paul D.

It has since contributed troops to [[ECOMIL]], [[United Nations Mission in Liberia|UNMIL]], and [[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]. Responsibility for the military has rested directly with the President since Jammeh seized power at the head of a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup in 1994]]. Jammeh also created the role of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (The Gambia)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], who is the senior military officer responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Gambia Armed Forces. Between 1958 and 1985, the Gambia did not have a military, but the Gambia Field Force existed as a paramilitary wing of the police. The military tradition of the Gambia can be traced to the [[Gambia Regiment]] of the [[British Army]], that existed from 1901 to 1958 and fought in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In 2017, Gambia signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Gambia Armed Forces is and has been the recipient of a number of equipment and training agreements with other countries. In 1992, a contingent of Nigerian soldiers helped lead the GNA. Between 1991 and 2005, the Turkish armed forces helped train Gambian soldiers.

The national borders outline a narrow strip on either side of the River Gambia, a body of water that has played a vital part in the nation's destiny and is known locally simply as \"the River\". Without natural barriers, the Gambia has become home to most of the ethnic groups that are present throughout western Africa, especially those in Senegal.\n\nEuropeans also figure prominently in Gambian history because the River Gambia is navigable deep into the continent, a geographic feature that made this area one of the most profitable sites for the slave trade from the 15th through the 17th centuries. (It also made it strategic to the halt of this trade once it was outlawed in the 19th century.) Some of this history was popularised in the [[Alex Haley]] book and TV series ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'', which was set in the Gambia.\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Further|Music of the Gambia}}\n\nThe music of the Gambia is closely linked musically with [[Music of Senegal|that of its neighbour, Senegal]], which surrounds its inland frontiers completely.
