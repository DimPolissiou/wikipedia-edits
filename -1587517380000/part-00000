The station serves as an East Coast flagship station of the [[Azteca America]] television network.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== as W53AA (1973-1996)===\nThis station was signed on over UHF channel 53 in the 1970s by its original owner [[CBS|CBS Inc.]] as '''W53AA'''. It was one of multiple [[Television]] [[Broadcast relay station|Broadcast Translator]]s in New York City which operated at the upper end of the UHF band in order to provide reliable coverage to certain New York boroughs whose reception was ultimately compromised by construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]. This translator station relayed the signal of [[WCBS-TV]], which for decades prior and at that time operated over [[very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2.\n\nOriginally, most of the New York City television stations operated their main transmitters from the [[Empire State Building]]. However, reliable reception was ultimately compromised for some viewers once the majority of the World Trade Center was constructed, thus necessitating the use of the UHF translators. In response, nearly all of the TV stations, including WCBS-TV, relocated to the North Tower of the World Trade Center in 1975. CBS, however, maintained an auxiliary transmitter back at Empire.\n\nCBS eventually sold the station on July 15, 1987 to Accord Communications, Inc.  Accord, who purchased W53AA as an investment and intended to sell it for a profit, improved the station by relocating its transmitter to the Empire State Building and increasing its transmitting power to 7.2 kW.\n\nAccord sold W53AA on October 6, 1989 to Pan-Asian Communications, Inc. whose president was Andrew H. Ohm, a major figure in Korean media in the United States. Ohm established the Korea Broadcasting Corp. (KBC) over W53AA, the first Korean-owned television station in the United States. The station's emphasis was on Asian language programming and broadcast throughout the New York metropolitan area.\n\n=== as WKOB-LP/LD (1996-present)===\nOn February 19, 1996, the call-sign was changed to WKOB-LP.\n\nOn June 1, 1998, WKOB filed a displacement application to move to channel 48 due to the impending [[WFUT-DT|WFUT]] operation on Channel 53.\n \nIn the late 1990s, programming was leased and consisted of religious programs and infomercials.\n\nAccording to WKOB, in a filing to the FCC, the station had broadcast programming 24 hours a day under a time brokerage agreement with [[Paxson Communications]] LPTV, Inc. until August 31, 1999. The station then went silent because its time brokerage programming agreement expired.  WKOB notified the FCC on September 17, 1999 that the station was back on the air with a \u201climited\u201d amount of programming.  WKOB-LP also stated that it had obtained locally-produced programming targeted to the needs of the Korean residents of New York City, and asserted that this specialized programming service supported an award of Class A status, which it was ultimately denied.\n\n[[WRNN-TV]] strongly objected to any operation that could interfere with channel 48, as they had been assigned this channel for their Kingston, New York operation. In fact, WRNN-TV's owners took the unusual step to back up their opposition by monitoring WKOB-LP for 39 days between April 28 and August 22, 2000. They hired a Korean language interpreter, and based upon the transcripts provided by that interpreter, and their visual review of the programming, they determined the majority of the programs observed were religious services conducted in churches located in Korea. In its August 10, 2001 reply to WRNN-TV\u2019s opposition, WKOB-LP provided additional information regarding its programming, explaining that the programming is produced in New York, and edited in WKOB-LP\u2019s studio, and contended that if a Class A station cannot incorporate footage shot outside its service area in a locally produced program, then \u201ca local newscast would not get credit for local time during a news story on an address by the President in Washington.\u201d WKOB also asserted that \u201cits historical record of all-day programming coupled with its record of local service to the Korean minority community in New York justifies an exercise of the discretion granted to the Commission by the [CBPA] to act in the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe FCC ultimately denied both the application for review filed by WKOB Communications, Inc., and dismissed the opposition filed by WRNN-TV Associates Limited Partnership describing it as \"moot\".\n\nIn the early 2000s, the station owner began to suffer financial problems. It went into receivership in 2001, and a voluntary sale was attempted but fell through, leading to a lawsuit with the buyer. Financial problems still loomed, and the station ultimately requested Special Temporary Authority to go silent in January 2005.\n \nOhm sold the station to Nave Communications LLC on May 13, 2005 for $1,250,000. Under its new ownership, the station shortly thereafter became an [[Almavision]] affiliate in 2006. In Late-2006, Almavision programming ceased on the station, and was replaced by DayStar programming, which is still broadcasting to this day.\n\nThe station was displaced from Channel 53 to Channel 42 due to the FCC granting WFUT channel 53 for its pre-transition digital operations.\n\nThis station was originally signed on in the 1970s by CBS, Inc. In late 2008, Nave was uncertain if there would be any room left for its WKOB operation on the much smaller television band due to the DTV transition. Its attempt to secure Class A status and securing a spot on Channel 48 were both thwarted by WRNN-TV, and its Low Power classification relegated it to a secondary status. Making matters worse, its Channel 42 operation was predicted to cause interference to full power [[WZME|WSAH]] Bridgeport, if their pending application to broadcast on Channel 41 from the Empire State Building was approved. That application was ultimately denied due to unacceptable interference to [[WXTV-DT]] Paterson.\n\nDesperate and with few alternatives, Nave turned to [[CBS Corporation|CBS, Inc]]., asking if they would object to WKOB-LP requesting displacement to [[WCBS-TV]]'s analog channel position at Channel 2. CBS, which ultimately selected Channel 33 for their post-transition operations, did not object and signed a Waiver Of Consent, ultimately accepting whatever interference a WKOB-LP operation over Channel 2 would have presented to WCBS-TV. On January 21, 2009, the Request for Displacement was approved.\n\nWKOB-LP, however, did not commence operations on Channel 2 until seven months after WCBS-TV signed off Channel 2 for the final time in July 2009. The station finally began operations on RF Channel 2 on March 7, 2010 as WKOB-LD New York.\n\nWKOB-LD once had a construction permit to broadcast a digital signal on channel 59 at 400 Watts, which has since been modified to specify operation on channel 2 with 300 Watts, the latter of which is on the air as of February 2010. The station subsequently filed an Application For Displacement to move its digital signal back to channel 42. The station has filed this application for the following reason:\n\n{{quote|''\"Applicant\u2019s current operational facility is located on Channel 2, a [[Band I|low-band VHF]] channel. VHF facilities, particularly low band VHF, are subject to reception problems due to [[Electromagnetic interference|impulse noise]]. Applicant seeks a channel in the UHF band that will provide improved viewer reception.\"''}}\n\nThe application has been granted and there is an outstanding construction permit to build-out a transmitter facility for a Channel 42 operation, however Nave has not completed the build-out.\n\nIn June 2013, WKOB-LD was slated to be sold to Landover 5 LLC as part of a larger deal involving 51 other low-power television stations;<ref name=tvbr-saletolandover>{{cite news|last=Seyler|first=Dave|title=Anatomy of an LPTV deal extravaganza|url=http://rbr.com/anatomy-of-an-lptv-deal-extravaganza/|accessdate=July 3, 2013|newspaper=Television Business Report|date=June 24, 2013}}</ref> the sale fell through in June 2016.<ref name=\"fcc-nosaletolandover\">{{cite web|title=Notification of Non-consummation|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1731846&Form_id=905&Facility_id=51441|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> Nave Broadcasting sold WKOB-LD to HC2 Holdings in 2017.<ref name=\"fcc-saletohc2\">{{cite web|title=APPLICATION FOR CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT OF BROADCAST STATION CONSTRUCTION PERMIT OR LICENSE|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1765888&Service=LD&Form_id=345&Facility_id=51441|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=September 11, 2017}}</ref> \n\n== Digital television ==\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed:\n\n'''Digital channels'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This was the second time LATV appeared in the New York City market. It first appeared as a sub-channel on [[WPIX]], but was dropped just prior to that station adding [[This TV]] as a sub-channel. The addition of LATV as a sub-channel on WKOB-LD marked the second time a diginet was dropped by one station and later appeared over another in this Television market; [[Azteca Am\u00e9rica]] was the first, having relocated from [[WNYN-LD|WNYN-LD 39.4]] to [[WMBC-TV|WMBC-TV 63.6]]. LATV later secured carriage over [[WNWT-LD|WBQM-LD]].\n\nThe LATV affiliation over WKOB-LD ended after one week, however, as Daystar programming had returned to 42.1 and remains on 42.2.\n\nJanuary 12\u201319, 2011: WKOB-LD was apparently planning to add [[Tuff TV]] on 42.4. A Test Pattern/Standard Color Bars is on this sub-channel with text reading as follows: Line 1: \"TUFF TV\" static, Line 2: \"TUFF TV\" blinking. This same day, a fifth sub-channel appeared for the first time on WKOB-LD, channel 42.5. A Test Pattern/Standard Color Bars is on this sub-channel with text reading as follows: Line 1: \"WKOB-LP SD5\" static, Line 2: \"WKOB-LP\" blinking. Until 1/12/11, this text appeared on 42.4, with the appropriate corresponding SD#. On January 19, 2011, WKOB-LD added Tuff TV on 42.4.\n\nMarch 1, 2011: Daystar programming has been removed from 42.1. The stream remains live, but no A/V content is being transmitted. Daystar remains on 42.2.\n\nMarch 9, 2011: Daystar programming was returned to 42.1. WKOB-LD has added WizeBuys TV on 42.5. WizeBuys TV is a 24/7 national television network delivering both short and long form Direct Response advertising. It reaches over 30 million homes per day, including 15 of the top 20 DMAs that deliver an ever-growing audience. It is owned by The Cross Group, a subsidiary of Philadelphia based Cross MediaWorks.\n\nDuring the final week of March 2011, an STL problem existed where only the aural portion of Tuff TV could be received and re-broadcast by WKOB. On March 30, 2011, Tuff TV has all but been dropped from WKOB. The PSIP still identified 42.4 as Tuff TV through late June, and about once an hour, a technical issue still exists where the Tuff TV audio can be heard for about two seconds when the new programming service briefly interrupts for station ID.\n\nMarch 31, 2011: WKOB-LD has added HOT TV: History Of Television on 42.4. HOT TV is a classic TV station featuring TV shows and movies from the 1940s through the early 1960s.\n\nJune, 2011:  Daystar on channel 42.1 was replaced by color bars with a reference to GBC, and no further details.  Daystar continues on 42.2.  A few days later, infomercials appear on channel 42.1.\n\nJuly 2, 2011:  GBC World News was added to channel 42.1 at 8 AM.\n\nAugust, 2011:  GBC World News ceased operations, leaving a blank screen and no sound on 42.1\n\nSeptember, 2011: WizeBuy moved from 42.5 to 42.1 to replace the vacated space left by the demise of GBC, 42.5 deactivated\n\nSeptember 26, 2011: [[Retro Television Network|Retro Television Network (RTV)]] affiliation canceled. Replaced immediately with WKOB 42.3 24/7 Movie Network. This new station is locally produced and consists of 1930s through 1960s public domain movies.\n\nOctober 22, 2011: 24/7 Movie Network shifted to 42.1, HOT to 42.3 and WizeBuy to 42.4.  WKOB also has an ad running stating that they are hiring salespersons for HOT TV 42.3.\n\nNovember 25, 2011: The 24/7 Movie Network 42.1 has been removed and replaced by Mundo Hispano TV based out of Bloomfield, NJ. This station had formerly aired over [[WMBC-TV]] Newton, Channel 63-4. HOT 42.3 is off the air (running test color bars) and 42.4 is running 24/7 infomercials. Daystar remains active on 42.2.\n\nJanuary 24, 2012: Telos Alternative Health Network was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-1. The stations website describes Telos as: A Digital Television Network designed to present alternatives to traditional medicine.\n\nPrior to the Telos addition, channel 42-1, labeled \"24-7\" via PSIP to reflect the WKOB 24/7 Movie Network, was airing an EBR Test Pattern without audio duplicating the one which has been airing over 42-3 since November 2011.\n\nFebruary 4, 2012: HOT TV: History Of Television returned to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-3.\n\nMarch 16, 2012: WKOB-LD adds sub-channels 42-5 and 42-6. This marks the first time ever that WKOB-LD has added a sixth sub-channel. Both channels are labeled \"WKOB-LD\" via PSIP and are each airing an EBR Test Pattern without audio. However, for approximately two minutes beginning at 4:37AM EDT. on 3-17-12, audio was transmitted for the first time over both 42-5 and 42-6. The audio was from Telos TV which airs over 42-1, and this same audio feed aired over all six sub-channels during this two-minute interval. After which, audio content was restored to normal over all channels.\n\nPSIP channel names were also adjusted on 3-16-12. \"DayStar\" was changed to \"Daystar\" and \"HOT TV\" was changed to \"HOT\".\n\nAugust 2012: SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN) was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-5. The stations website describes SBN as: a television and radio network that is broadcast around the world 24/7. SBN is an extension of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and offers live church services as well as programs hosted by Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, Frances Swaggart, Evangelist Donnie Swaggart, Gabriel Swaggart, and more. The goal of SonLife Broadcasting Network is to reach the world with the Message of the Cross.\n\nSeptember 1, 2012: Telos Alternative Health Network and HOT TV are not being carried over WKOB-LD, despite the TVCT information reflecting their continued occupancy. An EBR Test Pattern without Audio is presently airing on those subchannels.\n\nSeptember 15, 2012: [[Almavision]] was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-6. The network is an American television network broadcasting Christian programming in Spanish with affiliates across North and Central America. Their slogan is \"Television Cristiana...a la manera de Dios. \" (\"Christian television... in God's way.\") and Comprometidos con la verdad \"committed to the truth\". This is the second time Almavision has aired over WKOB, the first time being shortly after Nave Communications, its present owners, first purchased the station.\n\nDecember 2012: [https://web.archive.org/web/20130105233053/http://my.punchtv.net/ Punch TV] was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-3. \"Punch TV is an urban programming experience that brings together a unique type of programming that reflects the tastes, preferences, hues, and nationalities of the new urban American \u2013 a population that includes Caucasians, African Americans, Latinos, Asians, Native Americans and citizenry of mixed ethnicity\u2019s.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=PRWeb: Punch TV Network is Redefining Urban America at its First Annual Upfront|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/punchtv/418/prweb9419881.htm|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> Until the network's actual launch, a still-slide showing the children's animated series ''Filbert's Big Bash'' with a \"Happy Holidays!\" banner atop was displayed with a message at bottom which read: \"P-TV Coming Soon!\" Actual Punch TV programming began on December 26, 2012.\n\nJanuary 2013: Cubana Television added over primary WKOB-LD, Channel 42-1. The affiliation lasted approximately one month.\n\nApril 20, 2013: Punch TV affiliation discontinued. [[Peace TV]] immediately launched over Channel 42-3.\n\nJuly 2013: [[Soul of the South]] added on 42-1.\n\nNovember 3, 2014: An EBR Test Pattern without audio replaces [[Soul of the South]], which has since commenced airing over [[WDVB-CD]] 23.2.\n\nDecember 1, 2014: WKOB-LD adds sub-channel 42-7. This marks the first time ever that WKOB-LD has added a seventh sub-channel. [http://www.revntv.com/ Rev'n], launched on December 1, 2014 at 5:00PM EDT. by Luken Communications, is a new network for automotive performance enthusiasts featuring programming focused on cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, ATVs, snowmobiles, events, auctions and more.\n\nDecember 9, 2014: [[Retro Television Network|Retro TV]] replaces Rev'n on WKOB-LD sub-channel 42-7.\n\nMarch, 2015: IQRA TV was added to 42.1. IQRA TV was acquired in 2009 by the [http://www.alkhair.org/ [[Al-Khair Foundation]]]. That foundation describes the station as \"one of the premier broadcasters of quality Islamic-based programmes. IQRA TV is distributed worldwide to Muslims and Non-Muslims alike, with informative and educational programmes.\" Prior to the addition of IQRA TV, 42.1 was not carrying actual programming since Soul of the South Network departed WKOB-LD in November 2014; An EBR Test Pattern without audio served as a placeholder in the interim.\n\nSimultaneously in March 2015, MiCasa Network was added to 42.6. MiCasa Network is the premiere provider of entertainment for the evolving Latino-American community, offering comedies, music, news, reality, sports, politics, and lifestyle entertainment in English with a distinct Latino flavor.  With over 350 hours of original programming shot in its state-of-the-art HD virtual production studios and 1,500 hours of licensed programming, MiCasa Network offers fresh and original entertainment for today\u2019s Latino-American community. As a result, ONTV4U, an Hispanic infomercial diginet which had occupied 42.6, was removed from the WKOB-LD sub-channel lineup.\n\nONTV4U reappeared on channel 42.8 in June 2015.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{TVQ|WKOB}}\n\n{{NYC TV}}\n{{Other New York Stations}}\n{{HC2 Holdings}}\n{{Daystar stations}}\n\n[[Category:Television stations in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Digital low-power stations]]\n[[Category:Daystar Television Network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1970]]\n[[Category:DTV America]]\n[[Category:HC2 Holdings]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n{{Infobox broadcast |\n  call_letters             = WKOB-LD|\n  station_logo             = |[[Image:Daystar.jpg|356\u00d7186pixel|jpeg)]]\n  station_slogan           = |\n  station_branding         = Azteca New York 42|\n  analog                   = |\n  digital                  = 2 ([[Very high frequency|VHF]])<br>{{small|(to move to 13 [VHF])}}|\n  virtual                  = 42 ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]])|\n  affiliations             = [[Azteca America]]|\n  founded                  = 1973|\n  location                 = [[New York City|New York City, NY]]|\n  country                  = [[United States]]|\n  callsign_meaning         = '''KO'''rean '''B'''rocasting Company (station's former owner)|\n  former_callsigns         = W53AA (1973-1996) WKOB-LP (1996-2010)|\n  owner                    = [[HC2 Holdings]]|\n  licensee                 = HC2 LPTV Holdings, Inc.|\n  former_affiliations      = [[CBS]] (via [[WCBS-TV]] translator) (1973-1989);<br />Asian Programming (1989-1996); [[Independent station|Independent]] (1996-2006 and 2010-2013)<br />[[Almavision]] (2006)<br />[[LATV]] on 42.2 (October 18\u201325, 2010)<br />[[Tuff TV]] on 42.4 (January 19, 2011-March 30, 2011)<br />[[Retro Television Network|RTV]] on 42.3 (2010-September 26, 2011)|\n  effective_radiated_power = Analog 50 kW, Digital 0.3 KW|\n  homepage       = [http://www.aztecaamerica.com/newyork/ Azteca New York]<br>[http://www.Daystar.com/ www.Daystar.com]|\n}}\n\n'''WKOB-LD''' (digital channel 2, virtual channel 42) is a low-powered television station in [[New York City]], licensed, owned and operated by [[HC2 Holdings]].

They hired a Korean language interpreter, and based upon the transcripts provided by that interpreter, and their visual review of the programming, they determined the majority of the programs observed were religious services conducted in churches located in Korea. In its August 10, 2001 reply to WRNN-TV\u2019s opposition, WKOB-LP provided additional information regarding its programming, explaining that the programming is produced in New York, and edited in WKOB-LP\u2019s studio, and contended that if a Class A station cannot incorporate footage shot outside its service area in a locally produced program, then \u201ca local newscast would not get credit for local time during a news story on an address by the President in Washington.\u201d WKOB also asserted that \u201cits historical record of all-day programming coupled with its record of local service to the Korean minority community in New York justifies an exercise of the discretion granted to the Commission by the [CBPA] to act in the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe FCC ultimately denied both the application for review filed by WKOB Communications, Inc., and dismissed the opposition filed by WRNN-TV Associates Limited Partnership describing it as \"moot\".\n\nIn the early 2000s, the station owner began to suffer financial problems. It went into receivership in 2001, and a voluntary sale was attempted but fell through, leading to a lawsuit with the buyer. Financial problems still loomed, and the station ultimately requested Special Temporary Authority to go silent in January 2005.\n \nOhm sold the station to Nave Communications LLC on May 13, 2005 for $1,250,000. Under its new ownership, the station shortly thereafter became an [[Almavision]] affiliate in 2006. In Late-2006, Almavision programming ceased on the station, and was replaced by DayStar programming, which is still broadcasting to this day.\n\nThe station was displaced from Channel 53 to Channel 42 due to the FCC granting WFUT channel 53 for its pre-transition digital operations.\n\nThis station was originally signed on in the 1970s by CBS, Inc. In late 2008, Nave was uncertain if there would be any room left for its WKOB operation on the much smaller television band due to the DTV transition. Its attempt to secure Class A status and securing a spot on Channel 48 were both thwarted by WRNN-TV, and its Low Power classification relegated it to a secondary status. Making matters worse, its Channel 42 operation was predicted to cause interference to full power [[WZME|WSAH]] Bridgeport, if their pending application to broadcast on Channel 41 from the Empire State Building was approved. That application was ultimately denied due to unacceptable interference to [[WXTV-DT]] Paterson.\n\nDesperate and with few alternatives, Nave turned to [[CBS Corporation|CBS, Inc]]., asking if they would object to WKOB-LP requesting displacement to [[WCBS-TV]]'s analog channel position at Channel 2. CBS, which ultimately selected Channel 33 for their post-transition operations, did not object and signed a Waiver Of Consent, ultimately accepting whatever interference a WKOB-LP operation over Channel 2 would have presented to WCBS-TV. On January 21, 2009, the Request for Displacement was approved.\n\nWKOB-LP, however, did not commence operations on Channel 2 until seven months after WCBS-TV signed off Channel 2 for the final time in July 2009. The station finally began operations on RF Channel 2 on March 7, 2010 as WKOB-LD New York.\n\nWKOB-LD once had a construction permit to broadcast a digital signal on channel 59 at 400 Watts, which has since been modified to specify operation on channel 2 with 300 Watts, the latter of which is on the air as of February 2010. The station subsequently filed an Application For Displacement to move its digital signal back to channel 42. The station has filed this application for the following reason:\n\n{{quote|''\"Applicant\u2019s current operational facility is located on Channel 2, a [[Band I|low-band VHF]] channel. VHF facilities, particularly low band VHF, are subject to reception problems due to [[Electromagnetic interference|impulse noise]]. Applicant seeks a channel in the UHF band that will provide improved viewer reception.\"''}}\n\nThe application has been granted and there is an outstanding construction permit to build-out a transmitter facility for a Channel 42 operation, however Nave has not completed the build-out.\n\nIn June 2013, WKOB-LD was slated to be sold to Landover 5 LLC as part of a larger deal involving 51 other low-power television stations;<ref name=tvbr-saletolandover>{{cite news|last=Seyler|first=Dave|title=Anatomy of an LPTV deal extravaganza|url=http://rbr.com/anatomy-of-an-lptv-deal-extravaganza/|accessdate=July 3, 2013|newspaper=Television Business Report|date=June 24, 2013}}</ref> the sale fell through in June 2016.<ref name=\"fcc-nosaletolandover\">{{cite web|title=Notification of Non-consummation|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1731846&Form_id=905&Facility_id=51441|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> Nave Broadcasting sold WKOB-LD to HC2 Holdings in 2017.<ref name=\"fcc-saletohc2\">{{cite web|title=APPLICATION FOR CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT OF BROADCAST STATION CONSTRUCTION PERMIT OR LICENSE|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1765888&Service=LD&Form_id=345&Facility_id=51441|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=September 11, 2017}}</ref> \n\n== Digital television ==\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed:\n\n'''Digital channels'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This was the second time LATV appeared in the New York City market. It first appeared as a sub-channel on [[WPIX]], but was dropped just prior to that station adding [[This TV]] as a sub-channel. The addition of LATV as a sub-channel on WKOB-LD marked the second time a diginet was dropped by one station and later appeared over another in this Television market; [[Azteca Am\u00e9rica]] was the first, having relocated from [[WNYN-LD|WNYN-LD 39.4]] to [[WMBC-TV|WMBC-TV 63.6]]. LATV later secured carriage over [[WNWT-LD|WBQM-LD]].\n\nThe LATV affiliation over WKOB-LD ended after one week, however, as Daystar programming had returned to 42.1 and remains on 42.2.\n\nJanuary 12\u201319, 2011: WKOB-LD was apparently planning to add [[Tuff TV]] on 42.4. A Test Pattern/Standard Color Bars is on this sub-channel with text reading as follows: Line 1: \"TUFF TV\" static, Line 2: \"TUFF TV\" blinking. This same day, a fifth sub-channel appeared for the first time on WKOB-LD, channel 42.5. A Test Pattern/Standard Color Bars is on this sub-channel with text reading as follows: Line 1: \"WKOB-LP SD5\" static, Line 2: \"WKOB-LP\" blinking. Until 1/12/11, this text appeared on 42.4, with the appropriate corresponding SD#. On January 19, 2011, WKOB-LD added [[Tuff TV]] on 42.4.\n\nMarch 1, 2011: Daystar programming has been removed from 42.1. The stream remains live, but no A/V content is being transmitted. Daystar remains on 42.2.\n\nMarch 9, 2011: Daystar programming was returned to 42.1. WKOB-LD has added WizeBuys TV on 42.5. WizeBuys TV is a 24/7 national television network delivering both short and long form Direct Response advertising. It reaches over 30 million homes per day, including 15 of the top 20 DMAs that deliver an ever-growing audience. It is owned by The Cross Group, a subsidiary of Philadelphia based Cross MediaWorks.\n\nDuring the final week of March 2011, an STL problem existed where only the aural portion of Tuff TV could be received and re-broadcast by WKOB. On March 30, 2011, Tuff TV has all but been dropped from WKOB. The PSIP still identified 42.4 as Tuff TV through late June, and about once an hour, a technical issue still exists where the Tuff TV audio can be heard for about two seconds when the new programming service briefly interrupts for station ID.\n\nMarch 31, 2011: WKOB-LD has added HOT TV: History Of Television on 42.4. HOT TV is a classic TV station featuring TV shows and movies from the 1940s through the early 1960s.\n\nJune, 2011:  Daystar on channel 42.1 was replaced by color bars with a reference to GBC, and no further details.  Daystar continues on 42.2.  A few days later, infomercials appear on channel 42.1.\n\nJuly 2, 2011:  GBC World News was added to channel 42.1 at 8 AM.\n\nAugust, 2011:  GBC World News ceased operations, leaving a blank screen and no sound on 42.1\n\nSeptember, 2011: WizeBuy moved from 42.5 to 42.1 to replace the vacated space left by the demise of GBC, 42.5 deactivated\n\nSeptember 26, 2011: [[Retro Television Network|Retro Television Network (RTV)]] affiliation canceled. Replaced immediately with WKOB 42.3 24/7 Movie Network. This new station is locally produced and consists of 1930s through 1960s public domain movies.\n\nOctober 22, 2011: 24/7 Movie Network shifted to 42.1, HOT to 42.3 and WizeBuy to 42.4.  WKOB also has an ad running stating that they are hiring salespersons for HOT TV 42.3.\n\nNovember 25, 2011: The 24/7 Movie Network 42.1 has been removed and replaced by Mundo Hispano TV based out of Bloomfield, NJ. This station had formerly aired over [[WMBC-TV]] Newton, Channel 63-4. HOT 42.3 is off the air (running test color bars) and 42.4 is running 24/7 infomercials. Daystar remains active on 42.2.\n\nJanuary 24, 2012: Telos Alternative Health Network was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-1. The stations website describes Telos as: A Digital Television Network designed to present alternatives to traditional medicine.\n\nPrior to the Telos addition, channel 42-1, labeled \"24-7\" via PSIP to reflect the WKOB 24/7 Movie Network, was airing an EBR Test Pattern without audio duplicating the one which has been airing over 42-3 since November 2011.\n\nFebruary 4, 2012: HOT TV: History Of Television returned to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-3.\n\nMarch 16, 2012: WKOB-LD adds sub-channels 42-5 and 42-6. This marks the first time ever that WKOB-LD has added a sixth sub-channel. Both channels are labeled \"WKOB-LD\" via PSIP and are each airing an EBR Test Pattern without audio. However, for approximately two minutes beginning at 4:37AM EDT. on 3-17-12, audio was transmitted for the first time over both 42-5 and 42-6. The audio was from Telos TV which airs over 42-1, and this same audio feed aired over all six sub-channels during this two-minute interval. After which, audio content was restored to normal over all channels.\n\nPSIP channel names were also adjusted on 3-16-12. \"DayStar\" was changed to \"Daystar\" and \"HOT TV\" was changed to \"HOT\".\n\nAugust 2012: SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN) was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-5. The stations website describes SBN as: a television and radio network that is broadcast around the world 24/7. SBN is an extension of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and offers live church services as well as programs hosted by Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, Frances Swaggart, Evangelist Donnie Swaggart, Gabriel Swaggart, and more. The goal of SonLife Broadcasting Network is to reach the world with the Message of the Cross.\n\nSeptember 1, 2012: Telos Alternative Health Network and HOT TV are not being carried over WKOB-LD, despite the TVCT information reflecting their continued occupancy. An EBR Test Pattern without Audio is presently airing on those subchannels.\n\nSeptember 15, 2012: [[Almavision]] was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-6. The network is an American television network broadcasting Christian programming in Spanish with affiliates across North and Central America. Their slogan is \"Television Cristiana...a la manera de Dios. \" (\"Christian television... in God's way.\") and Comprometidos con la verdad \"committed to the truth\". This is the second time Almavision has aired over WKOB, the first time being shortly after Nave Communications, its present owners, first purchased the station.\n\nDecember 2012: [https://web.archive.org/web/20130105233053/http://my.punchtv.net/ Punch TV] was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-3. \"Punch TV is an urban programming experience that brings together a unique type of programming that reflects the tastes, preferences, hues, and nationalities of the new urban American \u2013 a population that includes Caucasians, African Americans, Latinos, Asians, Native Americans and citizenry of mixed ethnicity\u2019s.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=PRWeb: Punch TV Network is Redefining Urban America at its First Annual Upfront|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/punchtv/418/prweb9419881.htm|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> Until the network's actual launch, a still-slide showing the children's animated series ''Filbert's Big Bash'' with a \"Happy Holidays!\" banner atop was displayed with a message at bottom which read: \"P-TV Coming Soon!\" Actual Punch TV programming began on December 26, 2012.\n\nJanuary 2013: Cubana Television added over primary WKOB-LD, Channel 42-1. The affiliation lasted approximately one month.\n\nApril 20, 2013: Punch TV affiliation discontinued. [[Peace TV]] immediately launched over Channel 42-3.\n\nJuly 2013: [[Soul of the South]] added on 42-1.\n\nNovember 3, 2014: An EBR Test Pattern without audio replaces [[Soul of the South]], which has since commenced airing over [[WDVB-CD]] 23.2.\n\nDecember 1, 2014: WKOB-LD adds sub-channel 42-7. This marks the first time ever that WKOB-LD has added a seventh sub-channel. [http://www.revntv.com/ Rev'n], launched on December 1, 2014 at 5:00PM EDT. by Luken Communications, is a new network for automotive performance enthusiasts featuring programming focused on cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, ATVs, snowmobiles, events, auctions and more.\n\nDecember 9, 2014: [[Retro Television Network|Retro TV]] replaces Rev'n on WKOB-LD sub-channel 42-7.\n\nMarch, 2015: IQRA TV was added to 42.1. IQRA TV was acquired in 2009 by the [http://www.alkhair.org/ [[Al-Khair Foundation]]]. That foundation describes the station as \"one of the premier broadcasters of quality Islamic-based programmes. IQRA TV is distributed worldwide to Muslims and Non-Muslims alike, with informative and educational programmes.\" Prior to the addition of IQRA TV, 42.1 was not carrying actual programming since Soul of the South Network departed WKOB-LD in November 2014; An EBR Test Pattern without audio served as a placeholder in the interim.\n\nSimultaneously in March 2015, MiCasa Network was added to 42.6. MiCasa Network is the premiere provider of entertainment for the evolving Latino-American community, offering comedies, music, news, reality, sports, politics, and lifestyle entertainment in English with a distinct Latino flavor.  With over 350 hours of original programming shot in its state-of-the-art HD virtual production studios and 1,500 hours of licensed programming, MiCasa Network offers fresh and original entertainment for today\u2019s Latino-American community. As a result, ONTV4U, an Hispanic infomercial diginet which had occupied 42.6, was removed from the WKOB-LD sub-channel lineup.\n\nONTV4U reappeared on channel 42.8 in June 2015.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{TVQ|WKOB}}\n\n{{NYC TV}}\n{{Other New York Stations}}\n{{HC2 Holdings}}\n{{Daystar stations}}\n\n[[Category:Television stations in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Digital low-power stations]]\n[[Category:Daystar Television Network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1970]]\n[[Category:DTV America]]\n[[Category:HC2 Holdings]]\n", "name_user": "Bumm13", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSubchannel history:removed redundant \"Tuff TV\" wikilink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WKOB-LD"}

The airport is located in the suburban municipality of [[Soledad, Atl\u00e1ntico|Soledad]]. It owes its name to one of the pioneers of Colombian aviation, Ernesto Cortissoz.\n\nThis airport serves as a focus city for [[Avianca]]. It is capable of accepting widebodied aircraft such as the [[Boeing 747]], [[Boeing 767]], and [[Airbus A340]]. It is the most important airport in terms of infrastructure in the northern part of the country and the first in terms of cargo movements.\n\n== Description ==\nThe airport is located in the municipality of Soledad, just {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from the center of Barranquilla. It is capable of receiving widebody aircraft like the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Airbus A340. In fact, it was once the largest airport in Colombia. Currently, the airport is fifth in number of passengers and cargo room. The airport has two terminals: the domestic, with gates 6-13, and international, with gates 1-5 and 5A In July 2007, the [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics|Aeronautica Civil]] gave the airport \"open skies\" designation, this means that any airline in the world can fly to Barranquilla on any route with any frequency. This action was taken largely to promote tourism as Barranquilla is a key access point to the Caribbean.\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of commercial aviation in [[Colombia]], airport construction was in charge of each airline purporting to serve a particular city. Thus construction of major airports in Colombia fell to [[SCADTA]], including Soledad Airport.\n\nSoledad Airport soon became the main center of operations and maintenance of SCADTA for their domestic operations. International services were operated by Pan American Airways, which maintained scheduled DC-3 service, later supplemented by Boeing 307 Stratoliners, to [[Panama]], [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and [[Miami]]. In 1946 international service at Soledad Airport resumed with Avianca DC-4s, first to Miami and later to Kingston and [[New York City|New York]].\n\nAlso in 1946 [[British South American Airways]] commenced operation at [[Barranquilla]], using a [[Avro Lancastrian|Lancastrian]] to provide one weekly flight to [[London]] via Bermuda. The service took 26 hours and was referred to as \"The Lightning Route to Europe\". Also that year a number of special flights with DC-4 aircraft were operated from Barranquilla to Miami and New York under contract with the airline Transocean Airlines. The Aviation Company [[KLM]] (Department of the West Indies) also started operating in Barranquilla with DC-4 aircraft, giving passengers the opportunity to connect with scheduled flights to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad]]. In the early fifties [[L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Nacionales S. A. (Peru)|LANSA]] inaugurated a service from Barranquilla to [[Havana]], but never won permission to fly to Miami. However, in the sixties TAXADER establish a service to Miami, but only for a few months.\n\nSoledad Airport soon established itself as the premier international airport in Colombia and the first hub in the country. In the mid-50s Avianca built in Soledad one of the most important aviation maintenance shops in [[Latin America]], two large hangars were built to house several aircraft at once. There were workshop for propellers, hydraulics, tools, electro-mechanical systems and metal rolling. The maintenance facility also included a painting workshop, warehouse of spare parts and a technical school. The workshop was certified by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) of the United States for repair and overhaul of all types of domestic and foreign aircraft.\n\nAlso, in the early 1950s a unique system was built for loading and unloading passengers and cargo from DC-4s that drastically reduced the time required by a claimed 50%.  With this system the DC-4 taxed to where it was in a certain spot and then electric carts on rails that were flush with the runway surface moved the aircraft sideways to the unloading gangways.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Airplane Parker Speeds Operation Of Colombian Airport.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1952, p. 119.</ref>\n\nWith the opening of the [[El Dorado International Airport]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]] in December 1959, Soledad was relegated to secondary importance in the country. It was only upon the delivery of the first [[Boeing 727]] to Avianca in 1966 that the runway was extended. However, in order to appropriately handle modern jet airliners, and the resulting passenger traffic, there was a need to build a new international airport with a modern terminal, stands, larger runways and taxiways and all necessary facilities for the city of Barranquilla. There was hope that this project would put Barranquilla back on the map as an airport served by major international carriers.\n\nFinally on the afternoon of April 7, 1981, [[Julio Cesar Turbay]], president of the Republic and [[Alvaro Uribe Velez]], Chief of the [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics|Aeron\u00e1utica Civil]] dedicated Barranquilla's new international airport Ernesto Cortissoz. The new terminal, with an area of 35 thousand square meters, along with its new control tower, apron, taxiways and runway (now 3,000 meters long by 45m wide) were built north of the old Soledad Airport. The design was by architect An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez Moreno-Ripoll and the new terminal was built by the firm Paredes, Fuentes, y Vasquez Ltda. The new terminal had seven domestic gates and four international gates each with their own waiting area. The premises of the former terminal building became the cargo area.\n\nFormerly, the company ''Caribbean Airports S. A.'' \"'''''ACSA'''''\" is the operator of airport concession. ACSA was incorporated in the month of December 1996 and its main activity is the administration and economic exploitation of Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport. This status was granted by the State through the renewable concession contract, number '''''001-CON-97''''', concluded with the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics for a term of 15 years. Under this contract ACSA assumed operations on March 1, 1997. According to the contract award, administration and economic exploitation includes the provision of all airport services, maintenance and management of the terminal, runway, ramp, airport facilities, visual aids for approach and access roads. [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics|Aeron\u00e1utica Civil]] reserved management and responsibility for control and monitoring functions of en route air traffic and the proper functioning of air navigation aids, including approach, communications and other equipment intended and necessary for the proper air traffic control.\n\nErnesto Cortissoz International Airport is named after one of the most important Colombian aviation pioneers. Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa was an entrepreneur, born in Barranquilla, which along with four [[Colombia]]ns and three [[Germany|Germans]] founded  [[SCADTA]] in December 1919. On June 8, 1924 while traveling in the [[Junkers F.13]] \"Tolima\" together with other executives of the company, he died as a result of one of the first plane crashes in the country.\n\nErnesto Cortissoz International Airport is a pride for the citizens and has the potential to continue growing and become the main cargo hub in the region.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n[[Image:A320-Avianca.jpg|thumb|Avianca airbus A320 at gate 5 arriving from Miami]]\n\n=== Field ===\nThe runway has a length of 3,000 m and a width of 45 m. The approaches to both ends of the runway are categorized for instrument flight operations in precision category I.\n\nThe airport has a taxiway parallel to the runway in order to reach both ends. The three turn-offs near the center of the runway connect with the taxiway and the ramp, they are 22.5 m wide and are made of concrete.\n\n=== Ramps ===\nThe airport has three ramps for parking aircraft, they are for use by commercial passenger aircraft, cargo aircraft and military aircraft. The ramp for commercial passenger aircraft is located opposite the passenger terminal building and has 16 parking spaces. The Cargo ramp is located north of the passenger terminal, near the head of runway 23.\n\n=== Passenger terminal ===\nThe airport has one passenger terminal building to handle all of the airport's commercial traffic. There are 36 check posts, a series of shops, including a [[Duty-free shop]], and passenger cafes and restaurant. There are two restricted areas for passengers, depending on the destination of the flight (domestic or international). On the side for domestic flights are located the gates 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, each with a waiting area for passengers. For access to aircraft, four gates (6, 7, 8 and 9) have [[Jet Bridge|boarding bridges]], each with two degrees of freedom.\n\nIn the international area are the gates 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, each with a waiting area for passengers. The aircraft access is via [[Jet Bridge|jet bridges]] except for gate 1. The bridges at gates 2, 3, 4 and 5 are mobile with three degrees of freedom. Passengers claim their luggage in a room used for that purpose on the first level, it has two conveyor belts. International passengers receive their luggage in this same room after passing through the [[immigration]] area.

The airport is located in the suburban municipality of [[Soledad, Atl\u00e1ntico|Soledad]]. It owes its name to one of the pioneers of Colombian aviation, Ernesto Cortissoz.\n\nThis airport serves as a focus city for [[Avianca]]. It is capable of accepting widebodied aircraft such as the [[Boeing 747]], [[Boeing 767]], and [[Airbus A340]]. It is the most important airport in terms of infrastructure in the northern part of the country and the first in terms of cargo movements.\n\n== Description ==\nThe airport is located in the municipality of Soledad, just {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from the center of Barranquilla. It is capable of receiving widebody aircraft like the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Airbus A340. In fact, it was once the largest airport in Colombia. Currently, the airport is fifth in number of passengers and cargo room. The airport has two terminals: the domestic, with gates 6-13, and international, with gates 1-5 and 5A In July 2007, the [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics|Aeronautica Civil]] gave the airport \"open skies\" designation, this means that any airline in the world can fly to Barranquilla on any route with any frequency. This action was taken largely to promote tourism as Barranquilla is a key access point to the Caribbean.\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of commercial aviation in [[Colombia]], airport construction was in charge of each airline purporting to serve a particular city. Thus construction of major airports in Colombia fell to [[SCADTA]], including Soledad Airport.\n\nSoledad Airport soon became the main center of operations and maintenance of SCADTA for their domestic operations. International services were operated by Pan American Airways, which maintained scheduled DC-3 service, later supplemented by Boeing 307 Stratoliners, to [[Panama]], [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and [[Miami]]. In 1946 international service at Soledad Airport resumed with Avianca DC-4s, first to Miami and later to Kingston and [[New York City|New York]].\n\nAlso in 1946 [[British South American Airways]] commenced operation at [[Barranquilla]], using a [[Avro Lancastrian|Lancastrian]] to provide one weekly flight to [[London]] via Bermuda. The service took 26 hours and was referred to as \"The Lightning Route to Europe\". Also that year a number of special flights with DC-4 aircraft were operated from Barranquilla to Miami and New York under contract with the airline Transocean Airlines. The Aviation Company [[KLM]] (Department of the West Indies) also started operating in Barranquilla with DC-4 aircraft, giving passengers the opportunity to connect with scheduled flights to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad]]. In the early fifties [[L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Nacionales S. A. (Peru)|LANSA]] inaugurated a service from Barranquilla to [[Havana]], but never won permission to fly to Miami. However, in the sixties TAXADER establish a service to Miami, but only for a few months.\n\nSoledad Airport soon established itself as the premier international airport in Colombia and the first hub in the country. In the mid-50s Avianca built in Soledad one of the most important aviation maintenance shops in [[Latin America]], two large hangars were built to house several aircraft at once. There were workshop for propellers, hydraulics, tools, electro-mechanical systems and metal rolling. The maintenance facility also included a painting workshop, warehouse of spare parts and a technical school. The workshop was certified by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) of the United States for repair and overhaul of all types of domestic and foreign aircraft.\n\nAlso, in the early 1950s a unique system was built for loading and unloading passengers and cargo from DC-4s that drastically reduced the time required by a claimed 50%.  With this system the DC-4 taxed to where it was in a certain spot and then electric carts on rails that were flush with the runway surface moved the aircraft sideways to the unloading gangways.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Airplane Parker Speeds Operation Of Colombian Airport.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1952, p. 119.</ref>\n\nWith the opening of the [[El Dorado International Airport]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]] in December 1959, Soledad was relegated to secondary importance in the country. It was only upon the delivery of the first [[Boeing 727]] to Avianca in 1966 that the runway was extended. However, in order to appropriately handle modern jet airliners, and the resulting passenger traffic, there was a need to build a new international airport with a modern terminal, stands, larger runways and taxiways and all necessary facilities for the city of Barranquilla. There was hope that this project would put Barranquilla back on the map as an airport served by major international carriers.\n\nFinally on the afternoon of April 7, 1981, [[Julio Cesar Turbay]], president of the Republic and [[Alvaro Uribe Velez]], Chief of the [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics|Aeron\u00e1utica Civil]] dedicated Barranquilla's new international airport Ernesto Cortissoz. The new terminal, with an area of 35 thousand square meters, along with its new control tower, apron, taxiways and runway (now 3,000 meters long by 45m wide) were built north of the old Soledad Airport. The design was by architect An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez Moreno-Ripoll and the new terminal was built by the firm Paredes, Fuentes, y Vasquez Ltda. The new terminal had seven domestic gates and four international gates each with their own waiting area. The premises of the former terminal building became the cargo area.\n\nFormerly, the company ''Caribbean Airports S. A.'' \"'''''ACSA'''''\" is the operator of airport concession. ACSA was incorporated in the month of December 1996 and its main activity is the administration and economic exploitation of Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport. This status was granted by the State through the renewable concession contract, number '''''001-CON-97''''', concluded with the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics for a term of 15 years. Under this contract ACSA assumed operations on March 1, 1997. According to the contract award, administration and economic exploitation includes the provision of all airport services, maintenance and management of the terminal, runway, ramp, airport facilities, visual aids for approach and access roads. [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics|Aeron\u00e1utica Civil]] reserved management and responsibility for control and monitoring functions of en route air traffic and the proper functioning of air navigation aids, including approach, communications and other equipment intended and necessary for the proper air traffic control.\n\nErnesto Cortissoz International Airport is named after one of the most important Colombian aviation pioneers. Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa was an entrepreneur, born in Barranquilla, which along with four [[Colombia]]ns and three [[Germany|Germans]] founded  [[SCADTA]] in December 1919. On June 8, 1924 while traveling in the [[Junkers F.13]] \"Tolima\" together with other executives of the company, he died as a result of one of the first plane crashes in the country.\n\nErnesto Cortissoz International Airport is a pride for the citizens and has the potential to continue growing and become the main cargo hub in the region.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n[[Image:A320-Avianca.jpg|thumb|Avianca airbus A320 at gate 5 arriving from Miami]]\n\n=== Field ===\nThe runway has a length of 3,000 m and a width of 45 m. The approaches to both ends of the runway are categorized for instrument flight operations in precision category I.\n\nThe airport has a taxiway parallel to the runway in order to reach both ends. The three turn-offs near the center of the runway connect with the taxiway and the ramp, they are 22.5 m wide and are made of concrete.\n\n=== Ramps ===\nThe airport has three ramps for parking aircraft, they are for use by commercial passenger aircraft, cargo aircraft and military aircraft. The ramp for commercial passenger aircraft is located opposite the passenger terminal building and has 16 parking spaces. The Cargo ramp is located north of the passenger terminal, near the head of runway 23.\n\n=== Passenger terminal ===\nThe airport has one passenger terminal building to handle all of the airport's commercial traffic. There are 36 check posts, a series of shops, including a [[Duty-free shop]], and passenger cafes and restaurant. There are two restricted areas for passengers, depending on the destination of the flight (domestic or international). On the side for domestic flights are located the gates 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, each with a waiting area for passengers. For access to aircraft, four gates (6, 7, 8 and 9) have [[Jet Bridge|boarding bridges]], each with two degrees of freedom.\n\nIn the international area are the gates 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, each with a waiting area for passengers. The aircraft access is via [[Jet Bridge|jet bridges]] except for gate 1. The bridges at gates 2, 3, 4 and 5 are mobile with three degrees of freedom. Passengers claim their luggage in a room used for that purpose on the first level, it has two conveyor belts. International passengers receive their luggage in this same room after passing through the [[immigration]] area. After leaving the terminal building you can access the public area which houses the offices of rental car companies and the taxi waiting area.\n\n=== Cargo terminal ===\nThe cargo terminal is located northeast of the passenger terminal and has a floor area of 9,000 m\u00b2, it is the former passenger terminal building. The loading dock can accommodate up to two aircraft simultaneously. The current use of the cargo terminal does not exceed 30%.\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n=== Passenger ===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at the airport:\n\n{{Airport destination list\n| [[Albatros Airlines]] | [[Simon Bolivar International Airport (Venezuela)|Caracas]]\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] \n| [[Aruba Airlines]] | [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liu |first1=Jim |title=Aruba Airlines plans Barranquilla launch in Dec 2019 |url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/286657/aruba-airlines-plans-barranquilla-launch-in-dec-2019/ |website=Routesonline |accessdate=3 October 2019}}</ref>\n| [[Avianca]] | [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport|Medellin\u2013C\u00f3rdova]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] \n| [[Copa Airlines Colombia]] | [[Tocumen International Airport|Panama City\u2013Tocumen]] \n| [[EasyFly]] | [[Palonegro International Airport|Bucaramanga]], [[Los Garzones Airport|Monteria]], [[Alfonso L\u00f3pez Pumarejo Airport|Valledupar]] \n| [[EZAir]] | [[Cura\u00e7ao International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]]<br>'''Charter:''' [[Flamingo International Airport|Bonaire]]\n| [[Avior Airlines|Gran Colombia de Aviacion]] | [[Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n International Airport|Cali]]\n| [[Helicol]] | '''Charter:''' [[Jorge Isaacs Airport|La Mina]], [[Puerto Bol\u00edvar Airport|El Cerrej\u00f3n]]\n| [[LATAM Colombia]] | [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport|Medellin\u2013C\u00f3rdova]]\n| [[Spirit Airlines]] | [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]] (resumes April 23, 2020)<ref name=SPIRITCOL>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/01/07/spirit-airlines-announces-new-colombia-fort-lauderdale-flights/2832050001/|title=Spirit Airlines unveils new flights between Florida and Colombia|publisher=US Today|date=January 2020|accessdate=January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n| [[Viva Air Colombia]] | [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogota]], [[Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n International Airport|Cali]] (begins April 1, 2020), [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport|Medell\u00edn\u2013C\u00f3rdova]]\n| [[Wingo (Airline)|Wingo]] |[[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport|San Andr\u00e9s Island]]\n}}\n\n===Cargo===\n{{Airport-dest-list\n|[[Avianca Cargo]] | [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport|Medell\u00edn-JMC]]\n}}\n\n== Incidents ==\n* On March 17, 1995, an [[Intercontinental de Aviaci\u00f3n|Intercontinental]] [[DC-9]] was destroyed by fire while it was parked in the apron, no one was on the plane.<ref>{{ASN accident|id=19950317-0|title=17-Mar-1995}}</ref>\n* On November 19, 2006, a [[DC-10]] operated by [[Cielos Airlines]] overran the runway while landing in bad weather, All 6 crew were injured.\n* On November 21, 2006, [[Avianca]] Flight 9522 was outbound from [[Bogot\u00e1]] also overran the runway.
