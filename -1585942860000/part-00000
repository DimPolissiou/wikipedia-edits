Ciara talks him down and makes her feel that he can trust her, Ben believes her and leaves to collect his medication from the pharmacy. Someone sets the cabin on fire, Hope (Kristian Alfonso) and Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering) save Ciara from the fire and arrest Ben who swears he is innocent. Ciara hires Ted Laurent (Gilles Marini) as his attorney. Ciara invites Ben to move in the apartment with her, Tripp Dalton (Lucas Adams) and her niece Claire (Olivia Rose Keegan). She feels attracted to Ben and only sleeps with Tripp when evidence shows Ben was the one who set the fire and is arrested by Hope. Ciara breaks up with Tripp after learning he planted evidence against Ben and starts seeing Ben. Ben works for Stefan DiMera as the security head, and does the dirty work of abducting [[Gabi Hernandez]] from the DiMera mansion per Steven's order. When Ciara finds out, she breaks up with Ben and leaves Salem to visit Theo. After her return, she is abducted by [[Jordan Ridgeway]] ([[Chrishell Stause]]) from the airport and kept hostage in the Cabin, where she is tied up in bed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.soapsindepth.com/posts/days-of-our-lives-spoilers-ciara-kidnapped-169412|title=DAYS OF OUR LIVES Spoilers \u2014 Ciara Is Kidnapped!|work=[[Soaps In Depth]]|date=January 28, 2019}}</ref> Ben rescues her from the burning cabin where she was left to die by Jordan, Hope shows up with Ted and threatens to shoot Ben, when Ciara comes in between and fills her in on Jordan being guilty. Hope apologizes and thanks him for saving Ciara's life. Ciara feels sick, so Ben carries her to the hospital. Hope asks Ben to stay with Ciara before she leaves. Ciara rekindles her romance with Ben, Jordan shows up in Ciara's room and attacks Ben knocking him out. Ciara stops her, as Jordan was trying to inject him. Jordan turns on her, about to kill her but Ben saves her. Jordan is arrested, Ben and Ciara Reunite. Ciara's niece [[Claire Brady (Days of Our Lives)|Claire Brady]] is the one who set the first fire that almost killed her, when she finds out she and Tripp compose a plan to get Claire to confess, but it goes horribly wrong and Claire kidnaps Ciara and tries to kill her again. Luckily Ben, Hope and Marlena get their in time and stop her from setting another fire. Before Claire gets taken to Bayview Ciara tells her that she forgives her and loves her but they will never be like they used to. [[Victor Kiriakis]] and [[Brady Black]] offer Ciara a job at titan and she accepts. Ciara is uneven about Jordan coming back to town but Ben is determined to protect her.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/credits/character/ciara-brady Ciara\u00a0Brady at nbc.com]\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brady, Ciara}}\n[[Category:Fictional sexual assault victims]]\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of English descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Greek descent]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Fictional Greek people in television]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCasting:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 17 year old girl \u2192 17-year-old girl", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara_Brady"}

She is the third DC character to bear the name '''[[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]'''. The character was also the third incarnation of [[Batgirl]] and was a longtime member of the [[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]. In DC Comics [[New 52]] continuity, Helena Bertinelli is an alias used by [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]] while the real Helena Bertinelli is an agent of the spy organization Spyral.\n\nIn the first two seasons of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]],'' Helena Bertinelli is played by actress [[Jessica De Gouw]]. The character made her cinematic debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)]]'',<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/birds-prey-is-called-fantabulous-emancipation-one-harley-quinn-1163151|title=Margot Robbie Reveals Full 'Birds of Prey' Title: 'The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn'|website=thehollywoodreporter|date=November 20, 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}</ref> portrayed by [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]].\n\n==Publication history==\nHelena Bertinelli was introduced in her own ''Huntress'' series, written by [[Joey Cavalieri]] and drawn by [[Joe Staton]], co-creator and long-time artist of the Helena Wayne Huntress. Staton recalled, \"I think [[Paul Levitz|Paul [Levitz]]] realized that I felt my involvement with Helena had been abruptly cut short [by the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''], so I was always in line to be a part of any reworking of the character. I don\u2019t recall how Joey Cavalieri came to be the writer on the Helena Bertinelli version, but I think we did some nice work on that run. Helena Bertinelli could never have the deep resonance of Helena Wayne, because she didn\u2019t have the whole [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Batman]]/[[Catwoman]] backstory at her command, but Joey worked her into a different mythos, that of the mob, also dark, noirish\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Callahan|first= Timothy|date= February 2010 |title= The Huntress: The Daughter of the Bat and the Cat|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|pages= 71\u201378|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Origin===\n\n====''Huntress'' series====\nIn the 1989 ''Huntress'' series, Helena Bertinelli was born into one of [[Gotham City]]'s most prominent Mafia families. In this iteration of the character, she was kidnapped as a child (aged 6) and raped by a rival mafia don purely to psychologically torture her father and is a withdrawn girl. Her parents, Guido and Carmela, send her to a [[boarding school]] and assign a bodyguard for her protection where she learns all forms of combat. After she witnesses the mob-ordered murder of her parents at the age of 19, she crusades to put an end to the Mafia. She travels, accompanied and trained by her bodyguard Sal, before returning to Gotham to make her debut as the Huntress.\n\n====''Cry for Blood''====\nHuntress' origin was revised in 2000 in the six-issue ''Batman/Huntress: Cry for Blood'' limited series written by [[Greg Rucka]], art by Rick Burchett and Terry Beatty. Helena Rosa Bertinelli witnesses the murder of her entire family in their home when she is aged 8; a young Helena Rosa Bertinelli believes Franco Bertinelli to be her father, but her father is actually Santo Casamento, the don of a rival mafia family, who was carrying on an affair with Helena's mother, Maria. Helena is framed for two murders, which puts her in direct conflict with Batman and Nightwing. In an extended retreat with [[Richard Dragon]] and Vic Sage ([[Question (comics)|The Question]]), she tries to achieve better emotional balance, returning to Gotham to confront her true father and learn more about her family's murder. She faces a choice between the more ethical woman she is becoming and the earlier Helena, who still hears the vengeance call as \"blood cries for blood\".\n\n====''Huntress: Year One''====\nHuntress starred in her own six-issue biweekly ''Year One'' miniseries from May to July 2008 by [[Ivory Madison]] and [[Cliff Richards]].<ref>Steve Ekstrom IVORY MADISON: TALKING ABOUT ''HUNTRESS: YEAR ONE'' NEWSARAMA March 10, 2008 http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=149603 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204030423/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=149603 |date=2008-12-04 }}</ref> The story recounts and expands upon the beginning of Helena's vigilante career.  She is in [[Sicily]], days from turning 21 and receiving the inheritance from the murder of her family, which occurred before her eyes when she was eight years old.  Learning more about her family's murder, Helena adopts a costume disguise and weaponry to seek revenge, confronting not only the men who ordered her family's death but the assassin himself.\n\nIn the process, she establishes herself as angrier and more violent than a standard costumed hero, foreshadowing the conflicts with more mainstream heroes, predominantly Batman.  She crosses paths with [[Barbara Gordon]] (destined, like Oracle, to be a close friend and colleague), [[Catwoman]], and Batman, who will become partial mentor, partial antagonist during her subsequent career as a Gotham superhero. She states that her compulsion derives from the moment before her family was murdered when she believes she could have acted to save them. The story ends with her renouncing the Bertinelli legacy of crime and \u201c[[baptism|baptizing]]\u201d herself The Huntress.\n\n===Relationship with Batman===\n[[Batman]] rarely accepts the Huntress, regarding her as unpredictable and violent. However, when [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] questions Batman about his attitude towards the Huntress, Batman replies; \"You know exactly why I don't approve...You're not the only one she reminds of Barbara\"\u2014in reference to [[Barbara Gordon]], who had previously fought crime as Batgirl. Others in the Batman family feel differently; for instance, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] has a good relationship with her. Early in his career, he works with the female vigilante and later clears her name in a murder case.\n\nHuntress is briefly involved with the [[Justice League International]] when she happens upon a brainwashed [[Blue Beetle]] attempting to murder [[Maxwell Lord]]. The League is impressed and asks her to join.  Although League members help her on one of her own cases and she gets a tour of the group's [[New York City]] embassy, she never officially joins the team.\n\nDuring the League's restructuring following the ''Rock of Ages'' crisis, Batman sponsors Huntress' membership in the [[Justice League]],<ref>'' JLA Secret Files'' #2</ref> hoping that the influence of other heroes will mellow the Huntress, and for some time, Huntress is a respected member of the League.  Under the guidance of heroes such as [[Superman]], Helena grows in confidence, even playing a key role in defeating [[Solaris (comics)|Solaris]] during the ''[[DC One Million]]'' storyline; inspired by the time capsules students in her class had been making, she realizes they had over 800 centuries to set up a plan that would result in Solaris's defeat in the future. She also helps the League defeat foes like [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]] and encourages [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]] to fight the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]]'s hypno-pollen during her invasion of Earth. She is later forced to resign after Batman stops her from killing Prometheus while he is incapacitated.<ref>''JLA'' #40</ref>\n\n===Career in Gotham===\n\n====''No Man's Land''====\nIn the 1999 ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline, an [[earthquake]] levels [[Gotham City]]. The [[United States]] government declares Gotham City a \"No Man's Land,\" and Batman disappears.  To bring order to the city, Huntress assumes the mantle of [[Batgirl#Helena Bertinelli|Batgirl]], and she discovers criminals fear her more as Batgirl than they do as Huntress.<ref>''Batman: No Man's Land'' #0</ref> Batgirl fails to protect Batman's territory from [[Two-Face]] and his gang of more than 200 criminals, leading to an argument between her and Batman.  Huntress refuses to follow Batman's exact orders and gives up the Batgirl costume.<ref>''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' #120</ref>\n\nHuntress teams with former police officer Petit and his men, who had broken off from the group led by former commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. Petit believed that extreme force was the only way to survive No Man's Land. Batman intentionally drove Huntress to join Petit, knowing she could keep Petit in line and prevent him from hurting innocent people. On Christmas Eve, [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] attacks Petit's compound. Petit is killed and the Huntress stands her ground, barely surviving the attack as the Joker and his men overrun the compound. Batman and Nightwing intervene in time and Huntress is taken to a field hospital operated by forces who want to rebuild Gotham City.\n\n====Birds of Prey and the Outsiders====\n\nHuntress becomes involved with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] and [[Black Canary]] in the comic series ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]''. She bonds with Black Canary when they oppose a man called Braun, who had seduced and left them both. Huntress continues to work with the group, although her relationship with Oracle is strained and sometimes antagonistic due to Huntress' recklessness and Barbara's controlling nature.\n\nShe is made one of Oracle's full-time agents in ''Birds of Prey'' #68, after responding immediately to Barbara's intercepted call for help (intended for [[Black Canary|Dinah Lance]]). With two active agents on rotation, the lighter workload allows for Oracle to set up day jobs for Huntress and Black Canary; as an elementary school teacher and florist, respectively. The realization of her childhood dream of teaching gives Helena a great sense of fulfillment and inspires her stronger sense of protectiveness. For a time her straightforwardness continues to put her at odds with Barbara and even the accommodating Dinah, but eventually, her selflessness and desire to help her colleagues without hesitation win their trust, and she becomes a valued and integral member of the team.\n\nDuring the ''Birds of Prey'' \"Hero Hunters\" arc, Huntress realizes Oracle has been manipulating her psychologically in order to make her \"behave\" properly, in the same way, a teacher attempts to reform a troubled child <ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Simone, Gail | title=Birds of Prey | issue=80 | date=May 2005 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> and leaves the group. She later rejoins along with newcomer [[Lady Blackhawk]] who becomes another core member for the team. Upon Black Canary's departure of the team in Birds of Prey #99, Huntress becomes Oracle's most senior and trusted operative and field commander.\n\nHuntress appeared in the ''Hush'' storyline. She saves Batman's life from a criminal gang after he suffers a fractured skull in a fall. Batman realizes that she is \"so much like I was when I started out\", and \"she's better than she knows...\"  In the story, Huntress continues a feud with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]]. She later appears with a new costume and equipment, paid for by [[Hush (comics)|Thomas Elliot]]. While under the influence of Scarecrow's fear toxin, she fights [[Catwoman]], thinking her to be her old self and wants to be more like the Dark Knight.\n\nHuntress is asked to fill in an empty spot for the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] after [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] sustains major injuries on a mission.<ref>''Outsiders'' #8</ref> She leaves the team after just one mission.<ref>''Outsiders'' #12</ref>\n\n====''One Year Later''====\nIn 2006, the narratives of most DC Comics superhero series skipped [[One Year Later|one year]]. In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' stories, Huntress works with Oracle's group. With Black Canary's departure from the team (issue #99), in issue #100 Huntress becomes the team's field commander.\n\nHuntress later returns to Gotham after the Birds disband, aiding Cassandra Cain in maintaining order after Gotham descends into chaos during the midst of the ''Battle for the Cowl'' event.\n\nJoined by Lady Blackhawk and [[Grace Choi]], Huntress later assists her then love interest [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and his team the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] in a massive supervillain battle to steal [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]]'s ''Get Out Of Hell Free Card''.<ref>''Secret Six'' (Vol. 2) #7</ref>\n\n====''Brightest Day''====\nDuring the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' event, Oracle gathers the Birds of Prey back together in Gotham. In addition to getting the band back together, Oracle adds Hawk and Dove to the team.  Huntress aids Black Canary (who had now left the Justice League), in a battle against a new villainess calling herself the White Canary.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (Volume 2) #1-2</ref> The Birds soon strike up an uneasy alliance with [[the Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]], who ultimately betrays them and severely injures Zinda and [[Hank Hall|Hawk]]. He attempts to kill Huntress as well, but she and [[Dawn Granger#Holly and Dawn Granger|Dove]] easily defeat him.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (Volume 2) #4</ref> While Dove takes Hawk and Zinda to a hospital, Huntress binds and gags the Penguin with duct tape, intending to take the villain prisoner in order to interrogate him. After being informed by Oracle that she has to leave the Penguin behind, Huntress considers murdering him in cold blood, but instead opts to leave him alive.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (Volume 2) #5</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, in the relaunch issue of ''[[Worlds' Finest]]'', the Huntress is [[Helena Wayne]] from [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]. The Helena Bertinelli Huntress did exist but has been long dead, with all her exploits having been committed by Helena Wayne acting in her name.\n\n[[File:New 52 Helena Bertinelli.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|Helena Bertinelli of Earth Prime on the cover of ''Grayson Annual #1'' (February 2015).

This incarnation of the character is a dark skinned Italian woman to keep readers from confusing her with  Helena Wayne of Earth 2 according to ''Grayson'' series writer Tim Seeley.<ref>Rogers, Vaneta. \"SPOILERS!

Helena is described as \"the most wanted woman in the world,\" the granddaughter of Frank Bertinelli and the heir to \"the entire Sicilian mob\", who \"disappeared\" five years ago; her disappearance is legendary among criminals.\n\nIn the ''Agent of Spyral'' storyline she is the Matron of St. Hadrian's Boarding School for girls and a teacher herself. She rescues Leslie Thompsons from a raid by the Der Faust Die Kane (translating to \"The Fist of Cain\"), a depopulation terrorist cult made up of serial killers and hitmen.<ref>Nightwing (Vol. 2) #30</ref> During an interrogation, both the director of Spyral Minos and Helena learn of Batman's secret identity. Later, she is the individual that picks Dick Grayson as a candidate to join Spyral. Minos then enlists Dick Grayson as Agent 37 and Helena's partner.  Both are tasked with the duty of retrieving the Paragon Organs, which formerly belonged to Paragon. Each organ grants a different power of the Justice League; however, these organs are also highly sought by other intelligence organizations such as A.R.G.U.S and Checkmate. Both she and her partner run into [[Midnighter]], who attempts to foil Spyral's current agenda.<ref>, Grayson (Vol. 1) #1-4, Annual #1; Secret Origins #8</ref>\n\nMinos sends Helena and Dick to retrieve Paragon's brain, which holds Martian Manhunter's telepathic abilities, but they are too late. Dick later disappears and Helena learns that the Fist of Cain took the Brain and plans to unleash a psychic attack at a peace rally in Tel-Aviv and force people to kill each other. As she makes her way to Tel-Aviv, she later learns of her partner's fate with the use of Spyral's immense technological capabilities with Hypnos and informs them to send the current plans to Midnighter. As she arrives, she finds herself under psychic attack and due to the stress of previously using Hypnos to interrogate and locate her lost partner, she overworks herself. However, Dick and Midnighter assist. As Helena does her best to stop the crowd from killing each other, she ends up nearly killed by the Fist of Cain's leader, Christian Fleisher. She is saved by what appears to be Mister Minos. After the plan is foiled and Spyral retrieves the brain, she comments that she had various memory gaps from overworking herself mentally. Later, as part of Minos's endgame to out the secrets of Spyral, he shoots her with her own crossbow in an attempt to kill her. She survives and informs Grayson of Minos's plan to kill fellow Spyral Agent 1 (also \"Tiger\"). After Grayson rescues Agent 1, she reappears and seemingly kills the Minos, unaware that she actually killed a light composite of the real thing.<ref>, Grayson (Vol. 1) 5-8</ref>\n\n[[File:Huntressrebirth.png|thumbnail|upright|Helena Bertinelli as Huntress on the cover of ''Batgirl and the Birds of Prey'' #6.

Grayson and Bertinelli were pawns in the twisted mind of Dr. Otto Netz, who used his two daughters to play the world's super-espionage agencies against each other in a bid to take over the body of someone he considered a worthy receptacle. Initially choosing Bertinelli, Netz then attacked Grayson's mind, but Grayson destroyed the villain mentally. In the aftermath, and as part of the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' event, Helena left Spyral and assumed the mantle of Huntress, appearing in ''Batgirl and the Birds of Prey''.<ref>Batgirl and the Birds of Prey Rebirth #1</ref>\n\n===Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nAt the beginning of the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' era, Helena takes the name of Huntress and crosses paths with Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) and Black Canary (Dinah Lance) in Gotham City.  Issue 4 details her origin story as a mafia princess seeking revenge for her family's murders, and she is now tracking Santo Cassamento, who masterminded the murders. She works with the Birds of Prey to track down an impostor who is masquerading as Oracle, Batgirl's former hacker alias. Soon after, she discovers her mother, Maria Bertinelli has survived that fateful night and was now in charge of the operation, who tells her what had really happened: Maria had fallen in love with Santo, and wanting to get away from her husband, she and Santo organized his murder, but Santo went ahead and killed Helena's older brother as well, much to Maria's grief, and she also vowed revenge. Upon hearing this, Helena decideds not to kill Santo, but arrests him and Maria, who had become a powerful crime boss. After the arrest, Helena joins the Birds of Prey, and becomes a new teacher at a local school.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Huntress joined with the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]' [[Female Furies|Furies]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Earth 2''===\n{{Main article|Huntress (Helena Wayne)}}\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Helena is a member of Batman's insurgency, that combats Superman's One-Earth regime, she was very close to Kate Kane and Renee Montoya, Helena is killed in a battle against Wonder Woman, thus angering Kate and strengthening her resolve to fight the regime.

Instead, the two decide to get the aggression out of their systems by going one last round, the winner being determined by 'two falls out of three'.\n\n[[File:Huntress_BBATB.jpg|thumb|Huntress in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'']]\n* The Helena Bertinelli version of Huntress appeared in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]].

Some time before the show takes place, Helena, who was engaged to a man named Michael Staton, had been negotiating with the FBI to bring her father to justice. She put all her information on a laptop, which her father found. Believing that the laptop belonged to Helena's fianc\u00e9e, Frank had Michael killed.

Helena dedicated herself to becoming an assassin to avenge her family's deaths, returning to Gotham to eliminate the hitmen who killed her family, running into the other heroes when she kills Victor Zsasz - the last hitman - only to be informed that the person who truly organised the hit was Roman Sionis. While she is shown to be a lethally efficient assassin, she lacks the dramatic flair she feels she needs to introduce herself to her targets, leading to her dismay when she learns she is only known as \"the Crossbow Killer\".

After she witnesses the mob-ordered murder of her parents at the age of 19, she crusades to put an end to the Mafia. She travels, accompanied and trained by her bodyguard Sal, before returning to Gotham to make her debut as the Huntress.\n\n====''Cry for Blood''====\nHuntress' origin was revised in 2000 in the six-issue ''Batman/Huntress: Cry for Blood'' limited series written by [[Greg Rucka]], art by Rick Burchett and Terry Beatty. Helena Rosa Bertinelli witnesses the murder of her entire family in their home when she is aged 8; a young Helena Rosa Bertinelli believes Franco Bertinelli to be her father, but her father is actually Santo Casamento, the don of a rival mafia family, who was carrying on an affair with Helena's mother, Maria. Helena is framed for two murders, which puts her in direct conflict with Batman and Nightwing. In an extended retreat with [[Richard Dragon]] and Vic Sage ([[Question (comics)|The Question]]), she tries to achieve better emotional balance, returning to Gotham to confront her true father and learn more about her family's murder. She faces a choice between the more ethical woman she is becoming and the earlier Helena, who still hears the vengeance call as \"blood cries for blood\".\n\n====''Huntress: Year One''====\nHuntress starred in her own six-issue biweekly ''Year One'' miniseries from May to July 2008 by [[Ivory Madison]] and [[Cliff Richards]].<ref>Steve Ekstrom IVORY MADISON: TALKING ABOUT ''HUNTRESS: YEAR ONE'' NEWSARAMA March 10, 2008 http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=149603 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204030423/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=149603 |date=2008-12-04 }}</ref> The story recounts and expands upon the beginning of Helena's vigilante career.  She is in [[Sicily]], days from turning 21 and receiving the inheritance from the murder of her family, which occurred before her eyes when she was eight years old.  Learning more about her family's murder, Helena adopts a costume disguise and weaponry to seek revenge, confronting not only the men who ordered her family's death but the assassin himself.\n\nIn the process, she establishes herself as angrier and more violent than a standard costumed hero, foreshadowing the conflicts with more mainstream heroes, predominantly Batman.  She crosses paths with [[Barbara Gordon]] (destined, like Oracle, to be a close friend and colleague), [[Catwoman]], and Batman, who will become partial mentor, partial antagonist during her subsequent career as a Gotham superhero. She states that her compulsion derives from the moment before her family was murdered when she believes she could have acted to save them. The story ends with her renouncing the Bertinelli legacy of crime and \u201c[[baptism|baptizing]]\u201d herself The Huntress.\n\n===Relationship with Batman===\n[[Batman]] rarely accepts the Huntress, regarding her as unpredictable and violent. However, when [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] questions Batman about his attitude towards the Huntress, Batman replies; \"You know exactly why I don't approve...You're not the only one she reminds of Barbara\"\u2014in reference to [[Barbara Gordon]], who had previously fought crime as Batgirl. Others in the Batman family feel differently; for instance, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] has a good relationship with her. Early in his career, he works with the female vigilante and later clears her name in a murder case.\n\nHuntress is briefly involved with the [[Justice League International]] when she happens upon a brainwashed [[Blue Beetle]] attempting to murder [[Maxwell Lord]]. The League is impressed and asks her to join.  Although League members help her on one of her own cases and she gets a tour of the group's [[New York City]] embassy, she never officially joins the team.\n\nDuring the League's restructuring following the ''Rock of Ages'' crisis, Batman sponsors Huntress' membership in the [[Justice League]],<ref>'' JLA Secret Files'' #2</ref> hoping that the influence of other heroes will mellow the Huntress, and for some time, Huntress is a respected member of the League.  Under the guidance of heroes such as [[Superman]], Helena grows in confidence, even playing a key role in defeating [[Solaris (comics)|Solaris]] during the ''[[DC One Million]]'' storyline; inspired by the time capsules students in her class had been making, she realizes they had over 800 centuries to set up a plan that would result in Solaris's defeat in the future. She also helps the League defeat foes like [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]] and encourages [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]] to fight the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]]'s hypno-pollen during her invasion of Earth. She is later forced to resign after Batman stops her from killing Prometheus while he is incapacitated.<ref>''JLA'' #40</ref>\n\n===Career in Gotham===\n\n====''No Man's Land''====\nIn the 1999 ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline, an [[earthquake]] levels [[Gotham City]]. The [[United States]] government declares Gotham City a \"No Man's Land,\" and Batman disappears.  To bring order to the city, Huntress assumes the mantle of [[Batgirl#Helena Bertinelli|Batgirl]], and she discovers criminals fear her more as Batgirl than they do as Huntress.<ref>''Batman: No Man's Land'' #0</ref> Batgirl fails to protect Batman's territory from [[Two-Face]] and his gang of more than 200 criminals, leading to an argument between her and Batman.  Huntress refuses to follow Batman's exact orders and gives up the Batgirl costume.<ref>''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' #120</ref>\n\nHuntress teams with former police officer Petit and his men, who had broken off from the group led by former commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. Petit believed that extreme force was the only way to survive No Man's Land. Batman intentionally drove Huntress to join Petit, knowing she could keep Petit in line and prevent him from hurting innocent people. On Christmas Eve, [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] attacks Petit's compound. Petit is killed and the Huntress stands her ground, barely surviving the attack as the Joker and his men overrun the compound. Batman and Nightwing intervene in time and Huntress is taken to a field hospital operated by forces who want to rebuild Gotham City.\n\n====Birds of Prey and the Outsiders====\n\nHuntress becomes involved with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] and [[Black Canary]] in the comic series ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]''. She bonds with Black Canary when they oppose a man called Braun, who had seduced and left them both. Huntress continues to work with the group, although her relationship with Oracle is strained and sometimes antagonistic due to Huntress' recklessness and Barbara's controlling nature.\n\nShe is made one of Oracle's full-time agents in ''Birds of Prey'' #68, after responding immediately to Barbara's intercepted call for help (intended for [[Black Canary|Dinah Lance]]). With two active agents on rotation, the lighter workload allows for Oracle to set up day jobs for Huntress and Black Canary; as an elementary school teacher and florist, respectively. The realization of her childhood dream of teaching gives Helena a great sense of fulfillment and inspires her stronger sense of protectiveness. For a time her straightforwardness continues to put her at odds with Barbara and even the accommodating Dinah, but eventually, her selflessness and desire to help her colleagues without hesitation win their trust, and she becomes a valued and integral member of the team.\n\nDuring the ''Birds of Prey'' \"Hero Hunters\" arc, Huntress realizes Oracle has been manipulating her psychologically in order to make her \"behave\" properly, in the same way, a teacher attempts to reform a troubled child <ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Simone, Gail | title=Birds of Prey | issue=80 | date=May 2005 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> and leaves the group. She later rejoins along with newcomer [[Lady Blackhawk]] who becomes another core member for the team. Upon Black Canary's departure of the team in Birds of Prey #99, Huntress becomes Oracle's most senior and trusted operative and field commander.\n\nHuntress appeared in the ''Hush'' storyline. She saves Batman's life from a criminal gang after he suffers a fractured skull in a fall. Batman realizes that she is \"so much like I was when I started out\", and \"she's better than she knows...\"  In the story, Huntress continues a feud with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]]. She later appears with a new costume and equipment, paid for by [[Hush (comics)|Thomas Elliot]]. While under the influence of Scarecrow's fear toxin, she fights [[Catwoman]], thinking her to be her old self and wants to be more like the Dark Knight.\n\nHuntress is asked to fill in an empty spot for the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] after [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] sustains major injuries on a mission.<ref>''Outsiders'' #8</ref> She leaves the team after just one mission.<ref>''Outsiders'' #12</ref>\n\n====''One Year Later''====\nIn 2006, the narratives of most DC Comics superhero series skipped [[One Year Later|one year]]. In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' stories, Huntress works with Oracle's group. With Black Canary's departure from the team (issue #99), in issue #100 Huntress becomes the team's field commander.\n\nHuntress later returns to Gotham after the Birds disband, aiding Cassandra Cain in maintaining order after Gotham descends into chaos during the midst of the ''Battle for the Cowl'' event.\n\nJoined by Lady Blackhawk and [[Grace Choi]], Huntress later assists her then love interest [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and his team the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] in a massive supervillain battle to steal [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]]'s ''Get Out Of Hell Free Card''.<ref>''Secret Six'' (Vol. 2) #7</ref>\n\n====''Brightest Day''====\nDuring the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' event, Oracle gathers the Birds of Prey back together in Gotham. In addition to getting the band back together, Oracle adds Hawk and Dove to the team.  Huntress aids Black Canary (who had now left the Justice League), in a battle against a new villainess calling herself the White Canary.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (Volume 2) #1-2</ref> The Birds soon strike up an uneasy alliance with [[the Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]], who ultimately betrays them and severely injures Zinda and [[Hank Hall|Hawk]]. He attempts to kill Huntress as well, but she and [[Dawn Granger#Holly and Dawn Granger|Dove]] easily defeat him.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (Volume 2) #4</ref> While Dove takes Hawk and Zinda to a hospital, Huntress binds and gags the Penguin with duct tape, intending to take the villain prisoner in order to interrogate him. After being informed by Oracle that she has to leave the Penguin behind, Huntress considers murdering him in cold blood, but instead opts to leave him alive.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (Volume 2) #5</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, in the relaunch issue of ''[[Worlds' Finest]]'', the Huntress is [[Helena Wayne]] from [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]. The Helena Bertinelli Huntress did exist but has been long dead, with all her exploits having been committed by Helena Wayne acting in her name.\n\n[[File:New 52 Helena Bertinelli.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|Helena Bertinelli of Earth Prime on the cover of ''Grayson Annual #1'' (February 2015). Art by Mikel Jan\u00edn.]]\nIn May 2014, writers [[Tim Seeley]] and Tom King of the DC series ''Grayson'', revealed that a new Prime Earth Helena Bertinelli will be in The New 52 continuity, appearing in the series as a spy and partner of [[Dick Grayson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/21124-grayson-creators-super-spy-dick-will-carry-gun-have-a-surprise-partner.html|title=GRAYSON Creators: Super-Spy DICK WILL Carry Gun, Have a Surprise Partner|last=Rodgers|first=Vaneta|publisher=Newsarama|date=May 14, 2014|accessdate=May 15, 2014}}</ref> Prime Earth's Helena Bertinelli is revealed to be an agent of the organization Spyral, who is ''presumed'' dead by the outside world. This incarnation of the character is a dark skinned Italian woman to keep readers from confusing her with  Helena Wayne of Earth 2 according to ''Grayson'' series writer Tim Seeley.<ref>Rogers, Vaneta. \"SPOILERS! GRAYSON Writers Establish HELENA & DICK's New Status Quo & MIDNIGHTER's Role.\"10 July 2014. Web. 23 July 2014.  Newsarama.com. http://www.newsarama.com/21536-spoilers-grayson-writers-establish-helena-dick-s-new-status-quo-talks-that-surprise-cast-member.html</ref> Her origin is expanded on in ''Grayson Annual'' #1 (February 2015). Helena is described as \"the most wanted woman in the world,\" the granddaughter of Frank Bertinelli and the heir to \"the entire Sicilian mob\", who \"disappeared\" five years ago; her disappearance is legendary among criminals.\n\nIn the ''Agent of Spyral'' storyline she is the Matron of St. Hadrian's Boarding School for girls and a teacher herself. She rescues Leslie Thompsons from a raid by the Der Faust Die Kane (translating to \"The Fist of Cain\"), a depopulation terrorist cult made up of serial killers and hitmen.<ref>Nightwing (Vol. 2) #30</ref> During an interrogation, both the director of Spyral Minos and Helena learn of Batman's secret identity. Later, she is the individual that picks Dick Grayson as a candidate to join Spyral. Minos then enlists Dick Grayson as Agent 37 and Helena's partner.  Both are tasked with the duty of retrieving the Paragon Organs, which formerly belonged to Paragon. Each organ grants a different power of the Justice League; however, these organs are also highly sought by other intelligence organizations such as A.R.G.U.S and Checkmate. Both she and her partner run into [[Midnighter]], who attempts to foil Spyral's current agenda.<ref>, Grayson (Vol. 1) #1-4, Annual #1; Secret Origins #8</ref>\n\nMinos sends Helena and Dick to retrieve Paragon's brain, which holds Martian Manhunter's telepathic abilities, but they are too late. Dick later disappears and Helena learns that the Fist of Cain took the Brain and plans to unleash a psychic attack at a peace rally in Tel-Aviv and force people to kill each other. As she makes her way to Tel-Aviv, she later learns of her partner's fate with the use of Spyral's immense technological capabilities with Hypnos and informs them to send the current plans to Midnighter. As she arrives, she finds herself under psychic attack and due to the stress of previously using Hypnos to interrogate and locate her lost partner, she overworks herself. However, Dick and Midnighter assist. As Helena does her best to stop the crowd from killing each other, she ends up nearly killed by the Fist of Cain's leader, Christian Fleisher. She is saved by what appears to be Mister Minos. After the plan is foiled and Spyral retrieves the brain, she comments that she had various memory gaps from overworking herself mentally. Later, as part of Minos's endgame to out the secrets of Spyral, he shoots her with her own crossbow in an attempt to kill her. She survives and informs Grayson of Minos's plan to kill fellow Spyral Agent 1 (also \"Tiger\"). After Grayson rescues Agent 1, she reappears and seemingly kills the Minos, unaware that she actually killed a light composite of the real thing.<ref>, Grayson (Vol. 1) 5-8</ref>\n\n[[File:Huntressrebirth.png|thumbnail|upright|Helena Bertinelli as Huntress on the cover of ''Batgirl and the Birds of Prey'' #6.

Grayson and Bertinelli were pawns in the twisted mind of Dr. Otto Netz, who used his two daughters to play the world's super-espionage agencies against each other in a bid to take over the body of someone he considered a worthy receptacle. Initially choosing Bertinelli, Netz then attacked Grayson's mind, but Grayson destroyed the villain mentally. In the aftermath, and as part of the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' event, Helena left Spyral and assumed the mantle of Huntress, appearing in ''Batgirl and the Birds of Prey''.<ref>Batgirl and the Birds of Prey Rebirth #1</ref>\n\n===Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nAt the beginning of the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' era, Helena takes the name of Huntress and crosses paths with Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) and Black Canary (Dinah Lance) in Gotham City.  Issue 4 details her origin story as a mafia princess seeking revenge for her family's murders, and she is now tracking Santo Cassamento, who masterminded the murders. She works with the Birds of Prey to track down an impostor who is masquerading as Oracle, Batgirl's former hacker alias. Soon after, she discovers her mother, Maria Bertinelli has survived that fateful night and was now in charge of the operation, who tells her what had really happened: Maria had fallen in love with Santo, and wanting to get away from her husband, she and Santo organized his murder, but Santo went ahead and killed Helena's older brother as well, much to Maria's grief, and she also vowed revenge. Upon hearing this, Helena decideds not to kill Santo, but arrests him and Maria, who had become a powerful crime boss. After the arrest, Helena joins the Birds of Prey, and becomes a new teacher at a local school.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Huntress joined with the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]' [[Female Furies|Furies]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Earth 2''===\n{{Main article|Huntress (Helena Wayne)}}\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Helena is a member of Batman's insurgency, that combats Superman's One-Earth regime, she was very close to Kate Kane and Renee Montoya, Helena is killed in a battle against Wonder Woman, thus angering Kate and strengthening her resolve to fight the regime.

Instead, the two decide to get the aggression out of their systems by going one last round, the winner being determined by 'two falls out of three'.\n\n[[File:Huntress_BBATB.jpg|thumb|Huntress in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'']]\n* The Helena Bertinelli version of Huntress appeared in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]].

Introduced in the [[Arrow (season 1)|season one]] episodes \"Muse of Fire\" and \"Vendetta\", she is depicted as the daughter of high-profile mobster Frank Bertinelli. Some time before the show takes place, Helena, who was engaged to a man named Michael Staton, had been negotiating with the FBI to bring her father to justice. She put all her information on a laptop, which her father found. Believing that the laptop belonged to Helena's fianc\u00e9e, Frank had Michael killed. Since then, Helena has been systematically destroying her father's organization. While trying to kill a corrupt man working for her father, she nearly kills [[Moira Queen (Arrowverse)|Moira Queen]]. [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] tracks Helena and learns of her secret identity as a vigilante with her own cause. He starts dating her in order to learn more about her motives.

Helena dedicated herself to becoming an assassin to avenge her family's deaths, returning to Gotham to eliminate the hitmen who killed her family, running into the other heroes when she kills Victor Zsasz - the last hitman - only to be informed that the person who truly organised the hit was Roman Sionis. While she is shown to be a lethally efficient assassin, she lacks the dramatic flair she feels she needs to introduce herself to her targets, leading to her dismay when she learns she is only known as \"the Crossbow Killer\".
