This chapter deals with special powers which exist as well as the powers available under Chapter 2. \"The Governor\u2011General may make a human biosecurity emergency declaration if the Health Minister is satisfied that the special powers in this Part are needed to deal with a human biosecurity emergency. The Health Minister may exercise special powers under this Part to deal with a human biosecurity emergency, subject to limits and protections. These powers may be exercised anywhere in Australian territory.\"<ref name=bioact2019/>\n\nSimilar emergency powers are given to the Governor-General and Agriculture Minister for other types of biosecurity emergencies, in Chapter 8, Par 1. In addition, the Agriculture Minister may \"declare Commonwealth bodies, or parts of Commonwealth bodies, to be national response agencies for the purposes of dealing with biosecurity emergencies\", and some of the Minister's powers may be delegated to staff in the national response agencies.<ref name=bioact2019/>\n\n===2020 invocation of state of emergency===\n{{also|Biosecurity in Australia#2020: Coronavirus}}\nOn 18 March 2020,<ref name=decl/> a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the [[2020 coronavirus  pandemic in Australia]], after the [[National Security Committee (Australia)|National Security Committee]] met the previous day.

There are chapters which cover management of risks in several areas, including:<ref name=bioact2019/>\n*Risks to human health. Human diseases listed in a legislative instrument are the main focus, but there are also requirements relating to people entering or leaving Australian territory as well as rules relating to managing deceased people.\n*Goods that are brought into Australian territory from outside Australian territory, by air or by sea. It also provides for prohibition of or conditions relating to certain goods from being brought or imported into Australian territory.\n*Aircraft and vessels entering Australian territory from outside Australian territory, including controlling landing or mooring places and their movement while they are in Australian territory.\n*Implementation of the Ballast Water Convention, which regulates the [[ballast water]] and [[sediment]] of certain vessels, in accordance with the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].\n*Other biosecurity risks which may be posed by diseases or pests in or on goods or premises in Australian territory.\n*Arrangements to enable biosecurity officials to carry out biosecurity activities to manage biosecurity risks associated with goods, premises or other things.\n*Provision for the [[Governor-General of Australia]] to declare [[state of emergency|biosecurity emergencies and human biosecurity emergencies]]; provision for special powers for the Agriculture Minister to deal with biosecurity emergencies (including the delegation of certain powers to national response agencies; and provision for special powers to be given to the Health Minister to deal with human biosecurity emergencies, including by effecting the recommendations of the [[World Health Organization]].\n*Provision for powers for biosecurity officers powers to ensure people are complying with this Act, to investigate non\u2011compliance and to enforce this Act by means such as civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and injunctions and other means.\n*Governance is described, including the functions and powers of the Director of Biosecurity, Director of Human Biosecurity, and various types of biosecurity officers.\n==Biosecurity emergencies==\n\nChapter 8, Part 2 of the Act deals with \"emergencies involving threats or harm to human health on a nationally significant scale\".  This chapter deals with special powers which exist as well as the powers available under Chapter 2. \"The Governor\u2011General may make a human biosecurity emergency declaration if the Health Minister is satisfied that the special powers in this Part are needed to deal with a human biosecurity emergency. The Health Minister may exercise special powers under this Part to deal with a human biosecurity emergency, subject to limits and protections. These powers may be exercised anywhere in Australian territory.\"<ref name=bioact2019/>\n\nSimilar emergency powers are given to the Governor-General and Agriculture Minister for other types of biosecurity emergencies, in Chapter 8, Par 1. In addition, the Agriculture Minister may \"declare Commonwealth bodies, or parts of Commonwealth bodies, to be national response agencies for the purposes of dealing with biosecurity emergencies\", and some of the Minister's powers may be delegated to staff in the national response agencies.<ref name=bioact2019/>\n\n===2020 invocation of state of emergency===\n{{also|Biosecurity in Australia#2020: Coronavirus}}\nOn 18 March 2020,<ref name=decl/> a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the [[2020 coronavirus  pandemic in Australia]], after the [[National Security Committee (Australia)|National Security Committee]] met the previous day.

However, many Turks pronounce it differently as \"Selam\u00fcn aleyk\u00fcm\".\n* In [[Pakistan]], the greeting is also associated with shaking right hands and is also often accompanied with a hug when meeting infrequently (only between the same gender). In some places, people put a hand on their heart as they shake your hand and greet. Also, the full greeting is preferred versus the shorter greeting, \"salam\". Goodbye is supplanted by a \"Khuda Hafiz\" (secular/less formal or to an acquaintance) or \"Allah Hafiz\" (less secular/generally to strangers, formal), both of which mean \"May God keep you safe\".\n* In [[India]], the greeting mostly among Muslims is accompanied by raising the right hand to the chest (arz hai \"regards\"; adaab \"respect\") or a simple handshake or hug, the shorter greeting \"Salam\" is used in informal situations. Goodbye is supplanted by a \"Khuda hafiz\" (secular/less formal or to an acquaintance) or \"Allah hafiz\" (less secular/generally to strangers, formal), both of which mean \"May God keep you safe\".\n* In [[Bangladesh]], Assalamu alaykum is a simple greeting.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/audio/languagelessons/bangladesh/BD_Bangla_Language_Lessons.pdf |title=Introduction to the bangla language |work=[[Peace Corps]] |page=6 |access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref>\n* In [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]], Assalomu aleykum is used as an informal greeting.\n* In [[Indonesia]], the greeting is usually{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} accompanied with a kind of two-handed \"handshake\", whereby the shaker's palms remain closed, and the fingers alone open to admit the other's proffered hand \u2013 which briefly touches the proffered's fingers or fingertips alone. In this way more adherent males and females may greet though touching \u2013 but remain true to the [[Islam]]ic or cultural teachings forbidding physical contact between the genders. Occasionally, the right hand will touch the left breast or heart area after this.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Indonesia's [[Javanese people|Javanese/Sasak]] culture, a remnant of feudalism is retained, where an elder's proffered right hand is taken and pressed briefly against the forehead. Some may instead briefly kiss the hand or the main ring. This is very common for young children to greet older relatives (of their parents' age, though, on occasion, if very polite children, younger). In slang words, this greeting is sometimes referred as \"samlekom\".\n* Shortening the greeting to acronyms, such as ''A.S.'', ''As'kum'' (in [[Malaysia]]), or ''AsA'' is becoming common amongst Internet users in chat rooms and by people using [[Short Message Service|SMS]] (some scholar forbid to used these shortcut due to no meaning or improper word){{citation needed}}. This trend is similar to writing (S) or SAWS in place of [[Peace be upon him (Islam)|''\u1e63all\u0101 ll\u0101hu \u02bfalayhi wa-sallam'']].\n* In [[Chechnya]] and other parts of Caucasus, Salam Aleykum is used to say hi.\n* In [[Senegal]] which has a majority of Islam with [[Sufi]]-orientation, it is a common greeting. Spelled and pronounced in [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: \"(a)sala maaleykum\", and the reply \"maa lekum salaam.\"\n* In [[Xinjiang, China]], \"Essalam eleykum\" is used as a greeting by [[Uyghurs]], and the reply is \"We'eleykum essalam\".\n* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the expression \"[[wikt:salamaleque|salamaleque]]\" gained a totally distinct and curious meaning: because of the habit of Arabic cultures to bow down and wave the hand from the front ahead in greeting a person, the expression \"salamaleque\" is applied to exaggerated movements or acts in order to appear to be formal or entertaining or even fancy. \"Os rapazes chegaram cheios de salamaleques\". \"Salamelecco\" has the same meaning also in [[Italian language|Italian]].\n* In Israel or among Hebrew speakers, ''[[Shalom aleichem]]'' {{lang-he-n|\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd}} ''sh\u0101l\u00f4m \u02bbal\u00ea\u1e35em'')<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|shalom aleichem|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/amp/english/shalom-aleichem|title=shalom aleichem|work=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}</ref> is a greeting in meaning \"peace be upon you.\" The response is ''aleichem shalom'' (\"unto you peace\") ({{lang-he-n|\u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd}}).<ref>{{Dictionary.com|shalom aleichem |publisher=|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Hello |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1582771/jewish/The-Jewish-Hello.htm |publisher=[[Chabad.org]] |author=Dovid Zaklikowski |access-date=July 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Islam}}\n* [[Peace be upon him]]\n* [[Salawat]]\n* [[Shahadah]]\n* [[Adhan]]\n* [[Dhikr]]\n* [[Tashahhud]]\n* [[Pax (liturgy)|Pax vobiscum]] (equivalent Christian phrase)\n* [[Shalom alechem]] (equivalent Hebrew phrase)\n* [[\u0160-L-M]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.islam-guide.com/ A brief illustrated guide to understanding Islam]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geFK3-y_VK4 How to pronounce As salamu alaykum in Arabic]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBOc-P_bmck How To Pronounce Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh in Arabic]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amKP_xzRaHM How to pronounce Walaikum Assalam in Arabic]\n\n[[Category:Arabic words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Arabic words and phrases in Sharia]]\n[[Category:Greeting words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Islamic honorifics]]\n[[Category:Islamic terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2011}}\n'''As-sal\u0101mu \u02bfalaykum''' ({{lang-ar|\u0671\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0651\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652}}; {{IPA-ar|as.sa.la\u02d0.mu \u0295a.laj.kum|}}) is a greeting in [[Arabic]] that means \"Peace be upon you\".

Goodbye is supplanted by a ''Khud\u00e2 h\u00e2fez'' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u062e\u062f\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638}}}}), meaning \"with the protection of God\", with the occasional use of ''beh sal\u00e2mat'' ({{lang|fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0628\u0647 \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a}}}}), meaning \"[go] with peace\".\n* In [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], a diminutive form in the Albanian language, ''Selamun Alejkem'' or ''Selamun Alejqum'' is rarely used, the 'q' being a voiceless palatal stop typical of [[Turks in the Balkans|Balkan Turkish]] and Thracian Turkish phonology.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://humstatic.uchicago.edu/slavic/archived/papers/Friedman-TurkEncyc.pdf |title=Balkan Turkish in Macedonia and Adjacent Areas |first=Victor A. |last=Friedman |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |access-date=18 December 2019 |pages=12}}</ref>\n* In [[Amharic]], the native [[Amharic]] term ''Selam'' is used in place of ''Tadias'', which is the equivalent of \"What's up\".\n* In [[Turkey]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]], many religious people use this statement and shake hands and it is the same for saying \"goodbye\"; more secular and non-religious people say ''Selam'' as an equivalent to \"Hello\" or \"Hi\". However, many Turks pronounce it differently as \"Selam\u00fcn aleyk\u00fcm\".\n* In [[Pakistan]], the greeting is also associated with shaking right hands and is also often accompanied with a hug when meeting infrequently (only between the same gender). In some places, people put a hand on their heart as they shake your hand and greet. Also, the full greeting is preferred versus the shorter greeting, \"salam\". Goodbye is supplanted by a \"Khuda Hafiz\" (secular/less formal or to an acquaintance) or \"Allah Hafiz\" (less secular/generally to strangers, formal), both of which mean \"May God keep you safe\".\n* In [[India]], the greeting mostly among Muslims is accompanied by raising the right hand to the chest (arz hai \"regards\"; adaab \"respect\") or a simple handshake or hug, the shorter greeting \"Salam\" is used in informal situations. Goodbye is supplanted by a \"Khuda hafiz\" (secular/less formal or to an acquaintance) or \"Allah hafiz\" (less secular/generally to strangers, formal), both of which mean \"May God keep you safe\".\n* In [[Bangladesh]], Assalamu alaykum is a simple greeting.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/audio/languagelessons/bangladesh/BD_Bangla_Language_Lessons.pdf |title=Introduction to the bangla language |work=[[Peace Corps]] |page=6 |access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref>\n* In [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]], Assalomu aleykum is used as an informal greeting.\n* In [[Indonesia]], the greeting is usually{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} accompanied with a kind of two-handed \"handshake\", whereby the shaker's palms remain closed, and the fingers alone open to admit the other's proffered hand \u2013 which briefly touches the proffered's fingers or fingertips alone. In this way more adherent males and females may greet though touching \u2013 but remain true to the [[Islam]]ic or cultural teachings forbidding physical contact between the genders. Occasionally, the right hand will touch the left breast or heart area after this.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Indonesia's [[Javanese people|Javanese/Sasak]] culture, a remnant of feudalism is retained, where an elder's proffered right hand is taken and pressed briefly against the forehead. Some may instead briefly kiss the hand or the main ring. This is very common for young children to greet older relatives (of their parents' age, though, on occasion, if very polite children, younger). In slang words, this greeting is sometimes referred as \"samlekom\".\n* Shortening the greeting to acronyms, such as ''A.S.'', ''As'kum'' (in [[Malaysia]]), or ''AsA'' is becoming common amongst Internet users in chat rooms and by people using [[Short Message Service|SMS]] (some scholar forbid to used these shortcut due to no meaning or improper word). This trend is similar to writing (S) or SAWS in place of [[Peace be upon him (Islam)|''\u1e63all\u0101 ll\u0101hu \u02bfalayhi wa-sallam'']].\n* In [[Chechnya]] and other parts of Caucasus, Salam Aleykum is used to say hi.\n* In [[Senegal]] which has a majority of Islam with [[Sufi]]-orientation, it is a common greeting. Spelled and pronounced in [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: \"(a)sala maaleykum\", and the reply \"maa lekum salaam.\"\n* In [[Xinjiang, China]], \"Essalam eleykum\" is used as a greeting by [[Uyghurs]], and the reply is \"We'eleykum essalam\".\n* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the expression \"[[wikt:salamaleque|salamaleque]]\" gained a totally distinct and curious meaning: because of the habit of Arabic cultures to bow down and wave the hand from the front ahead in greeting a person, the expression \"salamaleque\" is applied to exaggerated movements or acts in order to appear to be formal or entertaining or even fancy. \"Os rapazes chegaram cheios de salamaleques\". \"Salamelecco\" has the same meaning also in [[Italian language|Italian]].\n* In Israel or among Hebrew speakers, ''[[Shalom aleichem]]'' {{lang-he-n|\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd}} ''sh\u0101l\u00f4m \u02bbal\u00ea\u1e35em'')<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|shalom aleichem|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/amp/english/shalom-aleichem|title=shalom aleichem|work=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}</ref> is a greeting in meaning \"peace be upon you.\" The response is ''aleichem shalom'' (\"unto you peace\") ({{lang-he-n|\u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd}}).<ref>{{Dictionary.com|shalom aleichem |publisher=|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Hello |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1582771/jewish/The-Jewish-Hello.htm |publisher=[[Chabad.org]] |author=Dovid Zaklikowski |access-date=July 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Islam}}\n* [[Peace be upon him]]\n* [[Salawat]]\n* [[Shahadah]]\n* [[Adhan]]\n* [[Dhikr]]\n* [[Tashahhud]]\n* [[Pax (liturgy)|Pax vobiscum]] (equivalent Christian phrase)\n* [[Shalom alechem]] (equivalent Hebrew phrase)\n* [[\u0160-L-M]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.islam-guide.com/ A brief illustrated guide to understanding Islam]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geFK3-y_VK4 How to pronounce As salamu alaykum in Arabic]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBOc-P_bmck How To Pronounce Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh in Arabic]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amKP_xzRaHM How to pronounce Walaikum Assalam in Arabic]\n\n[[Category:Arabic words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Arabic words and phrases in Sharia]]\n[[Category:Greeting words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Islamic honorifics]]\n[[Category:Islamic terminology]]\n", "name_user": "K386imj", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added citation needed for \"some scholars\" reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-salamu_alaykum"}

He is searching for Julie Meyers, the office woman who testified against him. Elsewhere, Detective Rick Castle is summoned by his boss and learns about Trent's escape. He is assigned to protect Julie Meyers and bring in Trent alive.  At the same time, a police officer enters Julie Meyers' apartment to secure the witness. Trent McKormick comes out of the shadows and kills the officer before figuring out where Julie works. \n\nMcKormick, walks into Julie's office and stabs her sexually-harassing boss in the throat with a large knife. Rick finds the dead cop in Julie's apartment and races to her office complex.  On his way to rescue her, Rick is attacked by a recently released ex-con. Rick is apparently responsible for the attacker's prison time. Rick knocks him out, dumps him in a garbage truck and races to the Julie's office.\n\nIn a stairwell shoot out, Rick protects Julie from Trent. He takes her to the safe house and the two come close to having an intimate moment.  While taking a bath July flashes back to the day that Trent vowed revenge. Meanwhile, Trent follows a police officer and kills him after giving him information on Rick's location. Rick takes to the streets in his [[Dodge Viper]] to search for McKormick. Rick meets an old friend from the police force at a cafe to see if he has any information. After leaving the bar, Trent brutally murders Rick's friend at a local playhouse. Trent ambushes Rick and the two of them fight at an old junkyard during a rainstorm. Trent taunts Rick during the fight and misses several opportunities to kill him. Julie emerges from the shadows and  shoots Trent.

Trent McKormick comes out of the shadows and kills the officer before figuring out where Julie works. \n\nMcKormick, walks into Julie's office and stabs her sexually-harassing boss in the throat with a large knife. Rick finds the dead cop in Julie's apartment and races to her office complex.  On his way to rescue her, Rick is attacked by a recently released ex-con. Rick is apparently responsible for the attacker's prison time. Rick knocks him out, dumps him in a garbage truck and races to the Julie's office.\n\nIn a stairwell shoot out, Rick protects Julie from Trent. He takes her to the safe house and the two come close to having an intimate moment.  While taking a bath July flashes back to the day that Trent vowed revenge. Meanwhile, Trent follows a police officer and kills him after giving him information on Rick's location. Rick takes to the streets in his [[Dodge Viper]] to search for McKormick. Rick meets an old friend from the police force at a cafe to see if he has any information. After leaving the bar, Trent brutally murders Rick's friend at a local playhouse. Trent ambushes Rick and the two of them fight at an old junkyard during a rainstorm. Trent taunts Rick during the fight and misses several opportunities to kill him. Julie emerges from the shadows and  shoots Trent. She and Rick embrace and walk off.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Brian Gluhak]] as Rick Castle\n* [[Christopher Michael Egger]] as [[Trent McKormick]] \n* [[Jennifer Aguilar]] as [[Julie Meyers]]\n\n==Reviews==\nMatt Anderson of Terribly Awful said \"The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the story is bad, the dialog is bad, just everything is bad\".

All home matches are played at the 12-court [[Jimmy Lunsford Tennis Complex]] on Troy's campus.\n\n==History==\nThe women's tennis team began playing in the 1980s, and because of a lack of record keeping during that time, the exact year it was founded is unknown, as well as the yearly records.\n\nIn 1995, the Trojan women won their first conference tournament title while a member of the [[The Summit League|Mid-Continent Conference]].  That same year, player Claire Mowling was named the Mid-Con Newcomer of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesummitleague.org/RecordBook/Tennis.pdf|title=The Summit League|website=The Summit League}}</ref>\n\nAfter becoming a member of the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] in the late 1990s, the women again went on to win another conference in 2004 under head coach Eric Hayes.  That year, the women made it to the finals of the Atlantic Sun Tournament, defeating [[UCF Knights|UCF]] by a score of 4\u20132.  They would receive the automatic bid to play in their first ever NCAA Tournament, matching up with #5 [[Clemson Tigers women's tennis|Clemson]].  The Trojans would be defeated by the Tigers, 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YySC4SGao8rdEK_UL4L75pzYFCUZXQQgxUF9mVACgD8/edit|title=ASUN Women's Tennis Championship Results|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe Trojans program moved from the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] to the [[Sun Belt Conference]] for the 2005 season. In 2006, just Troy's second season of being in the Sun Belt Conference, the women's team won the consolation bracket of the Sun Belt Tournament and finished the season with a 16\u20135 record and a '''#68''' national ranking, their highest final ranking of Eric Hayes tenure as head coach. The doubles duo of Tsitsi Masviba and Claudia Strauss finished their 2006 campaign as the '''#55''' doubles team in the country, going 13-6 during the 2006 season. The Lady Trojans followed that up in 2007 with another winning season, going 13\u20139 with a national ranking of '''#72'''.\n\nHayes would lead the program to more successful seasons afterwards, accumulating a record of 74-56 between 2008 and 2013 and only having one season with a losing record in that span. In 2013, Hayes' last season as head coach, he coached the women's team to a 17\u20136 record, putting together a 12-game win streak that was the third-longest win streak in the country during the 2013 season. Troy entered the Sun Belt Tournament as the #3-seed, but was upset by #6-seed [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] in the quarterfinals.\n\nRawia Elsisi, a former Troy women's tennis player, was hired in 2014 as the next head coach for the team. In her first season at the helm, she led the Trojans to a 15\u20138 record that included a win over then #72-ranked [[Nicholls State Colonels|Nicholls State]] and received the #4-seed in the Sun Belt Tournament. Troy defeated [[Texas State Bobcats|Texas State]] in the quarterfinals of tournament, only to drop their semifinal match to #66 [[Georgia State Panthers|Georgia State]].\n\nIn 2018, Troy garnered their first ever #1-seed into the Sun Belt Tournament by way of a 4-2 conference record during the season, despite finishing the regular season with an 8\u201310 record. Troy had gone a 6-game win streak toward the end of the season, which included a 4\u20133 win over eventual Sun Belt champion Georgia State. The Trojans won their first round match of the Sun Belt Tournament against #9-seed [[Georgia Southern Eagles|Georgia Southern]] but lost their semifinal match to #4-seed [[South Alabama Jaguars|South Alabama]].\n\n==Award Winners/Finalists==\n*'''[[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] Finalist'''\n:Rawia Elsisi \u2013 2009\n\n*'''[[Atlantic Sun Conference]] Coach of the Year'''\n:Eric Hayes - 2004\n\n*'''[[Sun Belt Conference]] Coach of the Year'''\n:Rawia Elsisi - 2018\n\n==ITA Final Rankings==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#8e0028; color:white;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#8e0028; color:white;\" | Record\n! style=\"background:#8e0028; color:white;\" | ITA<br>National<br>Ranking\n! style=\"background:#8e0028; color:white;\" | ITA<br>Regional<br>Ranking\n|-\n|2002 || - || #73 || -\n|-\n|2006 || 16-5 || #68 || -\n|-\n|2007 || 13-9 || #72 || #9\n|-\n|2008 || 10-10 || - || #14\n|-\n|2009 || 13-7 || - || #14\n|-\n|2010 || 11-9 || - || #10\n|-\n|2013 || 17-6 || - || #7\n|-\n|2016 || 12-9 ||  || #8\n|}\nSource:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itatennis.com/ResultsAndRankings/archive/Past_Division_I_Women_s_Tennis_Rankings.htm|title=Troy Tennis In the Polls}}</ref>\n\n* The doubles duo of '''Tsitsi Masviba''' and '''Claudia Strauss''' finished the 2006 season as the '''#55''' doubles team in the country, going 13\u20136 on the season.\n\n==Year-by-Year Results==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

[[Los Angeles Times]].</ref>  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Frank Lloyd]] and starring [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Clark Gable]], based on the [[Charles Nordhoff]] and [[James Norman Hall]] novel ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''.\n\nThe film was one of MGM's biggest hits of the 1930s. Despite some historical inaccuracies, film critics consider this adaptation to be the best cinematic work inspired by the mutiny.\n\n==Plot==\nOne night in [[Portsmouth, England]] in 1787, a [[Impressment|press gang]] breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service.  One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is {{HMS|Bounty}}. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is [[William Bligh]] ([[Charles Laughton]]) and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The ''Bounty'' leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. [[Fletcher Christian]] ([[Clark Gable]]), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam ([[Franchot Tone]]) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian.\n\nDuring the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of [[Tahiti]], where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani ([[Movita Castaneda]]), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti ([[Mamo Clark]]). Christian promises her he will be back someday.\n\nAfter leaving Tahiti the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr.&nbsp;Bacchus ([[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]]), and Bligh severely cuts water rationing to the crew in favor of providing more water for the breadfruit plants. Christian, although initially opposing the idea, decides he can no longer tolerate Bligh's brutality when he witnesses crew members shackled in iron chains, and he approves the mutiny. The crew raids the weapons cabinet and seizes the ship. Bligh and his loyalists are cast into a boat and set adrift at sea with a map and rations to ensure their survival. Due to Bligh's steady leadership, they are able to find their way back to land.\n\nMeanwhile, Christian orders that ''Bounty'' return to Tahiti. Byam, who was in his cabin during the mutiny, disapproves of what Christian has done and decides the two can no longer be friends. Months later, Byam is married to Tehani and Christian has married Maimiti and has a child with her, while the rest of the crew are enjoying their freedom on the island. After a long estrangement, Byam and Christian reconcile their friendship. However, when the British ship [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']] is spotted approaching, Byam and Christian decide they must part ways. Byam and several crew members remain on the island for the ship to take them back to England, while Christian leads the remaining crew, his wife and several Tahitian men and women back on board ''Bounty'' in search of a new island on which to seek refuge.\n\nByam boards ''Pandora'' and, much to his surprise, discovers that Bligh is the captain. Bligh, who suspects that Byam was complicit in the mutiny, has him imprisoned for the remainder of the journey across the sea. Back in England Byam is court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny. Before the court condemns him, Byam speaks of Bligh's cruel, dehumanising conduct aboard ''Bounty''. Due to the intervention of his friend Sir Joseph Banks ([[Henry Stephenson]]) and Lord Hood ([[David Torrence]]), Byam is pardoned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and allowed to resume his naval career at sea.\n\nMeanwhile, Christian has found Pitcairn, an uninhabited yet sustainable island that he believes will provide adequate refuge from the reach of the Royal Navy. After ''Bounty'' crashes on the rocks, Christian orders her to be burned.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n[[File:Charles laughton mutiny bounty 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles Laughton]] as [[Captain Bligh]] set adrift by [[Fletcher Christian]] ([[Clark Gable]])]]\nThe movie contains several historical inaccuracies. [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[William Bligh|Bligh]] was never on board {{HMS|Pandora|1779|6}}, nor was he present at the trial of the mutineers who stayed on [[Tahiti]]. At the time he was halfway around the world on a second voyage for [[breadfruit]] plants. [[Fletcher Christian]]'s father had died many years before Christian's travels on board ''Bounty'', whereas the film shows the elder Christian at the trial. The movie was always presented as an adaptation of the Nordhoff and Hall trilogy, which already differed from the actual story of the mutiny.\n\nBligh is depicted as a brutal, sadistic disciplinarian. Particular episodes include a [[keelhauling]] and flogging a dead man. Neither of these happened. Keelhauling was used rarely, if at all, and had been abandoned long before Bligh's time. Indeed, the meticulous record of ''Bounty''{{'}}s log reveals that the flogging rate was lower than the average for that time. Prior to the mutiny, ''Bounty'' had only two deaths\u2014one seaman died of [[scurvy]] (not keelhauling), and the ship's surgeon died apparently of drink and indolence and not as a result of abuse by Bligh. Likewise, the film shows the mutineers taking over the ship only after killing several loyal crewmen, when in fact none died (although one crewman came very close to shooting Bligh until stopped by Christian). Lastly, Christian is shown being inspired to take over the ship after several crewmen have unjustly been put into irons by Bligh; this is fictional.\n\nIn the final scene of the film, Gable gives a rousing speech to his fellow mutineers, speaking of creating a perfect society of free men on [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]], away from Bligh and the navy. The reality was very different as mutineers enslaved Tahitian men.\n\nFor historical accuracy, [[Clark Gable]] reluctantly had to shave off his famous [[moustache]] because the sailors in the [[Royal Navy]] in the 18th century had to be clean-shaven. Midshipman Roger Byam was based on a real person, Midshipman [[Peter Heywood]], who is not listed in the novel or motion picture. Just as the fictional Byam is pardoned at the end of the film, the real-life Peter Heywood was pardoned for his part in the mutiny. MGM trailers in 1935 made an error calling Midshipman Byam an ensign.\n\nMutineer [[Thomas Ellison (mutineer)|Thomas Ellison]] is depicted as being allowed to see his wife before his execution. There is no record to indicate that the real Ellison was married, and in any case a consolation visit of this type never would have been permitted in real life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as [[William Bligh|Captain Bligh]]\n* [[Clark Gable]] as [[Fletcher Christian]]\n* [[Franchot Tone]] as Byam\n* [[Herbert Mundin]] as [[John Adams (mutineer)|Smith]]\n* [[Eddie Quillan]] as [[Thomas Ellison (mutineer)|Ellison]]\n* [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]] as Bacchus\n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Burkitt\n* [[Henry Stephenson]] as [[Sir Joseph Banks]]\n* [[Francis Lister]] as Capt.

Cagney is clearly visible toward the beginning of the film. He was sailing his boat near where the film was shooting near Catalina Island; director Frank Lloyd was an old friend of his, and Cagney asked him if he could play a small part in the film, saying, jokingly, \"I need the money\". Lloyd had Cagney dressed in a crewman's clothes and put him in the background of a few scenes.\n\nCharles Laughton, who had a severe self-image complex concerning his weight and unattractive looks, suffered horribly in comparing himself to the handsome, masculine Clark Gable.<ref name=\"HG:CL\">{{Cite episode |title=Charles Laughton |series=Hollywood Greats|airdate=August 31, 1978|seriesno=2|number=5 |minutes=12\u201313}}</ref> Laughton would constantly watch his own walk, gestures, and face, making sure not to let his complex be projected.<ref name=\"HG:CL\"/>\n\n===Ship===\nA British merchant navy officer<ref>Le Page, Peter \"A working lifetime\" (1991)</ref> recalled in his memoirs seeing the fore and aft-rigged schooner ''Commodore II'' being broken up in [[Cape Town]] in 1945, having suffered severe gale damage, and that this was the ship that had been re-rigged for the film.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Poster - Mutiny on the Bounty (1935).jpg|thumb|Advertorial poster]]\n\nContemporary reviews were enthusiastic.

Bligh, was a disaster both critically and financially at the time. Nonetheless, the remake was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and has come to be re-evaluated by current critics.\n\nIn 1984 [[Mel Gibson]] played Christian opposite [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Bligh in a film (based not upon the Nordhoff-Hall novels but on an historical work by [[Richard Hough]]) called ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]''. This latest version, which gives a far more sympathetic view of Bligh, is considered to be the closest to historical events.\n\nThe 1935 version was itself not the first film account of the mutiny. In 1933 an Australian film entitled ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', with the then-unknown [[Errol Flynn]] as Fletcher Christian, was released, but was not successful and received few bookings outside Australia. Flynn noted in his autobiography that whenever he mentioned that he'd played Christian in an Australian version of ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' two years before Gable, no one ever believed him. There was also an even earlier film, the 1916 Australian\u2013New Zealand film, ''[[The Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' directed by [[Raymond Longford]].\n\n==Parodies==\n* [[Friz Freleng]]'s cartoon ''[[Mutiny on the Bunny]]'' casts [[Yosemite Sam]] (called Shanghai Sam) as a foul-tempered skipper who shanghais [[Bugs Bunny]], only to see Bugs rebel. Also, in one scene in Freleng's earlier ''[[Buccaneer Bunny]]'', Bugs dresses up as Capt. Bligh (including a visual and vocal impression of [[Charles Laughton]]) and barks out orders to Sam (called Seagoin' Sam).\n* The 1967 ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode \"[[List of Lost in Space episodes|Mutiny in Space]]\" features [[Ronald Long]] imitating Charles Laughton in the role of spaceship captain \"Admiral Zahrk.\" \n* [[Morecambe and Wise]] performed a sketch with [[Arthur Lowe]] (famous for playing [[Captain Mainwaring]] in [[Dad's Army]]) as Captain Bligh. At the end of the sketch it is announced Bligh has some loyal crewmen who turn out to be other stars of Dad's Army. \n* \"Holidays at Home\", a 1978 episode of ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'', includes a dream sequence where the sitcom's cast enact scenes from the film.\n* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[The Wettest Stories Ever Told]]\" features the family telling stories set on ships.

[[Los Angeles Times]].</ref>  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Frank Lloyd]] and starring [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Clark Gable]], based on the [[Charles Nordhoff]] and [[James Norman Hall]] novel ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''.\n\nThe film was one of MGM's biggest hits of the 1930s. Despite some historical inaccuracies, film critics consider this adaptation to be the best cinematic work inspired by the mutiny.\n\n==Plot==\nOne night in [[Portsmouth, England]] in 1787, a [[Impressment|press gang]] breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service.  One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is {{HMS|Bounty}}. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is [[William Bligh]] ([[Charles Laughton]]) and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The ''Bounty'' leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. [[Fletcher Christian]] ([[Clark Gable]]), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam ([[Franchot Tone]]) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian.\n\nDuring the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of [[Tahiti]], where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani ([[Movita Castaneda]]), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti ([[Mamo Clark]]). Christian promises her he will be back someday.\n\nAfter leaving Tahiti the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr.&nbsp;Bacchus ([[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]]), and Bligh severely cuts water rationing to the crew in favor of providing more water for the breadfruit plants. Christian, although initially opposing the idea, decides he can no longer tolerate Bligh's brutality when he witnesses crew members shackled in iron chains, and he approves the mutiny. The crew raids the weapons cabinet and seizes the ship. Bligh and his loyalists are cast into a boat and set adrift at sea with a map and rations to ensure their survival. Due to Bligh's steady leadership, they are able to find their way back to land.\n\nMeanwhile, Christian orders that ''Bounty'' return to Tahiti. Byam, who was in his cabin during the mutiny, disapproves of what Christian has done and decides the two can no longer be friends. Months later, Byam is married to Tehani and Christian has married Maimiti and has a child with her, while the rest of the crew are enjoying their freedom on the island. After a long estrangement, Byam and Christian reconcile their friendship. However, when the British ship [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']] is spotted approaching, Byam and Christian decide they must part ways. Byam and several crew members remain on the island for the ship to take them back to England, while Christian leads the remaining crew, his wife and several Tahitian men and women back on board ''Bounty'' in search of a new island on which to seek refuge.\n\nByam boards ''Pandora'' and, much to his surprise, discovers that Bligh is the captain. Bligh, who suspects that Byam was complicit in the mutiny, has him imprisoned for the remainder of the journey across the sea. Back in England Byam is court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny. Before the court condemns him, Byam speaks of Bligh's cruel, dehumanising conduct aboard ''Bounty''. Due to the intervention of his friend Sir Joseph Banks ([[Henry Stephenson]]) and Lord Hood ([[David Torrence]]), Byam is pardoned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and allowed to resume his naval career at sea.\n\nMeanwhile, Christian has found Pitcairn, an uninhabited yet sustainable island that he believes will provide adequate refuge from the reach of the Royal Navy. After ''Bounty'' crashes on the rocks, Christian orders her to be burned.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n[[File:Charles laughton mutiny bounty 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles Laughton]] as [[Captain Bligh]] set adrift by [[Fletcher Christian]] ([[Clark Gable]])]]\nThe movie contains several historical inaccuracies. [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[William Bligh|Bligh]] was never on board {{HMS|Pandora|1779|6}}, nor was he present at the trial of the mutineers who stayed on [[Tahiti]]. At the time he was halfway around the world on a second voyage for [[breadfruit]] plants. [[Fletcher Christian]]'s father had died many years before Christian's travels on board ''Bounty'', whereas the film shows the elder Christian at the trial. The movie was always presented as an adaptation of the Nordhoff and Hall trilogy, which already differed from the actual story of the mutiny.\n\nBligh is depicted as a brutal, sadistic disciplinarian. Particular episodes include a [[keelhauling]] and flogging a dead man. Neither of these happened. Keelhauling was used rarely, if at all, and had been abandoned long before Bligh's time. Indeed, the meticulous record of ''Bounty''{{'}}s log reveals that the flogging rate was lower than the average for that time. Prior to the mutiny, ''Bounty'' had only two deaths\u2014one seaman died of [[scurvy]] (not keelhauling), and the ship's surgeon died apparently of drink and indolence and not as a result of abuse by Bligh. Likewise, the film shows the mutineers taking over the ship only after killing several loyal crewmen, when in fact none died (although one crewman came very close to shooting Bligh until stopped by Christian). Lastly, Christian is shown being inspired to take over the ship after several crewmen have unjustly been put into irons by Bligh; this is fictional.\n\nIn the final scene of the film, Gable gives a rousing speech to his fellow mutineers, speaking of creating a perfect society of free men on [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]], away from Bligh and the navy. The reality was very different as mutineers enslaved Tahitian men.\n\nFor historical accuracy, [[Clark Gable]] reluctantly had to shave off his famous [[moustache]] because the sailors in the [[Royal Navy]] in the 18th century had to be clean-shaven. Midshipman Roger Byam was based on a real person, Midshipman [[Peter Heywood]], who is not listed in the novel or motion picture. Just as the fictional Byam is pardoned at the end of the film, the real-life Peter Heywood was pardoned for his part in the mutiny. MGM trailers in 1935 made an error calling Midshipman Byam an ensign.\n\nMutineer [[Thomas Ellison (mutineer)|Thomas Ellison]] is depicted as being allowed to see his wife before his execution. There is no record to indicate that the real Ellison was married, and in any case a consolation visit of this type never would have been permitted in real life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as [[William Bligh|Captain Bligh]]\n* [[Clark Gable]] as [[Fletcher Christian]]\n* [[Franchot Tone]] as Byam\n* [[Herbert Mundin]] as [[John Adams (mutineer)|Smith]]\n* [[Eddie Quillan]] as [[Thomas Ellison (mutineer)|Ellison]]\n* [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]] as Bacchus\n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Burkitt\n* [[Henry Stephenson]] as [[Sir Joseph Banks]]\n* [[Francis Lister]] as Capt.

Lloyd had Cagney dressed in a crewman's clothes and put him in the background of a few scenes.\n\nCharles Laughton, who had a severe self-image complex concerning his weight and unattractive looks, suffered horribly in comparing himself to the handsome, masculine Clark Gable.<ref name=\"HG:CL\">{{Cite episode |title=Charles Laughton |series=Hollywood Greats|airdate=August 31, 1978|seriesno=2|number=5 |minutes=12\u201313}}</ref> Laughton would constantly watch his own walk, gestures, and face, making sure not to let his complex be projected.<ref name=\"HG:CL\"/>\n\n===Ship===\nA British merchant navy officer<ref>Le Page, Peter \"A working lifetime\" (1991)</ref> recalled in his memoirs seeing the fore and aft-rigged schooner ''Commodore II'' being broken up in [[Cape Town]] in 1945, having suffered severe gale damage, and that this was the ship that had been re-rigged for the film.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Poster - Mutiny on the Bounty (1935).jpg|thumb|Advertorial poster]]\n\nContemporary reviews were enthusiastic.

Bligh, was a disaster both critically and financially at the time. Nonetheless, the remake was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and has come to be re-evaluated by current critics.\n\nIn 1984 [[Mel Gibson]] played Christian opposite [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Bligh in a film (based not upon the Nordhoff-Hall novels but on an historical work by [[Richard Hough]]) called ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]''. This latest version, which gives a far more sympathetic view of Bligh, is considered to be the closest to historical events.\n\nThe 1935 version was itself not the first film account of the mutiny. In 1933 an Australian film entitled ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', with the then-unknown [[Errol Flynn]] as Fletcher Christian, was released, but was not successful and received few bookings outside Australia. Flynn noted in his autobiography that whenever he mentioned that he'd played Christian in an Australian version of ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' two years before Gable, no one ever believed him. There was also an even earlier film, the 1916 Australian\u2013New Zealand film, ''[[The Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' directed by [[Raymond Longford]].\n\n==Parodies==\n* [[Friz Freleng]]'s cartoon ''[[Mutiny on the Bunny]]'' casts [[Yosemite Sam]] (called Shanghai Sam) as a foul-tempered skipper who shanghais [[Bugs Bunny]], only to see Bugs rebel. Also, in one scene in Freleng's earlier ''[[Buccaneer Bunny]]'', Bugs dresses up as Capt. Bligh (including a visual and vocal impression of [[Charles Laughton]]) and barks out orders to Sam (called Seagoin' Sam).\n* The 1967 ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode \"[[List of Lost in Space episodes|Mutiny in Space]]\" features [[Ronald Long]] imitating Charles Laughton in the role of spaceship captain \"Admiral Zahrk.\" \n* [[Morecambe and Wise]] performed a sketch with [[Arthur Lowe]] (famous for playing [[Captain Mainwaring]] in [[Dad's Army]]) as Captain Bligh. At the end of the sketch it is announced Bligh has some loyal crewmen who turn out to be other stars of Dad's Army. \n* \"Holidays at Home\", a 1978 episode of ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'', includes a dream sequence where the sitcom's cast enact scenes from the film.\n* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[The Wettest Stories Ever Told]]\" features the family telling stories set on ships. The second segment is a parody on ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' and casts [[Principal Skinner]] as Capt. Bligh, brutalizing the crew members (played by Bart, Milhouse, Martin, Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0026752|Mutiny on the Bounty (1935)}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=15288|title=Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n* {{allmovie|33980|synopsis}}\n* {{AFI film|id=7072|title=Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=1014481-mutiny_on_the_bounty|title=Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n* [http://southseascinema.org/index.html Southseascinema.org]\n* [http://www.virtual-history.com/movie/film/1124/mutiny-on-the-bounty ''Mutiny on the Bounty''] at Virtual History\n\n{{Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n{{Frank Lloyd}}\n{{Irving Thalberg}}\n{{AcademyAwardBestPicture 1927-1940}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mutiny On The Bounty (1935 Film)}}\n[[Category:1935 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American historical films]]\n[[Category:Best Picture Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:1930s adventure films]]\n[[Category:1930s historical films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:American epic films]]\n[[Category:Military courtroom films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about HMS Bounty]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Frank Lloyd]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Irving Thalberg]]\n[[Category:Films shot in French Polynesia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jules Furthman]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Herbert Stothart]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films]]\n[[Category:Films set on ships]]\n", "name_user": "Renard Migrant", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast:Marion Clayton as Marion Clayton?

It was during this period that [[Rise of Rome|Rome's control expanded]] from the [[city of Rome|city's]] immediate surroundings to [[hegemony]] over the entire [[Mediterranean|Mediterranean world]].\n\nRoman society under the Republic was a cultural mix of Latin, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], and Greek elements, which is especially visible in the [[List of Roman deities|Roman Pantheon]]. Its political organisation was strongly influenced by the [[Polis|Greek city states]] of [[Magna Graecia]], with collective and annual magistracies, overseen by a [[Roman Senate|senate]].<ref>Arnaldo Momigliano, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. VII part 2, pp. 110, 111.</ref> The top magistrates were the two [[Roman consul|consuls]], who had an extensive range of executive, legislative, judicial, military, and religious powers. While there were elections each year, the Republic was not a [[democracy]], but an [[oligarchy]], as a small number of powerful families (called ''[[Gens|gentes]]'') monopolised the main magistracies. Roman institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic to adapt to the difficulties it faced, such as the creation of [[Promagistrate|promagistracies]] to rule its conquered [[Roman province|provinces]], or the composition of the senate.\n\nUnlike the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' of the [[Roman Empire]], the Republic was in a state of quasi-perpetual war throughout its existence. Its first enemies were its [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] neighbours as well as the [[Gauls]], who even [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|sacked the city]] in 387 BC. The [[Republic]] nonetheless demonstrated extreme resilience and always managed to overcome its losses, however catastrophic. After the Gallic Sack, Rome conquered the whole Italian peninsula in a century, which turned the Republic into a major power in the Mediterranean. The Republic's greatest enemy was doubtless [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], against which it waged [[Punic Wars|three wars]]. The [[Punics|Punic]] general [[Hannibal]] famously invaded Italy by [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|crossing the Alps]] and inflicted on Rome two devastating defeats at [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], but the Republic once again recovered and won the war thanks to [[Scipio Africanus]] at the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202 BC. With Carthage defeated, Rome became the dominant power of the ancient Mediterranean world. It then embarked on a long series of difficult conquests, after having notably defeated [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] of the [[Seleucid Empire]], the [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] [[Viriathus]], the [[Numidia]]n [[Jugurtha]], the great [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], the [[Gaul]] [[Vercingetorix]], and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] queen [[Cleopatra]].\n\nAt home, the Republic similarly experienced a long streak of social and political crises, which ended in several violent civil wars. At first, the [[Conflict of the Orders]] opposed the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], the closed oligarchic elite, to the far more numerous ''plebs'', who finally achieved political equality in several steps during the 4th century BC. Later, the vast conquests of the Republic disrupted its society, as the immense influx of slaves they brought enriched the aristocracy, but ruined the peasantry and urban workers. In order to solve this issue, several social reformers, known as the ''[[Populares]]'', tried to pass agrarian laws, but the [[Gracchi|Gracchi brothers]], [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus|Saturninus]], or [[Clodius Pulcher]] were all murdered by their opponents, the ''[[Optimates]]'', keepers of the traditional aristocratic order. Mass slavery also caused three [[Servile Wars]]; the last of them was led by [[Spartacus]], a skilful gladiator who ravaged Italy and left Rome powerless until his defeat in 71 BC. In this context, the last decades of the Republic were marked by the rise of great generals, who exploited their military conquests and the factional situation in Rome to gain control of the political system. [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] (between 105\u201386 BC), then [[Sulla]] (between 82\u201378 BC) dominated in turn the Republic; both used extraordinary powers to purge their opponents. These multiple tensions led to a series of [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]]; the first between the two generals [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]]. Despite his victory and appointment as [[Roman dictator|dictator for life]], Caesar was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] in 44 BC. Caesar's heir [[Octavian]] and lieutenant [[Mark Antony]] defeated Caesar's assassins [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in 42 BC, but then turned against each other. The final defeat of Mark Antony and his ally [[Reign of Cleopatra|Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, and the Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to [[Octavian]] as ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' in 27 BC \u2013 which effectively made him the first [[Roman emperor]] \u2013 thus ended the Republic.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation (509 BC)===\n{{main|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}\nSince the [[foundation of Rome]], its rulers had been monarchs, elected for life by the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician noblemen]] who made up the [[Roman senate|Roman Senate]]. The last [[Roman Kingdom|Roman king]] was [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (\"Tarquin the Proud\"). In the traditional histories, Tarquin was expelled in 509 because his son [[Sextus Tarquinius]] had raped the noblewoman [[Lucretia]], who afterwards took her own life. Lucretia's father, her husband [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], and Tarquin's nephew [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] mustered support from the Senate and army, and forced Tarquin into exile in [[Etruria]].<ref>Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215\u2013218: Cornell offers a summary of \"Livy's prose narrative\" and derived literary works relating to the expulsion of the kings.</ref><ref>[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]], iv. 64\u201385.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/4D*.html]</ref><ref>[[Titus Livius|Livy]], i. 57\u201360</ref>\n\nThe Senate agreed to abolish kingship. Most of the king's former functions were transferred to two consuls, who were elected to office for a term of one year. Each consul had the capacity to act as a check on his [[Collegiality#Collegiality in the Roman Republic|colleague]], if necessary through the same power of ''[[veto]]'' that the kings had held. If a consul abused his powers in office, he could be prosecuted when his term expired. Brutus and Collatinus became Republican Rome's first [[Roman consul|consuls]]. Despite Collatinus' role in the creation of the Republic, he belonged to the same family as the former king, and was forced to abdicate his office and leave Rome. He was replaced as co-consul by [[Publius Valerius Publicola]].<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 226\u2013228.</ref>\n\nMost modern scholarship describes these events as the quasi-mythological detailing of an aristocratic coup within Tarquin's own family, not a popular revolution. They fit a narrative of a personal vengeance against a tyrant leading to his overthrow, which was common among Greek cities and even theorised by [[Aristotle]].<ref>Aristotle, ''Politics'', 5.1311a.</ref><ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215\u2013218, 377\u2013378.</ref><ref>Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', VII, part 2, p. 178.</ref>\n\npeople peed in buckets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe died because of peeepeeeeee\n\n===Rome in Latium (509\u2013387 BC)===\n====Early campaigns====\nAccording to Rome's traditional histories, Tarquin made several attempts to retake the throne, including the [[Tarquinian conspiracy]], which involved Brutus' own sons, the [[Roman\u2013Etruscan Wars#War with Veii and Tarquinii, after the overthrow of the monarchy in 509 BC|war with Veii and Tarquinii]] and finally the [[Roman\u2013Etruscan Wars#War with Clusium in 508 BC|war between Rome and Clusium]]; but none succeeded.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215\u2013217.</ref>[[File:Capitoline Brutus Musei Capitolini MC1183.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|The \"[[Capitoline Brutus]]\", a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] possibly depicting [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who led the revolt against Rome's last king and was a founder of the Republic|alt=|left]]\n\nThe first Roman republican wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory in the region.<ref>Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 33</ref> Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] towns and villages, or else tribal [[Sabines]] from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities, both those under Etruscan control and those that had cast off their [[Etruria|Etruscan]] rulers. Rome defeated the Latin cities in the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]] in 496, the [[Battle of Mount Algidus]] in 458, the [[Battle of Corbio]] in 446, the Battle of Aricia, however it suffered a significant defeat at the [[Battle of the Cremera]] in 477 wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of [[Veii]].<ref name=\"epitomeB1C12\">Florus, ''Epitome'', i. 11\u201312.</ref><ref name=\"historyP37\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', pp. 37\u201341.</ref> {{Campaignbox Rome's Early Italian Campaigns}}By the end of this period, Rome had effectively [[Roman conquest of Italy|completed the conquest]] of their immediate Etruscan and Latin neighbours, and also secured their position against the immediate threat posed by the nearby Apennine hill tribes.<ref>Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. II</ref>\n\n====Plebeians and patricians====\n{{Main|Conflict of the Orders}}\nBeginning with their revolt against Tarquin, and continuing through the early years of the Republic, Rome's patrician aristocrats were the dominant force in politics and society. They initially formed a closed group of about 50 large families, called [[Gens|''gentes'']], who monopolised Rome's magistracies, state priesthoods and senior military posts. The most prominent of these families were the [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]],{{efn-lr|Throughout the Republic, the Cornelii held 75 consulships and 27 consular tribuneships, almost 10% of all the consulships of the period.}} followed by the [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]]. The power, privilege and influence of leading families derived from their wealth, in particular from their landholdings, their position as [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patrons]], and their numerous clients.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 289\u2013291.</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of Roman citizens were commoners of various social degrees. They formed the backbone of Rome's economy, as smallholding farmers, managers, artisans, traders, and tenants. In times of war, they could be summoned for military service. Most had little direct political influence over the Senate's decisions or the laws it passed, including the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the consular system. During the early Republic, the ''[[plebs]]'' (or plebeians) emerged as a self-organised, culturally distinct group of commoners, with their own internal hierarchy, laws, customs, and interests.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 256\u2013259: ''Plebs'' (\"the mass\") was originally a disparaging term, but was adopted as a badge of pride by those whom it was meant to insult. It might not have referred to wealthier commoners.</ref>\n\nPlebeians had no access to high religious and civil office,{{efn-lr|Several historians, notably [[Tim Cornell]], have challenged this view, saying that in the early Republic the [[Fasti Consulares]] bear names that are distinctively plebeian. Therefore, they claim that the plebeians were only excluded from higher offices by the Decemvirate in 451 BC. More recently, [[Corey Brennan]] has dismissed this theory, arguing that the consular plebeians would not have let the Decemvirs take their power away that easily (cf. ''The Praetorship'', pp. 24, 25). He explains the \"plebeian\" names in the Fasti by some patrician gentes who later died out, or lost their status. Consequently, this article follows the traditional narrative that the plebeians were excluded from the start.}} and could be punished for offences against laws of which they had no knowledge.<ref>Orlin, ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 59\u201360.</ref> For the poorest, one of the few effective political tools was their withdrawal of labour and services, in a \"''[[secessio plebis]]''\"; they would leave the city en masse, and allow their social superiors to fend for themselves. The [[First secessio plebis|first such secession]] occurred in 494, in protest at the abusive treatment of plebeian debtors by the wealthy during a famine.<ref>The traditional date for the first secession is given by Livy as 494; many other dates have been suggested, and several such events probably took place: see Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215\u2013218, 256\u2013261, 266.</ref> The Senate was compelled to give them direct access to the written civil and religious laws, and to the [[Elections in the Roman Republic|electoral]] and political process. To represent their interests, the ''plebs'' elected [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunes]], who were personally [[Sacrosanctity|sacrosanct]], immune to arbitrary arrest by any magistrate, and had [[veto]] power over the passage of legislation.<ref>For a discussion of the duties and legal status of plebeian tribunes and aediles, see Andrew Lintott, ''Violence in Republican Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QIKEpOP4lLIC&pg=PA92 pp. 92\u2013101].</ref>\n\n====Celtic invasion of Italy (390\u2013387 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Roman-Gallic Wars}}\nBy 390, several [[Gauls|Gallic tribes]] were invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. The Romans were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe, the [[Senones]],<ref>Florus, ''Epitome'', i. 13.</ref> invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the [[Battle of the Allia|Battle of Allia River]] around 390\u2013387 BC. The Gauls, led by the chieftain [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]], defeated the Roman army of approximately 15,000 troops, pursued the fleeing Romans back to Rome, and sacked the city before being either driven off or bought off.\n\n===Roman expansion in Italy (387\u2013272 BC)===\n\n====Wars against Italian neighbours====\n[[File:Roman conquest of Italy.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Map showing Roman expansion in [[Italy]]]]\n{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}\n{{Campaignbox Samnite Wars}}\nFrom 343 to 341, Rome won [[First Samnite war|two battles]] against their [[Samnites|Samnite]] neighbours, but were unable to consolidate their gains, due to the outbreak of war with former Latin allies.\n\nIn the [[Latin War]] (340\u2013338), Rome defeated a coalition of Latins at the battles of [[Battle of Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] and the [[Battle of Trifanum|Trifanum]]. The Latins submitted to Roman rule.<ref>Grant, ''The History of Rome'', pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\nA [[Second Samnite War]] began in 327.<ref name=\"historyOfRomeP52\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 52.</ref> The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated, but from 314, Rome was dominant, and offered progressively unfavourable terms for peace. The war ended with Samnite defeat at the [[Battle of Bovianum]] (305). By the following year, Rome had annexed most Samnite territory, and began to establish colonies there; but in 298 the Samnites rebelled, and defeated a Roman army, in a [[Third Samnite War]]. Following this success they built a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome.<ref>Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 53.</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Populonia]] in 282 Rome finished off the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.\n\n====Rise of the plebeian nobility====\nIn the 4th century, plebeians gradually obtained political equality with patricians. The starting point was in 400, when the first plebeian consular tribunes were elected; likewise, several subsequent consular colleges counted plebeians (in 399, 396, 388, 383, and 379). The reason behind this sudden gain is unknown,<ref>It has nevertheless been speculated that [[Lucius Atilius Luscus]] in 444, and [[Quintus Antonius Meranda]] in 422 were also plebeian. cf. Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', p. 50.</ref> but it was limited as patrician tribunes retained preeminence over their plebeian colleagues.<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 338.</ref> In 385, the former consul and saviour of the besieged Capitol [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus]] is said to have sided with the plebeians, ruined by the Sack and largely indebted to patricians. The issue of debt relief for the plebs remained indeed pressing throughout the century. Livy tells that Capitolinus sold his estate to repay the debt of many of them, and even went over to the plebs, the first patrician to do so. Nevertheless, the growing unrest he had caused led to his trial for seeking kingly power; he was sentenced to death and thrown from the [[Tarpeian Rock]].<ref>Livy, vi. 11, 13\u201330.</ref><ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 331, 332.</ref>\n\nBetween 376 and 367, the tribunes of the plebs [[Gaius Licinius Stolo]] and [[Lucius Sextius Lateranus]] continued the plebeian agitation and pushed for an ambitious legislation, known as the ''[[Leges Liciniae Sextiae]]''. Two of their bills attacked patricians' economic supremacy, by creating legal protection against indebtedness and forbidding excessive use of public land, as the ''[[Ager publicus]]'' was monopolised by large landowners. The most important bill opened the consulship to plebeians.<ref name=\"Cornell, p. 337.\">Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 337. Cornell explains that Livy confused the contents of the ''Lex Licinia Sextia'' of 366 the ''Lex Genucia'' of 342.</ref> Other tribunes controlled by the patricians vetoed the bills, but Stolo and Lateranus retaliated by vetoing the elections for five years while being continuously re-elected by the plebs, resulting in a stalemate.<ref>Livy mentions at least two patricians favourable to the tribunes: [[Marcus Fabius Ambustus (consular tribune 381)|Marcus Fabius Ambustus]], Stolo's father-in-law, and the dictator for 368 [[Publius Manlius Capitolinus]], who appointed the first plebeian ''magister equitum'', Gaius Licinius Calvus.</ref> In 367, they carried a bill creating the ''[[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|Decemviri sacris faciundis]]'', a college of ten priests, of whom five had to be plebeians, therefore breaking patricians' monopoly on priesthoods. Finally, the resolution of the crisis came from the dictator [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]], who made a compromise with the tribunes; he agreed to their bills, while they in return consented to the creation of the offices of praetor and curule aediles, both reserved to patricians. Lateranus also became the first plebeian consul in 366; Stolo followed in 361.<ref>Livy, vi. 36\u201342.</ref><ref>Broughton, vol. I, pp. 108\u2013114.</ref><ref>Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 59\u201361.</ref>\n\nSoon after, plebeians were able to hold both the [[roman dictator|dictatorship]] and the censorship, since former consuls normally filled these senior magistracies. The four time consul [[Gaius Marcius Rutilus]] became the first plebeian dictator in 356 and censor in 351. In 342, the tribune of the plebs Lucius Genucius passed his ''[[Leges Genuciae]]'', which abolished interest on loans, in a renewed effort to tackle indebtedness, required the election of at least one plebeian consul each year, and prohibited a magistrate from holding the same magistracy for the next ten years or two magistracies in the same year.<ref>Livy, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0154%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D42 vii. 42].</ref><ref name=\"Cornell, p. 337.\" /><ref>Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 65\u201367, where he shows that the ten-year rule was only temporary at this time.</ref> In 339, the plebeian consul and dictator [[Quintus Publilius Philo]] passed three laws extending the powers of the plebeians. His first law followed the ''Lex Genucia'' by reserving one censorship to plebeians, the second made plebiscites binding on all citizens (including patricians), and the third stated that the Senate had to give its prior approval to plebiscites before becoming binding on all citizens (the ''Lex Valeria-Horatia'' of 449 had placed this approval after the vote).<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 342, 343.</ref> Two years later, Publilius ran for the praetorship, probably in a bid to take the last senior magistracy closed to plebeians, which he won.<ref>Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 68, 69.</ref> \n[[File:RomaTempioRotondoForoBoarioJPG.JPG|thumb|The [[Temple of Hercules Victor]], Rome, built in the mid 2nd century BC, most likely by [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]], who won the [[Achaean War]]|208x208px]]\n\nDuring the early republic, senators were chosen by the consuls among their supporters. Shortly before 312, the ''[[Lex Ovinia]]'' transferred this power to the censors, who could only remove senators for misconduct, thus appointing them for life. This law strongly increased the power of the Senate, which was by now protected from the influence of the consuls and became the central organ of government.<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 393, 394.

More recently, Humm described his activity as the continuation of the reforms undertaken since Stolo and Lateranus.}} His tribal reforms were nonetheless cancelled by the next censors, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] and [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 312 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]], his political enemies.<ref>Taylor, ''Voting Districts'', pp. 132\u2013138.</ref> Caecus also launched a vast construction program, building the first aqueduct (''[[Aqua Appia]]''), and the first Roman road (''[[Via Appia]]'').<ref>Bruce MacBain, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638505 Appius Claudius Caecus and the Via Appia]\", in ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 30, No. 2 (1980), pp. 356\u2013372.</ref>\n\nIn 300, the two tribunes of the plebs Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius passed the ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'', which created four plebeian pontiffs, therefore equalling the number of patrician pontiffs, and five plebeian augurs, outnumbering the four patricians in the college.<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 343.</ref> Eventually the Conflict of the Orders ended with the last secession of the plebs in about 287.

They had indeed little in common with the mass of plebeians; Stolo was noteworthy fined for having exceeded the limit on land occupation he had fixed in his own law.<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 340, 341.</ref> As a result of the end of the patrician monopoly on senior magistracies, many small patrician ''gentes'' faded into history during the 4th and 3rd centuries due to the lack of available positions; the [[Verginii]], [[Horatia (gens)|Horatii]], [[Menenia (gens)|Menenii]], [[Cloelii]] all disappear, even the [[Julii]] entered a long eclipse. They were replaced by plebeian aristocrats, of whom the most emblematic were the [[Caecilia (gens)|Caecilii Metelli]], who received 18 consulships until the end of the Republic; the [[Domitia (gens)|Domitii]], [[Fulvia (gens)|Fulvii]], [[Licinia (gens)|Licinii]], [[Marcia (gens)|Marcii]], or [[Sempronia (gens)|Sempronii]] were as successful.

It triggered a violent reaction from the Tarentine democrats, who sank some of the ships; they were in fact worried that Rome could favour the oligarchs in the city, as it had done with the other Greek cities under its control. The Roman embassy sent to investigate the affair was insulted and war was promptly declared.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, xix. 5, 6.</ref> Facing a hopeless situation, the Tarentines (together with the Lucanians and Samnites) appealed for military aid to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], the very ambitious king of [[Epirus]].

[[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], the consul sent to face him, rejected the king's negotiation offer, as he had more troops and hoped to cut the invasion short. The Romans were nevertheless defeated at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]], as their cavalry were afraid of the elephants of Pyrrhus, who lost a large portion of his army. Pyrrhus then marched on Rome, but could not take any Roman city on his way; facing the prospect of being flanked by the two consular armies, he moved back to Tarentum. His adviser, the orator [[Cineas]], made a peace offer before the Roman Senate, asking Rome to return the land it took from the Samnites and Lucanians, and liberate the Greek cities under its control. The offer was rejected after [[Appius Claudius Caecus|Appius Caecus]] (the old censor of 312) spoke against it in a celebrated speech, which was the earliest recorded by the time of Cicero.<ref>Cicero, ''[[Cato Maior de Senectute]]'', 6.</ref><ref>Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 18, 19.</ref><ref>Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 466\u2013471.</ref> In 279, Pyrrhus met the consuls [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] and Publius Sulpicius Saverrio at the [[Battle of Asculum]], which remained undecided for two days, as the Romans had prepared some special chariots to counter his elephants. Finally, Pyrrhus personally charged into the melee and won the battle, but [[Pyrrhic victory|at the cost of an important part of his troops]]; he allegedly said \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.\"<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, xx. 3.</ref><ref>Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 21 \u00a7 9.</ref><ref>Cassius Dio, x. 5.</ref>{{efn-lr|There are significant differences between the accounts of Cassius Dio, Dionysius, and Plutarch, but the latter's is traditionally followed in the academic literature.}}\n\nHe escaped the Italian deadlock by answering a call for help from Syracuse, which tyrant Thoenon was desperately fighting an invasion from [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]. Pyrrhus could not let them take the whole island as it would have compromised his ambitions in the western Mediterranean and so declared war on them. At first, his Sicilian campaign was an easy triumph; he was welcomed as a liberator in every Greek city on his way, even receiving the title of king (''[[basileus]]'') of Sicily. The Carthaginians lifted the [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] before his arrival, but he could not entirely oust them from the island as he failed to take their fortress of [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]].<ref>Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 473\u2013480.</ref> His harsh rule, especially the murder of Thoenon, whom he did not trust, soon led to a widespread antipathy among the Sicilians; some cities even defected to Carthage. In 275, Pyrrhus left the island before he had to face a full-scale rebellion.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, xx. 8.</ref> He returned to Italy, where his Samnite allies were on the verge of losing the war, despite their earlier victory at the [[Battle of the Cranita hills|Cranita hills]]. Pyrrhus again met the Romans at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]]; this time the consul [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Manius Dentatus]] was victorious, and even captured eight elephants. Pyrrhus then withdrew from Italy, but left a garrison in Tarentum, and waged a new campaign in Greece against [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos Gonatas]]. His death in battle at [[Argos]] in 272 forced Tarentum to surrender to Rome.

Between 288 and 283, [[Messina|Messena]] in Sicily was taken by the [[Mamertines]], a band of mercenaries formerly employed by [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]]. They plundered the surroundings until [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], the new tyrant of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], defeated them (in either 269 or 265). Carthage could not let him take Messena, as he would have controlled its [[Strait of Messina|Strait]], and garrisoned the city. In effect under a Carthaginian protectorate, the remaining Mamertines appealed to Rome to regain their independence. Senators were divided on whether to help them or not, as it would have meant war with Carthage, since Sicily was in its sphere of influence (the treaties furthermore forbade the island to Rome), and also [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. A supporter of the war, the consul [[Appius Claudius Caudex]] ([[Appius Claudius Caecus|Caecus]]' brother) turned to the [[Tribal Assembly]] to get a favourable vote, by notably promising booty to voters.<ref>Which assembly was consulted has led to many discussions in the academic literature. Goldsworthy favours the Centuriate Assembly, cf. ''The Punic Wars'', p. 69.</ref>\n\nCaudex first secured control of the city with ease. However, Syracuse and Carthage, at war for centuries, made an alliance to counter the invasion and blockaded Messena, but Caudex defeated Hiero and Carthage separately.<ref>Polybius, i. 11, 12.</ref><ref>[[Howard Hayes Scullard|H. H. Scullard]] thinks that Caudex was not successful, since he did not receive a triumph and was succeeded in command by Messalla, his political enemy. Cf. ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 545.</ref> His successor [[Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla|Manius Valerius Corvinus Messalla]] landed with a strong 40,000 men army that conquered eastern Sicily, which prompted Hiero to shift his allegiance and forge a long lasting alliance with Rome. In 262, the Romans moved to the southern coast and besieged [[Agrigento|Akragas]]. In order to raise the siege, Carthage sent reinforcements, including 60 elephants \u2013 the first time they used them, but still lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|battle]].<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 547.</ref> Nevertheless, as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] before, Rome could not take all of Sicily because Carthage's naval superiority prevented them from effectively besieging coastal cities, which could receive supplies from the sea. Using a captured Carthaginian ship as blueprint, Rome therefore launched a massive construction program and built 100 [[quinquereme]]s in only two months, perhaps through an [[assembly line]] organisation. They also invented a new device, the ''[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]'', a grappling engine which enabled a crew to board on an enemy ship.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 113</ref> The consul for 260 [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Scipio Asina]] lost the first [[Battle of the Lipari Islands|naval skirmish]] of the war against [[Hannibal Gisco]] at [[Lipari|Lipara]], but his colleague [[Gaius Duilius|Gaius Dullius]] won a [[Battle of Mylae|great victory]] at [[Milazzo|Mylae]]. He destroyed or captured 44 ships, and was the first Roman to receive a naval triumph, which also included captive Carthaginians for the first time.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 84.</ref> Although Carthage was victorious on land at [[Battle of Thermae|Thermae]] in Sicily, the ''corvus'' made Rome invincible on the waters. The consul [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Scipio]] (Asina's brother) captured [[Corsica]] in 259; his successors won the naval battles of [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] in 258, [[Battle of Tyndaris|Tyndaris]] in 257, and [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Cape Ecnomus]] in 256.<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 548\u2013554.</ref>\n[[File:Corvus.svg|alt=|left|thumb|Diagram of a ''corvus'']]In order to hasten the end of the war, the consuls for 256 decided to carry the operations to Africa, on Carthage's homeland. The consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] landed on the [[Cap Bon]] peninsula with about 18,000 soldiers. He captured the city of [[Siege of Aspis|Aspis]], then repulsed Carthage's counter-attack at [[Battle of Adys|Adys]], and took [[Tunis]]. The Carthaginians supposedly sued him for peace, but his conditions were so harsh that they continued the war instead. They hired Spartan mercenaries, led by [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]], to command their troops.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 88.</ref> In 255, the Spartan general marched on Regulus, still encamped at Tunis, who accepted the battle to avoid sharing the glory with his successor. However, the flat land near Tunis favoured the Punic elephants, [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|which crushed the Roman infantry on the Bagradas plain]]; only 2,000 soldiers escaped, and Regulus was captured. The consuls for 255 nonetheless won a new sounding naval victory at Cape Hermaeum, where they captured 114 warships. This success was spoilt by a storm that annihilated the victorious navy: 184 ships of 264 sank, 25,000 soldiers and 75,000 rowers drowned. The ''corvus'' considerably hindered ships' navigation, and made them vulnerable during tempest. It was abandoned after another similar catastrophe took place in 253 (150 ships sank with their crew). These disasters prevented any significant campaign between 254 and 252.<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 554\u2013557.</ref>\n[[File:C._Caecilius_Metellus_Caprarius,_denarius,_125_BC,_RRC_269-1.jpg|thumb|Denarius of [[Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius|C.

Carthage countered the following year, by besieging [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], who held [[Palermo|Panormos]] (now Palermo). The consul had dug trenches to counter the elephants, which once hurt by missiles turned back on their own army, resulting in a [[Battle of Panormus|great victory]] for Metellus, who exhibited some captured beasts in the [[Circus Maximus|Circus]]. Rome then besieged the last Carthaginian strongholds in Sicily, [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]] and [[Drepana]], but these cities were impregnable by land. [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]], the consul of 249, recklessly tried to take the latter from the sea, but he suffered a terrible [[Battle of Drepana|defeat]]; his colleague [[Lucius Junius Pullus (consul 249 BC)|Lucius Junius Pullus]] likewise lost his fleet off [[Siege of Lilybaeum (250 BC)|Lilybaeum]]. Without the ''corvus'', Roman warships had lost their advantage. By now, both sides were drained and could not undertake large scale operations; the number of Roman citizens who were being called up for war had been reduced by 17% in two decades, a result of the massive bloodshed. The only military activity during this period was the landing in Sicily of [[Hamilcar Barca]] in 247, who harassed the Romans with a mercenary army from a citadel he built on [[Monte Erice|Mt. Eryx]].<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 559\u2013564.</ref>\n\nFinally, unable to take the Punic fortresses in Sicily, Rome tried to win the decision at sea and built a new navy, thanks to a forced borrowing on the rich. In 242, the 200 quinqueremes of the consul [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] blockaded Drepana. The rescue fleet from Carthage arrived the next year, but was largely undermanned and [[Battle of the Aegates|soundly defeated]] by Catulus. Exhausted and unable to bring supplies to Sicily, Carthage sued for peace. Catulus and Hamilcar negotiated a treaty, which was somewhat lenient to Carthage, but the Roman people rejected it and imposed harsher terms: Carthage had to pay 1000 [[Talents of silver|talents]] immediately and 2200 over ten years, and evacuate Sicily. The fine was so high that Carthage could not pay Hamilcar's mercenaries, who had been shipped back to Africa. They revolted during the [[Mercenary War]], which Carthage had enormous difficulties to suppress. Meanwhile, Rome took advantage of a similar revolt in [[Sardinia]] to seize the island from Carthage, in violation of the peace treaty. This stab-in-the-back led to permanent bitterness in Carthage, and [[revanchism]].<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 565\u2013569.</ref>\n\n====Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Second Punic War}}\nAfter its victory, the Republic shifted its attention to its northern border as the [[Insubres]] and [[Boii]] were threatening Italy.<ref>Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', p. 217.</ref> Meanwhile, Carthage compensated the loss of Sicily and Sardinia with the [[Barcid conquest of Hispania|conquest]] of Southern [[Hispania]] (up to [[Salamanca]]), and its rich silver mines.<ref>Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', p. 215.</ref> This enterprise was the work of the [[Barcid family]], headed by [[Hamilcar Barca|Hamilcar]], the former commander in Sicily.

The Carthaginian refusal started the Second Punic War.<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 39.</ref>\n[[File:Second Punic War full-en.svg|alt=|left|thumb|422x422px|Principal offensives of the war: Rome (red), Hannibal (green), Hasdrubal (purple)]]\n\nInitially, the plan of the Republic was to carry war outside Italy, by sending the consuls [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] to Hispania, and [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BCE)|Sempronius Longus]] to Africa, while their naval superiority prevented Carthage from attacking from the sea.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 46.</ref> This plan was thwarted by Hannibal's bold move to Italy. In May 218, he indeed crossed the Ebro with a large army of about 100,000 soldiers and 37 elephants.<ref>Fronda, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', pp. 251, 252.</ref> He passed in [[Gaul]], [[Battle of Rhone Crossing|crossed the Rhone]], then the [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|Alps]], possibly through the [[Col de Clapier]] (2,491 meters high).<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 47.</ref> This famous exploit cost him half of his troops,<ref>Livy, xxi. 38, quoting [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius Alimentus]] who reported a personal discussion with Hannibal, in which he said he lost 38,000 men by crossing the Alps.</ref> but he could now rely on the Boii and Insubres, still at war with Rome.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 48.</ref> Publius Scipio, who had failed to block Hannibal on the Rhone, sent his elder brother [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus|Gnaeus]] with the main part of his army in Hispania according to the initial plan, and went back to Italy with the rest to resist Hannibal in Italy, but he was defeated and wounded near [[Battle of Ticinus|Pavia]].\n\nHannibal then marched south and won three outstanding victories. The first one was on the banks of the [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] in December 218, where he defeated the other consul Sempronius Longus thanks to his brother Mago, who had concealed some elite troops behind the legions and attacked them from the rear once fighting Hannibal. More than half of the Roman army was lost. Hannibal then ravaged the country around [[Arezzo|Arretium]] to lure the new consul [[Gaius Flaminius]] into a trap, at the [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]]. He had hidden his troops in the hills surrounding the lake and attacked Flaminius when he was cornered on the shore. This [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|clever ambush]] resulted in the death of the consul and the complete destruction of his army of 30,000 men. In 216, the new consuls [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Aemilius Paullus]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro|Terentius Varro]] mustered the biggest army possible, with eight legions (more than 80,000 soldiers) \u2013 twice as many as the Punic army \u2013 and confronted Hannibal, who was encamped at [[Cannae]], in [[Apulia]]. Despite his numerical disadvantage, Hannibal used his heavier cavalry to rout the Roman wings and envelop their infantry, whom he annihilated. In terms of casualties, the [[Battle of Cannae]] was the worst defeat in the history of Rome: only 14,500 soldiers escaped; Paullus was killed as well as 80 senators.<ref>Polybius (iii. 117) gives 70,000 dead. Livy (xxii. 49) gives 47,700 dead and 19,300 prisoners.</ref> Soon after, the Boii ambushed the army of the consul-elect for 215, [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 BC)|Postumius Albinus]], who died with all his army of 25,000 men in the [[Battle of Silva Litana|Forest of Litana]].\n\n[[File:Carthage, quarter shekel, 237-209 BC, SNG BM Spain 102.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|quarter shekel]] of Carthage, perhaps minted in Spain.

His attack on [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] started the [[First Macedonian War]]. In 215, [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] died of old age, and his young grandson [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]] broke the long alliance with Rome to side with Carthage. At this desperate point, the aggressive strategy against Hannibal advocated by the Scipiones was abandoned in favour of delaying tactics that avoided direct confrontation with him. Its main proponents were the consuls Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, nicknamed ''Cunctator'' (\"the delayer\"), [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Claudius Marcellus]], and [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 237 BC)|Fulvius Flaccus]]. The \"[[Fabian strategy|Fabian Strategy]]\" favoured a slow reconquest of the lost territories, since Hannibal could not be everywhere to defend them.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 49, 50.</ref> Although he remained invincible on the battlefield, defeating all the Roman armies on his way, he could not prevent Claudius Marcellus from taking Syracuse in 212 after a [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|long siege]], nor the fall of his bases of Capua and Tarentum in [[Siege of Capua (211 BC)|211]] and [[Battle of Tarentum (209 BC)|209]]. However, in 208 the consuls Claudius Marcellus and Quinctius Crispinus were ambushed and killed near [[Venusia]].\n\nIn Hispania, the situation was overall much better for Rome. This theatre was mostly commanded by the brothers Publius and Gnaeus Scipio, who won the battles of [[Battle of Cissa|Cissa]] in 218, soon after Hannibal's departure, and [[Battle of Dertosa|Dertosa]] against his brother Hasdrubal in 215, which enabled them to conquer the eastern coast of Hispania. In 211 however, Hasdrubal and Mago Barca successfully returned the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian tribes]] that supported the Scipiones, and attacked them simultaneously at the [[Battle of the Upper Baetis]], in which the Scipiones brothers died.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 57.</ref> Publius' son, the future [[Scipio Africanus]], was then elected with a special proconsulship to lead the Hispanic campaign. He soon showed outstanding skills as a commander, by winning a series of battles with ingenious tactics. In 209, he took [[Battle of Cartagena (209 BC)|Carthago Nova]], the main Punic base in Hispania, then defeated Hasdrubal at the [[Battle of Baecula]] (208).<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 59.</ref> After his defeat, Hasdrubal was ordered by Carthage to move to Italy. Since he could not use ships, he followed the same route as his brother through the Alps, but this time the surprise effect was gone. The consuls [[Marcus Livius Salinator|Livius Salinator]] and [[Gaius Claudius Nero|Claudius Nero]] were awaiting him and won the [[Battle of the Metaurus]], where Hasdrubal died.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 55.</ref> It was the turning point of the war. The attrition campaign had indeed worked well: Hannibal's troops were now depleted; he only had one elephant left ([[Surus]]) and retreated to [[Calabria|Bruttium]], on the defensive. In Greece, Rome contained Philip V without devoting too many forces, by setting an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]], [[Sparta]], and [[Pergamon]], which also prevented Philip from aiding Hannibal. The war resulted in a stalemate, with the [[Treaty of Phoenice]] signed in 205.\n{{Campaignbox First Macedonian War}}\n\nIn Hispania, Scipio continued his triumphal campaign at the battles of [[Battle of Carmona|Carmona]] in 207, and [[Battle of Ilipa|Ilipa]] (now [[Seville]]) in 206, which ended the Punic threat on the peninsula.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 60.</ref> Elected consul in 205, he convinced the Senate to cancel the Fabian Strategy, and instead to invade Africa by using the support of the Numidian king [[Masinissa|Massinissa]], who had defected to Rome. Scipio landed in Africa in 204. He took [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Utica]], then won the [[Battle of the Great Plains]], which prompted Carthage to recall Hannibal from Italy and open peace negotiations with Rome. The talks nevertheless failed because Scipio wanted to impose harsher terms on Carthage, in order to avoid it from rising again as a threat to Rome. Hannibal was therefore sent to face Scipio at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]]. Scipio could now use the heavy Numidian cavalry of Massinissa \u2013 which had hitherto been so successful against Rome \u2013 to rout the Punic wings, then flank the infantry, as Hannibal had done at Cannae. Defeated for the first time, Hannibal convinced the Carthaginian Senate to pay the war indemnity, which was even harsher than that of 241: 10,000 talents in 50 instalments. Carthage furthermore had to give up all its elephants, all its fleet but ten [[trireme]]s, all its possessions outside its core territory in Africa (what is now [[Tunisia]]), and could not declare war without the authorisation of Rome. In effect, Carthage was condemned to be a minor power, while Rome recovered from a desperate situation to dominate the Western Mediterranean.\n\n====Roman supremacy in the Greek East (200\u2013188 BC)====\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|style=\"background:#ddd; text-align:center;\"|'''Macedonian Wars'''\n|-\n|[[File:Macedonia and the Aegean World c.200.png|center|thumb|300px|Macedonia, Greece and Asia at the outbreak of the Second Macedonian War, 200 BC]]\n|-\n|{{Campaignbox Macedonian Wars}}\n{{Campaignbox Second Macedonian War}}\n{{Campaignbox Roman\u2013Seleucid War}}\n{{Campaignbox Third Macedonian War}}\n{{Campaignbox Fourth Macedonian War}}\n|}\n{{further|Rise of Rome}}\n\nRome's preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] of the kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], located in the north of the [[Greek peninsula]], to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome.<ref name=\"enemiesP47\">Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 47</ref><ref name=\"historyP115\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 115</ref> However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet.<ref name=\"enemiesP47\"/> The [[First Macedonian War]] saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of preoccupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.\n\nThe past century had seen the Greek world dominated by the three primary successor kingdoms of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire: [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and the [[Seleucid Empire]]. In 202, internal problems led to a weakening of Egypt's position, thereby disrupting the power balance among the successor states. Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt.<ref name=\"Eckstein, Arthur p42\">Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 42.</ref> Fearing this increasingly unstable situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to seek an alliance.<ref>Eckstein, Arthur. \"Rome Enters the Greek East\". p. 43</ref> The delegation succeeded, even though prior Greek attempts to involve Rome in Greek affairs had been met with Roman apathy. Our primary source about these events, the surviving works of Polybius, do not state Rome's reason for getting involved. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome's new Greek allies. Doubting Rome's strength (a reasonable doubt, given Rome's performance in the [[First Macedonian War]]) Philip ignored the request, and Rome sent an army of Romans and Greek allies, beginning the [[Second Macedonian War]].<ref name=\"enemiesP49\">Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 49</ref> Despite his recent successes against the Greeks and earlier successes against Rome, Philip's army buckled under the pressure from the Roman-Greek army.

Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace.

Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded by sending a stronger army. This second consular army decisively defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168<ref name=\"historyP120\"/><ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 92</ref> and the Macedonians duly capitulated, ending the war.<ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 53</ref>\n\nConvinced now that the Greeks (and therefore the rest of the region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent foothold in the Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The [[Fourth Macedonian War]], 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second battle of Pydna]].\n\nThe [[Achaean League]] chose this moment to fight Rome but was swiftly defeated. In 146 (the same year as the destruction of [[Carthage]]), [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]] was besieged and destroyed in the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]], which led to the league's surrender.<ref>History of Rome \u2013 The republic, Isaac Asimov.</ref> After nearly a century of constant crisis management in Greece, which always led back to internal instability and war when she withdrew, Rome decided to divide Macedonia into two new Roman provinces, [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].\n\n====Third Punic War (149\u2013146 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Third Punic War}}\nCarthage never recovered militarily after the Second Punic War,<ref>Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. XV, para. 24</ref> but quickly did so economically and the [[Third Punic War]] that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission after the neighbouring Numidians allied to Rome robbed/attacked Carthaginian merchants. Treaties had forbidden any war with Roman allies, and defence against robbing/pirates was considered as \"war action\": Rome decided to annihilate the city of Carthage.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 338</ref> Carthage was almost defenceless, and submitted when besieged.<ref name=\"punicP339\">Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 339</ref> However, the Romans demanded complete surrender and removal of the city into the (desert) inland far off any coastal or harbour region, and the Carthaginians refused. The city was [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|besieged, stormed, and completely destroyed]].\n\nUltimately, all of Carthage's North African and Iberian territories were acquired by Rome. Note that \"Carthage\" was not an 'empire', but a league of Punic colonies (port cities in the western Mediterranean) like the 1st and 2nd Athenian (\"Attic\") leagues, under leadership of Carthage. Punic Carthage was gone, but the other Punic cities in the western Mediterranean flourished under Roman rule.\n\n===Social troubles and first civil war (146\u201360 BC)===\n[[Rise of Rome|Rome's rapid expansion]] destabilized its social organization and triggered unrest in the heart of the Republic, which ultimately led to political violence, unrest in the provinces, and ultimately a breakdown in the traditional social relations of Rome that created the Augustan Empire. The period is marked by the rise of strongmen ([[Gaius Marius|Marius]], [[Sulla]], [[Pompey]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]], and [[Julius Caesar]]), who turned military success into political power.\n\n====The Gracchi (133\u2013121 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Servile Wars}}\n{{Main|Gracchi}}\n\nIn 135, the first slave uprising, known as the [[First Servile War]], broke out in Sicily. After initial successes, the slaves led by [[Eunus]] and [[Cleon (Roman rebel)|Cleon]] were annihilated by the consul [[Publius Rupilius]] in 132 BC.\n\nIn this context, [[Tiberius Gracchus]] was elected tribune in 133 BC. He attempted to enact a law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the [[Plebeian Council]], but the law was vetoed by a tribune named [[Marcus Octavius]]. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council to [[impeach]] Octavius. The theory, that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority.<ref name=\"Abbott, 96\">Abbott, 96</ref> His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered with 300 of his associates<ref name=\"Hillsborough\">{{cite web|last=Bishop|first=Paul|title=Rome: Transition from Republic to Empire|url=http://www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf|publisher=Hillsborough Community College|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref> when he stood for reelection to the tribunate.\n\nTiberius' brother Gaius was elected tribune in 123. [[Gaius Gracchus]]' ultimate goal was to weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces.<ref name=\"Abbott, 97\">Abbott, 97</ref> In the past, for example, the senate would eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a\n''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' (\"ultimate decree of the senate\"). Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the ''senatus consultum ultimum'' to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support.<ref>Stobart, J.C.

He was succeeded by two legitimate sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate son, [[Jugurtha]]. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, turned on his brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated a division of the country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, [[Gaius Marius]], a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display.<ref name=\"Abbott, 100\">Abbott, 100</ref> The ''[[populares]]'' party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.\n\n{{Campaignbox Cimbrian War}}\nThe [[Cimbrian War]] (113\u2013101) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121. The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes of the ''[[Cimbri]]'' and the ''[[Teutons]]''<ref name=\"appianS6\">Appian, ''History of Rome'', \u00a76</ref> migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories,<ref name=\"enemiesP75\">Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 75</ref> and clashed with Rome and her allies.<ref name=\"stormingP6\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 6</ref> At the [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] and the [[Battle of Vercellae]] both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.\n\n====Sulla's Civil Wars====\n{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}\n{{Campaignbox First Mithridatic War}}\n{{Campaignbox Sulla's Second Civil War}}\nIn 91 the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]] broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy when the allies complained that they shared the risk of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards. Although they lost militarily, the allies achieved their objectives with legal proclamations which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians.\n\nThe internal unrest reached its most serious state, however, in the [[Sulla's civil wars|two civil wars]] that were caused by the clash between generals [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] starting from 88. In the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]]<ref>Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 161</ref> at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Marius supporters and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was to pave the way for the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nSeveral years later, in 88, a Roman army was sent to put down an emerging Asian power, king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. The army, however, was not defeated and won. One of Marius' old quaestors, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], had been elected consul for the year, and was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, a member of the \"''[[populares]]''\" party, had a tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla, a member of the aristocratic (\"''[[optimates]]''\") party, brought his army back to Italy and [[Sulla's civil wars|marched on Rome]]. Sulla was so angry at Marius' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tribunate.<ref name = \"Abbott, 103\">Abbott, 103</ref> He then returned to his war against Mithridates. With Sulla gone, the ''populares'' under Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] soon took control of the city.\n\nDuring the period in which the ''populares'' party controlled the city, they flouted convention by re-electing Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten-year interval between offices.<ref name = \"Abbott, 106\">Abbott, 106</ref> They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates. In 83, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters.

The Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, [[Gaius Marius]]. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.\n\nThe [[Second Mithridatic War]] began when Rome tried to annex a province that Mithridates claimed as his own. In the [[Third Mithridatic War]], first [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and then [[Pompey the Great]] were sent against Mithridates and his [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian]] ally [[Tigranes the Great]].<ref name=\"classicalworldP363\">Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 363</ref> Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time [[Battle of the Lycus]].<ref name = \"Plutarch\">Plutarch, ''Lives'', Pompey</ref>\n\n{{Campaignbox Rome against the Cilician Pirates}}\nThe Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of pirates,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> largely from [[Cilicia]].<ref name=\"epitomeB3C6\">Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman history'', Book 3, ch. 6</ref> The pirates not only strangled shipping lanes but also plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia.

By 71, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], had just put down the [[Spartacus]]-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the ''populares'' party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution.<ref name=\"Abbott, 108\">Abbott, 108</ref> They attempted to forge an agreement with the ''populares'' party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.<ref name=\"Abbott, 109\">Abbott, 109</ref>\n[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|A Roman marble bust of [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], Musei Capitolini, Rome]]\n\nAround 66, a movement to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began.<ref name=\"Abbott, 109-110\">Abbott, 109\u2013110</ref> After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]]. The movement was based in the town of Faesulae, which was not a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation.<ref name=\"Abbott, 110\">Abbott, 110</ref> The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome,<ref name = \"Abbott, 111\"/> and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63. The consul for the year, [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.\n\nThe most important result of the Catilinarian conspiracy was that the ''populares'' party became discredited. The prior 70 years had witnessed a gradual erosion in senatorial powers. The violent nature of the conspiracy, in conjunction with the senate's skill in disrupting it, did a great deal to repair the senate's image.<ref name=\"Abbott, 111\">Abbott, 111</ref>\n\n===Triumvirates and end of the Republic (60\u201327 BC)===\n\n====First Triumvirate (60\u201350 BC)====\n{{Ancient Rome and the fall of the Republic}}\n{{Main|First Triumvirate}}\n[[File:Pompeius.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Roman marble head of [[Pompey]] (now in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]])]]\nIn 62, Pompey returned victorious from Asia. The Senate, elated by its successes against Catiline, refused to ratify the arrangements that Pompey had made. Pompey, in effect, became powerless. Thus, when [[Julius Caesar]] returned from a governorship in Spain in 61, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, now known as the [[First Triumvirate]]. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements would be ratified. Caesar would be elected consul in 59, and would then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was promised a future consulship.<ref name = \"Abbott, 112\"/>\n\nBy 59 an unofficial political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]] was formed between [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], and [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (\"Pompey the Great\") to share power and influence.<ref>Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 168</ref>\n\nCaesar became consul in 59. His colleague, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], was an extreme aristocrat. Caesar submitted the laws that he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage.<ref name=\"Abbott, 112\">Abbott, 112</ref> Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated the election of the former patrician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] to the tribunate for 58. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.<ref name=\"Abbott, 113\">Abbott, 113</ref>\n\n[[File:Caesar campaigns gaul-en.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Gallic Wars]]\n{{Campaignbox Gallic Wars}}\nDuring his term as praetor in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's contemporary [[Julius Caesar]] defeated two local tribes in battle.<ref name=\"livescaesar\">Plutarch, ''Lives'', Caesar</ref> After his term as consul in 59, he was appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans).<ref name=\"livescaesar\"/><ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 58</ref> Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his [[Gallic Wars]], fought between 58 and 49.\n\nCaesar defeated large armies at major battles 58 and 57. In 55 and 54 he made [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|two expeditions into Britain]], the first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated a union of Gauls at the [[Battle of Alesia]],<ref name=\"stormingP62\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 62 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 212</ref> completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50, all of Gaul lay in Roman hands.\n\nClodius formed armed gangs that terrorised the city and eventually began to attack Pompey's followers, who in response funded counter-gangs formed by [[Titus Annius Milo]]. The political alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC)|Ahenobarbus]] ran for the consulship in 55 promising to take Caesar's command from him. Eventually, the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the consulship in 55, and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years.\nBeginning in the summer of 54, a wave of political corruption and violence swept Rome.<ref name=\"Abbott, 114\">Abbott, 114</ref> This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo.\n\nIn 53, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes,<ref name=\"enemiesP133\">Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 133</ref> he marched his army deep into the desert;<ref>Plutarch, ''Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'', p. 266</ref> but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 214</ref> and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. Pompey's wife, Julia, who was Caesar's daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar. In 51, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.\n\n====Caesar's Civil War and dictatorship (49\u201344 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Caesar's Civil War}}\n[[File:04305 - Roma - Fori - Curia Iulia - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 18-Mar-2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Curia Julia]], the [[Roman Senate]] house established by Julius Caesar in 44 BC and completed by [[Octavian]] in 29 BC, replacing the [[Curia Cornelia]] as the meeting place of the Senate]]\n{{Main|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}\n\nOn 1 January 49, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic.<ref name=\"Abbott, 115\">Abbott, 115</ref> Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49, the senate passed a ''senatus consultum ultimum'', which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts.\n\nOn 10 January, Caesar with his veteran army crossed the river [[Rubicon]], the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, in violation of Roman laws, and by the spring of 49 swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed. Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain)<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 217</ref> but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece.<ref>Julius Caesar, ''The Civil War'', 81\u201392 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 218</ref> Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48,<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 227 See also: Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 403</ref> despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops.<ref>Holland, ''Rubicon'', p. 312</ref> Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.\n\nPompey's death did not end the civil war, as Caesar's many enemies fought on. In 46 Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army, but ultimately came back to defeat the Pompeian army of [[Metellus Scipio]] in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Hispania. Caesar then defeated the combined Pompeian forces at the [[Battle of Munda]].\n[[File:Retrato de Julio C\u00e9sar (26724093101).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Tusculum portrait]], a [[Roman sculpture]] of [[Julius Caesar]], Archaeological Museum of [[Turin]], Italy]]\n\nWith Pompey defeated and order restored, Caesar wanted to achieve undisputed control over the government. The powers which he gave himself were later assumed by his imperial successors.<ref name = \"Abbott, 134\"/> His assumption of these powers decreased the authority of Rome's other political institutions.\n\nCaesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship.<ref name=\"Abbott, 134\">Abbott, 134</ref> In 48, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46, Caesar was given censorial powers,<ref name=\"Abbott, 135\">Abbott, 135</ref> which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised the membership of the Senate to 900.<ref name = \"Abbott, 137\"/> This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.{{clarify|date=January 2019}}<!-- how did asking for their consent on everything make them powerless?--><ref name=\"Abbott, 138\">Abbott, 138</ref>\n\nNear the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law before his death which allowed him to appoint all magistrates, and later all consuls and tribunes. This transformed the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.<ref name=\"Abbott, 137\">Abbott, 137</ref>\n\nCaesar was now the primary figure of the Roman state, enforcing and entrenching his powers. His enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler. Arguing that the Roman Republic was in danger, a group of senators hatched a conspiracy and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated Caesar]] at a meeting of the Senate in March 44.<ref name=\"antiquityP170\">Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 170</ref>\n\nCaesar was assassinated on 15 March 44. The assassination was led by [[Gaius Cassius]] and [[Marcus Brutus]]. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms in favor of the landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed what was left of the Republic.<ref name=\"Abbott, 133\">Abbott, 133</ref>\n\n====Second Triumvirate====\n[[Mark Antony]], Caesar's lieutenant, condemned Caesar's assassination, and war broke out between the two factions. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Caesar's adopted son and chosen heir, [[Augustus|Gaius Octavianus]], was entrusted with the command of the war against him. At the [[Battle of Mutina]] Mark Antony was defeated by the consuls [[Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Pansa]], who were both killed.\n{{multiple image|total_width=550\n|image1=Venus and Cupid from the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, most likely a depiction of Cleopatra VII (2).jpg\n|image2=Venus and Cupid from the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, most likely a depiction of Cleopatra VII (5).jpg\n|footer=This mid-1st-century-BC [[Pompeian Styles|Roman wall painting]] in [[Pompeii]] is probably a depiction of [[Cleopatra VII]] as [[Venus Genetrix]], with her son [[Caesarion]] as [[Cupid]].

Known as the [[Second Triumvirate]],<ref name=\"Goldsworthy, p. 237\">Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 237</ref> they held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus did likewise soon afterwards.\n\nHowever, civil war flared again when the alliance failed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base of patronage and then launched a campaign against Mark Antony.<ref name=\"antiquityP170\"/> At the naval [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 off the coast of Greece, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. Octavian was granted a series of special powers including sole \"imperium\" within the city of Rome, permanent consular powers and credit for every Roman military victory, since all future generals were assumed to be acting under his command. In 27 Octavian was granted the use of the names \"Augustus\", indicating his primary status above all other Romans, \"Princeps\", which he used to refer to himself as in public, and he adopted the title \"Imperator Caesar\" making him the first Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"grandP7\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 7</ref>\n\n==Constitutional system==\n{{Roman government}}\n{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}\n{{Main|History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic}}\n{{further|Elections in the Roman Republic}}\nThe constitutional history of the Roman Republic began with the revolution which overthrew the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]] in 509 BC, and ended with constitutional reforms that transformed the Republic into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. The Constitution of the Roman Republic was a constantly-evolving, unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent, by which the government and its politics operated.<ref name=\"Byrd, 161\">Byrd, 161</ref> Throughout the history of the Republic, changes in the constitution were driven by [[Conflict of the Orders|conflicts of interest]] between the aristocracy and ordinary citizens.\n\n===Senate===\n{{Main|Senate of the Roman Republic}}\nThe [[Senate of the Roman Republic|senate's]] ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators.<ref name=\"Byrd, 96\">Byrd, 96</ref> This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called ''senatus consulta''. These were officially \"advice\" from the senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates.<ref name=\"Byrd, 44\">Byrd, 44</ref> The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. This was due to the senate's explicit power over the state's budget and in military affairs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bleiken |first1=Jochen |title=Die Verfassung der r\u00f6mischen Republik |date=1995 |publisher=UTB |location=Sch\u00f6ningh |edition=6th}}</ref> The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by [[Roman Censors]], who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. During times of military emergency, such as the civil wars of the 1st century, this practice became less prevalent, as the [[Roman Dictator]], [[Triumvir]] or the senate itself would select its members. Towards the end of the Republic, the senate could enact a ''[[Senatus consultum ultimum|senatus consultus ultimum]]'' in times of emergency, instead of appointing a dictator.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Your explanation here}}\n\n===Legislative assemblies===\n[[File:Forum Romanum through Arch of Septimius Severus Forum Romanum Rome.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Forum]], the commercial, cultural, religious, and political center of the city and the Republic which housed the various offices and meeting places of the government]]\n\n{{Main|Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic}}\n\nThe legal status of Roman citizenship was limited and was a vital prerequisite to possessing many important legal rights such as the right to trial and appeal, to marry, to vote, to hold office, to enter binding contracts, and to special tax exemptions. An adult male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called \"optimo jure.\" The optimo jure elected their assemblies, whereupon the assemblies elected magistrates, enacted legislation, presided over trials in capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties. There were [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Comitia, Concilium, Conventio|two types of legislative assemblies]]. The first was the ''comitia'' (\"committees\"),<ref name=\"Lintott, 42\">Lintott, 42</ref> which were assemblies of all optimo jure. The second was the ''concilia'' (\"councils\"), which were assemblies of specific groups of optimo jure.<ref name=\"Abbott, 251\">Abbott, 251</ref>\n\nCitizens were organized on the basis of centuries and [[Tribe of Rome|tribes]], which would each gather into their own assemblies. The [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Centuries|Comitia Centuriata]] (\"Centuriate Assembly\") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had the ''imperium'' powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census.<ref name=\"Abbott, 257\">Abbott, 257</ref> It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.\n\nThe assembly of the tribes (i.e., the citizens of Rome), the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Tribes|Comitia Tributa]], was presided over by a consul, and was composed of 35 tribes. The tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions.<ref name=\"Lintott, 51\">Lintott, 51</ref> The order that the thirty-five tribes would vote in was selected randomly by lot.<ref name=\"Taylor, 77\">Taylor, 77</ref> Once a measure received support from a majority of the tribes, the voting would end. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, [[Curule seat|curule]] [[aedile]]s, and military tribunes.<ref name=\"Taylor, 7\">Taylor, 7</ref> The Plebeian Council<ref name=\"Abbott, 196\">Abbott, 196</ref> was identical to the assembly of the tribes, but excluded the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal.\n\n===Magistrates===\n{{Main|Executive magistrates of the Roman Republic}}\nEach republican magistrate held certain [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Republic#Powers|constitutional powers]]. Each was assigned a ''provincia'' by the Senate. This was the scope of that particular office holder's authority. It could apply to a geographic area or to a particular responsibility or task.<ref name=\"Lintott, 101\">Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 101.</ref> The powers of a magistrate came from the people of Rome (both plebeians ''and'' patricians).<ref name=\"Lintott, 95\">Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 95.</ref> The ''[[imperium]]'' was held by both consuls and praetors. Strictly speaking, it was the authority to command a military force. In reality, however, it carried broad authority in the other public spheres such as diplomacy, and the justice system. In extreme cases, those with the imperium power were able to sentence Roman Citizens to death. All magistrates also had the power of ''coercitio'' (coercion). This was used by magistrates to maintain public order by imposing punishment for crimes.<ref name=\"Lintott, 97\">Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 97.</ref> Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power could also be used to obstruct political opponents.\n\nOne check on a magistrate's power was called ''Collega'' (collegiality). Each magisterial office would be held concurrently by at least two people. Another such check was ''provocatio''. While in Rome, all citizens were protected from coercion, by ''provocatio'', which was an early form of [[due process]]. It was a precursor to ''[[habeas corpus]]''. If any magistrate tried to use the powers of the state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to [[Cursus honorum|wait ten years]] before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their ''imperium'' extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a [[promagistrate]]), without officially holding that office.<ref name=\"Lintott, 113\">Lintott, 113</ref>\n\nThe [[Roman consul|consuls]] of the Roman Republic were the highest ranking ordinary magistrates. Each served for one year.<ref>Byrd, 20</ref> They retained several elements of the former kingly regalia, such as the ''[[toga praetexta]]'', and the ''[[fasces]]'', which represented the power to inflict physical punishment. Consular powers included the kings' former \"power to command\" (''[[imperium]]'') and appointment of new senators. Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government. They would preside over the senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army.<ref name=\"Byrd, 179\">Byrd, 179</ref> His authority abroad would be nearly absolute. [[Praetor]]s administered civil law<ref name=\"Byrd, 32\">Byrd, 32</ref> and commanded provincial armies. Every five years, two [[Roman Censor|censors]] were elected for an 18-month term, during which they would conduct a [[census]]. During the census, they could enroll citizens in the senate, or purge them from the senate.<ref name=\"Byrd, 26\">Byrd, 26</ref> [[Aediles]] were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome, such as managing public games and shows. The [[quaestor]]s would usually assist the consuls in Rome, and the governors in the provinces. Their duties were often financial.\n\nSince the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were [[sacrosanct]]. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. It was a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to otherwise interfere with him.<ref name=\"Byrd, 23\">Byrd, 23</ref> In times of military emergency, a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] would be appointed for a term of six months.<ref name=\"Byrd, 24\">Byrd, 24</ref> Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.\n\n==Military==\n{{RomanMilitary}}\n{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}\nRome's military secured Rome's territory and borders, and helped to impose tribute on conquered peoples. Rome's armies had a formidable reputation; but Rome also \"produced [its] share of incompetents\"<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 15</ref> and catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of Rome's greatest enemies, such as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Hannibal]],<ref>Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 312</ref> to win early battles but lose the war.\n\n===Hoplite armies (509\u2013c. 315 BC)===\n{{Main|Phalanx}}\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the [[Etruscans]] to the north,<ref>Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 17.</ref> who themselves are believed to have copied [[phalanx formation|their style of warfare]] from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the [[phalanx formation]] into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, [[Servius Tullius]] (ruled 578\u2013534).<ref>Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 18.</ref> According to [[Livy]]<ref>Livy, i. 43.</ref> and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]],<ref>''Roman Antiquities'', 4.16\u201318</ref> the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it. The phalanx was effective in large, open spaces, but not on the hilly terrain of the central [[Italian peninsula]]. In the 4th century, the Romans replaced it with the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to [[Marcus Furius Camillus]] and placed shortly after the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic invasion]] of 390; more likely, it was copied from Rome's [[Samnium|Samnite]] enemies to the south,<ref>''Early Roman Armies'', pp. 37\u201338.</ref> following the [[Samnite Wars|Second Samnite War]] (326\u2013304).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/samnite_wars.htm |title=Rome, The Samnite Wars |publisher=History-world.org |accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Manipular legion (c. 315\u2013107 BC)===\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing (centre-right) two Roman foot-soldiers c. 122 BC.

The manipular army was based upon social class, age and military experience.<ref>Boak, '' A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 87</ref> ''Maniples'' were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. They were typically deployed into three discrete lines based on the three [[heavy infantry]] types:\n\n# The first line maniple were the ''[[hastati]]'', leather-armoured infantry soldiers who wore a bronze breastplate and a bronze helmet adorned with 3 feathers approximately {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height and carried an iron-clad wooden shield. They were armed with a sword and two throwing spears.\n# The second line were the ''[[principes]]''. They were armed and armoured in the same manner as the hastati, but wore a lighter coat of mail rather than a solid brass breastplate.\n# The ''[[triarii]]'' formed the third line. They were the last remnant of the hoplite-style troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured like the ''principes'', with the exception that they carried a lighter spear.<ref name=\"polybiusB6\">PolybiusB6</ref>\n\nThe three infantry classes<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 18</ref> may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.\n\nThe heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\"/> The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the third line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and a small shield, as well as several light javelins.\n\nRome's military confederation with the other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army was provided by the [[Socii]], such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 men at the beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in ''alae'', or ''wings'', roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300.\n\n[[File:Togatus Barberini 2392.PNG|thumb|upright|The \"[[Togatus Barberini]]\", depicting a Roman senator holding the ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'' ([[effigies]]) of deceased ancestors in his hands; marble, late 1st century BC; head (not belonging): mid 1st century BC]]\nA small navy had operated at a fairly low level after about 300, but it was massively upgraded about forty years later, during the [[First Punic War]]. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] (\"Punic\") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.<ref name=\"websterP156\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 156</ref>\n\nThe extraordinary demands of the [[Punic Wars]], in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term.<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 2</ref> In 217, near the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]], Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population,<ref name=\"gabbaP9\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 9</ref> partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it did not have to do in the past.\n\nThe distinction between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the provision of allied troops.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 11</ref> Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 143</ref>\n\n===Legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107\u201327 BC)===\n{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}\nIn a process known as the [[Marian reforms]], Roman consul [[Gaius Marius]] carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10</ref> In 107, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service.<ref>Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 1</ref> The distinction among the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.<ref name=\"SantosuossoP29\">Santosuosso, p. 29</ref>\n\nUnlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat \"acquired a stronger and more elevated position\"<ref name=\"gabbaP25\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 25</ref> within the state.\n\nThe legions of the late Republic were almost entirely heavy infantry. The main legionary sub-unit was a ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]'' of approximately 480 infantrymen, further divided into six [[Centuria#Military|centuries]] of 80 men each.<ref name=\"luttwakP14\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 14</ref> Each century comprised 10 \"tent groups\" of 8 men. Cavalry were used as scouts and dispatch riders, rather than as battlefield forces.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 116</ref> Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 15</ref>\n\nThe army's most obvious deficiency lay in its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 43</ref> Particularly in the East, Rome's slow-moving infantry legions were often confronted by fast-moving cavalry-troops, and found themselves at a tactical disadvantage.\n[[File:D473-bir\u00e8me romaine-Liv2-ch10.png|thumb|A [[Roman navy|Roman naval]] [[bireme]] depicted in a [[relief]] from the Temple of [[Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna Primigenia]] in [[Praeneste]],<ref>D.B.

[[Julius Caesar]] assembled a fleet to cross the [[English Channel]] and invade ''[[Britannia]]''. [[Pompey]] raised a fleet to deal with the [[Cilicia]]n pirates who threatened Rome's Mediterranean trading routes.

A form of limited, theoretically voluntary slavery (debt bondage, or [[nexum]]) allowed wealthy creditors to negotiate payment of debt through bonded service. Poor, landless citizens of the lowest class (''proletarii'') might contract their sons to a creditor, patron or third party employer to obtain an income, or to pay off family debts. ''Nexum'' was only abolished when slave labour became more readily available, most notably during the Punic wars.<ref>Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 126.</ref><ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 238, 379\u2013380, citing Livy, 9. 46. 13\u201314 for the poorest citizens as ''forensis facto... humillimi'' (the \"lowest of the low\").</ref><ref>Alf\u00f6ldy, Geza, ''The Social History of Rome'', p. 17.</ref>\n[[File:BM GR 1867.5-8.55 - 01.JPG|thumb|An inscribed [[Roman funerary art|funerary relief]] of Aurelius Hermia and his wife Aurelia Philematum, [[Slavery in ancient Rome|former slaves]] who married after their manumission, 80 BC, from a tomb along the [[Via Nomentana]] in Rome]]\n\nSlaves were simultaneously family members and family property. They could be bought, sold, acquired through warfare, or born and raised within their master's household,. They could also buy their freedom with money saved or the offer of future services as a freedman or woman, and their sons could be eligible for citizenship; this degree of social mobility was unusual in the ancient world. Freed slaves and the master who freed them retained certain legal and moral mutual obligations. This was the bottom rung of one of Rome's fundamental social and economic institutions, the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client-patron relationship]]. At the top rung were the senatorial families of the landowning nobility, both patrician and plebeian, bound by shifting allegiances and mutual competition. A plebiscite of 218 forbade senators and their sons to engage in substantial trade or money-lending.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 288\u2013291.</ref><ref>Flower, ''Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', pp. 173\u2013175; Flower is describing the restrictions placed on Senatorial business activity by the ''plebiscitum Claudianum'' of 218 BC, and related legislation: it may have been intended to reduce opportunity for bribery and corruption, or to help Senators focus exclusively on their tasks in government.</ref> A wealthy equestrian class emerged, not subject to the same trading constraints as the senate.<ref>D'Arms, J.

[[Marriage in ancient Rome|Marriage]] offered opportunities for political alliance and social advancement. Patricians usually married in a form known as ''[[confarreatio]]'', which transferred the bride from her father's absolute control or \"hand\" (''manus'') to that of her husband.<ref>David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Patrician status could only be inherited through birth; an early [[Twelve Tables|law]], introduced by the reactionary [[Decemviri]] but rescinded in 445, sought to prevent marriages between patricians and plebeians; any resulting offspring may not have been legally recognised.<ref>The plebeian involved in such a marriage would likely have been wealthy: see Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', p. 255.</ref> Among ordinary plebeians, different marriage forms offered married women considerable more freedom than their patrician counterparts, until ''manus'' marriage was replaced by ''free marriage'', in which the wife remained under the legal authority of her absent father, not her husband.<ref>Bruce W.

Plebeian marriage forms include ''coemptio'' (marriage \"by purchase\" \u2013 a form of dowry), and ''usus'' (marriage recognised through the couple's \"habitual cohabitation\")</ref> Infant mortality was high. Towards the end of the Republic, the birthrate began to fall among the elite. Some wealthy, childless citizens resorted to [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoption]] to provide male heirs for their estates, and to forge political alliances. Adoption was subject to the senate's approval; the notoriously unconventional patrician politician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] had himself and his family adopted into a plebeian clan, so that he could hold a plebeian tribunate.\n\n==Trade and economy==\n===Farming===\n{{Main|Roman agriculture}}\nThe Republic was created during a time of warfare, economic recession, food shortages, and plebeian debt. In wartime, plebeian farmers were liable to conscription. In peacetime, most depended on whatever cereal crops they could produce on small farming plots, allotted to them by the state, or by patrons. Soil fertility varied from place to place, and natural water sources were unevenly distributed throughout the landscape. In good years, a pleb small-holder might trade a small surplus, to meet his family's needs, or to buy the armatures required for his military service. In other years, crop failure through soil exhaustion, adverse weather, disease or military incursions could lead to poverty, unsupported borrowing, and debt. Nobles invested much of their wealth in ever-larger, more efficient farming units, exploiting a range of soil conditions though mixed farming techniques. As farming was labour-intensive, and military conscription reduced the pool of available manpower, over time the wealthy became ever more reliant upon the increasingly plentiful slave-labour provided by successful military campaigns.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 265\u2013268, 283.</ref><ref name=\"Bannon, pp. 5\">Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors'', pp. 5\u201310.</ref><ref>Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 118\u2013122, 135, 136.</ref> Well managed agricultural estates helped provide for clients and dependents, support an urban family home, and fund the owner's public and military career. Large estates yielded cash for bribes, and security for borrowing. Later Roman moralists idealised farming as an intrinsically noble occupation: [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus#First dictatorship|Cincinnatus]] left off his ploughing reluctantly, to serve as [[Roman dictator|dictator]], and returned once his state duties were done.<ref>Livy, iii. 26\u201329.</ref><ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 412\u2013413: [[Cato the Elder]] dwelt upon the probably mythical poverty of leading Romans such as [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Manius Dentatus]], and the incorruptible [[Gaius Fabricius Luscinus]].</ref><ref>Rosenstein, Nathan, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20430663 Aristocrats and Agriculture in the Middle and Late Republic]\", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 98 (2008), pp. 1\u20133.</ref>\n\nIn law, land taken by conquest was ''[[ager publicus]]'' (public land). In practise, much of it was exploited by the nobility, using slaves rather than free labour. Rome's expansionist wars and colonisations were at least partly driven by the land-hunger of displaced peasants, who must otherwise join the swelling, dependent population of urban ''plebs''.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 265\u2013268.</ref> At the end of the second Punic War, Rome added the fertile ''ager Campanus'', suitable for intense cultivation of vines, olives and cereals. Like the grain-fields of Sicily \u2013 seized after the same conflict \u2013 it was likely farmed extra-legally by leading landowners, using slave-gangs. A portion of Sicily's grain harvest was sent to Rome as [[tribute]], for redistribution by the ''aediles''.<ref>Gabba, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 8, pp. 197\u2013198.</ref><ref>Lintott, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, p. 55: A later consular investigation into similar land-encroachments is dated to 175.</ref> The urban ''plebs'' increasingly relied on firstly subsidised, then free grain.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 328\u2013329.</ref>\n\n[[File:Esquilino - acquedotto Anio Vetus 1000968.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the [[Aqua Anio Vetus]], a [[Roman aqueduct]] built in 272 BC]]\nWith the introduction of aqueducts (from 312), suburban market-farms could be supplied with run-off or waste aqueduct water. Perishable commodities such as flowers (for perfumes, and festival garlands), fresh grapes, vegetables and orchard fruits, and small livestock such as pigs and chickens, could be farmed close to municipal and urban markets.<ref name=\"Bannon, pp. 5\"/> In the early 2nd century [[Cato the Elder]] tried to block the illicit tapping of rural aqueducts by the elite, who thus exploited the increased productivity of cheaply bought, formerly \"dry\" farmland; a law was duly passed, but fines for abuses, and taxes on profits, proved more realistic solutions than an outright ban. Food surpluses, no matter how obtained, kept prices low.<ref>Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors'', pp. 5\u201310; citing Hodge, ''Roman Aqueducts'', p. 219 for Cato's diatribe against the misuse of aqueduct water by [[Lucius Furius Purpureo|L.

By the late Republican era, Roman wine had been transformed from an indifferent local product for local consumption, to a major domestic and export commodity.<ref>Rosenstein, Nathan, \"Aristocrats and Agriculture in the Middle Republic\", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 98 (2008), pp. 2\u201316.</ref><ref>Nicolet, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, pp. 612\u2013615: up to this time, the Roman elite had favoured Greek imported wine over any of Rome's homegrown versions.</ref>\n\nRoman writers have little to say about large-scale stock-breeding, but make passing references to its profitability. Drummond speculates that this might reflect elite preoccupations with historical grain famines, or long-standing competition between agriculturalists and pastoralists. While agriculture was a seasonal practise, pasturage was a year-round requirement. Some of Republican Rome's early agricultural legislation sought to balance the competing public grazing rights of small farmers, the farming elite, and [[Transhumance|transhumant]] pastoralists, who maintained an ancient right to herd, graze and water their animals between low-lying winter pastures and upland summer pastures. From the early second century, transhumance was practised on a vast scale, as an investment opportunity.<ref name=\"Drummond, pp. 118\">Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 118\u2013122.</ref><ref>Gabba, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 8, pp. 237\u2013239.</ref> Though meat and hides were valuable by products of stock-raising, cattle were primarily reared to pull carts and ploughs, and sheep were bred for their wool, the mainstay of the Roman clothing industry. Horses, mules and donkeys were bred as civil and military transport. Pigs bred prolifically, and could be raised at little cost by any small farmer with rights to [[pannage]]. Their central dietary role is reflected by their use as sacrificial victims in domestic cults, funerals, and cults to agricultural deities.<ref name=\"Drummond, pp. 118\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Religion in ancient Rome}}\n{{further|List of ancient Roman deities|List of Roman agricultural deities}}\n[[File:Temple of portunus front.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Portunus]], god of grain storage, keys, livestock and ports.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=W.

Every individual, occupation and location had a protective [[Tutelary deity#Ancient Rome|tutelary deity]], or sometimes several. Each was associated with a particular, highly prescriptive form of prayer and sacrifice. Piety (''pietas'') was the correct, dutiful and timely performance of such actions. The well-being of each Roman household was thought to depend on daily cult to its [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] (guardian deities, or spirits), ancestors, and the [[Genius (mythology)|divine generative essence]] embodied within its ''pater familias''. A family which neglected its religious responsibilities could not expect to prosper.<ref>Orr, D.

Accidental errors could be remedied by repeating the rite correctly, or by an additional sacrifice; outright sacrilege threatened the bonds between the human and divine, and carried the death penalty. As divine retribution was invoked in the lawful swearing of oaths and vows, oath-breakers forfeited their right to divine protection, and might be killed with impunity.<ref>Halm, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 241, 242.</ref>\n\nRoman religious authorities were unconcerned with personal beliefs or privately funded cults, unless they offended natural or divine laws, or undermined the ''mos maiorum'' (roughly, \"the way of the ancestors\"); the relationship between gods and mortals should be sober, contractual, and of mutual benefit.

During the crisis of the [[Second Punic War]] an unprecedented number of reported prodigies were expiated, in more than twenty days of public ritual and sacrifices. In the same period, Rome recruited the [[Cybele|\"Trojan\" Magna Mater (Great Mother of the Gods)]] to the Roman cause, \"Hellenised\" the native Roman cult to [[Ceres (mythology)#Ceres and Proserpina|Ceres]]; and took control of the [[Bacchanalia]] festival in Rome and its allied territories.

For instance, [[Scipio Africanus]] claimed Jupiter as a personal mentor. Some gentes claimed a divine descent, often thanks to a [[false etymology]] of their name; the Caecilii Metelli pretended to descend from Vulcan through his son [[Caeculus]], the [[Mamilii]] from [[Circe]] through her granddaughter Mamilia, the [[Julia (gens)|Julii Caesares]] and the [[Aemilii]] from Venus through her grandsons [[Iulus]] and Aemylos.

As every family's ''pater familias'' was responsible for his family's cult activities, he was effectively the senior priest of his own household. Likewise, most priests of public cult were expected to marry, produce children, and support their families.<ref>The [[Vestal Virgins]] were the major exception. The [[Galli]], mendicant eunuch priets of the [[Magna Mater]], were forbidden Roman citizenship.</ref> In the early Republic the patricians, as \"fathers\" to the Roman people, claimed the right of seniority to lead and control the state's relationship with the divine. Patrician families, in particular the ''Cornelii'', ''Postumii'' and ''Valerii'', monopolised the leading state priesthoods: the ''[[flamines]]'' of [[Flamen Dialis|Jupiter]], [[Flamen Martialis|Mars]] and [[Flamen Quirinalis|Quirinus]], as well as the ''[[pontifices]]''. The patrician ''[[Flamen Dialis]]'' employed the \"greater auspices\" (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auspicia maiora|auspicia maiora]]'') to consult with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] on significant matters of State.\n\nTwelve \"lesser flaminates\" (''Flamines minores''), were open to plebeians, or reserved to them.

The [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] (\"Jupiter, Best and Greatest\") stood on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. Among the settled areas outside the ''pomerium'' was the nearby [[Aventine Hill]]. It was traditionally associated with Romulus' unfortunate twin, [[Remus]], and in later history with the Latins, and the Roman ''plebs''.

Beneath its southern slopes ran the [[Via Sacra|sacred way]], next to the former palace of the kings ([[Regia]]), the [[House of the Vestals]] and [[Temple of Vesta]]. Close by were the [[Lupercal]] shrine and the cave where Romulus and Remus were said to have been suckled by the she-wolf. On the flat area between the Aventine and Palatine was the [[Circus Maximus]], which hosted chariot races and religious games. Its several shrines and temples included those to Rome's indigenous sun-god, [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], the moon-goddess [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the grain-storage god, [[Consus]], and the obscure goddess [[Murcia]]. A temple to [[Hercules]] stood in the [[Forum Boarium]], near the Circus starting gate. Every district (''[[Vicus]]'') of the city had a crossroads shrine to its own protective Lares.\n\nWhereas Republican (and thereafter, Imperial) Romans marked the passage of years with the names of their ruling consuls, their [[Roman calendar|calendars]] marked the anniversaries of religious foundations to particular deities, the days when official business was permitted (''fas''), and those when it was not (''nefas''). The Romans observed an eight-day week; markets were held on the ninth day. Each month was presided over by a particular, usually major deity. The oldest calendars were lunar, structured around the most significant periods in the agricultural cycle, and the religious duties required to yield a good harvest.\n\n===In the military===\n[[File:Gaius Julius Caesar, denarius, 44 BC, RRC 480-3.jpg|thumb|Denarius of Caesar, minted just before his murder, in 44 BC.

The reverse with Venus alludes to his claimed descent from the goddess.<ref>Crawford, ''Roman Republican Coinage'', pp. 487\u2013495.</ref>]]\nBefore any campaign or battle, Roman commanders took [[auspices]], or [[Haruspex|haruspices]], to seek the gods' opinion regarding the likely outcome. Military success was achieved through a combination of personal and collective ''virtus'' (roughly, \"manly virtue\") and divine will. [[Roman triumph|Triumphal generals]] dressed as Jupiter Capitolinus, and laid their victor's laurels at his feet. Religious negligence, or lack of ''virtus'', provoked divine wrath and led to military disaster.<ref>Orlin, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 58.</ref><ref>Beard, North, Price, ''Religions of Rome'', Vol. I, pp. 44, 59, 60, 143.</ref> Military oaths dedicated the oath-takers life to Rome's gods and people; defeated soldiers were expected to take their own lives, rather than survive as captives. Examples of ''[[devotio]]'', as performed by the [[Decia (gens)|Decii Mures]], in which soldiers offered and gave their lives to the ''[[Di inferi]]'' (gods of the underworld) in exchange for Roman victory were celebrated as the highest good.\n\nSome of Republican Rome's leading deities were acquired through military actions. In the earliest years of the Republic, [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] promised Veii's goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] a temple in Rome as incentive for her desertion ''([[evocatio]])''. He conquered the city in her name, brought her cult statue to Rome \"with miraculous ease\" and dedicated a temple to her on the Aventine Hill.<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 299, citing Livy xxi. 8\u20139 and xxii. 3\u20136.

The city rapidly outgrew its original sacred boundary (''[[pomerium]]''), and its [[Servian Wall|first city walls]]. Further growth was constrained by an inadequate fresh-water supply. Rome's first [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] (312) built during the Punic wars crisis, provided a plentiful, clean supply.

Nobles and rich patrons lived in spacious, well-appointed town houses; they were expected to keep \"open house\" for their peers and clients. A semi-public ''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]'' typically functioned as a meeting-space, and a vehicle for display of wealth, artistic taste, and religious piety. Noble ''atria'' were also display areas for ancestor-masks (''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'').<ref>\"The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual:\" Lott, John.

Most surviving [[Latin literature]] is written in [[Classical Latin]], a highly stylised and polished [[literary language]] which developed from early and vernacular spoken Latin, from the 1st century. Most Latin speakers used [[Vulgar Latin]], which significantly differed from Classical Latin in grammar, vocabulary, and eventually pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nFollowing various military conquests in the [[Greek East]], Romans adapted a number of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system.<ref name=\"Legacy\">Nanette R.

Education began at the age of around six, and in the next six to seven years, boys and girls were expected to learn the basics of reading, writing and counting. By the age of twelve, they would be learning Latin, Greek, grammar and literature, followed by training for public speaking.

From the mid-Republic, Roman authors followed Greek models, to produce free-verse and verse-form plays and other in Latin; for example, [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote tragedies and comedies. The earliest Latin works to have survived intact are the comedies of [[Plautus]], written during the mid-Republic. Works of well-known, popular playwrights were sometimes commissioned for performance at religious festivals; many of these were [[Satyr plays]], based on Greek models and Greek myths. The poet [[Gnaeus Naevius|Naevius]] may be said to have written the first Roman epic poem, although [[Ennius]] was the first Roman poet to write an epic in an adapted Latin hexameter. However, only fragments of Ennius' epic, the ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]'', have survived, yet both Naevius and Ennius influenced later Latin epic, especially Virgil's Aeneid. [[Lucretius]], in his ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' explicated the tenets of [[Epicurean]] philosophy.\n\nThe politician, poet and philosopher [[Cicero]]'s literary output was remarkably prolific and so influential on contemporary and later literature that the period from 83BC to 43BC has been called the 'Age of Cicero'. His oratory set new standards for centuries, and continue to influence modern speakers, while his philosophical works, which were, for the most part, Cicero's Latin adaptations of Greek Platonic and Epicurean works influenced many later philosophers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zauzmer |first1=Julie |title=Donald Trump, the Cicero of 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2016/11/03/donald-trump-the-cicero-of-2016/ |website=The Washington Post (WP Company LLC) [US] |accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=Miriam |editor1-last=Boardman |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Griffin |editor2-first=Jasper |editor3-last=Murray |editor3-first=Oswyn |title=The Oxford History of the Classical World |date=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-285236-1 |pages=454\u2013459 |chapter=Cicero and Rome}}</ref> Other prominent writers of this period include the grammarian and historian of religion [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], the politician, general and military commentator [[Julius Caesar]], the historian [[Sallust]] and the love poet [[Catullus]].\n\n===Sports and entertainment===\n[[File:Amphitheatre 1 Pompeii.jpg|thumb|The [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii]], built around 70 BC and buried by [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|the eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] 79 AD, once hosted spectacles with [[gladiator]]s.]]\nThe city of Rome had a place called the [[Campus Martius]] (\"Field of Mars\"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers.

It was during this period that [[Rise of Rome|Rome's control expanded]] from the [[city of Rome|city's]] immediate surroundings to [[hegemony]] over the entire [[Mediterranean|Mediterranean world]].\n\nRoman society under the Republic was a cultural mix of Latin, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], and Greek elements, which is especially visible in the [[List of Roman deities|Roman Pantheon]]. Its political organisation was strongly influenced by the [[Polis|Greek city states]] of [[Magna Graecia]], with collective and annual magistracies, overseen by a [[Roman Senate|senate]].<ref>Arnaldo Momigliano, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. VII part 2, pp. 110, 111.</ref> The top magistrates were the two [[Roman consul|consuls]], who had an extensive range of executive, legislative, judicial, military, and religious powers. While there were elections each year, the Republic was not a [[democracy]], but an [[oligarchy]], as a small number of powerful families (called ''[[Gens|gentes]]'') monopolised the main magistracies. Roman institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic to adapt to the difficulties it faced, such as the creation of [[Promagistrate|promagistracies]] to rule its conquered [[Roman province|provinces]], or the composition of the senate.\n\nUnlike the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' of the [[Roman Empire]], the Republic was in a state of quasi-perpetual war throughout its existence. Its first enemies were its [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] neighbours as well as the [[Gauls]], who even [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|sacked the city]] in 387 BC. The [[Republic]] nonetheless demonstrated extreme resilience and always managed to overcome its losses, however catastrophic. After the Gallic Sack, Rome conquered the whole Italian peninsula in a century, which turned the Republic into a major power in the Mediterranean. The Republic's greatest enemy was doubtless [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], against which it waged [[Punic Wars|three wars]]. The [[Punics|Punic]] general [[Hannibal]] famously invaded Italy by [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|crossing the Alps]] and inflicted on Rome two devastating defeats at [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], but the Republic once again recovered and won the war thanks to [[Scipio Africanus]] at the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202 BC. With Carthage defeated, Rome became the dominant power of the ancient Mediterranean world. It then embarked on a long series of difficult conquests, after having notably defeated [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] of the [[Seleucid Empire]], the [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] [[Viriathus]], the [[Numidia]]n [[Jugurtha]], the great [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], the [[Gaul]] [[Vercingetorix]], and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] queen [[Cleopatra]].\n\nAt home, the Republic similarly experienced a long streak of social and political crises, which ended in several violent civil wars. At first, the [[Conflict of the Orders]] opposed the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], the closed oligarchic elite, to the far more numerous ''plebs'', who finally achieved political equality in several steps during the 4th century BC. Later, the vast conquests of the Republic disrupted its society, as the immense influx of slaves they brought enriched the aristocracy, but ruined the peasantry and urban workers. In order to solve this issue, several social reformers, known as the ''[[Populares]]'', tried to pass agrarian laws, but the [[Gracchi|Gracchi brothers]], [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus|Saturninus]], or [[Clodius Pulcher]] were all murdered by their opponents, the ''[[Optimates]]'', keepers of the traditional aristocratic order. Mass slavery also caused three [[Servile Wars]]; the last of them was led by [[Spartacus]], a skilful gladiator who ravaged Italy and left Rome powerless until his defeat in 71 BC. In this context, the last decades of the Republic were marked by the rise of great generals, who exploited their military conquests and the factional situation in Rome to gain control of the political system. [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] (between 105\u201386 BC), then [[Sulla]] (between 82\u201378 BC) dominated in turn the Republic; both used extraordinary powers to purge their opponents. These multiple tensions led to a series of [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]]; the first between the two generals [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]]. Despite his victory and appointment as [[Roman dictator|dictator for life]], Caesar was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] in 44 BC. Caesar's heir [[Octavian]] and lieutenant [[Mark Antony]] defeated Caesar's assassins [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in 42 BC, but then turned against each other. The final defeat of Mark Antony and his ally [[Reign of Cleopatra|Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, and the Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to [[Octavian]] as ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' in 27 BC \u2013 which effectively made him the first [[Roman emperor]] \u2013 thus ended the Republic.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation (509 BC)===\n{{main|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}\nSince the [[foundation of Rome]], its rulers had been monarchs, elected for life by the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician noblemen]] who made up the [[Roman senate|Roman Senate]]. The last [[Roman Kingdom|Roman king]] was [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (\"Tarquin the Proud\"). In the traditional histories, Tarquin was expelled in 509 because his son [[Sextus Tarquinius]] had raped the noblewoman [[Lucretia]], who afterwards took her own life. Lucretia's father, her husband [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], and Tarquin's nephew [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] mustered support from the Senate and army, and forced Tarquin into exile in [[Etruria]].<ref>Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215\u2013218: Cornell offers a summary of \"Livy's prose narrative\" and derived literary works relating to the expulsion of the kings.</ref><ref>[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]], iv. 64\u201385.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/4D*.html]</ref><ref>[[Titus Livius|Livy]], i. 57\u201360</ref>\n\nThe Senate agreed to abolish kingship. Most of the king's former functions were transferred to two consuls, who were elected to office for a term of one year. Each consul had the capacity to act as a check on his [[Collegiality#Collegiality in the Roman Republic|colleague]], if necessary through the same power of ''[[veto]]'' that the kings had held. If a consul abused his powers in office, he could be prosecuted when his term expired. Brutus and Collatinus became Republican Rome's first [[Roman consul|consuls]]. Despite Collatinus' role in the creation of the Republic, he belonged to the same family as the former king, and was forced to abdicate his office and leave Rome. He was replaced as co-consul by [[Publius Valerius Publicola]].<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 226\u2013228.</ref>\n\nMost modern scholarship describes these events as the quasi-mythological detailing of an aristocratic coup within Tarquin's own family, not a popular revolution.

II</ref>\n\n====Plebeians and patricians====\n{{Main|Conflict of the Orders}}\nBeginning with their revolt against Tarquin, and continuing through the early years of the Republic, Rome's patrician aristocrats were the dominant force in politics and society. They initially formed a closed group of about 50 large families, called [[Gens|''gentes'']], who monopolised Rome's magistracies, state priesthoods and senior military posts. The most prominent of these families were the [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]],{{efn-lr|Throughout the Republic, the Cornelii held 75 consulships and 27 consular tribuneships, almost 10% of all the consulships of the period.}} followed by the [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]]. The power, privilege and influence of leading families derived from their wealth, in particular from their landholdings, their position as [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patrons]], and their numerous clients.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 289\u2013291.</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of Roman citizens were commoners of various social degrees. They formed the backbone of Rome's economy, as smallholding farmers, managers, artisans, traders, and tenants. In times of war, they could be summoned for military service. Most had little direct political influence over the Senate's decisions or the laws it passed, including the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the consular system. During the early Republic, the ''[[plebs]]'' (or plebeians) emerged as a self-organised, culturally distinct group of commoners, with their own internal hierarchy, laws, customs, and interests.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 256\u2013259: ''Plebs'' (\"the mass\") was originally a disparaging term, but was adopted as a badge of pride by those whom it was meant to insult. It might not have referred to wealthier commoners.</ref>\n\nPlebeians had no access to high religious and civil office,{{efn-lr|Several historians, notably [[Tim Cornell]], have challenged this view, saying that in the early Republic the [[Fasti Consulares]] bear names that are distinctively plebeian. Therefore, they claim that the plebeians were only excluded from higher offices by the Decemvirate in 451 BC. More recently, [[Corey Brennan]] has dismissed this theory, arguing that the consular plebeians would not have let the Decemvirs take their power away that easily (cf. ''The Praetorship'', pp. 24, 25). He explains the \"plebeian\" names in the Fasti by some patrician gentes who later died out, or lost their status. Consequently, this article follows the traditional narrative that the plebeians were excluded from the start.}} and could be punished for offences against laws of which they had no knowledge.<ref>Orlin, ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 59\u201360.</ref> For the poorest, one of the few effective political tools was their withdrawal of labour and services, in a \"''[[secessio plebis]]''\"; they would leave the city en masse, and allow their social superiors to fend for themselves. The [[First secessio plebis|first such secession]] occurred in 494, in protest at the abusive treatment of plebeian debtors by the wealthy during a famine.<ref>The traditional date for the first secession is given by Livy as 494; many other dates have been suggested, and several such events probably took place: see Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215\u2013218, 256\u2013261, 266.</ref> The Senate was compelled to give them direct access to the written civil and religious laws, and to the [[Elections in the Roman Republic|electoral]] and political process. To represent their interests, the ''plebs'' elected [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunes]], who were personally [[Sacrosanctity|sacrosanct]], immune to arbitrary arrest by any magistrate, and had [[veto]] power over the passage of legislation.<ref>For a discussion of the duties and legal status of plebeian tribunes and aediles, see Andrew Lintott, ''Violence in Republican Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QIKEpOP4lLIC&pg=PA92 pp. 92\u2013101].</ref>\n\n====Celtic invasion of Italy (390\u2013387 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Roman-Gallic Wars}}\nBy 390, several [[Gauls|Gallic tribes]] were invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. The Romans were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe, the [[Senones]],<ref>Florus, ''Epitome'', i. 13.</ref> invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the [[Battle of the Allia|Battle of Allia River]] around 390\u2013387 BC. The Gauls, led by the chieftain [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]], defeated the Roman army of approximately 15,000 troops, pursued the fleeing Romans back to Rome, and sacked the city before being either driven off or bought off.\n\n===Roman expansion in Italy (387\u2013272 BC)===\n\n====Wars against Italian neighbours====\n[[File:Roman conquest of Italy.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Map showing Roman expansion in [[Italy]]]]\n{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}\n{{Campaignbox Samnite Wars}}\nFrom 343 to 341, Rome won [[First Samnite war|two battles]] against their [[Samnites|Samnite]] neighbours, but were unable to consolidate their gains, due to the outbreak of war with former Latin allies.\n\nIn the [[Latin War]] (340\u2013338), Rome defeated a coalition of Latins at the battles of [[Battle of Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] and the [[Battle of Trifanum|Trifanum]].

The war ended with Samnite defeat at the [[Battle of Bovianum]] (305). By the following year, Rome had annexed most Samnite territory, and began to establish colonies there; but in 298 the Samnites rebelled, and defeated a Roman army, in a [[Third Samnite War]]. Following this success they built a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome.<ref>Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 53.</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Populonia]] in 282 Rome finished off the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.\n\n====Rise of the plebeian nobility====\nIn the 4th century, plebeians gradually obtained political equality with patricians. The starting point was in 400, when the first plebeian consular tribunes were elected; likewise, several subsequent consular colleges counted plebeians (in 399, 396, 388, 383, and 379). The reason behind this sudden gain is unknown,<ref>It has nevertheless been speculated that [[Lucius Atilius Luscus]] in 444, and [[Quintus Antonius Meranda]] in 422 were also plebeian. cf. Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', p. 50.</ref> but it was limited as patrician tribunes retained preeminence over their plebeian colleagues.<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 338.</ref> In 385, the former consul and saviour of the besieged Capitol [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus]] is said to have sided with the plebeians, ruined by the Sack and largely indebted to patricians. The issue of debt relief for the plebs remained indeed pressing throughout the century. Livy tells that Capitolinus sold his estate to repay the debt of many of them, and even went over to the plebs, the first patrician to do so. Nevertheless, the growing unrest he had caused led to his trial for seeking kingly power; he was sentenced to death and thrown from the [[Tarpeian Rock]].<ref>Livy, vi. 11, 13\u201330.</ref><ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 331, 332.</ref>\n\nBetween 376 and 367, the tribunes of the plebs [[Gaius Licinius Stolo]] and [[Lucius Sextius Lateranus]] continued the plebeian agitation and pushed for an ambitious legislation, known as the ''[[Leges Liciniae Sextiae]]''. Two of their bills attacked patricians' economic supremacy, by creating legal protection against indebtedness and forbidding excessive use of public land, as the ''[[Ager publicus]]'' was monopolised by large landowners. The most important bill opened the consulship to plebeians.<ref name=\"Cornell, p. 337.\">Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 337. Cornell explains that Livy confused the contents of the ''Lex Licinia Sextia'' of 366 the ''Lex Genucia'' of 342.</ref> Other tribunes controlled by the patricians vetoed the bills, but Stolo and Lateranus retaliated by vetoing the elections for five years while being continuously re-elected by the plebs, resulting in a stalemate.<ref>Livy mentions at least two patricians favourable to the tribunes: [[Marcus Fabius Ambustus (consular tribune 381)|Marcus Fabius Ambustus]], Stolo's father-in-law, and the dictator for 368 [[Publius Manlius Capitolinus]], who appointed the first plebeian ''magister equitum'', Gaius Licinius Calvus.</ref> In 367, they carried a bill creating the ''[[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|Decemviri sacris faciundis]]'', a college of ten priests, of whom five had to be plebeians, therefore breaking patricians' monopoly on priesthoods. Finally, the resolution of the crisis came from the dictator [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]], who made a compromise with the tribunes; he agreed to their bills, while they in return consented to the creation of the offices of praetor and curule aediles, both reserved to patricians. Lateranus also became the first plebeian consul in 366; Stolo followed in 361.<ref>Livy, vi. 36\u201342.</ref><ref>Broughton, vol. I, pp. 108\u2013114.</ref><ref>Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 59\u201361.</ref>\n\nSoon after, plebeians were able to hold both the [[roman dictator|dictatorship]] and the censorship, since former consuls normally filled these senior magistracies. The four time consul [[Gaius Marcius Rutilus]] became the first plebeian dictator in 356 and censor in 351. In 342, the tribune of the plebs Lucius Genucius passed his ''[[Leges Genuciae]]'', which abolished interest on loans, in a renewed effort to tackle indebtedness, required the election of at least one plebeian consul each year, and prohibited a magistrate from holding the same magistracy for the next ten years or two magistracies in the same year.<ref>Livy, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0154%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D42 vii. 42].</ref><ref name=\"Cornell, p. 337.\" /><ref>Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 65\u201367, where he shows that the ten-year rule was only temporary at this time.</ref> In 339, the plebeian consul and dictator [[Quintus Publilius Philo]] passed three laws extending the powers of the plebeians. His first law followed the ''Lex Genucia'' by reserving one censorship to plebeians, the second made plebiscites binding on all citizens (including patricians), and the third stated that the Senate had to give its prior approval to plebiscites before becoming binding on all citizens (the ''Lex Valeria-Horatia'' of 449 had placed this approval after the vote).<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 342, 343.</ref> Two years later, Publilius ran for the praetorship, probably in a bid to take the last senior magistracy closed to plebeians, which he won.<ref>Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 68, 69.</ref> \n[[File:RomaTempioRotondoForoBoarioJPG.JPG|thumb|The [[Temple of Hercules Victor]], Rome, built in the mid 2nd century BC, most likely by [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]], who won the [[Achaean War]]|208x208px]]\n\nDuring the early republic, senators were chosen by the consuls among their supporters. Shortly before 312, the ''[[Lex Ovinia]]'' transferred this power to the censors, who could only remove senators for misconduct, thus appointing them for life. This law strongly increased the power of the Senate, which was by now protected from the influence of the consuls and became the central organ of government.<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 393, 394.

More recently, Humm described his activity as the continuation of the reforms undertaken since Stolo and Lateranus.}} His tribal reforms were nonetheless cancelled by the next censors, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] and [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 312 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]], his political enemies.<ref>Taylor, ''Voting Districts'', pp. 132\u2013138.</ref> Caecus also launched a vast construction program, building the first aqueduct (''[[Aqua Appia]]''), and the first Roman road (''[[Via Appia]]'').<ref>Bruce MacBain, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638505 Appius Claudius Caecus and the Via Appia]\", in ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 30, No. 2 (1980), pp. 356\u2013372.</ref>\n\nIn 300, the two tribunes of the plebs Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius passed the ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'', which created four plebeian pontiffs, therefore equalling the number of patrician pontiffs, and five plebeian augurs, outnumbering the four patricians in the college.<ref>Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 343.</ref> Eventually the Conflict of the Orders ended with the last secession of the plebs in about 287.

The Romans were nevertheless defeated at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]], as their cavalry were afraid of the elephants of Pyrrhus, who lost a large portion of his army. Pyrrhus then marched on Rome, but could not take any Roman city on his way; facing the prospect of being flanked by the two consular armies, he moved back to Tarentum. His adviser, the orator [[Cineas]], made a peace offer before the Roman Senate, asking Rome to return the land it took from the Samnites and Lucanians, and liberate the Greek cities under its control.

At first, his Sicilian campaign was an easy triumph; he was welcomed as a liberator in every Greek city on his way, even receiving the title of king (''[[basileus]]'') of Sicily. The Carthaginians lifted the [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] before his arrival, but he could not entirely oust them from the island as he failed to take their fortress of [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]].<ref>Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 473\u2013480.</ref> His harsh rule, especially the murder of Thoenon, whom he did not trust, soon led to a widespread antipathy among the Sicilians; some cities even defected to Carthage. In 275, Pyrrhus left the island before he had to face a full-scale rebellion.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, xx. 8.</ref> He returned to Italy, where his Samnite allies were on the verge of losing the war, despite their earlier victory at the [[Battle of the Cranita hills|Cranita hills]]. Pyrrhus again met the Romans at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]]; this time the consul [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Manius Dentatus]] was victorious, and even captured eight elephants. Pyrrhus then withdrew from Italy, but left a garrison in Tarentum, and waged a new campaign in Greece against [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos Gonatas]]. His death in battle at [[Argos]] in 272 forced Tarentum to surrender to Rome. Since it was the last independent city of Italy, Rome now dominated the entire Italian peninsula, and won an international military reputation.<ref>Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 80</ref>\n\n===Punic Wars and expansion in the Mediterranean (264\u2013146 BC)===\n====First Punic War (264\u2013241 BC)====\n{{main|Punic Wars}}\n{{Campaignbox First Punic War}}\n[[File:Dinastie della grecia occidentale, hieron II, 32 litri di siracusa, 274-216 ac ca.JPG|thumb|Coin of [[Hiero II of Syracuse]]]]\n\nRome and [[Carthage]] were initially on friendly terms; [[Polybius]] details three treaties between them, the first dating from the first year of the Republic, the second from 348. The last one was an alliance against Pyrrhus.<ref>Polybius, iii. 22\u201326.</ref><ref>Livy, vii. 27.</ref><ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 517\u2013537.</ref> However, tensions rapidly built on after the departure of the Epirote king. Between 288 and 283, [[Messina|Messena]] in Sicily was taken by the [[Mamertines]], a band of mercenaries formerly employed by [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]]. They plundered the surroundings until [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], the new tyrant of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], defeated them (in either 269 or 265). Carthage could not let him take Messena, as he would have controlled its [[Strait of Messina|Strait]], and garrisoned the city. In effect under a Carthaginian protectorate, the remaining Mamertines appealed to Rome to regain their independence. Senators were divided on whether to help them or not, as it would have meant war with Carthage, since Sicily was in its sphere of influence (the treaties furthermore forbade the island to Rome), and also [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. A supporter of the war, the consul [[Appius Claudius Caudex]] ([[Appius Claudius Caecus|Caecus]]' brother) turned to the [[Tribal Assembly]] to get a favourable vote, by notably promising booty to voters.<ref>Which assembly was consulted has led to many discussions in the academic literature. Goldsworthy favours the Centuriate Assembly, cf. ''The Punic Wars'', p. 69.</ref>\n\nCaudex first secured control of the city with ease. However, Syracuse and Carthage, at war for centuries, made an alliance to counter the invasion and blockaded Messena, but Caudex defeated Hiero and Carthage separately.<ref>Polybius, i. 11, 12.</ref><ref>[[Howard Hayes Scullard|H. H. Scullard]] thinks that Caudex was not successful, since he did not receive a triumph and was succeeded in command by Messalla, his political enemy. Cf. ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 545.</ref> His successor [[Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla|Manius Valerius Corvinus Messalla]] landed with a strong 40,000 men army that conquered eastern Sicily, which prompted Hiero to shift his allegiance and forge a long lasting alliance with Rome. In 262, the Romans moved to the southern coast and besieged [[Agrigento|Akragas]]. In order to raise the siege, Carthage sent reinforcements, including 60 elephants \u2013 the first time they used them, but still lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|battle]].<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 547.</ref> Nevertheless, as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] before, Rome could not take all of Sicily because Carthage's naval superiority prevented them from effectively besieging coastal cities, which could receive supplies from the sea. Using a captured Carthaginian ship as blueprint, Rome therefore launched a massive construction program and built 100 [[quinquereme]]s in only two months, perhaps through an [[assembly line]] organisation. They also invented a new device, the ''[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]'', a grappling engine which enabled a crew to board on an enemy ship.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 113</ref> The consul for 260 [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Scipio Asina]] lost the first [[Battle of the Lipari Islands|naval skirmish]] of the war against [[Hannibal Gisco]] at [[Lipari|Lipara]], but his colleague [[Gaius Duilius|Gaius Dullius]] won a [[Battle of Mylae|great victory]] at [[Milazzo|Mylae]]. He destroyed or captured 44 ships, and was the first Roman to receive a naval triumph, which also included captive Carthaginians for the first time.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 84.</ref> Although Carthage was victorious on land at [[Battle of Thermae|Thermae]] in Sicily, the ''corvus'' made Rome invincible on the waters. The consul [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Scipio]] (Asina's brother) captured [[Corsica]] in 259; his successors won the naval battles of [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] in 258, [[Battle of Tyndaris|Tyndaris]] in 257, and [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Cape Ecnomus]] in 256.<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 548\u2013554.</ref>\n[[File:Corvus.svg|alt=|left|thumb|Diagram of a ''corvus'']]In order to hasten the end of the war, the consuls for 256 decided to carry the operations to Africa, on Carthage's homeland. The consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] landed on the [[Cap Bon]] peninsula with about 18,000 soldiers. He captured the city of [[Siege of Aspis|Aspis]], then repulsed Carthage's counter-attack at [[Battle of Adys|Adys]], and took [[Tunis]]. The Carthaginians supposedly sued him for peace, but his conditions were so harsh that they continued the war instead. They hired Spartan mercenaries, led by [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]], to command their troops.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 88.</ref> In 255, the Spartan general marched on Regulus, still encamped at Tunis, who accepted the battle to avoid sharing the glory with his successor. However, the flat land near Tunis favoured the Punic elephants, [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|which crushed the Roman infantry on the Bagradas plain]]; only 2,000 soldiers escaped, and Regulus was captured. The consuls for 255 nonetheless won a new sounding naval victory at Cape Hermaeum, where they captured 114 warships. This success was spoilt by a storm that annihilated the victorious navy: 184 ships of 264 sank, 25,000 soldiers and 75,000 rowers drowned. The ''corvus'' considerably hindered ships' navigation, and made them vulnerable during tempest. It was abandoned after another similar catastrophe took place in 253 (150 ships sank with their crew). These disasters prevented any significant campaign between 254 and 252.<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 554\u2013557.</ref>\n[[File:C._Caecilius_Metellus_Caprarius,_denarius,_125_BC,_RRC_269-1.jpg|thumb|Denarius of [[Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius|C.

The elephant had thence become the emblem of the powerful [[Caecilia (gens)|Caecilii Metelli]].<ref>Crawford, ''Roman Republican Coinage'', pp. 292, 293.</ref>]]\n\nHostilities in Sicily resumed in 252, with the taking of Thermae by Rome. Carthage countered the following year, by besieging [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], who held [[Palermo|Panormos]] (now Palermo). The consul had dug trenches to counter the elephants, which once hurt by missiles turned back on their own army, resulting in a [[Battle of Panormus|great victory]] for Metellus, who exhibited some captured beasts in the [[Circus Maximus|Circus]]. Rome then besieged the last Carthaginian strongholds in Sicily, [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]] and [[Drepana]], but these cities were impregnable by land. [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]], the consul of 249, recklessly tried to take the latter from the sea, but he suffered a terrible [[Battle of Drepana|defeat]]; his colleague [[Lucius Junius Pullus (consul 249 BC)|Lucius Junius Pullus]] likewise lost his fleet off [[Siege of Lilybaeum (250 BC)|Lilybaeum]]. Without the ''corvus'', Roman warships had lost their advantage. By now, both sides were drained and could not undertake large scale operations; the number of Roman citizens who were being called up for war had been reduced by 17% in two decades, a result of the massive bloodshed. The only military activity during this period was the landing in Sicily of [[Hamilcar Barca]] in 247, who harassed the Romans with a mercenary army from a citadel he built on [[Monte Erice|Mt. Eryx]].<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 559\u2013564.</ref>\n\nFinally, unable to take the Punic fortresses in Sicily, Rome tried to win the decision at sea and built a new navy, thanks to a forced borrowing on the rich. In 242, the 200 quinqueremes of the consul [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] blockaded Drepana. The rescue fleet from Carthage arrived the next year, but was largely undermanned and [[Battle of the Aegates|soundly defeated]] by Catulus. Exhausted and unable to bring supplies to Sicily, Carthage sued for peace. Catulus and Hamilcar negotiated a treaty, which was somewhat lenient to Carthage, but the Roman people rejected it and imposed harsher terms: Carthage had to pay 1000 [[Talents of silver|talents]] immediately and 2200 over ten years, and evacuate Sicily. The fine was so high that Carthage could not pay Hamilcar's mercenaries, who had been shipped back to Africa. They revolted during the [[Mercenary War]], which Carthage had enormous difficulties to suppress. Meanwhile, Rome took advantage of a similar revolt in [[Sardinia]] to seize the island from Carthage, in violation of the peace treaty. This stab-in-the-back led to permanent bitterness in Carthage, and [[revanchism]].<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 565\u2013569.</ref>\n\n====Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Second Punic War}}\nAfter its victory, the Republic shifted its attention to its northern border as the [[Insubres]] and [[Boii]] were threatening Italy.<ref>Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', p. 217.</ref> Meanwhile, Carthage compensated the loss of Sicily and Sardinia with the [[Barcid conquest of Hispania|conquest]] of Southern [[Hispania]] (up to [[Salamanca]]), and its rich silver mines.<ref>Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', p. 215.</ref> This enterprise was the work of the [[Barcid family]], headed by [[Hamilcar Barca|Hamilcar]], the former commander in Sicily.

Hannibal dismissed Roman rights on the city, and took it in 219.<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 33\u201336.</ref> At Rome, the [[Cornelii]] and the [[Aemilii]] considered the capture of Saguntum a ''casus belli'',<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 37. These ''gentes'' had interests in [[Marseille|Massalia]] and other Greek cities of the western Mediterranean. Massalia was concerned by the Carthaginian growing influence in Spain.</ref> and won the debate against [[Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]], who wanted to negotiate. An embassy carrying an ultimatum was sent to Carthage, asking its senate to condemn Hannibal's deeds. The Carthaginian refusal started the Second Punic War.<ref>Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 39.</ref>\n[[File:Second Punic War full-en.svg|alt=|left|thumb|422x422px|Principal offensives of the war: Rome (red), Hannibal (green), Hasdrubal (purple)]]\n\nInitially, the plan of the Republic was to carry war outside Italy, by sending the consuls [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] to Hispania, and [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BCE)|Sempronius Longus]] to Africa, while their naval superiority prevented Carthage from attacking from the sea.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 46.</ref> This plan was thwarted by Hannibal's bold move to Italy. In May 218, he indeed crossed the Ebro with a large army of about 100,000 soldiers and 37 elephants.<ref>Fronda, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', pp. 251, 252.</ref> He passed in [[Gaul]], [[Battle of Rhone Crossing|crossed the Rhone]], then the [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|Alps]], possibly through the [[Col de Clapier]] (2,491 meters high).<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 47.</ref> This famous exploit cost him half of his troops,<ref>Livy, xxi. 38, quoting [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius Alimentus]] who reported a personal discussion with Hannibal, in which he said he lost 38,000 men by crossing the Alps.</ref> but he could now rely on the Boii and Insubres, still at war with Rome.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 48.</ref> Publius Scipio, who had failed to block Hannibal on the Rhone, sent his elder brother [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus|Gnaeus]] with the main part of his army in Hispania according to the initial plan, and went back to Italy with the rest to resist Hannibal in Italy, but he was defeated and wounded near [[Battle of Ticinus|Pavia]].\n\nHannibal then marched south and won three outstanding victories. The first one was on the banks of the [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] in December 218, where he defeated the other consul Sempronius Longus thanks to his brother Mago, who had concealed some elite troops behind the legions and attacked them from the rear once fighting Hannibal. More than half of the Roman army was lost. Hannibal then ravaged the country around [[Arezzo|Arretium]] to lure the new consul [[Gaius Flaminius]] into a trap, at the [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]]. He had hidden his troops in the hills surrounding the lake and attacked Flaminius when he was cornered on the shore. This [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|clever ambush]] resulted in the death of the consul and the complete destruction of his army of 30,000 men. In 216, the new consuls [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Aemilius Paullus]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro|Terentius Varro]] mustered the biggest army possible, with eight legions (more than 80,000 soldiers) \u2013 twice as many as the Punic army \u2013 and confronted Hannibal, who was encamped at [[Cannae]], in [[Apulia]]. Despite his numerical disadvantage, Hannibal used his heavier cavalry to rout the Roman wings and envelop their infantry, whom he annihilated. In terms of casualties, the [[Battle of Cannae]] was the worst defeat in the history of Rome: only 14,500 soldiers escaped; Paullus was killed as well as 80 senators.<ref>Polybius (iii. 117) gives 70,000 dead. Livy (xxii. 49) gives 47,700 dead and 19,300 prisoners.</ref> Soon after, the Boii ambushed the army of the consul-elect for 215, [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 BC)|Postumius Albinus]], who died with all his army of 25,000 men in the [[Battle of Silva Litana|Forest of Litana]].\n\n[[File:Carthage, quarter shekel, 237-209 BC, SNG BM Spain 102.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|quarter shekel]] of Carthage, perhaps minted in Spain.

His attack on [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] started the [[First Macedonian War]]. In 215, [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] died of old age, and his young grandson [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]] broke the long alliance with Rome to side with Carthage. At this desperate point, the aggressive strategy against Hannibal advocated by the Scipiones was abandoned in favour of delaying tactics that avoided direct confrontation with him. Its main proponents were the consuls Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, nicknamed ''Cunctator'' (\"the delayer\"), [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Claudius Marcellus]], and [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 237 BC)|Fulvius Flaccus]]. The \"[[Fabian strategy|Fabian Strategy]]\" favoured a slow reconquest of the lost territories, since Hannibal could not be everywhere to defend them.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 49, 50.</ref> Although he remained invincible on the battlefield, defeating all the Roman armies on his way, he could not prevent Claudius Marcellus from taking Syracuse in 212 after a [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|long siege]], nor the fall of his bases of Capua and Tarentum in [[Siege of Capua (211 BC)|211]] and [[Battle of Tarentum (209 BC)|209]]. However, in 208 the consuls Claudius Marcellus and Quinctius Crispinus were ambushed and killed near [[Venusia]].\n\nIn Hispania, the situation was overall much better for Rome. This theatre was mostly commanded by the brothers Publius and Gnaeus Scipio, who won the battles of [[Battle of Cissa|Cissa]] in 218, soon after Hannibal's departure, and [[Battle of Dertosa|Dertosa]] against his brother Hasdrubal in 215, which enabled them to conquer the eastern coast of Hispania. In 211 however, Hasdrubal and Mago Barca successfully returned the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian tribes]] that supported the Scipiones, and attacked them simultaneously at the [[Battle of the Upper Baetis]], in which the Scipiones brothers died.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 57.</ref> Publius' son, the future [[Scipio Africanus]], was then elected with a special proconsulship to lead the Hispanic campaign. He soon showed outstanding skills as a commander, by winning a series of battles with ingenious tactics. In 209, he took [[Battle of Cartagena (209 BC)|Carthago Nova]], the main Punic base in Hispania, then defeated Hasdrubal at the [[Battle of Baecula]] (208).<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 59.</ref> After his defeat, Hasdrubal was ordered by Carthage to move to Italy. Since he could not use ships, he followed the same route as his brother through the Alps, but this time the surprise effect was gone. The consuls [[Marcus Livius Salinator|Livius Salinator]] and [[Gaius Claudius Nero|Claudius Nero]] were awaiting him and won the [[Battle of the Metaurus]], where Hasdrubal died.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 55.</ref> It was the turning point of the war. The attrition campaign had indeed worked well: Hannibal's troops were now depleted; he only had one elephant left ([[Surus]]) and retreated to [[Calabria|Bruttium]], on the defensive. In Greece, Rome contained Philip V without devoting too many forces, by setting an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]], [[Sparta]], and [[Pergamon]], which also prevented Philip from aiding Hannibal. The war resulted in a stalemate, with the [[Treaty of Phoenice]] signed in 205.\n{{Campaignbox First Macedonian War}}\n\nIn Hispania, Scipio continued his triumphal campaign at the battles of [[Battle of Carmona|Carmona]] in 207, and [[Battle of Ilipa|Ilipa]] (now [[Seville]]) in 206, which ended the Punic threat on the peninsula.<ref>Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 60.</ref> Elected consul in 205, he convinced the Senate to cancel the Fabian Strategy, and instead to invade Africa by using the support of the Numidian king [[Masinissa|Massinissa]], who had defected to Rome. Scipio landed in Africa in 204. He took [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Utica]], then won the [[Battle of the Great Plains]], which prompted Carthage to recall Hannibal from Italy and open peace negotiations with Rome. The talks nevertheless failed because Scipio wanted to impose harsher terms on Carthage, in order to avoid it from rising again as a threat to Rome. Hannibal was therefore sent to face Scipio at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]]. Scipio could now use the heavy Numidian cavalry of Massinissa \u2013 which had hitherto been so successful against Rome \u2013 to rout the Punic wings, then flank the infantry, as Hannibal had done at Cannae. Defeated for the first time, Hannibal convinced the Carthaginian Senate to pay the war indemnity, which was even harsher than that of 241: 10,000 talents in 50 instalments. Carthage furthermore had to give up all its elephants, all its fleet but ten [[trireme]]s, all its possessions outside its core territory in Africa (what is now [[Tunisia]]), and could not declare war without the authorisation of Rome. In effect, Carthage was condemned to be a minor power, while Rome recovered from a desperate situation to dominate the Western Mediterranean.\n\n====Roman supremacy in the Greek East (200\u2013188 BC)====\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|style=\"background:#ddd; text-align:center;\"|'''Macedonian Wars'''\n|-\n|[[File:Macedonia and the Aegean World c.200.png|center|thumb|300px|Macedonia, Greece and Asia at the outbreak of the Second Macedonian War, 200 BC]]\n|-\n|{{Campaignbox Macedonian Wars}}\n{{Campaignbox Second Macedonian War}}\n{{Campaignbox Roman\u2013Seleucid War}}\n{{Campaignbox Third Macedonian War}}\n{{Campaignbox Fourth Macedonian War}}\n|}\n{{further|Rise of Rome}}\n\nRome's preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] of the kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], located in the north of the [[Greek peninsula]], to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome.<ref name=\"enemiesP47\">Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 47</ref><ref name=\"historyP115\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 115</ref> However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet.<ref name=\"enemiesP47\"/> The [[First Macedonian War]] saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of preoccupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.\n\nThe past century had seen the Greek world dominated by the three primary successor kingdoms of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire: [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and the [[Seleucid Empire]]. In 202, internal problems led to a weakening of Egypt's position, thereby disrupting the power balance among the successor states. Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt.<ref name=\"Eckstein, Arthur p42\">Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 42.</ref> Fearing this increasingly unstable situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to seek an alliance.<ref>Eckstein, Arthur. \"Rome Enters the Greek East\". p. 43</ref> The delegation succeeded, even though prior Greek attempts to involve Rome in Greek affairs had been met with Roman apathy. Our primary source about these events, the surviving works of Polybius, do not state Rome's reason for getting involved. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome's new Greek allies. Doubting Rome's strength (a reasonable doubt, given Rome's performance in the [[First Macedonian War]]) Philip ignored the request, and Rome sent an army of Romans and Greek allies, beginning the [[Second Macedonian War]].<ref name=\"enemiesP49\">Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 49</ref> Despite his recent successes against the Greeks and earlier successes against Rome, Philip's army buckled under the pressure from the Roman-Greek army.

Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.<ref>Eckstein, Arthur. \"Rome Enters the Greek East\". p. 55</ref>\n\n====Conquest of Greece (172\u2013146 BC)====\n[[File:Tony robert-fleury, l'ultimo giorno di corinto, ante 1870.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Scene of the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]]: last day before the Roman legions looted and burned the Greek city of [[Corinth]].

Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The [[Fourth Macedonian War]], 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second battle of Pydna]].\n\nThe [[Achaean League]] chose this moment to fight Rome but was swiftly defeated. In 146 (the same year as the destruction of [[Carthage]]), [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]] was besieged and destroyed in the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]], which led to the league's surrender.<ref>History of Rome \u2013 The republic, Isaac Asimov.</ref> After nearly a century of constant crisis management in Greece, which always led back to internal instability and war when she withdrew, Rome decided to divide Macedonia into two new Roman provinces, [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].\n\n====Third Punic War (149\u2013146 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Third Punic War}}\nCarthage never recovered militarily after the Second Punic War,<ref>Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. XV, para. 24</ref> but quickly did so economically and the [[Third Punic War]] that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission after the neighbouring Numidians allied to Rome robbed/attacked Carthaginian merchants. Treaties had forbidden any war with Roman allies, and defence against robbing/pirates was considered as \"war action\": Rome decided to annihilate the city of Carthage.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 338</ref> Carthage was almost defenceless, and submitted when besieged.<ref name=\"punicP339\">Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 339</ref> However, the Romans demanded complete surrender and removal of the city into the (desert) inland far off any coastal or harbour region, and the Carthaginians refused. The city was [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|besieged, stormed, and completely destroyed]].\n\nUltimately, all of Carthage's North African and Iberian territories were acquired by Rome. Note that \"Carthage\" was not an 'empire', but a league of Punic colonies (port cities in the western Mediterranean) like the 1st and 2nd Athenian (\"Attic\") leagues, under leadership of Carthage. Punic Carthage was gone, but the other Punic cities in the western Mediterranean flourished under Roman rule.\n\n===Social troubles and first civil war (146\u201360 BC)===\n[[Rise of Rome|Rome's rapid expansion]] destabilized its social organization and triggered unrest in the heart of the Republic, which ultimately led to political violence, unrest in the provinces, and ultimately a breakdown in the traditional social relations of Rome that created the Augustan Empire. The period is marked by the rise of strongmen ([[Gaius Marius|Marius]], [[Sulla]], [[Pompey]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]], and [[Julius Caesar]]), who turned military success into political power.\n\n====The Gracchi (133\u2013121 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Servile Wars}}\n{{Main|Gracchi}}\n\nIn 135, the first slave uprising, known as the [[First Servile War]], broke out in Sicily. After initial successes, the slaves led by [[Eunus]] and [[Cleon (Roman rebel)|Cleon]] were annihilated by the consul [[Publius Rupilius]] in 132 BC.\n\nIn this context, [[Tiberius Gracchus]] was elected tribune in 133 BC. He attempted to enact a law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the [[Plebeian Council]], but the law was vetoed by a tribune named [[Marcus Octavius]]. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council to [[impeach]] Octavius. The theory, that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority.<ref name=\"Abbott, 96\">Abbott, 96</ref> His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered with 300 of his associates<ref name=\"Hillsborough\">{{cite web|last=Bishop|first=Paul|title=Rome: Transition from Republic to Empire|url=http://www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf|publisher=Hillsborough Community College|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref> when he stood for reelection to the tribunate.\n\nTiberius' brother Gaius was elected tribune in 123.

Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the ''senatus consultum ultimum'' to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support.<ref>Stobart, J.C.

He was succeeded by two legitimate sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate son, [[Jugurtha]]. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, turned on his brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated a division of the country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, [[Gaius Marius]], a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display.<ref name=\"Abbott, 100\">Abbott, 100</ref> The ''[[populares]]'' party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.\n\n{{Campaignbox Cimbrian War}}\nThe [[Cimbrian War]] (113\u2013101) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121. The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes of the ''[[Cimbri]]'' and the ''[[Teutons]]''<ref name=\"appianS6\">Appian, ''History of Rome'', \u00a76</ref> migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories,<ref name=\"enemiesP75\">Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 75</ref> and clashed with Rome and her allies.<ref name=\"stormingP6\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 6</ref> At the [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] and the [[Battle of Vercellae]] both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.\n\n====Sulla's Civil Wars====\n{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}\n{{Campaignbox First Mithridatic War}}\n{{Campaignbox Sulla's Second Civil War}}\nIn 91 the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]] broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy when the allies complained that they shared the risk of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards. Although they lost militarily, the allies achieved their objectives with legal proclamations which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians.\n\nThe internal unrest reached its most serious state, however, in the [[Sulla's civil wars|two civil wars]] that were caused by the clash between generals [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] starting from 88. In the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]]<ref>Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 161</ref> at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Marius supporters and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was to pave the way for the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nSeveral years later, in 88, a Roman army was sent to put down an emerging Asian power, king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. The army, however, was not defeated and won. One of Marius' old quaestors, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], had been elected consul for the year, and was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, a member of the \"''[[populares]]''\" party, had a tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla, a member of the aristocratic (\"''[[optimates]]''\") party, brought his army back to Italy and [[Sulla's civil wars|marched on Rome]]. Sulla was so angry at Marius' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tribunate.<ref name = \"Abbott, 103\">Abbott, 103</ref> He then returned to his war against Mithridates. With Sulla gone, the ''populares'' under Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] soon took control of the city.\n\nDuring the period in which the ''populares'' party controlled the city, they flouted convention by re-electing Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten-year interval between offices.<ref name = \"Abbott, 106\">Abbott, 106</ref> They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates. In 83, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters. Sulla, having observed the violent results of radical ''popular'' reforms, was naturally conservative. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by extension the senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\">Abbott, 104</ref> Sulla made himself dictator, passed a [[Constitutional reforms of Sulla|series of constitutional reforms]], resigned the dictatorship, and served one last term as consul.

The Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, [[Gaius Marius]]. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.\n\nThe [[Second Mithridatic War]] began when Rome tried to annex a province that Mithridates claimed as his own. In the [[Third Mithridatic War]], first [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and then [[Pompey the Great]] were sent against Mithridates and his [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian]] ally [[Tigranes the Great]].<ref name=\"classicalworldP363\">Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 363</ref> Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time [[Battle of the Lycus]].<ref name = \"Plutarch\">Plutarch, ''Lives'', Pompey</ref>\n\n{{Campaignbox Rome against the Cilician Pirates}}\nThe Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of pirates,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> largely from [[Cilicia]].<ref name=\"epitomeB3C6\">Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman history'', Book 3, ch. 6</ref> The pirates not only strangled shipping lanes but also plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia.

By 71, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], had just put down the [[Spartacus]]-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the ''populares'' party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution.<ref name=\"Abbott, 108\">Abbott, 108</ref> They attempted to forge an agreement with the ''populares'' party.

The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]]. The movement was based in the town of Faesulae, which was not a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation.<ref name=\"Abbott, 110\">Abbott, 110</ref> The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome,<ref name = \"Abbott, 111\"/> and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63. The consul for the year, [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.\n\nThe most important result of the Catilinarian conspiracy was that the ''populares'' party became discredited. The prior 70 years had witnessed a gradual erosion in senatorial powers. The violent nature of the conspiracy, in conjunction with the senate's skill in disrupting it, did a great deal to repair the senate's image.<ref name=\"Abbott, 111\">Abbott, 111</ref>\n\n===Triumvirates and end of the Republic (60\u201327 BC)===\n\n====First Triumvirate (60\u201350 BC)====\n{{Ancient Rome and the fall of the Republic}}\n{{Main|First Triumvirate}}\n[[File:Pompeius.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Roman marble head of [[Pompey]] (now in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]])]]\nIn 62, Pompey returned victorious from Asia. The Senate, elated by its successes against Catiline, refused to ratify the arrangements that Pompey had made. Pompey, in effect, became powerless. Thus, when [[Julius Caesar]] returned from a governorship in Spain in 61, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, now known as the [[First Triumvirate]]. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements would be ratified. Caesar would be elected consul in 59, and would then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was promised a future consulship.<ref name = \"Abbott, 112\"/>\n\nBy 59 an unofficial political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]] was formed between [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], and [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (\"Pompey the Great\") to share power and influence.<ref>Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 168</ref>\n\nCaesar became consul in 59. His colleague, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], was an extreme aristocrat. Caesar submitted the laws that he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage.<ref name=\"Abbott, 112\">Abbott, 112</ref> Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated the election of the former patrician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] to the tribunate for 58. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.<ref name=\"Abbott, 113\">Abbott, 113</ref>\n\n[[File:Caesar campaigns gaul-en.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Gallic Wars]]\n{{Campaignbox Gallic Wars}}\nDuring his term as praetor in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's contemporary [[Julius Caesar]] defeated two local tribes in battle.<ref name=\"livescaesar\">Plutarch, ''Lives'', Caesar</ref> After his term as consul in 59, he was appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans).<ref name=\"livescaesar\"/><ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 58</ref> Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his [[Gallic Wars]], fought between 58 and 49.\n\nCaesar defeated large armies at major battles 58 and 57. In 55 and 54 he made [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|two expeditions into Britain]], the first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated a union of Gauls at the [[Battle of Alesia]],<ref name=\"stormingP62\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 62 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 212</ref> completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50, all of Gaul lay in Roman hands.\n\nClodius formed armed gangs that terrorised the city and eventually began to attack Pompey's followers, who in response funded counter-gangs formed by [[Titus Annius Milo]]. The political alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC)|Ahenobarbus]] ran for the consulship in 55 promising to take Caesar's command from him. Eventually, the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the consulship in 55, and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years.\nBeginning in the summer of 54, a wave of political corruption and violence swept Rome.<ref name=\"Abbott, 114\">Abbott, 114</ref> This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo.\n\nIn 53, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes,<ref name=\"enemiesP133\">Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 133</ref> he marched his army deep into the desert;<ref>Plutarch, ''Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'', p. 266</ref> but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 214</ref> and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. Pompey's wife, Julia, who was Caesar's daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar. In 51, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.\n\n====Caesar's Civil War and dictatorship (49\u201344 BC)====\n{{Campaignbox Caesar's Civil War}}\n[[File:04305 - Roma - Fori - Curia Iulia - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 18-Mar-2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Curia Julia]], the [[Roman Senate]] house established by Julius Caesar in 44 BC and completed by [[Octavian]] in 29 BC, replacing the [[Curia Cornelia]] as the meeting place of the Senate]]\n{{Main|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}\n\nOn 1 January 49, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic.<ref name=\"Abbott, 115\">Abbott, 115</ref> Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49, the senate passed a ''senatus consultum ultimum'', which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts.\n\nOn 10 January, Caesar with his veteran army crossed the river [[Rubicon]], the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, in violation of Roman laws, and by the spring of 49 swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed. Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain)<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 217</ref> but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece.<ref>Julius Caesar, ''The Civil War'', 81\u201392 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 218</ref> Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48,<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 227 See also: Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 403</ref> despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops.<ref>Holland, ''Rubicon'', p. 312</ref> Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.\n\nPompey's death did not end the civil war, as Caesar's many enemies fought on. In 46 Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army, but ultimately came back to defeat the Pompeian army of [[Metellus Scipio]] in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Hispania. Caesar then defeated the combined Pompeian forces at the [[Battle of Munda]].\n[[File:Retrato de Julio C\u00e9sar (26724093101).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Tusculum portrait]], a [[Roman sculpture]] of [[Julius Caesar]], Archaeological Museum of [[Turin]], Italy]]\n\nWith Pompey defeated and order restored, Caesar wanted to achieve undisputed control over the government. The powers which he gave himself were later assumed by his imperial successors.<ref name = \"Abbott, 134\"/> His assumption of these powers decreased the authority of Rome's other political institutions.\n\nCaesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship.<ref name=\"Abbott, 134\">Abbott, 134</ref> In 48, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46, Caesar was given censorial powers,<ref name=\"Abbott, 135\">Abbott, 135</ref> which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised the membership of the Senate to 900.<ref name = \"Abbott, 137\"/> This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.{{clarify|date=January 2019}}<!-- how did asking for their consent on everything make them powerless?--><ref name=\"Abbott, 138\">Abbott, 138</ref>\n\nNear the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law before his death which allowed him to appoint all magistrates, and later all consuls and tribunes. This transformed the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.<ref name=\"Abbott, 137\">Abbott, 137</ref>\n\nCaesar was now the primary figure of the Roman state, enforcing and entrenching his powers. His enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler. Arguing that the Roman Republic was in danger, a group of senators hatched a conspiracy and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated Caesar]] at a meeting of the Senate in March 44.<ref name=\"antiquityP170\">Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 170</ref>\n\nCaesar was assassinated on 15 March 44. The assassination was led by [[Gaius Cassius]] and [[Marcus Brutus]]. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms in favor of the landless classes.

Known as the [[Second Triumvirate]],<ref name=\"Goldsworthy, p. 237\">Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 237</ref> they held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus did likewise soon afterwards.\n\nHowever, civil war flared again when the alliance failed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base of patronage and then launched a campaign against Mark Antony.<ref name=\"antiquityP170\"/> At the naval [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 off the coast of Greece, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. Octavian was granted a series of special powers including sole \"imperium\" within the city of Rome, permanent consular powers and credit for every Roman military victory, since all future generals were assumed to be acting under his command. In 27 Octavian was granted the use of the names \"Augustus\", indicating his primary status above all other Romans, \"Princeps\", which he used to refer to himself as in public, and he adopted the title \"Imperator Caesar\" making him the first Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"grandP7\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 7</ref>\n\n==Constitutional system==\n{{Roman government}}\n{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}\n{{Main|History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic}}\n{{further|Elections in the Roman Republic}}\nThe constitutional history of the Roman Republic began with the revolution which overthrew the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]] in 509 BC, and ended with constitutional reforms that transformed the Republic into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. The Constitution of the Roman Republic was a constantly-evolving, unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent, by which the government and its politics operated.<ref name=\"Byrd, 161\">Byrd, 161</ref> Throughout the history of the Republic, changes in the constitution were driven by [[Conflict of the Orders|conflicts of interest]] between the aristocracy and ordinary citizens.\n\n===Senate===\n{{Main|Senate of the Roman Republic}}\nThe [[Senate of the Roman Republic|senate's]] ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators.<ref name=\"Byrd, 96\">Byrd, 96</ref> This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called ''senatus consulta''. These were officially \"advice\" from the senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates.<ref name=\"Byrd, 44\">Byrd, 44</ref> The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. This was due to the senate's explicit power over the state's budget and in military affairs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bleiken |first1=Jochen |title=Die Verfassung der r\u00f6mischen Republik |date=1995 |publisher=UTB |location=Sch\u00f6ningh |edition=6th}}</ref> The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by [[Roman Censors]], who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. During times of military emergency, such as the civil wars of the 1st century, this practice became less prevalent, as the [[Roman Dictator]], [[Triumvir]] or the senate itself would select its members. Towards the end of the Republic, the senate could enact a ''[[Senatus consultum ultimum|senatus consultus ultimum]]'' in times of emergency, instead of appointing a dictator.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Your explanation here}}\n\n===Legislative assemblies===\n[[File:Forum Romanum through Arch of Septimius Severus Forum Romanum Rome.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Forum]], the commercial, cultural, religious, and political center of the city and the Republic which housed the various offices and meeting places of the government]]\n\n{{Main|Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic}}\n\nThe legal status of Roman citizenship was limited and was a vital prerequisite to possessing many important legal rights such as the right to trial and appeal, to marry, to vote, to hold office, to enter binding contracts, and to special tax exemptions. An adult male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called \"optimo jure.\" The optimo jure elected their assemblies, whereupon the assemblies elected magistrates, enacted legislation, presided over trials in capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties. There were [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Comitia, Concilium, Conventio|two types of legislative assemblies]]. The first was the ''comitia'' (\"committees\"),<ref name=\"Lintott, 42\">Lintott, 42</ref> which were assemblies of all optimo jure. The second was the ''concilia'' (\"councils\"), which were assemblies of specific groups of optimo jure.<ref name=\"Abbott, 251\">Abbott, 251</ref>\n\nCitizens were organized on the basis of centuries and [[Tribe of Rome|tribes]], which would each gather into their own assemblies. The [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Centuries|Comitia Centuriata]] (\"Centuriate Assembly\") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had the ''imperium'' powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census.<ref name=\"Abbott, 257\">Abbott, 257</ref> It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.\n\nThe assembly of the tribes (i.e., the citizens of Rome), the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Tribes|Comitia Tributa]], was presided over by a consul, and was composed of 35 tribes. The tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions.<ref name=\"Lintott, 51\">Lintott, 51</ref> The order that the thirty-five tribes would vote in was selected randomly by lot.<ref name=\"Taylor, 77\">Taylor, 77</ref> Once a measure received support from a majority of the tribes, the voting would end. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, [[Curule seat|curule]] [[aedile]]s, and military tribunes.<ref name=\"Taylor, 7\">Taylor, 7</ref> The Plebeian Council<ref name=\"Abbott, 196\">Abbott, 196</ref> was identical to the assembly of the tribes, but excluded the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal.\n\n===Magistrates===\n{{Main|Executive magistrates of the Roman Republic}}\nEach republican magistrate held certain [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Republic#Powers|constitutional powers]]. Each was assigned a ''provincia'' by the Senate. This was the scope of that particular office holder's authority. It could apply to a geographic area or to a particular responsibility or task.<ref name=\"Lintott, 101\">Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 101.</ref> The powers of a magistrate came from the people of Rome (both plebeians ''and'' patricians).<ref name=\"Lintott, 95\">Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 95.</ref> The ''[[imperium]]'' was held by both consuls and praetors. Strictly speaking, it was the authority to command a military force. In reality, however, it carried broad authority in the other public spheres such as diplomacy, and the justice system. In extreme cases, those with the imperium power were able to sentence Roman Citizens to death. All magistrates also had the power of ''coercitio'' (coercion). This was used by magistrates to maintain public order by imposing punishment for crimes.<ref name=\"Lintott, 97\">Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 97.</ref> Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power could also be used to obstruct political opponents.\n\nOne check on a magistrate's power was called ''Collega'' (collegiality). Each magisterial office would be held concurrently by at least two people. Another such check was ''provocatio''. While in Rome, all citizens were protected from coercion, by ''provocatio'', which was an early form of [[due process]]. It was a precursor to ''[[habeas corpus]]''. If any magistrate tried to use the powers of the state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to [[Cursus honorum|wait ten years]] before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their ''imperium'' extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a [[promagistrate]]), without officially holding that office.<ref name=\"Lintott, 113\">Lintott, 113</ref>\n\nThe [[Roman consul|consuls]] of the Roman Republic were the highest ranking ordinary magistrates. Each served for one year.<ref>Byrd, 20</ref> They retained several elements of the former kingly regalia, such as the ''[[toga praetexta]]'', and the ''[[fasces]]'', which represented the power to inflict physical punishment. Consular powers included the kings' former \"power to command\" (''[[imperium]]'') and appointment of new senators. Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government. They would preside over the senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army.<ref name=\"Byrd, 179\">Byrd, 179</ref> His authority abroad would be nearly absolute. [[Praetor]]s administered civil law<ref name=\"Byrd, 32\">Byrd, 32</ref> and commanded provincial armies. Every five years, two [[Roman Censor|censors]] were elected for an 18-month term, during which they would conduct a [[census]]. During the census, they could enroll citizens in the senate, or purge them from the senate.<ref name=\"Byrd, 26\">Byrd, 26</ref> [[Aediles]] were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome, such as managing public games and shows. The [[quaestor]]s would usually assist the consuls in Rome, and the governors in the provinces. Their duties were often financial.\n\nSince the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were [[sacrosanct]]. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. It was a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to otherwise interfere with him.<ref name=\"Byrd, 23\">Byrd, 23</ref> In times of military emergency, a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] would be appointed for a term of six months.<ref name=\"Byrd, 24\">Byrd, 24</ref> Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.\n\n==Military==\n{{RomanMilitary}}\n{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}\nRome's military secured Rome's territory and borders, and helped to impose tribute on conquered peoples. Rome's armies had a formidable reputation; but Rome also \"produced [its] share of incompetents\"<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 15</ref> and catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of Rome's greatest enemies, such as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Hannibal]],<ref>Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 312</ref> to win early battles but lose the war.\n\n===Hoplite armies (509\u2013c. 315 BC)===\n{{Main|Phalanx}}\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the [[Etruscans]] to the north,<ref>Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 17.</ref> who themselves are believed to have copied [[phalanx formation|their style of warfare]] from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the [[phalanx formation]] into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, [[Servius Tullius]] (ruled 578\u2013534).<ref>Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 18.</ref> According to [[Livy]]<ref>Livy, i. 43.</ref> and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]],<ref>''Roman Antiquities'', 4.16\u201318</ref> the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it. The phalanx was effective in large, open spaces, but not on the hilly terrain of the central [[Italian peninsula]]. In the 4th century, the Romans replaced it with the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to [[Marcus Furius Camillus]] and placed shortly after the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic invasion]] of 390; more likely, it was copied from Rome's [[Samnium|Samnite]] enemies to the south,<ref>''Early Roman Armies'', pp. 37\u201338.</ref> following the [[Samnite Wars|Second Samnite War]] (326\u2013304).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/samnite_wars.htm |title=Rome, The Samnite Wars |publisher=History-world.org |accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Manipular legion (c. 315\u2013107 BC)===\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing (centre-right) two Roman foot-soldiers c. 122 BC. Note the [[Montefortino helmet|Montefortino-style helmets]] with horsehair plume, [[chain mail]] cuirasses with shoulder reinforcement, oval shields with calfskin covers, ''[[gladius]]'' and ''[[pilum]].'']]\n\nDuring this period, an army formation of around 5,000 men (of both heavy and light infantry) was known as a legion. The manipular army was based upon social class, age and military experience.<ref>Boak, '' A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 87</ref> ''Maniples'' were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. They were typically deployed into three discrete lines based on the three [[heavy infantry]] types:\n\n# The first line maniple were the ''[[hastati]]'', leather-armoured infantry soldiers who wore a bronze breastplate and a bronze helmet adorned with 3 feathers approximately {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height and carried an iron-clad wooden shield. They were armed with a sword and two throwing spears.\n# The second line were the ''[[principes]]''. They were armed and armoured in the same manner as the hastati, but wore a lighter coat of mail rather than a solid brass breastplate.\n# The ''[[triarii]]'' formed the third line. They were the last remnant of the hoplite-style troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured like the ''principes'', with the exception that they carried a lighter spear.<ref name=\"polybiusB6\">PolybiusB6</ref>\n\nThe three infantry classes<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 18</ref> may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.\n\nThe heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\"/> The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the third line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and a small shield, as well as several light javelins.\n\nRome's military confederation with the other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army was provided by the [[Socii]], such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 men at the beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in ''alae'', or ''wings'', roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300.\n\n[[File:Togatus Barberini 2392.PNG|thumb|upright|The \"[[Togatus Barberini]]\", depicting a Roman senator holding the ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'' ([[effigies]]) of deceased ancestors in his hands; marble, late 1st century BC; head (not belonging): mid 1st century BC]]\nA small navy had operated at a fairly low level after about 300, but it was massively upgraded about forty years later, during the [[First Punic War]]. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] (\"Punic\") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.<ref name=\"websterP156\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 156</ref>\n\nThe extraordinary demands of the [[Punic Wars]], in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term.<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 2</ref> In 217, near the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]], Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population,<ref name=\"gabbaP9\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 9</ref> partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it did not have to do in the past.\n\nThe distinction between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the provision of allied troops.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 11</ref> Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 143</ref>\n\n===Legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107\u201327 BC)===\n{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}\nIn a process known as the [[Marian reforms]], Roman consul [[Gaius Marius]] carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10</ref> In 107, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service.<ref>Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 1</ref> The distinction among the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.<ref name=\"SantosuossoP29\">Santosuosso, p. 29</ref>\n\nUnlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat \"acquired a stronger and more elevated position\"<ref name=\"gabbaP25\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 25</ref> within the state.\n\nThe legions of the late Republic were almost entirely heavy infantry. The main legionary sub-unit was a ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]'' of approximately 480 infantrymen, further divided into six [[Centuria#Military|centuries]] of 80 men each.<ref name=\"luttwakP14\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 14</ref> Each century comprised 10 \"tent groups\" of 8 men. Cavalry were used as scouts and dispatch riders, rather than as battlefield forces.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 116</ref> Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 15</ref>\n\nThe army's most obvious deficiency lay in its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 43</ref> Particularly in the East, Rome's slow-moving infantry legions were often confronted by fast-moving cavalry-troops, and found themselves at a tactical disadvantage.\n[[File:D473-bir\u00e8me romaine-Liv2-ch10.png|thumb|A [[Roman navy|Roman naval]] [[bireme]] depicted in a [[relief]] from the Temple of [[Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna Primigenia]] in [[Praeneste]],<ref>D.B.

[[Pompey]] raised a fleet to deal with the [[Cilicia]]n pirates who threatened Rome's Mediterranean trading routes.

McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 65ff.</ref> Citizenship was also taxable, and undischarged debt was potentially a capital offence. A form of limited, theoretically voluntary slavery (debt bondage, or [[nexum]]) allowed wealthy creditors to negotiate payment of debt through bonded service. Poor, landless citizens of the lowest class (''proletarii'') might contract their sons to a creditor, patron or third party employer to obtain an income, or to pay off family debts.

They could be bought, sold, acquired through warfare, or born and raised within their master's household,. They could also buy their freedom with money saved or the offer of future services as a freedman or woman, and their sons could be eligible for citizenship; this degree of social mobility was unusual in the ancient world. Freed slaves and the master who freed them retained certain legal and moral mutual obligations. This was the bottom rung of one of Rome's fundamental social and economic institutions, the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client-patron relationship]]. At the top rung were the senatorial families of the landowning nobility, both patrician and plebeian, bound by shifting allegiances and mutual competition.

Towards the end of the Republic, the birthrate began to fall among the elite. Some wealthy, childless citizens resorted to [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoption]] to provide male heirs for their estates, and to forge political alliances. Adoption was subject to the senate's approval; the notoriously unconventional patrician politician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] had himself and his family adopted into a plebeian clan, so that he could hold a plebeian tribunate.\n\n==Trade and economy==\n===Farming===\n{{Main|Roman agriculture}}\nThe Republic was created during a time of warfare, economic recession, food shortages, and plebeian debt. In wartime, plebeian farmers were liable to conscription. In peacetime, most depended on whatever cereal crops they could produce on small farming plots, allotted to them by the state, or by patrons. Soil fertility varied from place to place, and natural water sources were unevenly distributed throughout the landscape. In good years, a pleb small-holder might trade a small surplus, to meet his family's needs, or to buy the armatures required for his military service. In other years, crop failure through soil exhaustion, adverse weather, disease or military incursions could lead to poverty, unsupported borrowing, and debt. Nobles invested much of their wealth in ever-larger, more efficient farming units, exploiting a range of soil conditions though mixed farming techniques. As farming was labour-intensive, and military conscription reduced the pool of available manpower, over time the wealthy became ever more reliant upon the increasingly plentiful slave-labour provided by successful military campaigns.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 265\u2013268, 283.</ref><ref name=\"Bannon, pp. 5\">Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors'', pp. 5\u201310.</ref><ref>Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 118\u2013122, 135, 136.</ref> Well managed agricultural estates helped provide for clients and dependents, support an urban family home, and fund the owner's public and military career. Large estates yielded cash for bribes, and security for borrowing.

In practise, much of it was exploited by the nobility, using slaves rather than free labour. Rome's expansionist wars and colonisations were at least partly driven by the land-hunger of displaced peasants, who must otherwise join the swelling, dependent population of urban ''plebs''.<ref>Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 265\u2013268.</ref> At the end of the second Punic War, Rome added the fertile ''ager Campanus'', suitable for intense cultivation of vines, olives and cereals.

Drummond speculates that this might reflect elite preoccupations with historical grain famines, or long-standing competition between agriculturalists and pastoralists. While agriculture was a seasonal practise, pasturage was a year-round requirement. Some of Republican Rome's early agricultural legislation sought to balance the competing public grazing rights of small farmers, the farming elite, and [[Transhumance|transhumant]] pastoralists, who maintained an ancient right to herd, graze and water their animals between low-lying winter pastures and upland summer pastures. From the early second century, transhumance was practised on a vast scale, as an investment opportunity.<ref name=\"Drummond, pp. 118\">Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 118\u2013122.</ref><ref>Gabba, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 8, pp. 237\u2013239.</ref> Though meat and hides were valuable by products of stock-raising, cattle were primarily reared to pull carts and ploughs, and sheep were bred for their wool, the mainstay of the Roman clothing industry. Horses, mules and donkeys were bred as civil and military transport. Pigs bred prolifically, and could be raised at little cost by any small farmer with rights to [[pannage]]. Their central dietary role is reflected by their use as sacrificial victims in domestic cults, funerals, and cults to agricultural deities.<ref name=\"Drummond, pp. 118\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Religion in ancient Rome}}\n{{further|List of ancient Roman deities|List of Roman agricultural deities}}\n[[File:Temple of portunus front.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Portunus]], god of grain storage, keys, livestock and ports.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=W.

Every individual, occupation and location had a protective [[Tutelary deity#Ancient Rome|tutelary deity]], or sometimes several. Each was associated with a particular, highly prescriptive form of prayer and sacrifice. Piety (''pietas'') was the correct, dutiful and timely performance of such actions. The well-being of each Roman household was thought to depend on daily cult to its [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] (guardian deities, or spirits), ancestors, and the [[Genius (mythology)|divine generative essence]] embodied within its ''pater familias''. A family which neglected its religious responsibilities could not expect to prosper.<ref>Orr, D.

Impieties in state religion could produce expressions of divine wrath such as social unrest, wars, famines and epidemics, [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitiate]] the political process, render elections null and void, and lead to the abandonment of planned treaties, wars and any government business. Accidental errors could be remedied by repeating the rite correctly, or by an additional sacrifice; outright sacrilege threatened the bonds between the human and divine, and carried the death penalty. As divine retribution was invoked in the lawful swearing of oaths and vows, oath-breakers forfeited their right to divine protection, and might be killed with impunity.<ref>Halm, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 241, 242.</ref>\n\nRoman religious authorities were unconcerned with personal beliefs or privately funded cults, unless they offended natural or divine laws, or undermined the ''mos maiorum'' (roughly, \"the way of the ancestors\"); the relationship between gods and mortals should be sober, contractual, and of mutual benefit. Undignified grovelling, excessive enthusiasm (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#superstitio|superstitio]]'') and secretive practises were \"weak minded\" and morally suspect.<ref>R\u00fcpke, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 5.</ref> Magical practises were officially banned, as attempts to subvert the will of the gods for personal gain, but were probably common among all classes. Private cult organisations that seemed to threaten Rome's political and priestly hierarchy were investigated by the Senate, with advice from the priestly colleges. The Republic's most notable religious suppression was that of the [[Bacchanalia]], a widespread, unofficial, enthusiastic cult to the Greek wine-god [[Bacchus]]. The cult organisation was ferociously [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|suppressed]], and its deity was absorbed within the official cult to Rome's own wine-god, [[Liber]].<ref>Erich S.

During the crisis of the [[Second Punic War]] an unprecedented number of reported prodigies were expiated, in more than twenty days of public ritual and sacrifices. In the same period, Rome recruited the [[Cybele|\"Trojan\" Magna Mater (Great Mother of the Gods)]] to the Roman cause, \"Hellenised\" the native Roman cult to [[Ceres (mythology)#Ceres and Proserpina|Ceres]]; and took control of the [[Bacchanalia]] festival in Rome and its allied territories.

For instance, [[Scipio Africanus]] claimed Jupiter as a personal mentor. Some gentes claimed a divine descent, often thanks to a [[false etymology]] of their name; the Caecilii Metelli pretended to descend from Vulcan through his son [[Caeculus]], the [[Mamilii]] from [[Circe]] through her granddaughter Mamilia, the [[Julia (gens)|Julii Caesares]] and the [[Aemilii]] from Venus through her grandsons [[Iulus]] and Aemylos.

The [[Galli]], mendicant eunuch priets of the [[Magna Mater]], were forbidden Roman citizenship.</ref> In the early Republic the patricians, as \"fathers\" to the Roman people, claimed the right of seniority to lead and control the state's relationship with the divine. Patrician families, in particular the ''Cornelii'', ''Postumii'' and ''Valerii'', monopolised the leading state priesthoods: the ''[[flamines]]'' of [[Flamen Dialis|Jupiter]], [[Flamen Martialis|Mars]] and [[Flamen Quirinalis|Quirinus]], as well as the ''[[pontifices]]''.

The Romans observed an eight-day week; markets were held on the ninth day. Each month was presided over by a particular, usually major deity.

Rome's first [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] (312) built during the Punic wars crisis, provided a plentiful, clean supply.

Some ordinary citizens and freedmen of middling income might live in modest houses but most of the population lived in apartment blocks ([[Insula (building)|''insulae,'' literally \"islands\"]]), where the better-off might rent an entire ground floor, and the poorest a single, possibly windowless room at the top, with few or no amenities. Nobles and rich patrons lived in spacious, well-appointed town houses; they were expected to keep \"open house\" for their peers and clients. A semi-public ''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]'' typically functioned as a meeting-space, and a vehicle for display of wealth, artistic taste, and religious piety. Noble ''atria'' were also display areas for ancestor-masks (''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'').<ref>\"The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual:\" Lott, John.

From the mid-Republic, Roman authors followed Greek models, to produce free-verse and verse-form plays and other in Latin; for example, [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote tragedies and comedies. The earliest Latin works to have survived intact are the comedies of [[Plautus]], written during the mid-Republic. Works of well-known, popular playwrights were sometimes commissioned for performance at religious festivals; many of these were [[Satyr plays]], based on Greek models and Greek myths. The poet [[Gnaeus Naevius|Naevius]] may be said to have written the first Roman epic poem, although [[Ennius]] was the first Roman poet to write an epic in an adapted Latin hexameter. However, only fragments of Ennius' epic, the ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]'', have survived, yet both Naevius and Ennius influenced later Latin epic, especially Virgil's Aeneid. [[Lucretius]], in his ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' explicated the tenets of [[Epicurean]] philosophy.\n\nThe politician, poet and philosopher [[Cicero]]'s literary output was remarkably prolific and so influential on contemporary and later literature that the period from 83BC to 43BC has been called the 'Age of Cicero'. His oratory set new standards for centuries, and continue to influence modern speakers, while his philosophical works, which were, for the most part, Cicero's Latin adaptations of Greek Platonic and Epicurean works influenced many later philosophers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zauzmer |first1=Julie |title=Donald Trump, the Cicero of 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2016/11/03/donald-trump-the-cicero-of-2016/ |website=The Washington Post (WP Company LLC) [US] |accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=Miriam |editor1-last=Boardman |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Griffin |editor2-first=Jasper |editor3-last=Murray |editor3-first=Oswyn |title=The Oxford History of the Classical World |date=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-285236-1 |pages=454\u2013459 |chapter=Cicero and Rome}}</ref> Other prominent writers of this period include the grammarian and historian of religion [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], the politician, general and military commentator [[Julius Caesar]], the historian [[Sallust]] and the love poet [[Catullus]].\n\n===Sports and entertainment===\n[[File:Amphitheatre 1 Pompeii.jpg|thumb|The [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii]], built around 70 BC and buried by [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|the eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] 79 AD, once hosted spectacles with [[gladiator]]s.]]\nThe city of Rome had a place called the [[Campus Martius]] (\"Field of Mars\"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers.

Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the [[Domesday Book]] and [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]] of the year 1377.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=233}} Estimates of plague victims are usually [[Extrapolation|extrapolated]] from figures for the clergy.\n\n====Evidence against Y. pestis====\nThe plague theory implicating ''Y. pestis'' was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> In 1984, zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002 and 2013), [[David Herlihy]] (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nIn addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere or [[Replication crisis|were not replicable at all]], despite extensive samples from other mass graves.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague \u2013 which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\n====Means of transmission====\n[[Mathematical modelling]] is used to match the spreading patterns and the means of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]]. A research in 2018 challenged the popular hypothesis that \"infected rats died, their flea parasites could have jumped from the recently dead rat hosts to humans\". It suggested an alternative model which \"the disease was spread from human fleas and body lice to other people\". The second model claims to better fits the trends of death toll because the rat-flea-human hypothesis would have produced a delayed but very high spike in deaths, which contradict historical death data.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Guarino |date=2018-01-16|work=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/01/16/the-classic-explanation-for-the-black-death-plague-is-wrong-scientists-say/|title=The classic explanation for the Black Death plague is wrong, scientists say|archive-url=http://archive.today/ru0O9|archive-date=2018-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rats May Not Be to Blame for Spreading the 'Black Death'|author=Rachel Rettner|publisher=[[Live Science]]|date=2018-01-17|url=https://www.livescience.com/61444-black-death-cause-found-transmission.html|}}</ref>\n\nMcCormick has suggested that earlier archaeologists were simply not interested in the \"laborious\" processes needed to discover rat remains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Michael|date=1 July 2003|title=Rats, Communications, and Plague: Toward an Ecological History|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=34|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1162/002219503322645439|issn=0022-1953|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3208221|type=Submitted manuscript}}</ref> Wall\u00f8e complains that all of these authors \"take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat \u2192 rat flea \u2192 human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread\", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n</ref> Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-[[commensalism|commensal]]) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Monica|author-link=Monica Green (historian)|date=2014|title=Taking \"Pandemic\" Seriously: Making the Black Death Global|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|journal=The Medieval Globe|pages=31ff|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408203736/http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|archive-date=8 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Anthrax====\n[[File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|[[Anthrax]] skin lesion]]\nA variety of alternatives to ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward.

This blockage starves the fleas and drives them to aggressive feeding behaviour and attempts to clear the blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host.

Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the [[Domesday Book]] and [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]] of the year 1377.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=233}} Estimates of plague victims are usually [[Extrapolation|extrapolated]] from figures for the clergy.\n\n====Evidence against Y. pestis====\nThe plague theory implicating ''Y. pestis'' was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> In 1984, zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002 and 2013), [[David Herlihy]] (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nIn addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere or [[Replication crisis|were not replicable at all]], despite extensive samples from other mass graves.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague \u2013 which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\n====Means of transmission====\n[[Mathematical modelling]] is used to match the spreading patterns and the means of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]]. A research in 2018 challenged the popular hypothesis that \"infected rats died, their flea parasites could have jumped from the recently dead rat hosts to humans\". It suggested an alternative model which \"the disease was spread from human fleas and body lice to other people\". The second model claims to better fits the trends of death toll because the rat-flea-human hypothesis would have produced a delayed but very high spike in deaths, which contradict historical death data.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Guarino |date=2018-01-16|work=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/01/16/the-classic-explanation-for-the-black-death-plague-is-wrong-scientists-say/|title=The classic explanation for the Black Death plague is wrong, scientists say|archive-url=http://archive.today/ru0O9|archive-date=2018-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rats May Not Be to Blame for Spreading the 'Black Death'|author=Rachel Rettner|publisher=[[Live Science]]|date=2018-01-17|url=https://www.livescience.com/61444-black-death-cause-found-transmission.html|}}</ref>\n\nMcCormick has suggested that earlier archaeologists were simply not interested in the \"laborious\" processes needed to discover rat remains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Michael|date=1 July 2003|title=Rats, Communications, and Plague: Toward an Ecological History|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=34|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1162/002219503322645439|issn=0022-1953|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3208221|type=Submitted manuscript}}</ref> Wall\u00f8e complains that all of these authors \"take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat \u2192 rat flea \u2192 human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread\", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n</ref> Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-[[commensalism|commensal]]) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Monica|author-link=Monica Green (historian)|date=2014|title=Taking \"Pandemic\" Seriously: Making the Black Death Global|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|journal=The Medieval Globe|pages=31ff|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408203736/http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|archive-date=8 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Anthrax====\n[[File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|[[Anthrax]] skin lesion]]\nA variety of alternatives to ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward.
