The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany.

After (and during) the war, numerous other Haredi and Hasidic Yeshivot were re-established there by survivors.\nThe Mir in Jerusalem - today the largest Yeshiva in the world - was established in 1944, by Rabbi [[Eliezer Yehuda Finkel]] who had traveled to Palestine to obtain visas for his students.\nPorat Yosef, the leading Sephardi Yeshiva, was founded in 1914; its  predecessor, Yeshivat Ohel Moed was founded in 1904.\nFrom the 1940s and onward, especially following  immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities,  Sephardi leaders, such as [[Ovadia Yosef]] and [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]], established various yeshivot to facilitate Torah education for Sephardi and [[Mizrahi Jews]] (and alternative to Lithuanian yeshivot).\n\nThe Haredi community has grown with time - In 2016, 9% of Israel's population was Haredi, including [[Sephardic Haredim]] -  supporting a large number of yeshivot correspondingly (see [[Israel #Religion]]). \nBoys and girls here attend separate schools, and proceed to higher Torah study, in a yeshiva or seminary, respectively, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18; see ''[[Chinuch Atzmai]]'' and ''[[Bais Yaakov]]''.\nA significant proportion of young men then remain in yeshiva until their marriage; after marriage, many continue their Torah studies in a kollel. (In 2006, there were 80,000 in full-time learning .<ref name =\"JVL\"/>)\nKollel studies usually focus on deep analysis of Talmud, and those Tractates not usually covered in the standard \"undergraduate\" program ; see [[#Talmud study]] below.\nSome Kollels similarly focus on Halacha in total, others specifically on those topics required for ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) or  [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|''Dayanut'']] (qualification as a Rabbinic Judge). The certification in question is often conferred by the Rosh Yeshiva.\n\n[[Mercaz Harav]], the foundational and leading [[Religious Zionism|Religious-Zionist]] yeshiva was established in 1924 by Ashkenazi [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. Many in the Religious Zionist community today attend a [[Hesder]] yeshiva (discussed [[#Types of yeshivot|below]]) during [[Religious_Zionism#Military_service|their national service]]; these offer a kollel for Rabbinical students. (Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].)\nWomen correspondingly study in a [[Midrasha]]. \nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''.\n[[Bar Ilan University]] allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly, which also offers a Haredi track;\nthere are [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot''.\nTraining as a ''Dayan'' in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\nSee [[Religious Zionism #Educational institutions]].\n\n=====United States=====\n:''See: [[:Category:Orthodox yeshivas in the United States]].''\nThe first Orthodox yeshiva in the United States was [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva (Manhattan)|Etz Chaim]] of [[New York City|New York]] (1886), modeled after Volozhin.

On Thursday nights, there may be an extra long night seder, known as ''mishmar'' sometimes lasting beyond 1:00 am, and in some yeshivot even until the following sunrise. On Fridays, there is usually at least one ''seder'' in the morning, with unstructured learning schedules for the afternoon. Saturdays have a special [[Shabbat]] schedule which includes some ''sedarim'' but usually no shiur.\n|}\n[[File:Yeshiva lunchroom.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Mincha]]'',  [[Yeshiva Centre, Melbourne]] ]]\nYeshiva study is differentiated from, for example university study, as regards several structural features - curriculum aside.\nThe year is structured into \"''zmanim''\"; the day is structured into \"''seders''\".\nThe learning itself is delivered through a \"''shiur''\", a lecture with pre-specified sources; \nstudy in general, and particularly the preparation for ''shiur'', takes place in \"''chavruta''\" or paired-study.\nThis study is in a common venue called the ''[[beth midrash|bet midrash]]''.\n\nThe institution is headed by its ''[[Rosh Yeshiva]]'', while other senior Rabbis are referred to as \"Ram\" (''[[Rosh mesivta|Rosh Mesivta]], Reish Metivta''); \nthe [[Mashgiach ruchani|''Mashgiach'']] assumes responsibility for students' spiritual development (''[[Mashpia]]'', in Hasidic Yeshivot).\nA Kollel is headed by its ''[[Rosh Kollel]]'', even when it is part of a Yeshiva.\nA ''sho'el umeishiv'' (lit. \"ask and he answers\") is usually available to consult to students on difficult points in their day's Talmudic studies.\nThe Rabbi responsible for the (Talmud) ''shiur'' is known as a ''[[Maggid Shiur]]''. Students are known as ''talmidim''.\n\n===Academic year===\n{{see also|Bein Hazmanim}}\nIn most yeshivot, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called ''zmanim'' (lit. times; sing. ''zman''). ''Elul zman'' starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]] and extends until the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. Winter ''zman'' starts after [[Sukkot]] and lasts until about two weeks before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]). Summer ''zman'' starts after Passover and lasts until [[Rosh Chodesh]] Av or [[Tisha B'Av]], a duration of about three months.\n\n===Chavruta-style learning===\n{{main|Chavruta}}\nYeshiva students prepare for and review the [[Shiur (Torah)|''shiur'']] (lecture) with their ''chavruta'' during a study session known as a ''seder''.<ref name=\"Forta\"/> In contrast to conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student repeats the information back in tests, ''chavruta''-style learning challenges the student to analyze and explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights of the meaning of the text.<ref name=\"agora\"/><ref name=\"jeff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rebjeff.com/1/category/singing/1.html |title=Bringing the People Together |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |publisher=Reb Jeff}}</ref> A ''chavruta'' helps a student keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, organize his thoughts into logical arguments, and understand another person's viewpoint.<ref name=\"zobin\">{{cite book |pages=104&ndash;106 |title=Breakthrough to Learning Gemora: A Concise, Analytical Guide |last=Zobin |first=Zvi |year=1996 |publisher=Kest-Lebovits}}</ref>\n\nChavruta-style learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other, and then analyze, question, debate, and even argue their points of view to arrive at an understanding of the text.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\nSephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis. This concession is facilitated by arrangements for the student to receive credit towards a college degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.YeshivaDegree.com |title=Guide To Degree Completion Programs for Yeshiva Students |year=2011 |publisher=YeshivaDegree.com |accessdate=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402100219/http://www.yeshivadegree.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n[[Yeshiva University]] in New York provides a year's worth of credit for yeshiva studies.\n\nHaredi institutions with similar arrangements in place include [[Lander College for Men]], [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] and [[Hebrew Theological College]].\nFor historical context see: [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]], [[Volozhin yeshiva #History]], [[Yitzchok Hutner #Rabbinic and teaching career]] and [[Mesivta #Modern-day concept]].\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[Torah study]] at an Orthodox yeshiva comprises the study of [[rabbinic literature]], principally the Talmud, along with the study of ''[[Halacha]]'' (Jewish law); \n[[Musar literature|Musar]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]] are often studied also.\n<ref name=\"Actually\">{{cite news |last=Krakowski|first=Moshe |date=26 December 2018 |title=What Yeshiva Kids Are Actually Studying All Day |url=https://forward.com/life/faith/416616/what-yeshiva-kids-are-actually-studying-all-day/ |work=Forward |location= |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> \nIn some institutions, classical [[Jewish philosophy]] or Kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]). \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-Orthodox institutions]] offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.).

Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels - in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot - the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], less regularly [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Jewish educational institution for Torah study}}\n{{About| the Jewish educational system|the private university|Yeshiva University| the website|Yeshiva.co}}\n{{original research|date=April 2019}}\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|religion}} \n[[File:Mirs 14.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Mir Yeshiva (Jerusalem)]] - largest yeshiva in the world]]\n[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical [[beth midrash|''bet midrash'']] - [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]], [[Baltimore]]]]\n[[File:Carteret beis medrash.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chavrusas in study - [[Yeshiva Gedola of Carteret]]]]\n[[File:OrYisrael8885.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Morning ''seder'', [[Petah_Tikva#Schools_and_religious_institutions|Or-Yisrael]] (a yeshiva founded by the [[Chazon Ish]])]]\n[[File:RoyLindmanRabbinicalSchoolJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'', [[Jerusalem]]]]\n[[File:Rav_Kav_giving_Shiur_Klali_in_Yeshivas_Kerem_B'Yavne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Shiur klali'', [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]]]]\nA '''yeshiva''' ({{IPAc-en|j|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0283|i\u02d0|v|\u0259}}; {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4||sitting}}; pl. {{rtl-lang|he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea}}, {{transl|he|yeshivot}} or {{transl|he|yeshivos}}) is a [[Jewish education|Jewish]] [[educational institution]] that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Torah]], and [[Halacha]] (Jewish law).

The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany.

The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur.

Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe.

This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud.

After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels - in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot - the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot, emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), [[Niddah]], and often [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.<ref name=\"RCA\"/> <ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref>  \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eJewish law", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva"}

Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger's transcription) tend to be longer and less \"open\" than unstressed ones ({{IPA|[i e a o u]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0254 \u028a]}}). Long vowels also occur in loans and in a few onomatopoeic words (Grune 1998). All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).\n\nBerger (1998) finds the following consonants to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]], shown below in his transcription and in the [[help:IPA|IPA]]:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |  [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!\n!\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| m\n|\n| n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e45 {{IPA|/\u014b/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| p\n|ph {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}}\n| t\n|th {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n| \u1e6d {{IPA|/\u0288/}}\n|\u1e6dh {{IPA|/\u0288\u02b0/}}\n| k\n|kh {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}}\n| q\n|qh {{IPA|/q\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote2|group=decimal}}\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| b\n|\n| d\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e0d {{IPA|/\u0256/}}\n|\n| g\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n|'''c''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}}\n|'''ch''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02b0/}}\n|''\u0107 {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}''\n|''\u0107h {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/}}''\n|'''c\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282/}}\n|'''c\u0323h''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|''j {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0291/}}{{r|footnote4|group=decimal}}''\n|\n|'''j\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0256\u0361\u0290/}}{{r|footnote5|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n| s\n|\n|''\u015b {{IPA|/\u0255/}}''\n|\n|'''\u1e63''' {{IPA|/\u0282/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| h\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n| z\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|'''\u0121''' {{IPA|/\u0281/}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n| r\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n|\n| l\n|\n| y {{IPA|[j]}}{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n| \u1ef5 {{IPA|/\u027b/}}{{r|footnote7|group=decimal}}\n|\n| w{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes:\n{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=\n<ref name=footnote1>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[p\u02b0] ~ [p\u0361f] ~ [f]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote2>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[q\u02b0] ~ [q\u0361\u03c7] ~ [\u03c7]}}.</ref>\n<!--<ref name=footnote3>The Yasin dialect lacks aspirated affricates and uses the plain ones instead.</ref>-->\n<ref name=footnote4>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0291]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote5>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0290]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote6>Berger (1998) regards {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[j]}} as allophones of /u/ and /i/ that occur in front of stressed vowels.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote7>This phoneme has various pronunciations, all of which are rare sounds cross-linguistically.

In any case, it does not occur in the Yasin dialect, and in Hunza and Nager it does not occur at the beginning of words.</ref>\n}}\n\n==Grammar==\nBurushaski is a [[double-marking language]] and word order is generally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]].\n\n[[Noun]]s in Burushaski are divided into four [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to [[mass noun]]s). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, ''b\u00e1alt'' means 'apple' but when uncountable, it means 'apple tree' (Grune 1998).\n\nNoun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] consists of the noun stem, a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and [[grammatical number|number]] and [[declension|case]] [[Affix|suffixes]]. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]]/[[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and several [[Locative case|locatives]]; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.\n\nBurushaski [[verb]]s have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and [[nominalization]]; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for [[grammatical conjunction|coordination]]. [[Agreement (linguistics)|Agreement]] on the verb has both [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative]] and [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]] features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.\n\n== Nouns ==\n\n=== Noun classes ===\nIn Burushaski, there are four [[noun class]]es, similar to declensional classes in [[Indo-European languages]], but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical \"genders\":\n* '''m''' = male human beings, gods and spirits\n* '''f''' = female human beings and spirits\n* '''x''' = animals, [[countable]] nouns\n* '''y''' = abstract concepts, fluids, uncountable nouns\n\nBelow, the abbreviation \"'''h'''\" will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while \"'''hx'''\" will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.\n\nHowever, these rules are not universal \u2013 countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. ''ha'', 'house'. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes \u2013 for example, ''bay\u00fa'', when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The [[Article (grammar)|article]], [[adjectives]], [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and other attributes must be in [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun class of their subject.\n\n=== Pluralisation ===\nThere are two [[grammatical number|numbers]] in Burushaski: singular and [[plural]]. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:\n* '''h-class''': possible suffixes -ting, -aro, -daro, -taro, -tsaro\n* '''h- and x-class''': possible suffixes -o, -i\u0161o, -ko, -iko, -juko; -ono, -u; -i, -ai; -ts, -uts, -muts, -umuts; -nts, -ants, -ints, -iants, -ingants, -ents, -onts\n* '''y-class''': possible suffixes -ng, -ang, -ing, -iang; -eng, -ong, -ongo; -ming, -\u010ding, -i\u010ding, -mi\u010ding, -i\u010dang (Nagar dialect)\n\nSome nouns admit two or three different prefixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. ''bras'' 'rice', ''gur'' 'wheat', ''bishk\u00e9'', 'fur', (cf. [[plurale tantum]]). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. ''hag\u00far'' 'horse(s)'. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. ''bur\u00fam'' 'white' gives the x-class plural ''burum-i\u0161o'' and the y-class plural ''bur\u00fam-ing''.\n\nExamples of pluralisation in Burushaski:\n* ''waz\u00edir'' (m), pl. ''waz\u00edirishu'' 'vizier, minister'\n* ''hir'' (m), pl. ''huri'' 'man' (stress shifts)\n* ''gus'' (f), pl. ''gush\u00ednga'' 'woman' (stress shifts)\n* ''das\u00edn'' (f), pl. ''daseyoo'' 'girl', 'unmarried woman'\n* ''huk'' (x), pl. ''huk\u00e1'' 'dog'\n* ''thely'' (x), pl. ''til\u00ed'' 'walnut'\n* ''thely'' (y), pl. ''theleng'' 'walnut tree'\n\n=== Declension ===\nBurushaski is an [[ergativity|ergative]] language. It has five primary [[case (linguistics)|cases]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Case\n!Suffix\n!Function\n|-\n| [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] || unmarked || The subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive ones.\n|-\n| [[Ergative case|Ergative]] || ''-e'' || The subject of transitive verbs.\n|-\n| [[Oblique case|Oblique]] || ''-e''; ''-mo'' (f)|| [[Genitive]]; the basis of secondary case endings\n|-\n| [[Dative case|Dative]] || ''-ar'', ''-r'' || Dative, [[allative]].\n|-\n| [[Ablative case|Ablative]] || ''-um'', ''-m'', ''-mo'' || Indicates separation (e.g. 'from where?')\n|}\n\nThe case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. ''Hus\u00e9iniukutse'', 'the people of Hussein' (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:\n* ''hir-e'' 'the man's', ''gus-mo'' 'the woman's' (gen.)\n* ''hir-ar'' 'to the man', ''gus-mu-r'' 'to the woman' (dat.)\n\nThe genitive is placed before the thing possessed: ''Hunzue tham'', 'the Emir of Hunza.'\n\nThe endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering 'where?'), /-ar/ being terminative (answering 'where to?'), and /-um/ being ablative (answering 'where from?'). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:\n\n# ''-ts-'' 'at'\n# ''-ul-'' 'in'\n# ''-a\u1e6d-'' 'on; with'\n# ''-al-'' 'near' (only in the Hunza dialect)\n\nFrom these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Infix\n!Locative\n!Terminative\n!Ablative\n|-\n| '''-ts-''' || ''-ts-e'' 'at' || ''-ts-ar'' 'to' || ''-ts-um'' 'from'\n|-\n| '''-ul-''' || ''-ul-e'' 'in' || ''-ul-ar'' 'into' || ''-ul-um'' 'out of'\n|-\n| '''-a\u1e6d-''' || ''-a\u1e6d-e'' 'on','with' || ''-a\u1e6d-ar'' 'up to' || ''-a\u1e6d-um'' 'down from'\n|-\n| '''-al-''' || ''-al-e'' 'near' || ''-al-ar'' 'to' || ''-al-um'' 'from'\n|}\n\nThe regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.\n\n=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===\nNouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say 'mother' or 'arm' in Burushaski, but only 'my arm', 'your mother', 'his father', etc. For example, the root ''mi'' 'mother', is never found in isolation, instead one finds:\n* ''i-mi'' 'his mother', ''mu-mi'' 'her mother', \"gu-mi\" 'your mother'(3f sg.), ''u-mi'' 'their mother' (3h pl.), ''u-mi-tsaro'' 'their mothers'(3h pl.).\n\nThe pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and \u2013 in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>Noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-'', ''me-''\n|-\n| 2nd person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'', ''go-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''y-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-''\n|}\n\nPersonal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. ''khin'' 'he, this one here', but ''in'', 'he, that one there'. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.\n\n== Numerals ==\nThe Burushaski number system is [[vigesimal]], i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 ''altar'', 40 ''alto-altar'' (2 times 20), 60 ''iski-altar'' (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:\n* 1 ''han'' (or ''hen'', ''hak'')\n* 2 ''alt\u00f3'' (or ''alt\u00e1n'')\n* 3 ''isko'' (or ''iskey'')\n* 4 ''w\u00e1lto''\n* 5 ''\u010dind\u00f3''\n* 6 ''mish\u00edndo''\n* 7 ''thal\u00f3''\n* 8 ''alt\u00e1mbo''\n* 9 ''hunch\u00f3''\n* 10 ''t\u00f3orumo'' (also ''toorimi'' and ''turma'')\n* 100 ''tha''\n\nExamples of compound numerals:\n\n11 ''turma-han'', 12 ''turma-alto'', 13 ''turma-isko'', ... , 19 ''turma-hunti'';\n20 ''altar'', 30 ''altar-toorumo'', 40 ''alto-altar'', 50 ''alto-altar-toorumo'', 60 ''iski-altar'' and so on;\n21 ''altar-hak'', 22 ''altar-alto'', 23 ''altar-isko'' and so on.\n\n==Verbs==\n\n===Overview===\nThe verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[deletion (linguistics)|deletion]] and [[Accent (dialect)|accent shift]], which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can only specify certain basic principles.\n\nThe Burushaski [[finite verb]] falls into the following categories:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Category\n!Possible forms\n|-\n| [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]/[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] || Present, [[Future tense|Future]], [[Imperfect]], [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]], [[Pluperfect]]\n|-\n| [[Mood (linguistics)|Mood]] || [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], three [[Optative]]s, [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Conative]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical number|Number]] || Singular, [[Plural]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|Person]] || 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person (2nd person only in the imperative).\n|-\n| [[Noun class]] || the four noun classes m, f, x and y (only in the 3rd person)\n|}\n\nFor many [[transitive verb]]s, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronomimal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The [[infinitive]] forms \u2013 which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives \u2013 admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.\n\n=== The 11 positions of the finite verb ===\nAll verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions\n* '''The positions of Burushaski finite verbs'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Position\n!Affixes and their meanings\n|-\n| 1 || Negative prefix ''a-''\n|-\n| 2a/b || d-prefix (creates intransitive verbs) / n-prefix (absolutive prefix)\n|-\n| 3 || '''Pronominal prefixes''': subject of intransitive, object of transitive verbs\n|-\n| 4 || s-prefix (creates secondary transitive verbs)\n|- style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"\n|| 5 || style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"| '''Verb Stem'''\n|-\n| 6 || Plural suffix ''-ya-'' on the verb stem\n|-\n| 7 || Present stem mark ''-\u010d-'' (or ''\u0161'', ''ts''..) forming the present, future and imperfect\n|-\n| 8a/b || '''Pronominal suffix''' of the 1.sg.

The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the 'simple stem,' whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the 'present stem,' which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -\u010d- in position 7. The optative and imperative are derived directly from the stem. Altogether, the schema is as follows:\n\nThe formation of the tenses and moods of the verb ''her'' 'to cry', without prefixes:\n* '''Simple stem tenses'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| Conative || stem + personal suffix || ''her-i'' 'he starts to cry'\n|-\n| Preterite || stem [+ linking vowel] + m-suffix + personal suffix || ''her-i-m-i'' 'he cried'\n|-\n| Perfect || stem [+ linking vowel] + present auxiliary || ''her-a-i'' 'he has cried'\n|-\n| Pluperfect || stem [+ linking vowel] + perfect auxiliary || ''her-a-m'' 'he had cried'\n|}\n* '''Present stem tenses'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| Future || stem + present marker [+ linking vowel + m-suffix] + personal ending || ''her-\u010d-i'' 'he will cry'\n|-\n| Present || stem + present marker + linking vowel + present auxiliary || ''her-\u010d-a-i'' 'he is crying'\n|-\n| Imperfect || stem + present marker + linking vowel + perfect auxiliary || ''her-\u010d-a-m'' 'he was crying, used to cry'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Conditional || stem + present marker + linking vowel + m-Suffix (except 1. pl.) + ''\u010de'' || ''her-\u010d-u-m-\u010de'' '...{{nbsp}}he would cry',\n|-\n| stem + present marker + linking vowel + 1. pl. ending + ''\u010de'' || ''her-\u010d-an-\u010de'' 'we would cry'\n|}\n* '''Optatives and Imperative'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| ''\u00e1a''-optative || stem + ''\u00e1a'' (in all persons) || ''her-\u00e1a'' \"...{{nbsp}}should.. cry\"\n|-\n| ''m''-optative || stem [+ linking vowel] + m-suffix || ''her-u-m'' \"...{{nbsp}}should.. cry\u201c\n|-\n| ''\u0161''-optative || stem + ''(i)\u0161'' + personal suffix || ''her-\u0161-an'' \"he should cry\"\n|-\n| Imperative<br>singular || stem [+ ''\u00e9'' for ending-accented verbs] || ''her'' \"cry!\"\n|-\n| Imperative<br>plural || stem + ''in'' || ''her-in'' \"cry!\"\n|}\n\n=== Indication of the subject and object ===\nThe subject and object of the verb are indicated by the use of personal prefixes and suffixes in positions 3, 8 and 10 as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Affix\n!Position\n!Function\n|-\n| Prefixes || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3 || direct object of transitive verbs, subject of intransitive ones\n|-\n| Suffixes || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8/10 || subject of transitive and intransitive verbs\n|}\n\nThe personal prefixes are identical to the pronominal prefixes of nouns (mandatory with body parts and kinship terms, as above). A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:\n* '''Personal prefix''' (Position 3)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-''\n|-\n| 2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-''\n|}\n* '''Personal suffixes''' (Positions 8 and 10)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st/2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-a'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-o'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-ie''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i''\n|}\n\nFor example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb ''phus'' 'to tie', with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :\n* ''i-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties him\" (filled positions: 3-5-8-9-10)\n* ''mu-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties her (f)\"\n* ''u-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties them (pl. hx)\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-an'' \"we/you/they tie him\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-an'' \"you/they tie us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie it\"\n* ''gu-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie you\"\n\nThe personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. ''hir i-\u00edr-i-mi'' 'the man died'. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:\n* ''gu-ir-\u010d-u-m-a'' \"you will die\" (future)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he sank\" (preterite)\n\nPersonal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:\n* ''hur\u00fa\u1e6d-i-m-i'' \"he sat down\" (volitional action without prefix)\n* ''i-\u00edr-i-m-i'' \"he died\" (involuntary action with prefix)\n* ''ghurts-i-mi'' \"he went willingly underwater\", \"he dove\" (without prefix)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he went unwillingly underwater\", \"he sank\" (with prefix)\n\n=== The d- prefix ===\nA number of verbs \u2013 mostly according to their root form \u2013 are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to [[vowel harmony]]. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:\n* ''i-phalt-i-mi'' 'he breaks it open' (transitive)\n* ''du-phalt-as'' 'to break open, to explode' (intransitive)\n\nA master's thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in the Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc271839/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf|title=MIDDLE VOICE CONSTRUCTION IN BURUSHASKI: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER OF THE HUNZA DIALECT|last=Karim|first=Piar B.A.|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to \"indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity\" (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* ''hiles dd-i-il-imi''  'the boy drenched'\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Burushaski comparative vocabulary list|Burushaski comparative vocabulary list]] ([[Wiktionary]])\n* [[Partawi Shah]]\n* [[Languages of Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anderson, Gregory D.

The varieties of Hunza and Nagar diverge slightly, but are clearly dialects of a single language. The Yasin variety, also known by the Khowar exonym ''Werchikwar'', is much more divergent. Intelligibility between Hunza-Nagar and Yasin is difficult, and Yasin is sometimes considered a distinct language.<ref>Backstrom & Radloff (1992), Anderson (2006)</ref> Yasin is the least affected by [[language contact|contact with neighboring languages]], though speakers are bilingual in [[Khowar language|Khowar]].

Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger's transcription) tend to be longer and less \"open\" than unstressed ones ({{IPA|[i e a o u]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0254 \u028a]}}). Long vowels also occur in loans and in a few onomatopoeic words (Grune 1998). All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).\n\nBerger (1998) finds the following consonants to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]], shown below in his transcription and in the [[help:IPA|IPA]]:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |  [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!\n!\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| m\n|\n| n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e45 {{IPA|/\u014b/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| p\n|ph {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}}\n| t\n|th {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n| \u1e6d {{IPA|/\u0288/}}\n|\u1e6dh {{IPA|/\u0288\u02b0/}}\n| k\n|kh {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}}\n| q\n|qh {{IPA|/q\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote2|group=decimal}}\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| b\n|\n| d\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e0d {{IPA|/\u0256/}}\n|\n| g\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n|'''c''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}}\n|'''ch''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02b0/}}\n|''\u0107 {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}''\n|''\u0107h {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/}}''\n|'''c\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282/}}\n|'''c\u0323h''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|''j {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0291/}}{{r|footnote4|group=decimal}}''\n|\n|'''j\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0256\u0361\u0290/}}{{r|footnote5|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n| s\n|\n|''\u015b {{IPA|/\u0255/}}''\n|\n|'''\u1e63''' {{IPA|/\u0282/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| h\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n| z\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|'''\u0121''' {{IPA|/\u0281/}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n| r\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n|\n| l\n|\n| y {{IPA|[j]}}{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n| \u1ef5 {{IPA|/\u027b/}}{{r|footnote7|group=decimal}}\n|\n| w{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes:\n{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=\n<ref name=footnote1>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[p\u02b0] ~ [p\u0361f] ~ [f]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote2>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[q\u02b0] ~ [q\u0361\u03c7] ~ [\u03c7]}}.</ref>\n<!--<ref name=footnote3>The Yasin dialect lacks aspirated affricates and uses the plain ones instead.</ref>-->\n<ref name=footnote4>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0291]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote5>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0290]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote6>Berger (1998) regards {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[j]}} as allophones of /u/ and /i/ that occur in front of stressed vowels.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote7>This phoneme has various pronunciations, all of which are rare sounds cross-linguistically.

In any case, it does not occur in the Yasin dialect, and in Hunza and Nager it does not occur at the beginning of words.</ref>\n}}\n\n==Grammar==\nBurushaski is a [[double-marking language]] and word order is generally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]].\n\n[[Noun]]s in Burushaski are divided into four [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to [[mass noun]]s). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, ''b\u00e1alt'' means 'apple' but when uncountable, it means 'apple tree' (Grune 1998).\n\nNoun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] consists of the noun stem, a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and [[grammatical number|number]] and [[declension|case]] [[Affix|suffixes]]. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]]/[[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and several [[Locative case|locatives]]; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.\n\nBurushaski [[verb]]s have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and [[nominalization]]; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for [[grammatical conjunction|coordination]]. [[Agreement (linguistics)|Agreement]] on the verb has both [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative]] and [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]] features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.\n\n== Nouns ==\n\n=== Noun classes ===\nIn Burushaski, there are four [[noun class]]es, similar to declensional classes in [[Indo-European languages]], but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical \"genders\":\n* '''m''' = male human beings, gods and spirits\n* '''f''' = female human beings and spirits\n* '''x''' = animals, [[countable]] nouns\n* '''y''' = abstract concepts, fluids, uncountable nouns\n\nBelow, the abbreviation \"'''h'''\" will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while \"'''hx'''\" will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.\n\nHowever, these rules are not universal \u2013 countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. ''ha'', 'house'. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes \u2013 for example, ''bay\u00fa'', when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The [[Article (grammar)|article]], [[adjectives]], [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and other attributes must be in [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun class of their subject.\n\n=== Pluralisation ===\nThere are two [[grammatical number|numbers]] in Burushaski: singular and [[plural]]. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:\n* '''h-class''': possible suffixes -ting, -aro, -daro, -taro, -tsaro\n* '''h- and x-class''': possible suffixes -o, -i\u0161o, -ko, -iko, -juko; -ono, -u; -i, -ai; -ts, -uts, -muts, -umuts; -nts, -ants, -ints, -iants, -ingants, -ents, -onts\n* '''y-class''': possible suffixes -ng, -ang, -ing, -iang; -eng, -ong, -ongo; -ming, -\u010ding, -i\u010ding, -mi\u010ding, -i\u010dang (Nagar dialect)\n\nSome nouns admit two or three different prefixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. ''bras'' 'rice', ''gur'' 'wheat', ''bishk\u00e9'', 'fur', (cf. [[plurale tantum]]). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. ''hag\u00far'' 'horse(s)'. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. ''bur\u00fam'' 'white' gives the x-class plural ''burum-i\u0161o'' and the y-class plural ''bur\u00fam-ing''.\n\nExamples of pluralisation in Burushaski:\n* ''waz\u00edir'' (m), pl. ''waz\u00edirishu'' 'vizier, minister'\n* ''hir'' (m), pl. ''huri'' 'man' (stress shifts)\n* ''gus'' (f), pl. ''gush\u00ednga'' 'woman' (stress shifts)\n* ''das\u00edn'' (f), pl. ''daseyoo'' 'girl', 'unmarried woman'\n* ''huk'' (x), pl. ''huk\u00e1'' 'dog'\n* ''thely'' (x), pl. ''til\u00ed'' 'walnut'\n* ''thely'' (y), pl. ''theleng'' 'walnut tree'\n\n=== Declension ===\nBurushaski is an [[ergativity|ergative]] language. It has five primary [[case (linguistics)|cases]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Case\n!Suffix\n!Function\n|-\n| [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] || unmarked || The subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive ones.\n|-\n| [[Ergative case|Ergative]] || ''-e'' || The subject of transitive verbs.\n|-\n| [[Oblique case|Oblique]] || ''-e''; ''-mo'' (f)|| [[Genitive]]; the basis of secondary case endings\n|-\n| [[Dative case|Dative]] || ''-ar'', ''-r'' || Dative, [[allative]].\n|-\n| [[Ablative case|Ablative]] || ''-um'', ''-m'', ''-mo'' || Indicates separation (e.g. 'from where?')\n|}\n\nThe case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. ''Hus\u00e9iniukutse'', 'the people of Hussein' (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:\n* ''hir-e'' 'the man's', ''gus-mo'' 'the woman's' (gen.)\n* ''hir-ar'' 'to the man', ''gus-mu-r'' 'to the woman' (dat.)\n\nThe genitive is placed before the thing possessed: ''Hunzue tham'', 'the Emir of Hunza.'\n\nThe endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering 'where?'), /-ar/ being terminative (answering 'where to?'), and /-um/ being ablative (answering 'where from?'). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:\n\n# ''-ts-'' 'at'\n# ''-ul-'' 'in'\n# ''-a\u1e6d-'' 'on; with'\n# ''-al-'' 'near' (only in the Hunza dialect)\n\nFrom these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Infix\n!Locative\n!Terminative\n!Ablative\n|-\n| '''-ts-''' || ''-ts-e'' 'at' || ''-ts-ar'' 'to' || ''-ts-um'' 'from'\n|-\n| '''-ul-''' || ''-ul-e'' 'in' || ''-ul-ar'' 'into' || ''-ul-um'' 'out of'\n|-\n| '''-a\u1e6d-''' || ''-a\u1e6d-e'' 'on','with' || ''-a\u1e6d-ar'' 'up to' || ''-a\u1e6d-um'' 'down from'\n|-\n| '''-al-''' || ''-al-e'' 'near' || ''-al-ar'' 'to' || ''-al-um'' 'from'\n|}\n\nThe regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.\n\n=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===\nNouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say 'mother' or 'arm' in Burushaski, but only 'my arm', 'your mother', 'his father', etc. For example, the root ''mi'' 'mother', is never found in isolation, instead one finds:\n* ''i-mi'' 'his mother', ''mu-mi'' 'her mother', \"gu-mi\" 'your mother'(3f sg.), ''u-mi'' 'their mother' (3h pl.), ''u-mi-tsaro'' 'their mothers'(3h pl.).\n\nThe pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and \u2013 in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>Noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-'', ''me-''\n|-\n| 2nd person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'', ''go-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''y-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-''\n|}\n\nPersonal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. ''khin'' 'he, this one here', but ''in'', 'he, that one there'. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.\n\n== Numerals ==\nThe Burushaski number system is [[vigesimal]], i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 ''altar'', 40 ''alto-altar'' (2 times 20), 60 ''iski-altar'' (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:\n* 1 ''han'' (or ''hen'', ''hak'')\n* 2 ''alt\u00f3'' (or ''alt\u00e1n'')\n* 3 ''isko'' (or ''iskey'')\n* 4 ''w\u00e1lto''\n* 5 ''\u010dind\u00f3''\n* 6 ''mish\u00edndo''\n* 7 ''thal\u00f3''\n* 8 ''alt\u00e1mbo''\n* 9 ''hunch\u00f3''\n* 10 ''t\u00f3orumo'' (also ''toorimi'' and ''turma'')\n* 100 ''tha''\n\nExamples of compound numerals:\n\n11 ''turma-han'', 12 ''turma-alto'', 13 ''turma-isko'', ... , 19 ''turma-hunti'';\n20 ''altar'', 30 ''altar-toorumo'', 40 ''alto-altar'', 50 ''alto-altar-toorumo'', 60 ''iski-altar'' and so on;\n21 ''altar-hak'', 22 ''altar-alto'', 23 ''altar-isko'' and so on.\n\n==Verbs==\n\n===Overview===\nThe verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[deletion (linguistics)|deletion]] and [[Accent (dialect)|accent shift]], which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can only specify certain basic principles.\n\nThe Burushaski [[finite verb]] falls into the following categories:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Category\n!Possible forms\n|-\n| [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]/[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] || Present, [[Future tense|Future]], [[Imperfect]], [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]], [[Pluperfect]]\n|-\n| [[Mood (linguistics)|Mood]] || [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], three [[Optative]]s, [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Conative]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical number|Number]] || Singular, [[Plural]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|Person]] || 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person (2nd person only in the imperative).\n|-\n| [[Noun class]] || the four noun classes m, f, x and y (only in the 3rd person)\n|}\n\nFor many [[transitive verb]]s, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronomimal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The [[infinitive]] forms \u2013 which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives \u2013 admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.\n\n=== The 11 positions of the finite verb ===\nAll verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions\n* '''The positions of Burushaski finite verbs'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Position\n!Affixes and their meanings\n|-\n| 1 || Negative prefix ''a-''\n|-\n| 2a/b || d-prefix (creates intransitive verbs) / n-prefix (absolutive prefix)\n|-\n| 3 || '''Pronominal prefixes''': subject of intransitive, object of transitive verbs\n|-\n| 4 || s-prefix (creates secondary transitive verbs)\n|- style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"\n|| 5 || style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"| '''Verb Stem'''\n|-\n| 6 || Plural suffix ''-ya-'' on the verb stem\n|-\n| 7 || Present stem mark ''-\u010d-'' (or ''\u0161'', ''ts''..) forming the present, future and imperfect\n|-\n| 8a/b || '''Pronominal suffix''' of the 1.sg.

The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the 'simple stem,' whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the 'present stem,' which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -\u010d- in position 7. The optative and imperative are derived directly from the stem. Altogether, the schema is as follows:\n\nThe formation of the tenses and moods of the verb ''her'' 'to cry', without prefixes:\n* '''Simple stem tenses'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| Conative || stem + personal suffix || ''her-i'' 'he starts to cry'\n|-\n| Preterite || stem [+ linking vowel] + m-suffix + personal suffix || ''her-i-m-i'' 'he cried'\n|-\n| Perfect || stem [+ linking vowel] + present auxiliary || ''her-a-i'' 'he has cried'\n|-\n| Pluperfect || stem [+ linking vowel] + perfect auxiliary || ''her-a-m'' 'he had cried'\n|}\n* '''Present stem tenses'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| Future || stem + present marker [+ linking vowel + m-suffix] + personal ending || ''her-\u010d-i'' 'he will cry'\n|-\n| Present || stem + present marker + linking vowel + present auxiliary || ''her-\u010d-a-i'' 'he is crying'\n|-\n| Imperfect || stem + present marker + linking vowel + perfect auxiliary || ''her-\u010d-a-m'' 'he was crying, used to cry'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Conditional || stem + present marker + linking vowel + m-Suffix (except 1. pl.) + ''\u010de'' || ''her-\u010d-u-m-\u010de'' '...{{nbsp}}he would cry',\n|-\n| stem + present marker + linking vowel + 1. pl. ending + ''\u010de'' || ''her-\u010d-an-\u010de'' 'we would cry'\n|}\n* '''Optatives and Imperative'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| ''\u00e1a''-optative || stem + ''\u00e1a'' (in all persons) || ''her-\u00e1a'' \"...{{nbsp}}should.. cry\"\n|-\n| ''m''-optative || stem [+ linking vowel] + m-suffix || ''her-u-m'' \"...{{nbsp}}should.. cry\u201c\n|-\n| ''\u0161''-optative || stem + ''(i)\u0161'' + personal suffix || ''her-\u0161-an'' \"he should cry\"\n|-\n| Imperative<br>singular || stem [+ ''\u00e9'' for ending-accented verbs] || ''her'' \"cry!\"\n|-\n| Imperative<br>plural || stem + ''in'' || ''her-in'' \"cry!\"\n|}\n\n=== Indication of the subject and object ===\nThe subject and object of the verb are indicated by the use of personal prefixes and suffixes in positions 3, 8 and 10 as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Affix\n!Position\n!Function\n|-\n| Prefixes || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3 || direct object of transitive verbs, subject of intransitive ones\n|-\n| Suffixes || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8/10 || subject of transitive and intransitive verbs\n|}\n\nThe personal prefixes are identical to the pronominal prefixes of nouns (mandatory with body parts and kinship terms, as above). A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:\n* '''Personal prefix''' (Position 3)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-''\n|-\n| 2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-''\n|}\n* '''Personal suffixes''' (Positions 8 and 10)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st/2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-a'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-o'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-ie''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i''\n|}\n\nFor example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb ''phus'' 'to tie', with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :\n* ''i-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties him\" (filled positions: 3-5-8-9-10)\n* ''mu-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties her (f)\"\n* ''u-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties them (pl. hx)\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-an'' \"we/you/they tie him\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-an'' \"you/they tie us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie it\"\n* ''gu-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie you\"\n\nThe personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. ''hir i-\u00edr-i-mi'' 'the man died'. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:\n* ''gu-ir-\u010d-u-m-a'' \"you will die\" (future)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he sank\" (preterite)\n\nPersonal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:\n* ''hur\u00fa\u1e6d-i-m-i'' \"he sat down\" (volitional action without prefix)\n* ''i-\u00edr-i-m-i'' \"he died\" (involuntary action with prefix)\n* ''ghurts-i-mi'' \"he went willingly underwater\", \"he dove\" (without prefix)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he went unwillingly underwater\", \"he sank\" (with prefix)\n\n=== The d- prefix ===\nA number of verbs \u2013 mostly according to their root form \u2013 are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to [[vowel harmony]]. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:\n* ''i-phalt-i-mi'' 'he breaks it open' (transitive)\n* ''du-phalt-as'' 'to break open, to explode' (intransitive)\n\nA master's thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in the Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc271839/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf|title=MIDDLE VOICE CONSTRUCTION IN BURUSHASKI: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER OF THE HUNZA DIALECT|last=Karim|first=Piar B.A.|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to \"indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity\" (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* ''hiles dd-i-il-imi''  'the boy drenched'\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Burushaski comparative vocabulary list|Burushaski comparative vocabulary list]] ([[Wiktionary]])\n* [[Partawi Shah]]\n* [[Languages of Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anderson, Gregory D.

It is located at the center of the gland, being surrounded by the [[adrenal cortex]]. It is the innermost part of the adrenal gland, consisting of cells that secrete [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), and a small amount of [[dopamine]] in response to stimulation by [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] [[preganglionic neurons]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe adrenal medulla consists of irregularly shaped cells grouped around blood vessels. These cells are intimately connected with the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).  In fact, these adrenal medullary cells are modified postganglionic neurons, and preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers lead to them directly from the central nervous system.

In unpointed Biblical Hebrew, most vowels are not written and the rest are written only ambiguously, as certain consonants can double as vowel markers (similar to the [[Latin]] use of V to indicate both U and V). These are referred to as [[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]] (\"mothers of reading\"). Therefore, in general, it is difficult to deduce how a word is pronounced only from its spelling, and the Tetragrammaton is a particular example: two of its letters can serve as vowels, and two are vocalic place-holders, which are not pronounced.\n\nThe original [[abjad|consonantal text]] of the Hebrew Bible was, several centuries later, provided with vowel marks by the [[Masoretes]] to assist reading. In places that the consonants of the text to be read (the [[Qere and Ketiv|''qere'']]) differed from the consonants of the written text (the [[Qere and Ketiv|''ketiv'']]), they wrote the ''qere'' in the margin as a note showing what was to be read. In such a case the vowels of the ''qere'' were written on the ''ketiv''. For a few frequent words, the marginal note was omitted: these are called [[Qere and Ketiv#Qere perpetuum|qere perpetuum]].\n\nOne of the frequent cases was the Tetragrammaton, which according to later Jewish practices should not be pronounced but read as \"[[Names of God in Judaism#Adonai|Adonai]]\" (\"My Lord\"), or, if the previous or next word already was [[Adonai]], as \"[[Elohim]]\" (\"God\"). \nWriting the vowel diacritics of these two words on the consonants YHVH produces {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4|rtl=yes}} and {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b1\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b4\u05d4\u200e|rtl=yes}} respectively, [[ghost word|non-words]] that would spell \"Yehovah\" and \"Yehovih\" respectively.<ref>{{cite book |title=Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, Volume 3 |editor=G.

(In his 1828 book, Gesenius attributed this view also to [[Adriaan Reland|Reland]]and Simonis, but removed their names in 1833 and 1834 and placed Reland as a supporter instead of ''Yahweh''.) Supporters of this view, Genesius said, were not altogether without means of defending their position, since the theophoric name prefixes \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9 {{IPA|/jeho/}} and \u05d9\u05d5 {{IPA|/jo/}} could most easily be explained as derived from \"Jehovah\".\n\nIn 1833 and 1834 Gesenius referred to the 1707 book in which [[Adriaan Reland]] reprinted the views of several other scholars debating the reasons for and against the pronunciation as \"Yahweh\" or as \"Jehovah\", to enable readers to make their own judgement. By then the majority view, shared by Reland, was that the pronunciation as ''Yahweh'' (for which the Hebrew punctuation would be {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b7\u05d4\u05b0\u05d5\u05b6\u05d4|rtl=yes}}: see image to the right) more accurately represents how the Tetragrammaton was pronounced than the usual Masoretic punctuation \"{{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4|rtl=yes}}\", from which the English transliteration ''[[Jehovah]]'' has been derived. (A less usual Masoretic punctuation, \"{{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b1\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b4\u05d4|rtl=yes}}\", is used where the synagogue reader speaks \"Elohim\", as he speaks \"Adonai\" where the more usual punctuation appears.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pDqyxbtzTIsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=1707+Decas+Reeland#v=onepage&q=1707+Decas+Reeland&f=false|title=Decas exercitationum philologicarum de vera pronuntiatione nominis Jehova, quarum quinque priores lectionem Jehova impugnant, posteriores tuentur.

He continued his studies and in the vast ''Thesaurus philologicus criticus linguae Hebraeae et Chaldaeae Veteris Testamenti'', on which he had only reached the second-last letter of the Hebrew alphabet at the time of his death, he rejected the interpretation of the name as \"Yahwoh\" and declared firmly in favour of \"Yahweh\", from which the theophoric name prefixes \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9 and \u05d9\u05d5 can be derived also.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gesenius|first=Wilhelm|title=Thesaurus philologicus criticus linguae Hebraeae et Chaldaeae Veteris Testamenti|year=1840|edition=2|volume=2|pp=575\u2013583|location=Leipzig|publisher=Friedrich Christian Wilhelm Vogel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kpTm1mMdtKIC&dq=Gesenius+Thesaurus+Philologicus}}</ref> This view is found also in later editions of his Lexicon.<ref>See p. 389 of Robinson's 1843 translation.</ref>\n\n===Yahweh===\n{{Main|Yahweh}}\n[[Robert Alter]] states that, in spite of the uncertainties that exist, there is now strong scholarly consensus that the original pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton is ''Yahweh'' ({{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05b7\u05d4\u05b0\u05d5\u05b6\u05d4}}): \"The strong consensus of biblical scholarship is that the original pronunciation of the name YHWH that God goes on to use in verse 15 was Yahweh.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S75SDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT240&lpg=PT240&dq=yahweh+consensus+pronunciation#v=onepage&q=yahweh+consensus+pronunciation&f=false|title=The Hebrew Bible: A Translation with Commentary|first=Robert|last=Alter|date=18 December 2018|publisher=W.

A constantly great amount of scholarly effort has been put in this question, especially as a result of more recent discoveries that challenged previously long-held assumptions. More specifically, W. G. von Baudissin (1929) maintained that right from its origins the LXX had rendered the Tetragrammaton by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, and that in no case was this latter a mere substitute for an earlier \u03b1\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9. Based on more recent evidence that had became {{sic}} available, [[Paul E. Kahle|P. Kahle]] (1960) supported that the Tetragrammaton written with Hebrew or Greek letters was retained in the OG and it was the Christians who later replaced it with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. S. Jellicoe (1968) concurred with Kahle. [[Hartmut Stegemann|H. Stegemann]] (1969/1978) argued that \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 /i.a.o/ was used in the original LXX. [[George Howard (Hebraist)|G. Howard]] (1977/1992) suggested that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was not used in the pre-Christian OG. [[Patrick W. Skehan|P. W. Skehan]] (1980) proposed that there had been a textual development concerning the divine name in this order: \u0399\u03b1\u03c9, the Tetragrammaton in square Hebrew characters, the Tetragrammaton in paleo-Hebrew characters and, finally, \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. [[Martin Hengel|M. Hengel]]  (1989) offered a similar scheme for the use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 for the divine name in the LXX tradition. Evolving R. Hanhart\u2019s position (1978/1986/1999), A. Pietersma (1984) regarded \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as the original Greek rendering of the Tetragrammaton in the OG text. This view was supported later by J. W. Wevers (2005) and M. R\u00f6sel (2007). Moreover, R\u00f6sel argued against the \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 being the original LXX rendering of the Tetragrammaton. [[Emanuel Tov|E. Tov]] (1998/2004/2008), [[Jan Joosten (biblical scholar)|J. Joosten]] (2011), and A. Meyer (2014) concluded that Pietersma\u2019s arguments are unconvincing. More particularly, Tov has supported that the original translators used a pronounceable form of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (like \u0399\u03b1\u03c9), which was later replaced by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, while Greek recensions replaced it with transliterations in paleo-Hebrew or square Hebrew characters. [[Rolf Furuli|R. Furuli]] (2011), after comparing the various proposals, argued that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 did not replace the Tetragrammaton before the Common Era and the LXX autographs included the Tetragrammaton in some form of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9.

Shaw describes as \"inconsistent and contradictory\" the arguments by Pietersma, R\u00f6sel and Perkins for the originality of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and considers all theories that posit in the Septuagint a single original form of the divine name as merely based on ''a priori'' assumptions.<ref name=JHS/> Accordingly, he declares: \"The matter of any (especially single) 'original' form of the divine name in the LXX is too complex, the evidence is too scattered and indefinite, and the various approaches offered for the issue are too simplistic\" to account for the actual scribal practices (p.&nbsp;158). He holds that the earliest stages of the LXX's translation were marked by diversity (p.&nbsp;262), with the choice of certain divine names depending on the context in which they appear (cf. Gen 4:26; Exod 3:15; 8:22; 28:32; 32:5; and 33:19). He treats of the related blank spaces in Septuagint manuscripts and the setting of spaces around the divine name in 4Q120 and another manuscript (p.&nbsp;265), and repeats that \"there was no one 'original' form but different translators had different feelings, theological beliefs, motivations, and practices when it came to their handling of the name\" (p.&nbsp;271).<ref name=JHS/>\n\nHis view on these points has won the support of Didier Fontaine,<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/22707254/English_Review_of_F._Shaw_The_Earliest_Non-Mystical_Jewish_Use_of_%CE%99%CE%B1%CF%89_2014_ Didier Fontaine, \"English Review of F.

These are called Theosophic Kabbalah represented by Rabbi Moshe De leon and the Zohar, and the Kabbalah of Names or Prophetic Kabbalah whose main representative is Rabbi Abraham Abulafia of Saragossa. Rabbi Abulafia wrote many wisdom books and prophetic books where the name is used for meditation purposes from 1271 onwards. Abulafia put a lot of attention on Exodus 15 and the Songs of Moses. In this song it says \"Yehovah is a Man of War, Yehovah is his name\". For Abulafia the goal of propecy was for a man to come to the level of prophecy and be called \"Yehovah a man of war\". Abulafia also used the tetragrammaton in a spiritual war against his spiritual enemies. For example, he prophesied in his book \"The Sign\", Therefore, thus said YHWH, the God of Israel: Have no fear of the enemy\" (See Hylton, A The Prophetic Jew Abraham Abulafia, 2015).\n\n[[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]],<ref name=ramchal31>In \u05e7\u05dc\"\u05d7 \u05e4\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4 by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato, Opening #31; English translation in book \"138 Openings of Wisdom\" by Rabbi Avraham Greenbaum, 2008, also viewable at  http://www.breslev.co.il/articles/spirituality_and_faith/kabbalah_and_mysticism/the_name_of_havayah.aspx?id=10847&language=english, accessed 12 March 2012</ref> says that the tree of the Tetragrammaton \"unfolds\" in accordance with the intrinsic nature of its letters, \"in the same order in which they appear in the Name, in the mystery of ten and the mystery of four.\" Namely, the upper cusp of the ''Yod'' is [[Arich Anpin]] and the main body of ''Yod'' is and [[Partzufim|Abba]]; the first ''Hei'' is [[Partzufim|Imma]]; the ''Vav'' is [[Zeir Anpin|Ze`ir Anpin]] and the second ''Hei'' is [[Partzufim|Nukvah]].

A Hebrew tetractys in a similar way has the letters of the Tetragrammaton (the four lettered name of God in Hebrew scripture) inscribed on the ten positions of the tetractys, from right to left. It has been argued that the Kabbalistic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], with its ten spheres of emanation, is in some way connected to the tetractys, but its form is not that of a triangle. The occult writer [[Dion Fortune]] says: \n: \"The [[Point (geometry)|point]] is assigned to Kether; \n: the [[Line (geometry)|line]] to Chokmah;\n: the two-dimensional [[plane (geometry)|plane]] to Binah; \n: consequently the three-dimensional [[Solid geometry|solid]] naturally falls to Chesed.\"<ref>The Mystical Qabalah, Dion Fortune, Chapter XVIII, 25</ref>\n\n(The first three-dimensional solid is the [[tetrahedron]].)\n\nThe relationship between geometrical shapes and the first four [[Sephirot]] is analogous to the geometrical correlations in tetractys, shown above under <span style=\"font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;\">Pythagorean Symbol</span>, and unveils the relevance of the Tree of Life with the tetractys.\n\n===Samaritans===\nThe [[Samaritans]] shared the taboo of the Jews about the utterance of the name, and there is no evidence that its pronunciation was common Samaritan practice.<ref name=Moore/><ref>The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture: Volume 3 \u2013 Page 152 [[Peter Sch\u00e4fer]], Catherine Hezser \u2013 2002 \" In fact, there is no proof in any other rabbinic writing that Samaritans used to pronounce the Divine Name when they took an oath.

Gentile Christians, primarily non-Hebrew speaking and using Greek texts, may have read \"Lord\" as it occurred in the Greek text of the [[New Testament]] and their copies of the [[Greek Old Testament]]. This practice continued into the Latin [[Vulgate]] where \"Lord\" represented the Tetragrammaton in the Latin text.  In [[Petrus Alphonsi]]'s Tetragrammaton-Trinity diagram, the name is written as \"Ieve\".  At the Reformation, the [[Luther Bible]] used \"Jehova\" in the German text of Luther's Old Testament.<ref>''A Catholic Handbook: Essentials for the 21st Century''  Page 51 William C.

In unpointed Biblical Hebrew, most vowels are not written and the rest are written only ambiguously, as certain consonants can double as vowel markers (similar to the [[Latin]] use of V to indicate both U and V). These are referred to as [[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]] (\"mothers of reading\"). Therefore, in general, it is difficult to deduce how a word is pronounced only from its spelling, and the Tetragrammaton is a particular example: two of its letters can serve as vowels, and two are vocalic place-holders, which are not pronounced.\n\nThe original [[abjad|consonantal text]] of the Hebrew Bible was, several centuries later, provided with vowel marks by the [[Masoretes]] to assist reading. In places that the consonants of the text to be read (the [[Qere and Ketiv|''qere'']]) differed from the consonants of the written text (the [[Qere and Ketiv|''ketiv'']]), they wrote the ''qere'' in the margin as a note showing what was to be read. In such a case the vowels of the ''qere'' were written on the ''ketiv''. For a few frequent words, the marginal note was omitted: these are called [[Qere and Ketiv#Qere perpetuum|qere perpetuum]].\n\nOne of the frequent cases was the Tetragrammaton, which according to later Jewish practices should not be pronounced but read as \"[[Names of God in Judaism#Adonai|Adonai]]\" (\"My Lord\"), or, if the previous or next word already was [[Adonai]], as \"[[Elohim]]\" (\"God\"). \nWriting the vowel diacritics of these two words on the consonants YHVH produces {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4|rtl=yes}} and {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b1\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b4\u05d4\u200e|rtl=yes}} respectively, [[ghost word|non-words]] that would spell \"Yehovah\" and \"Yehovih\" respectively.<ref>{{cite book |title=Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, Volume 3 |editor=G.

(In his 1828 book, Gesenius attributed this view also to [[Adriaan Reland|Reland]]and Simonis, but removed their names in 1833 and 1834 and placed Reland as a supporter instead of ''Yahweh''.) Supporters of this view, Genesius said, were not altogether without means of defending their position, since the theophoric name prefixes \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9 {{IPA|/jeho/}} and \u05d9\u05d5 {{IPA|/jo/}} could most easily be explained as derived from \"Jehovah\".\n\nIn 1833 and 1834 Gesenius referred to the 1707 book in which [[Adriaan Reland]] reprinted the views of several other scholars debating the reasons for and against the pronunciation as \"Yahweh\" or as \"Jehovah\", to enable readers to make their own judgement. By then the majority view, shared by Reland, was that the pronunciation as ''Yahweh'' (for which the Hebrew punctuation would be {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b7\u05d4\u05b0\u05d5\u05b6\u05d4|rtl=yes}}: see image to the right) more accurately represents how the Tetragrammaton was pronounced than the usual Masoretic punctuation \"{{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4|rtl=yes}}\", from which the English transliteration ''[[Jehovah]]'' has been derived. (A less usual Masoretic punctuation, \"{{lang|he|\u05d9\u05b1\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b4\u05d4|rtl=yes}}\", is used where the synagogue reader speaks \"Elohim\", as he speaks \"Adonai\" where the more usual punctuation appears.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pDqyxbtzTIsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=1707+Decas+Reeland#v=onepage&q=1707+Decas+Reeland&f=false|title=Decas exercitationum philologicarum de vera pronuntiatione nominis Jehova, quarum quinque priores lectionem Jehova impugnant, posteriores tuentur.

A constantly great amount of scholarly effort has been put in this question, especially as a result of more recent discoveries that challenged previously long-held assumptions. More specifically, W. G. von Baudissin (1929) maintained that right from its origins the LXX had rendered the Tetragrammaton by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, and that in no case was this latter a mere substitute for an earlier \u03b1\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9. Based on more recent evidence that had became {{sic}} available, [[Paul E. Kahle|P. Kahle]] (1960) supported that the Tetragrammaton written with Hebrew or Greek letters was retained in the OG and it was the Christians who later replaced it with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. S. Jellicoe (1968) concurred with Kahle. [[Hartmut Stegemann|H. Stegemann]] (1969/1978) argued that \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 /i.a.o/ was used in the original LXX. [[George Howard (Hebraist)|G. Howard]] (1977/1992) suggested that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was not used in the pre-Christian OG. [[Patrick W. Skehan|P. W. Skehan]] (1980) proposed that there had been a textual development concerning the divine name in this order: \u0399\u03b1\u03c9, the Tetragrammaton in square Hebrew characters, the Tetragrammaton in paleo-Hebrew characters and, finally, \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. [[Martin Hengel|M. Hengel]]  (1989) offered a similar scheme for the use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 for the divine name in the LXX tradition. Evolving R. Hanhart\u2019s position (1978/1986/1999), A. Pietersma (1984) regarded \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as the original Greek rendering of the Tetragrammaton in the OG text. This view was supported later by J. W. Wevers (2005) and M. R\u00f6sel (2007). Moreover, R\u00f6sel argued against the \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 being the original LXX rendering of the Tetragrammaton. [[Emanuel Tov|E. Tov]] (1998/2004/2008), [[Jan Joosten (biblical scholar)|J. Joosten]] (2011), and A. Meyer (2014) concluded that Pietersma\u2019s arguments are unconvincing. More particularly, Tov has supported that the original translators used a pronounceable form of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (like \u0399\u03b1\u03c9), which was later replaced by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, while Greek recensions replaced it with transliterations in paleo-Hebrew or square Hebrew characters. [[Rolf Furuli|R. Furuli]] (2011), after comparing the various proposals, argued that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 did not replace the Tetragrammaton before the Common Era and the LXX autographs included the Tetragrammaton in some form of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9.

Shaw describes as \"inconsistent and contradictory\" the arguments by Pietersma, R\u00f6sel and Perkins for the originality of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and considers all theories that posit in the Septuagint a single original form of the divine name as merely based on ''a priori'' assumptions.<ref name=JHS/> Accordingly, he declares: \"The matter of any (especially single) 'original' form of the divine name in the LXX is too complex, the evidence is too scattered and indefinite, and the various approaches offered for the issue are too simplistic\" to account for the actual scribal practices (p.&nbsp;158). He holds that the earliest stages of the LXX's translation were marked by diversity (p.&nbsp;262), with the choice of certain divine names depending on the context in which they appear (cf. Gen 4:26; Exod 3:15; 8:22; 28:32; 32:5; and 33:19). He treats of the related blank spaces in Septuagint manuscripts and the setting of spaces around the divine name in 4Q120 and another manuscript (p.&nbsp;265), and repeats that \"there was no one 'original' form but different translators had different feelings, theological beliefs, motivations, and practices when it came to their handling of the name\" (p.&nbsp;271).<ref name=JHS/>\n\nHis view on these points has won the support of Didier Fontaine,<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/22707254/English_Review_of_F._Shaw_The_Earliest_Non-Mystical_Jewish_Use_of_%CE%99%CE%B1%CF%89_2014_ Didier Fontaine, \"English Review of F.

These are called Theosophic Kabbalah represented by Rabbi Moshe De leon and the Zohar, and the Kabbalah of Names or Prophetic Kabbalah whose main representative is Rabbi Abraham Abulafia of Saragossa. Rabbi Abulafia wrote many wisdom books and prophetic books where the name is used for meditation purposes from 1271 onwards. Abulafia put a lot of attention on Exodus 15 and the Songs of Moses. In this song it says \"Yehovah is a Man of War, Yehovah is his name\". For Abulafia the goal of propecy was for a man to come to the level of prophecy and be called \"Yehovah a man of war\". Abulafia also used the tetragrammaton in a spiritual war against his spiritual enemies. For example, he prophesied in his book \"The Sign\", Therefore, thus said YHWH, the God of Israel: Have no fear of the enemy\" (See Hylton, A The Prophetic Jew Abraham Abulafia, 2015).\n\n[[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]],<ref name=ramchal31>In \u05e7\u05dc\"\u05d7 \u05e4\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4 by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato, Opening #31; English translation in book \"138 Openings of Wisdom\" by Rabbi Avraham Greenbaum, 2008, also viewable at  http://www.breslev.co.il/articles/spirituality_and_faith/kabbalah_and_mysticism/the_name_of_havayah.aspx?id=10847&language=english, accessed 12 March 2012</ref> says that the tree of the Tetragrammaton \"unfolds\" in accordance with the intrinsic nature of its letters, \"in the same order in which they appear in the Name, in the mystery of ten and the mystery of four.\" Namely, the upper cusp of the ''Yod'' is [[Arich Anpin]] and the main body of ''Yod'' is and [[Partzufim|Abba]]; the first ''Hei'' is [[Partzufim|Imma]]; the ''Vav'' is [[Zeir Anpin|Ze`ir Anpin]] and the second ''Hei'' is [[Partzufim|Nukvah]].

The occult writer [[Dion Fortune]] says: \n: \"The [[Point (geometry)|point]] is assigned to Kether; \n: the [[Line (geometry)|line]] to Chokmah;\n: the two-dimensional [[plane (geometry)|plane]] to Binah; \n: consequently the three-dimensional [[Solid geometry|solid]] naturally falls to Chesed.\"<ref>The Mystical Qabalah, Dion Fortune, Chapter XVIII, 25</ref>\n\n(The first three-dimensional solid is the [[tetrahedron]].)\n\nThe relationship between geometrical shapes and the first four [[Sephirot]] is analogous to the geometrical correlations in tetractys, shown above under <span style=\"font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;\">Pythagorean Symbol</span>, and unveils the relevance of the Tree of Life with the tetractys.\n\n===Samaritans===\nThe [[Samaritans]] shared the taboo of the Jews about the utterance of the name, and there is no evidence that its pronunciation was common Samaritan practice.<ref name=Moore/><ref>The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture: Volume 3 \u2013 Page 152 [[Peter Sch\u00e4fer]], Catherine Hezser \u2013 2002 \" In fact, there is no proof in any other rabbinic writing that Samaritans used to pronounce the Divine Name when they took an oath.

As examples of such vocalisation it mentioned \"Yahweh\" and \"Yehovah\". The early Christians, it said, followed the example of the Septuagint in replacing the name of God with \"the Lord\", a practice with important theological implications for their use of \"the Lord\" in reference to Jesus, as in {{Bibleverse||Philippians|2:9-11|ESV}} and other New Testament texts. It therefore directed that, \"in liturgical celebrations, in songs and prayers the name of God in the form of the ''Tetragrammaton'' YHWH is neither to be used or pronounced\"; and that translations of Biblical texts for liturgical use are to follow the practice of the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, replacing the divine name with \"the Lord\" or, in some contexts, \"God\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/Scripture/Name_CDW.pdf|title=Letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (PDF)|accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref> The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] welcomed this instruction, adding that it \"provides also an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the Name of God in daily life, emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/cdwtetragram.pdf |title=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Divine Worship (PDF) |accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Allah]] (Name of God in Islam which consists of four Arabic letters)\n* [[I Am that I Am]]\n* [[Names of God]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Commons category|Tetragrammaton}}\n{{Names of God}}\n\n[[Category:Tetragrammaton| ]]<!--please leave the empty space as standard-->\n[[Category:Kabbalistic words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Yahweh]]\n\n[[es:Yahveh#Escritura]]\n", "name_user": "Vali1105ved", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton"}

Like their previous hit \"[[Incomplete (Backstreet Boys song)|Incomplete]]\", the music video featured the Boys, now without [[Kevin Richardson (musician)|Kevin Richardson]], both individually and together. In the beginning, [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] is shown lying on the beach at dawn; [[Brian Littrell]] is in his house looking out; [[A.J. McLean]] is on the street with his car, much like in \"Incomplete\". [[Howie Dorough]] is shown sitting with his back against a wall near the beach. At various intervals in between, when the chorus is sung, the four are seen together on the Venice Pier. After the leads are sung, the scenes shift between the Boys individually and together; at the end of the video, the sun breaks and they look above in wonder.

{"title_page": "English grammar", "text_new": "{{Grammar series}}\n\n'''English grammar''' is the way in which meanings are encoded into wordings in the [[English language]]. This includes the structure of [[words]], [[phrases]], [[clauses]], and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], right up to the structure of whole texts.\n\nThere are historical, social, cultural and regional variations of English. Divergences from the [[grammar]] described here occur in some [[List of dialects of the English language|dialects]]. This article describes a generalized present-day [[Standard English]] \u2013 a form of speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and news, over a range of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] from formal to informal. There are differences in grammar between the [[standard variety|standard forms]] of [[British English|British]], [[American English|American]], and [[Australian English]], although these are more minor than differences in [[lexicon|vocabulary]] and [[English phonology|pronunciation]].\n\n[[Modern English]] has largely abandoned the [[inflectional]] [[grammatical case|case system]] of Indo-European in favor of [[analytic language|analytic]] constructions. The [[personal pronoun]]s retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant of the more extensive Germanic case system of Old English). For other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by [[word order]], by [[preposition]]s, and by the \"[[Saxon genitive]] or [[English possessive]]\" (''-'s'').<ref name=\"Huddleston phrasal genitive\">{{Cite book|quote=We conclude that both head and phrasal genitives involve case inflection. With head genitives it is always a noun that inflects, while the phrasal genitive can apply to words of most classes. |pages=479\u2013481|chapter= Nouns and noun phrases |last1=Payne|first1= John |last2=Huddleston |first2= Rodney |author-link2=Rodney Huddleston |editor1-last=Huddleston |editor1-first=Rodney |editor1-link=Rodney Huddleston |editor2-last= Pullum |editor2-first= Geoffrey |editor2-link=Geoffrey Pullum |title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}</ref>\n\nEight [[Part of speech|\"word classes\" or \"parts of speech\"]] are commonly distinguished in English: [[noun]]s, [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[preposition]]s, and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s. Nouns form the largest word class, and verbs the second-largest. Unlike many Indo-European languages, English nouns do not have [[grammatical gender]].\n\n==Word classes and phrases==\nNouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs form [[Open class (linguistics)|open class]]es \u2013 word classes that readily accept new members, such as the noun ''[[celebutante]]'' (a celebrity who frequents the fashion circles), and other similar relatively new words.<ref name=\"carter-mccarthy-p296\"/> The others are considered to be [[closed class]]es. For example, it is rare for a new pronoun to enter the language. Determiners, traditionally classified along with adjectives, have not always been regarded as a separate part of speech. [[Interjections]] are another word class, but these are not described here as they do not form part of the [[clause]] and [[Sentence go away brought about (linguistics)|sentence]] structure of the language.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p296>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=296}}</ref>\n\nLinguists generally accept nine English word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, and exclamations. English words are not generally marked for word class. It is not usually possible to tell from the form of a word which class it belongs to except, to some extent, in the case of words with inflectional endings or derivational suffixes. On the other hand, most words belong to more than one word class. For example, ''run'' can serve as either a verb or a noun (these are regarded as two different [[lexeme]]s).<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=297}}</ref> Lexemes may be [[inflected]] to express different grammatical categories. The lexeme ''run'' has the forms ''runs'', ''ran'', ''runny'', ''runner'', and ''running''.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/>  Words in one class can sometimes be [[Morphological derivation|derived]] from those in another. This has the potential to give rise to new words. The noun ''aerobics'' has recently given rise to the adjective ''aerobicized''.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/>\n\nWords combine to form [[phrase]]s. A phrase typically serves the same function as a word from some particular word class.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/> For example, ''my very good friend Peter'' is a phrase that can be used in a sentence as if it were a noun, and is therefore called a [[noun phrase]]. Similarly, [[adjectival phrase]]s and [[adverbial phrase]]s function as if they were adjectives or adverbs, but with other types of phrases the terminology has different implications. For example, a [[verb phrase]] consists of a verb together with any objects and other dependents; a [[adpositional phrase|prepositional phrase]] consists of a preposition and its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] (and is therefore usually a type of adverbial phrase); and a [[determiner phrase]] is a type of noun phrase containing a determiner.\n\n===Nouns===\nMany common [[suffix]]es form nouns from other nouns or from other types of words, such as ''-age'' (as in ''shrinkage''), ''-hood'' (as in ''sisterhood''), and so on,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/> although many nouns are base forms not containing any such suffix (such as ''cat'', ''grass'', ''France'').  Nouns are also often created by [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] of verbs or adjectives, as with the words ''talk'' and ''reading'' (''a boring talk'', ''the assigned reading'').\n\nNouns are sometimes classified semantically (by their meanings) as [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper nouns and common nouns]] (''Cyrus'', ''China'' vs. ''frog'', ''milk'') or as [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|concrete nouns and abstract nouns]] (''book'', ''laptop'' vs. ''heat'', ''prejudice'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p298/> A grammatical distinction is often made between [[count noun|count (countable) nouns]] such as ''clock'' and ''city'', and [[mass noun|non-count (uncountable) nouns]] such as ''milk'' and ''decor''.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=299}}</ref> Some nouns can function both as countable and as uncountable such as the word \"wine\" (''This is a good wine'', ''I prefer red wine'').\n\nCountable nouns generally have [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]] forms.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p298>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=298}}</ref> In most cases the plural is formed from the singular by adding ''-[e]s'' (as in ''dogs'', ''bushes''), although there are also [[irregular plural|irregular]] forms (''woman/women'', ''foot/feet'', etc.), including cases where the two forms are identical (''sheep'', ''series''). For more details, see [[English plural]]. Certain nouns can be used with plural verbs even though they are singular in form, as in ''The government were ...'' (where ''the government'' is considered to refer to the people constituting the government). This is a form of [[synesis]]; it is more common in British than American English. See {{slink|English plural|Singulars with collective meaning treated as plural}}.\n\nEnglish nouns are not marked for [[case (grammar)|case]] as they are in some languages, but they have [[possessive (linguistics)|possessive]] forms, through the addition of ''-'s'' (as in ''John's'', ''children's'') or just an [[apostrophe]] (with no change in pronunciation) in the case of ''-[e]s'' plurals and sometimes other words ending with ''-s'' (''the dogs' owners'', ''Jesus' love''). More generally, the ending can be applied to noun phrases (as in ''the man you saw yesterday's sister''); see below. The possessive form can be used either as a determiner (''John's cat'') or as a noun phrase (''John's is the one next to Jane's'').\n\nThe [[English possessive|status of the possessive]] as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate.<ref name=\"Hudson 2013\">{{Cite book |isbn=9789027273000|date=2013|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |title= Morphosyntactic Categories and the Expression of Possession |editor1-last=B\u00f6rjars |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Denison |editor2-first=David |editor1-link= David Denison |editor3-last=Scott |editor3-first=Alan |chapter= A cognitive analysis of John's hat |last1=Hudson|first1= Richard |author-link1=Richard Hudson (linguist) |pages=123\u2013148}}</ref><ref name=\" B\u00f6rjars 2013\">{{Cite book |isbn=9789027273000|date=2013|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |title= Morphosyntactic Categories and the Expression of Possession |editor1-last=B\u00f6rjars |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Denison |editor2-first=David | author-link1= David Denison |editor3-last=Scott |editor3-first=Alan |chapter= Expression of Possession in English |last1 =B\u00f6rjars | first1=Kersti |last2 =Denison | first2=David |editor1-link= David Denison |last3 =Krajewski | first3=Grzegorz |last4 =Scott | first4=Alan |pages=149\u2013176}}</ref> It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that the [[genitive]] ending may attach to the last word of the phrase. To account for this, the possessive can be analysed, for instance as a clitic construction (an \"[[enclitic]] [[postposition]]\"<ref name=\"Quirk group genitive\">{{Cite book|quote=[the ''-s'' ending is] more appropriately described as an enclitic postposition'|page=[https://archive.org/details/comprehensivegra00quir/page/328 328]|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph|authorlink1=Randolph Quirk|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Sidney|authorlink2=Sidney Greenbaum|last3=Leech|first3=Geoffrey|authorlink3=Geoffrey Leech|last4=Svartvik|first4=Jan|year=1985|title=A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language|location=Harlow|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-0-582-51734-9|url=https://archive.org/details/comprehensivegra00quir/page/328}}</ref>) or as an inflection<ref name=\"Oxford English Grammar, Case\">{{Cite book|quote=In speech the genitive is signalled in singular nouns by an inflection that has the same pronunciation variants as for plural nouns in the common case|pages=109\u2013110|last1=Greenbaum|first1= Sidney |author-link=Sidney Greenbaum |title=The Oxford English Grammar |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-861250-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|quote=In writing, the inflection of regular nouns is realized in the singular by apostrophe + ''s'' (''boy's''), and in the regular plural by the apostrophe following the plural ''s'' (''boys{{'}}'')|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph |last2=Greenbaum |first2=Sidney |last3=Leech |first3=Geoffrey |last4=Svartik |first4=Jan |title=A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language |url=https://archive.org/details/comprehensivegra00quir|url-access=registration|publisher=Longman |year=1985|page=[https://archive.org/details/comprehensivegra00quir/page/319 319]}}</ref> of the last word of a phrase (\"edge inflection\").\n\n====Phrases====\n[[Noun phrase]]s are phrases that function grammatically as nouns within sentences, for example as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] or [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb. Most noun phrases have a noun as their [[head (linguistics)|head]].<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299/>\n\nAn English noun phrase typically takes the following form (not all elements need be present):\n:{| cellspacing=\"5\"\n|- style=\"font-variant: small-caps; font-size: larger;\"\n! Determiner || + || Pre-modifiers || + || NOUN || + || Postmodifiers/Complement\n|}\n\nIn this structure:\n*the ''determiner'' may be an article (''the'', ''a[n]'') or other equivalent word, as described in the following section. In many contexts it is required for a noun phrase to include some determiner.\n*''[[pre-modifier]]s'' include adjectives and some adjective phrases (such as ''red'', ''really lovely''), and [[noun adjunct]]s (such as ''college'' in the phrase ''the college student''). Adjectival modifiers usually come before noun adjuncts.\n*a ''[[complement (linguistics)|complement]]'' or ''[[postmodifier]]''<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299/> may be a prepositional phrase (''... of London''), a [[relative clause]] (like '' ...which we saw yesterday''), certain adjective or [[participial]] phrases (''... sitting on the beach''), or a [[dependent clause]] or [[infinitive phrase]] appropriate to the noun (like ''... that the world is round'' after a noun such as ''fact'' or ''statement'', or ''... to travel widely'' after a noun such as ''desire'').\n\nAn example of a noun phrase that includes all of the above-mentioned elements is ''that rather attractive young college student to whom you were talking''. Here ''that'' is the determiner, ''rather attractive'' and ''young'' are adjectival pre-modifiers, ''college'' is a noun adjunct, ''student'' is the noun serving as the head of the phrase, and ''to whom you were talking'' is a post-modifier (a relative clause in this case). Notice the order of the pre-modifiers; the determiner ''that'' must come first and the noun adjunct ''college'' must come after the adjectival modifiers.\n\nCoordinating conjunctions such as ''and'', ''or'', and ''but'' can be used at various levels in noun phrases, as in ''John, Paul, and Mary''; ''the matching green coat and hat''; ''a dangerous but exciting ride''; ''a person sitting down or standing up''. See {{slink||Conjunctions}} below for more explanation.\n\nNoun phrases can also be placed in ''[[apposition]]'' (where two consecutive phrases refer to the same thing), as in ''that president, Abraham Lincoln, ...'' (where ''that president'' and ''Abraham Lincoln'' are in apposition). In some contexts the same can be expressed by a prepositional phrase, as in ''the twin curses of famine and pestilence'' (meaning \"the twin curses\" that are \"famine and pestilence\").\n\nParticular forms of noun phrases include:\n* phrases formed by the determiner ''the'' with an adjective, as in ''the homeless'', ''the English'' (these are [[plural]] phrases referring to homeless people or English people in general);\n* phrases with a pronoun rather than a noun as the head (see below);\n* phrases consisting just of a [[English possessive|possessive]];\n* [[infinitive]] and [[gerund]] phrases, in certain positions;\n* certain clauses, such as ''that'' clauses and [[relative clause]]s like ''what he said'', in certain positions.\n\n====Gender====\n{{Main|Gender in English}}\nA system of grammatical gender, whereby every [[noun]] was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, existed in [[Old English]], but fell out of use during the [[Middle English]] period. [[Modern English]] retains features relating to [[natural gender]], namely the use of certain nouns and [[pronoun]]s (such as ''he'' and ''she'') to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders  and certain others (such as ''it'') for sexless objects \u2013 although feminine pronouns are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes and analogous machinery) and nation states.\n\nSome aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement towards a preference for [[gender-neutral language]]. Animals are triple-gender nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns.<ref name=Siemund>{{cite book|last=Siemund|first=Peter|title=Pronominal Gender in English: A Study of English Varieties form a Cross-Linguistic Perspective|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref> Generally there is no difference between male and female in English nouns. However, gender is occasionally exposed by different shapes or dissimilar words when referring to people or animals.<ref name=\"NOUN GENDER\">[http://www.edufind.com/english-grammar/noun-gender/ NOUN GENDER] ''edufind.com''</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  Masculine !! Feminine !! Gender neutral\n|-\n|  ''man'' || ''woman'' || ''adult''\n|-\n|  ''boy'' || ''girl'' || ''child''\n|-\n|  ''husband'' || ''wife'' || ''spouse''\n|-\n|  ''actor'' || ''actress'' || ''performer''\n|-\n|  ''rooster'' || ''hen'' || ''chicken''\n|}\n\nMany nouns that mention people's roles and jobs can refer to either a masculine or a feminine subject, for instance \"cousin\", \"teenager\", \"teacher\", \"doctor\", \"student\", \"friend\", and \"colleague\".<ref name=\"NOUN GENDER\"/>\n\n*Jane is my friend. She is a dentist.\n*Paul is my cousin. He is a dentist.\n\nOften the gender distinction for these neutral nouns is established by inserting the words \"male\" or \"female\".<ref name=\"NOUN GENDER\"/>\n\n*Sam is a female doctor.\n*No, he is not my boyfriend; he is just a male friend.\n*I have three female cousins and two male cousins.\n\nRarely, nouns illustrating things with no gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to convey familiarity. It is also standard to use the gender-neutral pronoun (it).<ref name=\"NOUN GENDER\"/>\n\n*I love my car. She (the car) is my greatest passion.\n*France is popular with her (France's) neighbors at the moment.\n*I travelled from England to New York on the ''Queen Elizabeth''; she (the Queen Elizabeth) is a great ship.\n\n===Determiners===\n{{main|English determiners|English articles}}\nEnglish [[determiner (grammar)|determiner]]s constitute a relatively small class of words. They include the [[English articles|articles]] ''the'' and ''a[n]''; certain [[demonstrative adjective|demonstrative]] and [[interrogative]] words such as ''this'', ''that'', and ''which''; [[possessive adjective|possessives]] such as ''my'' and ''whose'' (the role of determiner can also be played by [[English possessive|noun possessive]] forms such as ''John's'' and ''the girl's''); various [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifying words]] like ''all'', ''some'', ''many'', ''various''; and [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s (''one'', ''two'', etc.). There are also many phrases (such as ''a couple of'') that can play the role of determiners.\n\nDeterminers are used in the formation of noun phrases (see above). Many words that serve as determiners can also be used as pronouns (''this'', ''that'', ''many'', etc.).\n\nDeterminers can be used in certain combinations, such as '''''all the''' water'' and '''''the many''' problems''.\n\nIn many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to be completed with an article or some other determiner. It is not grammatical to say just ''cat sat on table''; one must say ''my cat sat on the table''. The most common situations in which a complete noun phrase can be formed without a determiner are when it refers generally to a whole class or concept (as in ''dogs are dangerous'' and ''beauty is subjective'') and when it is a name (''Jane'', ''Spain'', etc.). This is discussed in more detail at [[English articles]] and [[Zero article in English]].\n\n===Pronouns===\n[[Pronoun]]s are a relatively small, closed class of words that function in the place of nouns or noun phrases. They include [[personal pronoun]]s, [[demonstrative pronoun]]s, [[relative pronoun]]s, [[interrogative pronouns]], and some others, mainly [[indefinite pronoun]]s.\n\n====Personal====\n{{main|English personal pronouns}}\nThe personal pronouns of modern standard English, and the corresponding [[possessive]] forms, are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!   !! [[Nominative case|Nominative]] !! [[Objective case|Oblique]] !! [[Reflexive pronoun|Reflexive]] !! [[Possessive determiner]] !! [[Possessive pronoun]]\n|-\n| 1st pers. sing. || ''I'' || ''me'' || ''myself'' || ''my'' || ''mine''\n|-\n| 2nd pers. sing./pl. || ''you'' || ''you'' || ''yourself/yourselves'' || ''your'' || ''yours''\n|-\n| 3rd pers. sing.|| ''she'', ''he'', ''they'', ''it'' || ''her'', ''him'', ''them'', ''it''  || ''herself'', ''himself'', ''themself'', ''itself''  || ''her'', ''his'', ''their'', ''its'' || ''hers'', ''his'', ''theirs'', ''its''\n|-\n| 1st pers. pl. || ''we'' || ''us'' || ''ourselves'' || ''our'' || ''ours''\n|-\n| 3rd pers. pl. || ''they'' || ''them'' || ''themselves'' || ''their'' || ''theirs''\n|}\n\nThe second-person forms such as ''you'' are used with both singular and plural reference. In the Southern United States, [[y'all]] (you all) is used as a plural form, and various other phrases such as ''you guys'' are used in other places. An archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference is ''[[thou]], thee, thyself, thy, thine, ''which are still used in religious services and can be seen in older works, such as Shakespeare's\u2014in such texts, the  ''you'' set of pronouns are used for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal [[T\u2013V distinction|V-form]]. ''You'' can also be used as an [[indefinite pronoun]], referring to a person in general (see [[generic you|generic ''you'']]), compared to the more formal alternative, ''[[one (pronoun)|one]]'' (reflexive ''oneself'', possessive ''one's'').\n\nThe third-person singular forms are differentiated according to the sex of the referent. For example, ''she'' is used to refer to a female person, sometimes a female animal, and sometimes an object to which female characteristics are attributed, such as a ship or a country. A male person, and sometimes a male animal, is referred to using ''he''. In other cases ''it'' can be used. (See [[Gender in English]].) The word ''it'' can also be used as a [[dummy subject]], in sentences like ''It is going to be sunny this afternoon''.\n\nThe third-person plural forms such as ''they'' are sometimes used with singular reference, as a [[gender-neutral pronoun]], as in ''each employee should ensure they tidy their desk''. Despite its long history, this usage is sometimes considered ungrammatical. (See [[Singular they|singular ''they'']].)\n\nThe possessive determiners such as ''my'' are used as determiners together with nouns, as in ''my old man'', ''some of his friends''. The second possessive forms like ''mine'' are used when they do not qualify a noun: as pronouns, as in ''mine is bigger than yours'', and as predicates, as in ''this one is mine''. Note also the construction ''a friend of mine'' (meaning \"someone who is my friend\"). See [[English possessive]] for more details.\n\n====Demonstrative and interrogative====\n\nThe [[demonstrative pronoun]]s of English are ''this'' (plural ''these''), and ''that'' (plural ''those''), as in ''these are good, I like that''. Note that all four words can also be used as determiners (followed by a noun), as in ''those cars''. They can also form the alternative pronominal expressions ''this/that one'', ''these/those ones''.\n\nThe [[interrogative pronoun]]s are ''who'', ''what'', and ''which'' (all of them can take the suffix ''[[-ever]]'' for emphasis). The pronoun ''who'' refers to a person or people; it has an oblique form ''[[whom]]'' (though in informal contexts this is usually replaced by ''who''), and a possessive form (pronoun or determiner) ''whose''. The pronoun ''what'' refers to things or abstracts. The word ''which'' is used to ask about alternatives from what is seen as a closed set: ''which (of the books) do you like best?'' (It can also be an interrogative determiner: ''which book?''; this can form the alternative pronominal expressions ''which one'' and ''which ones''.) ''Which'', ''who'', and ''what'' can be either singular or plural, although ''who'' and ''what'' often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number. For more information see [[Who (pronoun)|''who'']].\n\nAll the interrogative pronouns can also be used as relative pronouns; see below for more details.\n\n====Relative====\n{{main|English relative clauses}}\n{{for|\"who/whom\" and related forms|Who (pronoun)}}\nThe main [[relative pronoun]]s in English are ''[[who (pronoun)|who]]'' (with its derived forms ''whom'' and ''whose''), ''which'', and ''that''.<ref>Some linguists consider ''that'' in such sentences to be a [[complementizer]] rather than a relative pronoun. See [[English relative clauses#Status of that|English relative clauses: Status of ''that'']].</ref>\n\nThe relative pronoun ''which'' refers to things rather than persons, as in ''the shirt, which used to be red, is faded''. For persons, ''who'' is used (''the man who saw me was tall''). The [[oblique case]] form of ''who'' is ''whom'', as in ''the man whom I saw was tall'', although in informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] ''who'' is commonly used in place of ''whom''.\n\nThe possessive form of ''who'' is ''whose'' (''the man whose car is missing ...''); however the use of ''whose'' is not restricted to persons (one can say ''an idea whose time has come'').\n\nThe word ''that'' as a relative pronoun is normally found only in [[restrictive relative clause]]s (unlike ''which'' and ''who'', which can be used in both restrictive and unrestrictive clauses). It can refer to either persons or things, and cannot follow a preposition. For example, one can say ''the song that'' [or ''which''] ''I listened to yesterday'', but ''the song to which'' [not ''to that''] ''I listened yesterday''. The relative pronoun ''that'' is usually pronounced with a reduced vowel ([[schwa]]), and hence differently from the demonstrative ''that'' (see [[Weak and strong forms in English]]). If ''that'' is not the subject of the relative clause, it can be omitted (''the song I listened to yesterday'').\n\nThe word ''what'' can be used to form a [[free relative clause]] \u2013 one that has no antecedent and that serves as a complete noun phrase in itself, as in ''I like what he likes''. The words ''whatever'' and ''whichever'' can be used similarly, in the role of either pronouns (''whatever he likes'') or determiners (''whatever book he likes''). When referring to persons, ''who(ever)'' (and ''whom(ever)'') can be used in a similar way (but not as determiners).\n\n===={{Anchor|There as pronoun}}\"There\"====\nThe word ''there'' is used as a pronoun in some sentences, playing the role of a [[dummy subject]], normally of an [[intransitive verb]]. The \"logical subject\" of the verb then appears as a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] after the verb.\n\nThis use of ''there'' occurs most commonly with forms of the verb ''be'' in [[existential clause]]s, to refer to the presence or existence of something. For example: ''There is a heaven''; ''There are two cups on the table''; ''There have been a lot of problems lately''. It can also be used with other verbs: ''There exist two major variants''; ''There occurred a very strange incident''.\n\nThe dummy subject takes the [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural) of the logical subject (complement), hence it takes a plural verb if the complement is plural. In informal English, however, the [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] ''there's'' is often used for both singular and plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fowler|2015|p=813}}</ref>\n\nThe dummy subject can undergo [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]], ''Is there a test today?'' and ''Never has there been a man such as this.'' It can also appear without a corresponding logical subject, in short sentences and [[question tag]]s: ''There wasn't a discussion, was there? There was.''\n\nThe word ''there'' in such sentences has sometimes been analyzed as an [[adverb]], or as a dummy [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], rather than as a pronoun.<ref>For a treatment of ''there'' as a dummy predicate, based on the analysis of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], see [[Andrea Moro|Moro, A.]], ''The Raising of Predicates. Predicative Noun Phrases and the Theory of Clause Structure'', ''Cambridge Studies in Linguistics'', 80, Cambridge University Press, 1997.</ref> However, its identification as a pronoun is most consistent with its behavior in inverted sentences and question tags as described above.\n\nBecause the word ''there'' can also be a [[Deixis|deictic]] adverb (meaning \"at/to that place\"), a sentence like ''There is a river'' could have either of two meanings: \"a river exists\" (with ''there'' as a pronoun), and \"a river is in that place\" (with ''there'' as an adverb). In speech, the adverbial ''there'' would be given [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the pronoun would not \u2013 in fact the pronoun is often pronounced as a [[weak and strong forms in English|weak form]], {{IPA|/\u00f0\u0259(r)/}}.\n\n====Other====\nOther pronouns in English are often identical in form to [[English determiners|determiners]] (especially [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]]), such as ''many'', ''a little'', etc. Sometimes, the pronoun form is different, as with ''none'' (corresponding to the determiner ''no''), ''nothing'', ''everyone'', ''somebody'', etc. Many examples are listed as [[indefinite pronoun]]s. Another indefinite (or impersonal) pronoun is ''[[one (pronoun)|one]]'' (with its reflexive form ''oneself'' and possessive ''one's''), which is a more formal alternative to [[generic you|generic ''you'']].<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/one|title=''One'' Definition|dictionary=[[dictionary.com]]|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Verbs===\n{{Main|English verbs}}\n\nThe basic form of an English verb is not generally marked by any ending, although there are certain suffixes that are frequently used to form verbs, such as ''-ate'' (''formulate''), ''-fy'' (''electrify''), and ''-ise/ize'' (''realise/realize'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p301>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=301}}</ref> Many verbs also contain [[prefix]]es, such ''un-'' (''unmask''), ''out-'' (''outlast''), ''over-'' (''overtake''), and ''under-'' (''undervalue'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p301/> Verbs can also be formed from nouns and adjectives by [[Conversion (word formation)|zero derivation]], as with the verbs ''snare'', ''nose'', ''dry'', and ''calm''.\n\nMost verbs have three or four inflected forms in addition to the base form: a third-person singular present tense form in ''-(e)s'' (''writes'', ''botches''), a [[present participle]] and [[gerund]] form in ''-ing'' (''writing''), a past tense (''wrote''), and \u2013 though often identical to the past tense form \u2013 a [[past participle]] (''written''). Regular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms in ''-ed'', but there are 100 or so [[English irregular verbs|irregular English verbs]] with different forms (see [[List of English irregular verbs|list]]). The verbs ''have'', ''do'' and ''say'' also have irregular third-person present tense forms (''has'', ''does'' {{IPA|/d\u028cz/}}, ''says'' {{IPA|/s\u025bz/}}). The verb ''be'' has the largest number of irregular forms (''am, is, are'' in the present tense, ''was, were'' in the past tense, ''been'' for the past participle).\n\nMost of what are often referred to as verb [[grammatical tense|tenses]] (or sometimes [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s) in English are formed using [[auxiliary verb]]s. Apart from what are called the [[simple present (English)|simple present]] (''write'', ''writes'') and [[simple past (English)|simple past]] (''wrote''), there are also [[continuous aspect|continuous]] (progressive) forms (''am/is/are/was/were writing''), [[perfect aspect|perfect]] forms (''have/has/had written'', and the perfect continuous ''have/has/had been writing''), [[future tense|future]] forms (''will write'', ''will be writing'', ''will have written'', ''will have been writing''), and [[conditional tense|conditionals]] (also called \"future in the past\") with ''would'' in place of ''will''. The auxiliaries [[shall and will|''shall'' and ''should'']] sometimes replace ''will'' and ''would'' in the first person. For the uses of these various verb forms, see [[English verbs]] and [[English clause syntax]].\n\nThe basic form of the verb (''be, write, play'') is used as the [[infinitive]], although there is also a \"to-infinitive\" (''to be'', ''to write'', ''to play'') used in many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: ''(to) have written'', ''(to) be writing'', ''(to) have been writing''. The second-person [[imperative mood|imperative]] is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with ''let'' (''let us go'', or ''let's go''; ''let them eat cake'').\n\nA form identical to the infinitive can be used as a present [[subjunctive]] in certain contexts: ''It is important that he '''follow''' them'' or ''... that he '''be''' committed to the cause''. There is also a past subjunctive (distinct from the simple past only in the possible use of ''were'' instead of ''was''), used in some conditional sentences and similar: ''if I were'' (or ''was'') ''rich ...''; ''were he to arrive now ...''; ''I wish she were'' (or ''was'') ''here''. For details see [[English subjunctive]].\n\nThe [[passive voice]] is formed using the verb ''be'' (in the appropriate tense or form) with the past participle of the verb in question: ''cars are driven, he was killed, I am being tickled, it is nice to be pampered'', etc. The performer of the action may be introduced in a prepositional phrase with ''by'' (as in ''they were killed by the invaders'').\n\nThe [[English modal verbs]] consist of the core modals ''can'', ''could'', ''may'', ''might'', ''must'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''would'', as well as ''ought (to''), ''had better'', and in some uses ''dare'' and ''need''.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p303>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=303}}</ref> These do not inflect for person or number,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p303/> and do not have infinitive or participle forms (except synonyms, as with ''be/being/been able (to'') for the modals ''can/could''). The modals are used with the basic infinitive form of a verb (''I can swim, he may be killed'', ''we dare not move'', ''need they go?''), except for ''ought'', which takes ''to'' (''you ought to go'').\n\nThe [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'', along with the modal verbs and the other [[English auxiliary verbs|auxiliaries]], form a distinct class, sometimes called \"[[special verbs]]\" or simply \"auxiliaries\".<ref>C.D. Sidhu, ''An Intensive Course in English'', Orient Blackswan, 1976, p. 5.</ref> These have different syntax from ordinary [[lexical verb]]s, especially in that they make their [[interrogative]] forms by plain [[subject\u2013auxiliary inversion|inversion]] with the subject, and their [[negation|negative]] forms by adding ''not'' after the verb (''could I ...? I could not ...''). Apart from those already mentioned, this class may also include ''used to'' (although the forms ''did he use to?'' and ''he didn't use to'' are also found), and sometimes ''have'' even when not an auxiliary (forms like ''have you a sister?'' and ''he hadn't a clue'' are possible, though becoming less common). It also includes the auxiliary ''do'' (''does'', ''did''); this is used with the basic infinitive of other verbs (those not belonging to the \"special verbs\" class) to make their question and negation forms, as well as emphatic forms (''do I like you?''; ''he doesn't speak English''; ''we did close the fridge''). For more details of this, see [[do-support|''do''-support]].\n\nSome forms of the copula and auxiliaries often appear as [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s, as in ''I'm'' for ''I am'', ''you'd'' for ''you would'' or ''you had'', and ''John's'' for ''John is''. Their negated forms with following ''not'' are also often contracted (see {{slink||Negation}} below). For detail see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]].\n\n====Phrases====\nA verb together with its dependents, excluding its [[subject (grammar)|subject]], may be identified as a [[verb phrase]] (although this concept is not acknowledged in all theories of grammar<ref>[[Dependency grammar]]s reject the concept of finite verb phrases as clause constituents, regarding the subject as a dependent of the verb as well. See the [[verb phrase]] article for more information.</ref>). A verb phrase headed by a [[finite verb]] may also be called a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The dependents may be [[object (grammar)|object]]s, complements, and modifiers (adverbs or [[adverbial phrase]]s). In English, objects and complements nearly always come after the verb; a [[direct object]] precedes other complements such as prepositional phrases, but if there is an [[indirect object]] as well, expressed without a preposition, then that precedes the direct object: ''give me the book'', but ''give the book to me''. Adverbial modifiers generally follow objects, although other positions are possible (see under {{slink||Adverbs}} below). Certain verb\u2013modifier combinations, particularly when they have independent meaning (such as ''take on'' and ''get up''), are known as \"[[phrasal verb]]s\".\n\nFor details of possible patterns, see [[English clause syntax]]. See the [[English clause syntax#Non-finite clauses|Non-finite clauses]] section of that article for verb phrases headed by non-finite verb forms, such as infinitives and participles.\n\n===Adjectives===\nEnglish [[adjective]]s, as with other word classes, cannot in general be identified as such by their form,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p308>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=308}}</ref> although many of them are formed from nouns or other words by the addition of a suffix, such as ''-al'' (''habitual''), ''-ful'' (''blissful''), ''-ic'' (''atomic''), ''-ish'' (''impish'', ''youngish''), ''-ous'' (''hazardous''), etc.; or from other adjectives using a prefix: ''disloyal'', ''irredeemable'', ''unforeseen'', ''overtired''.\n\nAdjectives may be used [[attributive adjective|attributively]], as part of a noun phrase (nearly always preceding the noun they modify; for exceptions see [[postpositive adjective]]), as in ''the big house'', or [[predicate adjective|predicatively]], as in ''the house is big''. Certain adjectives are restricted to one or other use; for example, ''drunken'' is attributive (''a drunken sailor''), while ''drunk'' is usually predicative (''the sailor was drunk'').\n\n====Comparison====\nMany adjectives have [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] forms in ''-er'' and ''-est'',<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p309>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=309}}</ref> such as ''faster'' and ''fastest'' (from the positive form ''fast''). Spelling rules which maintain pronunciation apply to suffixing adjectives just as they do for similar treatment of [[English verbs#Past tense|regular past tense formation]]; these cover consonant doubling (as in ''bigger'' and ''biggest'', from ''big'') and the change of ''y'' to ''i'' after consonants (as in ''happier'' and ''happiest'', from ''happy'').\n\nThe adjectives ''good'' and ''bad'' have the irregular forms ''better, best'' and ''worse, worst''; also ''far'' becomes ''farther, farthest'' or ''further, furthest''. The adjective ''old'' (for which the regular ''older'' and ''oldest'' are usual) also has the irregular forms ''elder'' and ''eldest'', these generally being restricted to use in comparing [[sibling]]s and in certain independent uses. For the comparison of adverbs, see [[#Adverbs|Adverbs]] below.\n\nMany adjectives, however, particularly those that are longer and less common, do not have inflected comparative and superlative forms. Instead, they can be qualified with ''more'' and ''most'', as in ''beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful'' (this construction is also sometimes used even for adjectives for which inflected forms do exist).\n\nCertain adjectives are classed as [[ungradable adjective|ungradable]].<ref name=\"carter-mccarthy-p309\"/> These represent properties that cannot be compared on a scale; they simply apply or do not, as with ''pregnant'', ''dead'', ''unique''. Consequently, comparative and superlative forms of such adjectives are not normally used, except in a figurative, humorous or imprecise context. Similarly, such adjectives are not normally qualified with modifiers of degree such as ''very'' and ''fairly'', although with some of them it is idiomatic to use adverbs such as ''completely''. Another type of adjectives sometimes considered ungradable is those that represent an extreme degree of some property, such as ''delicious'' and ''terrified''.\n\n====Phrases====\nAn [[adjective phrase]] is a group of words that plays the role of an adjective in a sentence. It usually has a single adjective as its [[head (linguistics)|head]], to which [[modifier (linguistics)|modifier]]s and [[complement (linguistics)|complement]]s may be added.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p310>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=310}}</ref>\n\nAdjectives can be modified by a preceding adverb or adverb phrase, as in ''very warm'', ''truly imposing'', ''more than a little excited''. Some can also be preceded by a noun or quantitative phrase, as in ''fat-free'', ''two-metre-long''.\n\nComplements following the adjective may include:\n* [[prepositional phrase]]s: ''proud of him'', ''angry at the screen'', ''keen on breeding toads'';\n* [[infinitive]] phrases: ''anxious to solve the problem'', ''easy to pick up'';\n* [[content clause]]s, i.e. ''that'' clauses and certain others: ''certain that he was right'', ''unsure where they are'';\n* after comparatives, phrases or clauses with ''than'': ''better than you'', ''smaller than I had imagined''.\n\nAn adjective phrase may include both modifiers before the adjective and a complement after it, as in ''very difficult to put away''.\n\nAdjective phrases containing complements after the adjective cannot normally be used as attributive adjectives ''before'' a noun. Sometimes they are used [[postpositive adjective|attributively after the noun]], as in ''a woman proud of being a midwife'' (where they may be converted into relative clauses: ''a woman who is proud of being a midwife''), but it is wrong to say *''a proud of being a midwife woman''. Exceptions include very brief and often established phrases such as ''easy-to-use''. (Certain complements can be moved to after the noun, leaving the adjective before the noun, as in ''a better man than you'', ''a hard nut to crack''.)\n\nCertain attributive adjective phrases are formed from other parts of speech, without any adjective as their head, as in ''a two-bedroom house'', ''a no-jeans policy''.\n\n===Adverbs===\n[[Adverb]]s perform a wide range of functions. They typically modify verbs (or verb phrases), adjectives (or adjectival phrases), or other adverbs (or adverbial phrases).<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=311}}</ref> However, adverbs also sometimes qualify noun phrases ('''''only''' the boss''; '''''quite''' a lovely place''), pronouns and determiners ('''''almost''' all''), prepositional phrases ('''''halfway''' through the movie''), or whole sentences, to provide contextual comment or indicate an attitude ('''''Frankly''', I don't believe you'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=313}}</ref> They can also indicate a relationship between clauses or sentences (''He died, and '''consequently''' I inherited the estate'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313/>\n\nMany English adverbs are formed from adjectives by adding the ending ''-ly'', as in ''hopefully'', ''widely'', ''theoretically'' (for details of spelling and etymology, see ''[[-ly]]''). Certain words can be used as both adjectives and adverbs, such as ''fast'', ''straight'', and ''hard''; these are [[flat adverb]]s.  In earlier usage more flat adverbs were accepted in formal usage; many of these survive in idioms and colloquially. (''That's just '''plain''' ugly.'')  Some adjectives can also be used as flat adverbs when they actually describe the subject. (''The streaker ran '''naked''''', not **''The streaker ran nakedly''.)  The adverb corresponding to the adjective ''good'' is ''well'' (note that ''bad'' forms the regular ''badly'', although ''ill'' is occasionally used in some phrases).\n\nThere are also many adverbs that are not derived from adjectives,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311/> including adverbs of time, of frequency, of place,  of degree and with other meanings. Some suffixes that are commonly used to form adverbs from nouns are ''-ward[s]'' (as in ''homeward[s]'') and ''-wise'' (as in ''lengthwise'').\n\nMost adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by modification with ''more'' and ''most'': ''often'', ''more often'', ''most often''; ''smoothly'', ''more smoothly'', ''most smoothly'' (see also [[#Comparison|comparison of adjectives]], above). However, a few adverbs retain irregular inflection for [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] forms:<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311/> ''much'', ''more'', ''most''; ''a little'', ''less'', ''least''; ''well'', ''better'', ''best''; ''badly'', ''worse'', ''worst''; ''far'', ''further'' (''farther''), ''furthest'' (''farthest''); or follow the regular adjectival inflection: ''fast'', ''faster'', ''fastest''; ''soon'', ''sooner'', ''soonest''; etc.\n\nAdverbs indicating the manner of an action are generally placed after the verb and its objects (''We considered the proposal '''carefully'''''), although other positions are often possible (''We '''carefully''' considered the proposal''). Many adverbs of frequency, degree, certainty, etc. (such as ''often'', ''always'', ''almost'', ''probably'', and various others such as ''just'') tend to be placed before the verb (''they '''usually''' have chips''), although if there is an auxiliary or other \"special verb\" (see {{slink||Verbs}} above), then the normal position for such adverbs is after that special verb (or after the first of them, if there is more than one): ''I have '''just''' finished the crossword''; ''She can '''usually''' manage a pint''; ''We are '''never''' late''; ''You might '''possibly''' have been unconscious''. Adverbs that provide a connection with previous information (such as ''next'', ''then'', ''however''), and those that provide the context (such as time or place) for a sentence, are typically placed at the start of the sentence: '''''Yesterday''' we went on a shopping expedition.''<ref>[http://esl.about.com/od/grammarstructures/a/adverb_placement.htm esl.about.com]</ref>\n\nA special type of adverb is the adverbial particle used to form [[phrasal verb]]s (such as ''up'' in ''pick up'', ''on'' in ''get on'', etc.) If such a verb also has an object, then the particle may precede or follow the object, although it will normally follow the object if the object is a pronoun (''pick the pen up'' or ''pick up the pen'', but ''pick it up'').\n\n====Phrases====\nAn [[adverb phrase]] is a phrase that acts as an adverb within a sentence.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p312>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=312}}</ref> An adverb phrase may have an adverb as its [[head (linguistics)|head]], together with any modifiers (other adverbs or adverb phrases) and complements, analogously to the [[#Adjective phrases|adjective phrases]] described above. For example: ''very sleepily''; ''all too suddenly''; ''oddly enough''; ''perhaps shockingly for us''.\n\nAnother very common type of adverb phrase is the [[prepositional phrase]], which consists of a preposition and its object: ''in the pool''; ''after two years''; ''for the sake of harmony''.\n\n===Prepositions===\n[[Preposition]]s form a closed word class,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313/> although there are also certain phrases that serve as prepositions, such as ''in front of''. A single preposition may have a variety of meanings, often including temporal, spatial and abstract. Many words that are prepositions can also serve as adverbs. Examples of common English prepositions (including phrasal instances) are ''of'', ''in'', ''on'', ''over'', ''under'', ''to'', ''from'', ''with'', ''in front of'', ''behind'', ''opposite'', ''by'', ''before'', ''after'', ''during'', ''through'', ''in spite of'' or ''despite'', ''between'', ''among'', etc.\n\nA preposition is usually used with a noun phrase as its [[complement (grammar)|complement]]. A preposition together with its complement is called a [[prepositional phrase]].<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p314-315>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|pp=314\u2013315}}</ref> Examples are ''in England'', ''under the table'', ''after six pleasant weeks'', ''between the land and the sea''. A prepositional phrase can be used as a complement or post-modifier of a noun in a noun phrase, as in ''the man in the car'', ''the start of the fight''; as a complement of a verb or adjective, as in ''deal with the problem'', ''proud of oneself''; or generally as an adverb phrase (see above).\n\nEnglish allows the use of [[Preposition stranding|\"stranded\" prepositions]]. This can occur in interrogative and [[English relative clauses|relative clauses]], where the interrogative or relative pronoun that is the preposition's complement is moved to the start ([[wh-fronting|fronted]]), leaving the preposition in place. This kind of structure is avoided in some kinds of formal English. For example:\n*''What are you talking about?'' (Possible alternative version: ''About what are you talking?'')\n*''The song that you were listening to ...'' (more formal: ''The song to which you were listening ...'')\nNotice that in the second example the relative pronoun ''that'' could be omitted.\n\nStranded prepositions can also arise in [[English passive voice|passive voice]] constructions and other uses of passive [[past participle|past participial phrases]], where the complement in a prepositional phrase can become [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] in the same way that a verb's direct object would: ''it was looked at''; ''I will be operated on''; ''get your teeth seen to''. The same can happen in certain uses of [[infinitive]] phrases: ''he is nice to talk to''; ''this is the page to make copies of''.\n\n===Conjunctions===\n[[Conjunction (grammar)|Conjunction]]s express a variety of logical relations between items, phrases, clauses and sentences.<ref name=\"carter-mccarthy-p315\">{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=315}}</ref> The principal [[coordinating conjunction]]s in English are: ''and'', ''or'', ''but'', ''nor'', ''so'', ''yet'', and ''for''. These can be used in many grammatical contexts to link two or more items of equal grammatical status,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p315/> for example:\n*Noun phrases combined into a longer noun phrase, such as ''John, Eric, and Jill'', ''the red coat or the blue one''. When ''and'' is used, the resulting noun phrase is plural. A determiner does not need to be repeated with the individual elements: ''the cat, the dog, and the mouse'' and ''the cat, dog, and mouse'' are both correct. The same applies to other modifiers. (The word ''but'' can be used here in the sense of \"except\": ''nobody but you''.)\n*Adjective or adverb phrases combined into a longer adjective or adverb phrase: ''tired but happy'', ''over the fields and far away''.\n*Verbs or verb phrases combined as in ''he washed, peeled, and diced the turnips'' (verbs conjoined, object shared); ''he washed the turnips, peeled them, and diced them'' (full verb phrases, including objects, conjoined).\n*Other equivalent items linked, such as prefixes linked in ''pre- and post-test counselling'',<ref>British Medical Association, ''Misuse of Drugs'', Chapter 4, \"Constraints of current practice.\"</ref> numerals as in ''two or three buildings'', etc.\n*Clauses or sentences linked, as in ''We came, '''but''' they wouldn't let us in. They wouldn't let us in, '''nor''' would they explain what we had done wrong.''\n\nThere are also [[correlative conjunction]]s, where as well as the basic conjunction, an additional element appears before the first of the items being linked.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p315/> The common correlatives in English are:\n* ''either ... or'' (''either a man or a woman'');\n* ''neither ... nor'' (''neither clever nor funny'');\n* ''both ... and'' (''they both punished and rewarded them'');\n* ''not ... but'', particularly in ''not only ... but also'' (''not exhausted but exhilarated'', ''not only football but also many other sports'').\n\n[[Subordinating conjunction]]s make relations between clauses, making the clause in which they appear into a [[subordinate clause]].<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p316>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=316}}</ref> Some common subordinating conjunctions in English are:\n*conjunctions of time, including ''after'', ''before'', ''since'', ''until'', ''when'', ''while'';\n*conjunctions of cause and effect, including ''because'', ''since'', ''now that'', ''as'', ''in order that'', ''so'';\n*conjunctions of opposition or concession, such as ''although'', ''though'', ''even though'', ''whereas'', ''while'';\n*conjunctions of condition: such as ''if'', ''unless'', ''only if'', ''whether or not'', ''even if'', ''in case (that)'';\n*the conjunction ''that'', which produces [[content clause]]s, as well as words that produce interrogative content clauses: ''whether'', ''where'', ''when'', ''how'', etc.\n\nA subordinating conjunction generally comes at the very start of its clause, although many of them can be preceded by qualifying adverbs, as in ''probably because ...'', ''especially if ...''. The conjunction ''that'' can be omitted after certain verbs, as in ''she told us (that) she was ready''. (For the use of ''that'' in relative clauses, see {{slink||Relative pronouns}} above.)\n\n===Case===\nAlthough English has largely lost its case system, [[personal pronouns]] still have three morphological cases that are simplified forms of the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[objective case|objective]] and [[genitive case]]s:<ref>The Chambers Dictionary, 11th edition</ref>\n\n* The ''[[nominative case]]'' (''[[subjective pronouns]]'' such as ''I'', ''he'', ''she'', ''we'', ''they'', ''who'', ''whoever''), used for the subject of a [[finite verb]] and sometimes for the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]].\n* The ''[[oblique case]]'' (''[[object pronoun]]s'' such as ''me'', ''him'', ''her'', ''us'', ''it'', ''us'', ''them'', ''whom'', ''whomever''), used for the direct or indirect [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb, for the object of a preposition, for an absolute disjunct, and sometimes for the complement of a copula.\n* The ''[[genitive case]]'' (''[[possessive pronouns]]'' such as ''my/mine'', ''his'', ''her(s)'', ''our(s)'', ''its'', ''our(s)'', ''their'', ''theirs'', ''whose''), used for a grammatical possessor. This is not always considered to be a case; see {{slink|English possessive|Status of the possessive as a grammatical case}}.\n\nMost English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the [[possessive case]], which has both a ''[[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]'' form (such as ''my'', ''our'') and a distinct ''independent'' form (such as ''mine'', ''ours'') (with two exceptions: the [[grammatical person|third person]] singular masculine and the third person singular neuter ''it'', which use the same form for both determiner and independent [''his car'', ''it is his'']), and a distinct ''[[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]]'' or ''intensive'' form (such as ''myself'', ''ourselves''). The [[Interrogative word|interrogative]] personal pronoun ''who'' exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms (''who'', ''whom'', ''whose'') and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms (''whoever'', ''whomever'', and ''whosever'').\n\nForms such as ''I'', ''he'', and ''we'' are used for the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (\"'''I''' kicked the ball\"), whereas forms such as ''me'', ''him'' and ''us'' are used for the [[object (grammar)|object]] (\"John kicked '''me'''\").<ref>Finkenstaedt, Thomas; Dieter Wolff (1973). Ordered profusion; studies in dictionaries and the English lexicon. C. Winter.</ref>\n\n===Declension===\n{{further|Declension}}\nNouns have distinct singular and plural forms; that is, they ''decline'' to reflect their [[grammatical number]]; consider the difference between ''book'' and ''books''. In addition, a few English pronouns have distinct [[nominative case|nominative]] (also called [[nominative case#Subjective|subjective]]) and [[oblique case|oblique]] (or objective) forms; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a [[verb]] or [[preposition]], or [[grammatical case|case]]. Consider the difference between ''he'' (subjective) and ''him'' (objective), as in \"He saw it\" and \"It saw him\"; similarly, consider ''[[Who (pronoun)|who]]'', which is subjective, and the objective ''whom''.\n\nFurther, these pronouns and a few others have distinct [[grammatical possession|possessive]] forms, such as ''his'' and ''whose''. By contrast, nouns have no distinct nominative and objective forms, the two being merged into a single ''plain case''. For example, ''chair'' does not change form between \"the chair is here\" (subject) and \"I saw the chair\" (direct object). Possession is shown by the [[clitic]] ''-'s'' attached to a possessive [[noun phrase]], rather than by declension of the noun itself.<ref>[[James Clackson]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJDjNp6wODoC&pg=PA90 ''Indo-European linguistics: an introduction''], p.90</ref>\n\n==Negation==\nAs noted above under {{slink||Verbs}}, a finite indicative verb (or its clause) is [[negation (linguistics)|negated]] by placing the word ''not'' after an auxiliary, modal or other \"[[special verb|special]]\" verb such as ''do'', ''can'' or ''be''. For example, the clause ''I go'' is negated with the appearance of the auxiliary ''do'', as ''I do not go'' (see [[do-support|''do''-support]]). When the '''affirmative''' already uses auxiliary verbs (''I am going''), no other auxiliary ''verbs'' are added to negate the clause (''I am not going''). (Until the period of early Modern English, negation was effected without additional auxiliary verbs: ''I go not.'')\n\nMost combinations of auxiliary verbs etc. with ''not'' have [[contraction (grammar)|contracted forms]]: ''don't'', ''can't'', ''isn't'', etc. (Also the uncontracted negated form of ''can'' is written as a single word ''cannot''.) On inversion of subject and verb (such as in questions; see below), the subject may be placed after a contracted negated form: ''Should he not pay?'' or ''Shouldn't he pay?''\n\nOther elements, such as noun phrases, adjectives, adverbs, infinitive and participial phrases, etc., can be negated by placing the word ''not'' before them: ''not the right answer'', ''not interesting'', ''not to enter'', ''not noticing the train'', etc.\n\nWhen other negating words such as ''never'', ''nobody'', etc. appear in a sentence, the negating ''not'' is omitted (unlike its equivalents in many languages): ''I saw nothing'' or ''I didn't see anything'', but not (except in non-standard speech) *''I didn't see nothing'' (see [[Double negative]]). Such negating words generally have corresponding [[negative polarity item]]s (''ever'' for ''never'', ''anybody'' for ''nobody'', etc.) which can appear in a negative context, but are not negative themselves (and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double negatives).\n\n==Clause and sentence structure==\n{{main|English clause syntax}}\nA typical [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] contains one [[independent clause]] and possibly one or more [[dependent clause]]s, although it is also possible to link together sentences of this form into longer sentences, using coordinating conjunctions (see above). A clause typically contains a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (a noun phrase) and a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (a verb phrase in the terminology used above; that is, a verb together with its objects and complements). A dependent clause also normally contains a subordinating conjunction (or in the case of relative clauses, a relative pronoun or phrase containing one).\n\n===Word order===\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2) word order]] to being almost exclusively [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of [[auxiliary verbs]] often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as ''he had hoped to try to open it''. In most sentences English marks grammatical relations only through word order. The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The [[Object\u2013subject\u2013verb]] (OSV) may on occasion be seen in English, usually in the [[future tense]] or used as a contrast with the conjunction \"but\", such as in the following examples: \"Rome I shall see!\", \"I hate oranges, but apples I'll eat!\".<ref>{{cite book| last = Crystal| first = David| authorlink = David Crystal| title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language | edition = 2nd| year = 1997| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 0-521-55967-7}}</ref>\n\n===Questions===\nLike many other Western European languages, English historically allowed [[question]]s to be formed by [[inversion (grammar)|inverting]] the positions of verb and [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. Modern English permits this only in the case of a small class of verbs (\"[[special verb]]s\"), consisting of auxiliaries as well as forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'' (see [[subject\u2013auxiliary inversion]]). To form a question from a sentence which does not have such an auxiliary or copula present, the auxiliary verb ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') needs to be inserted, along with inversion of the word order, to form a question (see [[do-support|''do''-support]]). For example:\n* She can dance. \u2192 Can she dance? (inversion of subject ''she'' and auxiliary ''can'')\n* I am sitting here. \u2192 Am I sitting here? (inversion of subject ''I'' and copula ''am'')\n* The milk goes in the fridge. \u2192 Does the milk go in the fridge? (no special verb present; ''do''-support required)\n\nThe above concerns [[yes-no question]]s, but inversion also takes place in the same way after other questions, formed with [[interrogative word]]s such as ''where'', ''what'', ''how'', etc. An exception applies when the interrogative word is the subject or part of the subject, in which case there is no inversion. For example:\n* I go. \u2192 Where do I go? (''wh''-question formed using inversion, with ''do''-support required in this case)\n* He goes. \u2192 Who goes? (no inversion, because the question word ''who'' is the subject)\n\nNote that inversion does not apply in [[indirect question]]s: ''I wonder where he is'' (not *''... where is he''). Indirect yes-no questions can be expressed using ''if'' or ''whether'' as the interrogative word: ''Ask them whether/if they saw him.''\n\n[[Negative (grammar)|Negative]] questions are formed similarly; however if the verb undergoing inversion has a [[English contractions|contraction]] with ''not'', then it is possible to invert the subject with this contraction as a whole. For example:\n* John is going. (affirmative)\n* John is not going. / John isn't going. (negative, with and without contraction)\n* Isn't John going? / Is John not going? (negative question, with and without contraction respectively)\n\nSee also {{slink|English auxiliaries and contractions|Contractions and inversion}}.\n\n===Dependent clauses===\nThe syntax of a dependent clause is generally the same as that of an independent clause, except that the dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun (or phrase containing such). In some situations (as already described) the conjunction or relative pronoun ''that'' can be omitted. Another type of dependent clause with no subordinating conjunction is the conditional clause formed by inversion (see below).\n\n===Other uses of inversion===\nThe clause structure with inverted subject and verb, used to form questions as described above, is also used in certain types of declarative sentence. This occurs mainly when the sentence begins with an adverbial or other phrase that is essentially negative or contains words such as ''only'', ''hardly'', etc.: ''Never have I known someone so stupid; Only in France can such food be tasted''.\n\nIn elliptical sentences (see below), inversion takes place after ''so'' (meaning \"also\") as well as after the negative ''neither'': ''so do I, neither does she''.\n\nInversion can also be used to form conditional clauses, beginning with ''should'', ''were'' (subjunctive), or ''had'', in the following ways:\n*''should I win the race'' (equivalent to ''if I win the race'');\n*''were he a soldier'' (equivalent to ''if he were a soldier'');\n*''were he to win the race'' (equivalent to ''if he were to win the race'', i.e. ''if he won the race'');\n*''had he won the race'' (equivalent to ''if he had won the race'').\nOther similar forms sometimes appear, but are less common. There is also a construction with subjunctive ''be'', as in ''be he alive or dead'' (meaning \"no matter whether he is alive or dead\").\n\nUse of inversion to express a third-person imperative is now mostly confined to the expression ''long live X'', meaning \"let X live long\".\n\n===Imperatives===\nIn an [[imperative mood|imperative]] sentence (one giving an order), there is usually no subject in the independent clause: ''Go away until I call you.'' It is possible, however, to include ''you'' as the subject for emphasis: ''You stay away from me.''\n\n===Elliptical constructions===\nMany types of elliptical construction are possible in English, resulting in sentences that omit certain redundant elements. Various examples are given in the article on [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]].\n\nSome notable elliptical forms found in English include:\n*Short statements of the form ''I can'', ''he isn't'', ''we mustn't''. Here the verb phrase (understood from the context) is reduced to a single auxiliary or other \"special\" verb, negated if appropriate. If there is no special verb in the original verb phrase, it is replaced by ''do/does/did'': ''he does'', ''they didn't''.\n*Clauses that omit the verb, in particular those like ''me too'', ''nor me'', ''me neither''. The latter forms are used after negative statements. (Equivalents including the verb: ''I do too'' or ''so do I''; ''I don't either'' or ''neither do I''.)\n*[[Tag question]]s, formed with a special verb and pronoun subject: ''isn't it?''; ''were there?''; ''am I not?''\n\n==History of English grammars==\n{{main|History of English grammars}}\nThe first published English grammar was a ''Pamphlet for Grammar'' of 1586, written by [[William Bullokar]] with the stated goal of demonstrating that English was just as rule-based as Latin. Bullokar's grammar was faithfully modeled on [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily's]] Latin grammar, ''Rudimenta Grammatices'' (1534), used in English schools at that time, having been \"prescribed\" for them in 1542 by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Bullokar wrote his grammar in English and used a \"reformed spelling system\" of his own invention; but many English grammars, for much of the century after Bullokar's effort, were written in Latin, especially by authors who were aiming to be scholarly. [[John Wallis]]'s ''Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae'' (1685) was the last English grammar written in Latin.\n\nEven as late as the early 19th century, [[Lindley Murray]], the author of one of the most widely used grammars of the day, was having to cite \"grammatical authorities\" to bolster the claim that grammatical cases in English are different from those in Ancient Greek or Latin.\n\nEnglish [[Part of speech|parts of speech]] are based on Latin and Greek parts of speech.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=snippet&q=dryden&f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=27\u201328|language=en}}</ref> Some English grammar rules were adopted from [[Latin]], for example [[John Dryden]] is thought to have created the rule [[Preposition stranding|no sentences can end in a preposition]] because Latin cannot end sentences in prepositions. The rule of no [[split infinitive]]s was adopted from Latin because Latin has no split infinitives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=524618639|title=From 'F-Bomb' To 'Photobomb,' How The Dictionary Keeps Up With English|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=onepage&q=latin&f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=47|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=snippet&q=split&f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=44|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n* [[Disputes in English grammar]]\n* [[English prefixes]]\n* [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Grammar books===\n*{{cite book|author=Aarts, Bas|year=2011|title=Oxford Modern English Grammar|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordmodernengl00aart/page/410 410]|isbn=978-0-19-953319-0|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordmodernengl00aart/page/410}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Biber, Douglas |author2=Johansson, Stig |author3=Leech, Geoffrey |author4=Conrad, Susan |author5=Finegan, Edward |year=1999|title=Longman grammar of spoken and written English|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|page=1203|isbn=0-582-23725-4}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Biber, Douglas |author2=Leech, Geoffrey |author3=Conrad, Susan |year=2002|title=Longman student grammar of spoken and written English|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|page=487|isbn=0-582-23726-2}}\n* {{cite book|author=Bryant, Margaret|title=A functional English grammar|year=1945|publisher=D.C.

This includes the structure of [[words]], [[phrases]], [[clauses]], and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], right up to the structure of whole texts.\n\nThere are historical, social, cultural and regional variations of English. Divergences from the [[grammar]] described here occur in some [[List of dialects of the English language|dialects]]. This article describes a generalized present-day [[Standard English]] \u2013 a form of speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and news, over a range of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] from formal to informal. There are differences in grammar between the [[standard variety|standard forms]] of [[British English|British]], [[American English|American]], and [[Australian English]], although these are more minor than differences in [[lexicon|vocabulary]] and [[English phonology|pronunciation]].\n\n[[Modern English]] has largely abandoned the [[inflectional]] [[grammatical case|case system]] of Indo-European in favor of [[analytic language|analytic]] constructions. The [[personal pronoun]]s retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant of the more extensive Germanic case system of Old English). For other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by [[word order]], by [[preposition]]s, and by the \"[[Saxon genitive]] or [[English possessive]]\" (''-'s'').<ref name=\"Huddleston phrasal genitive\">{{Cite book|quote=We conclude that both head and phrasal genitives involve case inflection. With head genitives it is always a noun that inflects, while the phrasal genitive can apply to words of most classes. |pages=479\u2013481|chapter= Nouns and noun phrases |last1=Payne|first1= John |last2=Huddleston |first2= Rodney |author-link2=Rodney Huddleston |editor1-last=Huddleston |editor1-first=Rodney |editor1-link=Rodney Huddleston |editor2-last= Pullum |editor2-first= Geoffrey |editor2-link=Geoffrey Pullum |title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}</ref>\n\nEight [[Part of speech|\"word classes\" or \"parts of speech\"]] are commonly distinguished in English: [[noun]]s, [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[preposition]]s, and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s. Nouns form the largest word class, and verbs the second-largest. Unlike many Indo-European languages, English nouns do not have [[grammatical gender]].\n\n==Word classes and phrases==\nNouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs form [[Open class (linguistics)|open class]]es \u2013 word classes that readily accept new members, such as the noun ''[[celebutante]]'' (a celebrity who frequents the fashion circles), and other similar relatively new words.<ref name=\"carter-mccarthy-p296\"/> The others are considered to be [[closed class]]es. For example, it is rare for a new pronoun to enter the language. Determiners, traditionally classified along with adjectives, have not always been regarded as a separate part of speech. [[Interjections]] are another word class, but these are not described here as they do not form part of the [[clause]] and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] structure of the language.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p296>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=296}}</ref>\n\nLinguists generally accept nine English word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, and exclamations. English words are not generally marked for word class. It is not usually possible to tell from the form of a word which class it belongs to except, to some extent, in the case of words with inflectional endings or derivational suffixes. On the other hand, most words belong to more than one word class. For example, ''run'' can serve as either a verb or a noun (these are regarded as two different [[lexeme]]s).<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=297}}</ref> Lexemes may be [[inflected]] to express different grammatical categories. The lexeme ''run'' has the forms ''runs'', ''ran'', ''runny'', ''runner'', and ''running''.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/>  Words in one class can sometimes be [[Morphological derivation|derived]] from those in another. This has the potential to give rise to new words. The noun ''aerobics'' has recently given rise to the adjective ''aerobicized''.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/>\n\nWords combine to form [[phrase]]s. A phrase typically serves the same function as a word from some particular word class.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/> For example, ''my very good friend Peter'' is a phrase that can be used in a sentence as if it were a noun, and is therefore called a [[noun phrase]]. Similarly, [[adjectival phrase]]s and [[adverbial phrase]]s function as if they were adjectives or adverbs, but with other types of phrases the terminology has different implications. For example, a [[verb phrase]] consists of a verb together with any objects and other dependents; a [[adpositional phrase|prepositional phrase]] consists of a preposition and its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] (and is therefore usually a type of adverbial phrase); and a [[determiner phrase]] is a type of noun phrase containing a determiner.\n\n===Nouns===\nMany common [[suffix]]es form nouns from other nouns or from other types of words, such as ''-age'' (as in ''shrinkage''), ''-hood'' (as in ''sisterhood''), and so on,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p297/> although many nouns are base forms not containing any such suffix (such as ''cat'', ''grass'', ''France'').  Nouns are also often created by [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] of verbs or adjectives, as with the words ''talk'' and ''reading'' (''a boring talk'', ''the assigned reading'').\n\nNouns are sometimes classified semantically (by their meanings) as [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper nouns and common nouns]] (''Cyrus'', ''China'' vs. ''frog'', ''milk'') or as [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|concrete nouns and abstract nouns]] (''book'', ''laptop'' vs. ''heat'', ''prejudice'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p298/> A grammatical distinction is often made between [[count noun|count (countable) nouns]] such as ''clock'' and ''city'', and [[mass noun|non-count (uncountable) nouns]] such as ''milk'' and ''decor''.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=299}}</ref> Some nouns can function both as countable and as uncountable such as the word \"wine\" (''This is a good wine'', ''I prefer red wine'').\n\nCountable nouns generally have [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]] forms.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p298>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=298}}</ref> In most cases the plural is formed from the singular by adding ''-[e]s'' (as in ''dogs'', ''bushes''), although there are also [[irregular plural|irregular]] forms (''woman/women'', ''foot/feet'', etc.), including cases where the two forms are identical (''sheep'', ''series''). For more details, see [[English plural]]. Certain nouns can be used with plural verbs even though they are singular in form, as in ''The government were ...'' (where ''the government'' is considered to refer to the people constituting the government). This is a form of [[synesis]]; it is more common in British than American English. See {{slink|English plural|Singulars with collective meaning treated as plural}}.\n\nEnglish nouns are not marked for [[case (grammar)|case]] as they are in some languages, but they have [[possessive (linguistics)|possessive]] forms, through the addition of ''-'s'' (as in ''John's'', ''children's'') or just an [[apostrophe]] (with no change in pronunciation) in the case of ''-[e]s'' plurals and sometimes other words ending with ''-s'' (''the dogs' owners'', ''Jesus' love''). More generally, the ending can be applied to noun phrases (as in ''the man you saw yesterday's sister''); see below. The possessive form can be used either as a determiner (''John's cat'') or as a noun phrase (''John's is the one next to Jane's'').\n\nThe [[English possessive|status of the possessive]] as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate.<ref name=\"Hudson 2013\">{{Cite book |isbn=9789027273000|date=2013|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |title= Morphosyntactic Categories and the Expression of Possession |editor1-last=B\u00f6rjars |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Denison |editor2-first=David |editor1-link= David Denison |editor3-last=Scott |editor3-first=Alan |chapter= A cognitive analysis of John's hat |last1=Hudson|first1= Richard |author-link1=Richard Hudson (linguist) |pages=123\u2013148}}</ref><ref name=\" B\u00f6rjars 2013\">{{Cite book |isbn=9789027273000|date=2013|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |title= Morphosyntactic Categories and the Expression of Possession |editor1-last=B\u00f6rjars |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Denison |editor2-first=David | author-link1= David Denison |editor3-last=Scott |editor3-first=Alan |chapter= Expression of Possession in English |last1 =B\u00f6rjars | first1=Kersti |last2 =Denison | first2=David |editor1-link= David Denison |last3 =Krajewski | first3=Grzegorz |last4 =Scott | first4=Alan |pages=149\u2013176}}</ref> It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that the [[genitive]] ending may attach to the last word of the phrase.

Most noun phrases have a noun as their [[head (linguistics)|head]].<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299/>\n\nAn English noun phrase typically takes the following form (not all elements need be present):\n:{| cellspacing=\"5\"\n|- style=\"font-variant: small-caps; font-size: larger;\"\n! Determiner || + || Pre-modifiers || + || NOUN || + || Postmodifiers/Complement\n|}\n\nIn this structure:\n*the ''determiner'' may be an article (''the'', ''a[n]'') or other equivalent word, as described in the following section. In many contexts it is required for a noun phrase to include some determiner.\n*''[[pre-modifier]]s'' include adjectives and some adjective phrases (such as ''red'', ''really lovely''), and [[noun adjunct]]s (such as ''college'' in the phrase ''the college student''). Adjectival modifiers usually come before noun adjuncts.\n*a ''[[complement (linguistics)|complement]]'' or ''[[postmodifier]]''<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p299/> may be a prepositional phrase (''... of London''), a [[relative clause]] (like '' ...which we saw yesterday''), certain adjective or [[participial]] phrases (''... sitting on the beach''), or a [[dependent clause]] or [[infinitive phrase]] appropriate to the noun (like ''... that the world is round'' after a noun such as ''fact'' or ''statement'', or ''... to travel widely'' after a noun such as ''desire'').\n\nAn example of a noun phrase that includes all of the above-mentioned elements is ''that rather attractive young college student to whom you were talking''. Here ''that'' is the determiner, ''rather attractive'' and ''young'' are adjectival pre-modifiers, ''college'' is a noun adjunct, ''student'' is the noun serving as the head of the phrase, and ''to whom you were talking'' is a post-modifier (a relative clause in this case). Notice the order of the pre-modifiers; the determiner ''that'' must come first and the noun adjunct ''college'' must come after the adjectival modifiers.\n\nCoordinating conjunctions such as ''and'', ''or'', and ''but'' can be used at various levels in noun phrases, as in ''John, Paul, and Mary''; ''the matching green coat and hat''; ''a dangerous but exciting ride''; ''a person sitting down or standing up''. See {{slink||Conjunctions}} below for more explanation.\n\nNoun phrases can also be placed in ''[[apposition]]'' (where two consecutive phrases refer to the same thing), as in ''that president, Abraham Lincoln, ...'' (where ''that president'' and ''Abraham Lincoln'' are in apposition). In some contexts the same can be expressed by a prepositional phrase, as in ''the twin curses of famine and pestilence'' (meaning \"the twin curses\" that are \"famine and pestilence\").\n\nParticular forms of noun phrases include:\n* phrases formed by the determiner ''the'' with an adjective, as in ''the homeless'', ''the English'' (these are [[plural]] phrases referring to homeless people or English people in general);\n* phrases with a pronoun rather than a noun as the head (see below);\n* phrases consisting just of a [[English possessive|possessive]];\n* [[infinitive]] and [[gerund]] phrases, in certain positions;\n* certain clauses, such as ''that'' clauses and [[relative clause]]s like ''what he said'', in certain positions.\n\n====Gender====\n{{Main|Gender in English}}\nA system of grammatical gender, whereby every [[noun]] was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, existed in [[Old English]], but fell out of use during the [[Middle English]] period. [[Modern English]] retains features relating to [[natural gender]], namely the use of certain nouns and [[pronoun]]s (such as ''he'' and ''she'') to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders  and certain others (such as ''it'') for sexless objects \u2013 although feminine pronouns are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes and analogous machinery) and nation states.\n\nSome aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement towards a preference for [[gender-neutral language]]. Animals are triple-gender nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns.<ref name=Siemund>{{cite book|last=Siemund|first=Peter|title=Pronominal Gender in English: A Study of English Varieties form a Cross-Linguistic Perspective|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref> Generally there is no difference between male and female in English nouns. However, gender is occasionally exposed by different shapes or dissimilar words when referring to people or animals.<ref name=\"NOUN GENDER\">[http://www.edufind.com/english-grammar/noun-gender/ NOUN GENDER] ''edufind.com''</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  Masculine !! Feminine !! Gender neutral\n|-\n|  ''man'' || ''woman'' || ''adult''\n|-\n|  ''boy'' || ''girl'' || ''child''\n|-\n|  ''husband'' || ''wife'' || ''spouse''\n|-\n|  ''actor'' || ''actress'' || ''performer''\n|-\n|  ''rooster'' || ''hen'' || ''chicken''\n|}\n\nMany nouns that mention people's roles and jobs can refer to either a masculine or a feminine subject, for instance \"cousin\", \"teenager\", \"teacher\", \"doctor\", \"student\", \"friend\", and \"colleague\".<ref name=\"NOUN GENDER\"/>\n\n*Jane is my friend. She is a dentist.\n*Paul is my cousin. He is a dentist.\n\nOften the gender distinction for these neutral nouns is established by inserting the words \"male\" or \"female\".<ref name=\"NOUN GENDER\"/>\n\n*Sam is a female doctor.\n*No, he is not my boyfriend; he is just a male friend.\n*I have three female cousins and two male cousins.\n\nRarely, nouns illustrating things with no gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to convey familiarity. It is also standard to use the gender-neutral pronoun (it).<ref name=\"NOUN GENDER\"/>\n\n*I love my car. She (the car) is my greatest passion.\n*France is popular with her (France's) neighbors at the moment.\n*I travelled from England to New York on the ''Queen Elizabeth''; she (the Queen Elizabeth) is a great ship.\n\n===Determiners===\n{{main|English determiners|English articles}}\nEnglish [[determiner (grammar)|determiner]]s constitute a relatively small class of words. They include the [[English articles|articles]] ''the'' and ''a[n]''; certain [[demonstrative adjective|demonstrative]] and [[interrogative]] words such as ''this'', ''that'', and ''which''; [[possessive adjective|possessives]] such as ''my'' and ''whose'' (the role of determiner can also be played by [[English possessive|noun possessive]] forms such as ''John's'' and ''the girl's''); various [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifying words]] like ''all'', ''some'', ''many'', ''various''; and [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s (''one'', ''two'', etc.). There are also many phrases (such as ''a couple of'') that can play the role of determiners.\n\nDeterminers are used in the formation of noun phrases (see above). Many words that serve as determiners can also be used as pronouns (''this'', ''that'', ''many'', etc.).\n\nDeterminers can be used in certain combinations, such as '''''all the''' water'' and '''''the many''' problems''.\n\nIn many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to be completed with an article or some other determiner. It is not grammatical to say just ''cat sat on table''; one must say ''my cat sat on the table''. The most common situations in which a complete noun phrase can be formed without a determiner are when it refers generally to a whole class or concept (as in ''dogs are dangerous'' and ''beauty is subjective'') and when it is a name (''Jane'', ''Spain'', etc.). This is discussed in more detail at [[English articles]] and [[Zero article in English]].\n\n===Pronouns===\n[[Pronoun]]s are a relatively small, closed class of words that function in the place of nouns or noun phrases. They include [[personal pronoun]]s, [[demonstrative pronoun]]s, [[relative pronoun]]s, [[interrogative pronouns]], and some others, mainly [[indefinite pronoun]]s.\n\n====Personal====\n{{main|English personal pronouns}}\nThe personal pronouns of modern standard English, and the corresponding [[possessive]] forms, are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!   !! [[Nominative case|Nominative]] !! [[Objective case|Oblique]] !! [[Reflexive pronoun|Reflexive]] !! [[Possessive determiner]] !! [[Possessive pronoun]]\n|-\n| 1st pers. sing. || ''I'' || ''me'' || ''myself'' || ''my'' || ''mine''\n|-\n| 2nd pers. sing./pl. || ''you'' || ''you'' || ''yourself/yourselves'' || ''your'' || ''yours''\n|-\n| 3rd pers. sing.|| ''she'', ''he'', ''they'', ''it'' || ''her'', ''him'', ''them'', ''it''  || ''herself'', ''himself'', ''themself'', ''itself''  || ''her'', ''his'', ''their'', ''its'' || ''hers'', ''his'', ''theirs'', ''its''\n|-\n| 1st pers. pl. || ''we'' || ''us'' || ''ourselves'' || ''our'' || ''ours''\n|-\n| 3rd pers. pl. || ''they'' || ''them'' || ''themselves'' || ''their'' || ''theirs''\n|}\n\nThe second-person forms such as ''you'' are used with both singular and plural reference. In the Southern United States, [[y'all]] (you all) is used as a plural form, and various other phrases such as ''you guys'' are used in other places. An archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference is ''[[thou]], thee, thyself, thy, thine, ''which are still used in religious services and can be seen in older works, such as Shakespeare's\u2014in such texts, the  ''you'' set of pronouns are used for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal [[T\u2013V distinction|V-form]]. ''You'' can also be used as an [[indefinite pronoun]], referring to a person in general (see [[generic you|generic ''you'']]), compared to the more formal alternative, ''[[one (pronoun)|one]]'' (reflexive ''oneself'', possessive ''one's'').\n\nThe third-person singular forms are differentiated according to the sex of the referent. For example, ''she'' is used to refer to a female person, sometimes a female animal, and sometimes an object to which female characteristics are attributed, such as a ship or a country. A male person, and sometimes a male animal, is referred to using ''he''. In other cases ''it'' can be used. (See [[Gender in English]].) The word ''it'' can also be used as a [[dummy subject]], in sentences like ''It is going to be sunny this afternoon''.\n\nThe third-person plural forms such as ''they'' are sometimes used with singular reference, as a [[gender-neutral pronoun]], as in ''each employee should ensure they tidy their desk''. Despite its long history, this usage is sometimes considered ungrammatical. (See [[Singular they|singular ''they'']].)\n\nThe possessive determiners such as ''my'' are used as determiners together with nouns, as in ''my old man'', ''some of his friends''. The second possessive forms like ''mine'' are used when they do not qualify a noun: as pronouns, as in ''mine is bigger than yours'', and as predicates, as in ''this one is mine''. Note also the construction ''a friend of mine'' (meaning \"someone who is my friend\"). See [[English possessive]] for more details.\n\n====Demonstrative and interrogative====\n\nThe [[demonstrative pronoun]]s of English are ''this'' (plural ''these''), and ''that'' (plural ''those''), as in ''these are good, I like that''. Note that all four words can also be used as determiners (followed by a noun), as in ''those cars''. They can also form the alternative pronominal expressions ''this/that one'', ''these/those ones''.\n\nThe [[interrogative pronoun]]s are ''who'', ''what'', and ''which'' (all of them can take the suffix ''[[-ever]]'' for emphasis). The pronoun ''who'' refers to a person or people; it has an oblique form ''[[whom]]'' (though in informal contexts this is usually replaced by ''who''), and a possessive form (pronoun or determiner) ''whose''. The pronoun ''what'' refers to things or abstracts. The word ''which'' is used to ask about alternatives from what is seen as a closed set: ''which (of the books) do you like best?'' (It can also be an interrogative determiner: ''which book?''; this can form the alternative pronominal expressions ''which one'' and ''which ones''.) ''Which'', ''who'', and ''what'' can be either singular or plural, although ''who'' and ''what'' often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number. For more information see [[Who (pronoun)|''who'']].\n\nAll the interrogative pronouns can also be used as relative pronouns; see below for more details.\n\n====Relative====\n{{main|English relative clauses}}\n{{for|\"who/whom\" and related forms|Who (pronoun)}}\nThe main [[relative pronoun]]s in English are ''[[who (pronoun)|who]]'' (with its derived forms ''whom'' and ''whose''), ''which'', and ''that''.<ref>Some linguists consider ''that'' in such sentences to be a [[complementizer]] rather than a relative pronoun. See [[English relative clauses#Status of that|English relative clauses: Status of ''that'']].</ref>\n\nThe relative pronoun ''which'' refers to things rather than persons, as in ''the shirt, which used to be red, is faded''. For persons, ''who'' is used (''the man who saw me was tall''). The [[oblique case]] form of ''who'' is ''whom'', as in ''the man whom I saw was tall'', although in informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] ''who'' is commonly used in place of ''whom''.\n\nThe possessive form of ''who'' is ''whose'' (''the man whose car is missing ...''); however the use of ''whose'' is not restricted to persons (one can say ''an idea whose time has come'').\n\nThe word ''that'' as a relative pronoun is normally found only in [[restrictive relative clause]]s (unlike ''which'' and ''who'', which can be used in both restrictive and unrestrictive clauses). It can refer to either persons or things, and cannot follow a preposition. For example, one can say ''the song that'' [or ''which''] ''I listened to yesterday'', but ''the song to which'' [not ''to that''] ''I listened yesterday''. The relative pronoun ''that'' is usually pronounced with a reduced vowel ([[schwa]]), and hence differently from the demonstrative ''that'' (see [[Weak and strong forms in English]]). If ''that'' is not the subject of the relative clause, it can be omitted (''the song I listened to yesterday'').\n\nThe word ''what'' can be used to form a [[free relative clause]] \u2013 one that has no antecedent and that serves as a complete noun phrase in itself, as in ''I like what he likes''. The words ''whatever'' and ''whichever'' can be used similarly, in the role of either pronouns (''whatever he likes'') or determiners (''whatever book he likes''). When referring to persons, ''who(ever)'' (and ''whom(ever)'') can be used in a similar way (but not as determiners).\n\n===={{Anchor|There as pronoun}}\"There\"====\nThe word ''there'' is used as a pronoun in some sentences, playing the role of a [[dummy subject]], normally of an [[intransitive verb]]. The \"logical subject\" of the verb then appears as a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] after the verb.\n\nThis use of ''there'' occurs most commonly with forms of the verb ''be'' in [[existential clause]]s, to refer to the presence or existence of something. For example: ''There is a heaven''; ''There are two cups on the table''; ''There have been a lot of problems lately''. It can also be used with other verbs: ''There exist two major variants''; ''There occurred a very strange incident''.\n\nThe dummy subject takes the [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural) of the logical subject (complement), hence it takes a plural verb if the complement is plural. In informal English, however, the [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] ''there's'' is often used for both singular and plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fowler|2015|p=813}}</ref>\n\nThe dummy subject can undergo [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]], ''Is there a test today?'' and ''Never has there been a man such as this.'' It can also appear without a corresponding logical subject, in short sentences and [[question tag]]s: ''There wasn't a discussion, was there? There was.''\n\nThe word ''there'' in such sentences has sometimes been analyzed as an [[adverb]], or as a dummy [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], rather than as a pronoun.<ref>For a treatment of ''there'' as a dummy predicate, based on the analysis of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], see [[Andrea Moro|Moro, A.]], ''The Raising of Predicates. Predicative Noun Phrases and the Theory of Clause Structure'', ''Cambridge Studies in Linguistics'', 80, Cambridge University Press, 1997.</ref> However, its identification as a pronoun is most consistent with its behavior in inverted sentences and question tags as described above.\n\nBecause the word ''there'' can also be a [[Deixis|deictic]] adverb (meaning \"at/to that place\"), a sentence like ''There is a river'' could have either of two meanings: \"a river exists\" (with ''there'' as a pronoun), and \"a river is in that place\" (with ''there'' as an adverb). In speech, the adverbial ''there'' would be given [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the pronoun would not \u2013 in fact the pronoun is often pronounced as a [[weak and strong forms in English|weak form]], {{IPA|/\u00f0\u0259(r)/}}.\n\n====Other====\nOther pronouns in English are often identical in form to [[English determiners|determiners]] (especially [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]]), such as ''many'', ''a little'', etc. Sometimes, the pronoun form is different, as with ''none'' (corresponding to the determiner ''no''), ''nothing'', ''everyone'', ''somebody'', etc. Many examples are listed as [[indefinite pronoun]]s. Another indefinite (or impersonal) pronoun is ''[[one (pronoun)|one]]'' (with its reflexive form ''oneself'' and possessive ''one's''), which is a more formal alternative to [[generic you|generic ''you'']].<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/one|title=''One'' Definition|dictionary=[[dictionary.com]]|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Verbs===\n{{Main|English verbs}}\n\nThe basic form of an English verb is not generally marked by any ending, although there are certain suffixes that are frequently used to form verbs, such as ''-ate'' (''formulate''), ''-fy'' (''electrify''), and ''-ise/ize'' (''realise/realize'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p301>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=301}}</ref> Many verbs also contain [[prefix]]es, such ''un-'' (''unmask''), ''out-'' (''outlast''), ''over-'' (''overtake''), and ''under-'' (''undervalue'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p301/> Verbs can also be formed from nouns and adjectives by [[Conversion (word formation)|zero derivation]], as with the verbs ''snare'', ''nose'', ''dry'', and ''calm''.\n\nMost verbs have three or four inflected forms in addition to the base form: a third-person singular present tense form in ''-(e)s'' (''writes'', ''botches''), a [[present participle]] and [[gerund]] form in ''-ing'' (''writing''), a past tense (''wrote''), and \u2013 though often identical to the past tense form \u2013 a [[past participle]] (''written''). Regular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms in ''-ed'', but there are 100 or so [[English irregular verbs|irregular English verbs]] with different forms (see [[List of English irregular verbs|list]]). The verbs ''have'', ''do'' and ''say'' also have irregular third-person present tense forms (''has'', ''does'' {{IPA|/d\u028cz/}}, ''says'' {{IPA|/s\u025bz/}}). The verb ''be'' has the largest number of irregular forms (''am, is, are'' in the present tense, ''was, were'' in the past tense, ''been'' for the past participle).\n\nMost of what are often referred to as verb [[grammatical tense|tenses]] (or sometimes [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s) in English are formed using [[auxiliary verb]]s. Apart from what are called the [[simple present (English)|simple present]] (''write'', ''writes'') and [[simple past (English)|simple past]] (''wrote''), there are also [[continuous aspect|continuous]] (progressive) forms (''am/is/are/was/were writing''), [[perfect aspect|perfect]] forms (''have/has/had written'', and the perfect continuous ''have/has/had been writing''), [[future tense|future]] forms (''will write'', ''will be writing'', ''will have written'', ''will have been writing''), and [[conditional tense|conditionals]] (also called \"future in the past\") with ''would'' in place of ''will''. The auxiliaries [[shall and will|''shall'' and ''should'']] sometimes replace ''will'' and ''would'' in the first person. For the uses of these various verb forms, see [[English verbs]] and [[English clause syntax]].\n\nThe basic form of the verb (''be, write, play'') is used as the [[infinitive]], although there is also a \"to-infinitive\" (''to be'', ''to write'', ''to play'') used in many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: ''(to) have written'', ''(to) be writing'', ''(to) have been writing''. The second-person [[imperative mood|imperative]] is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with ''let'' (''let us go'', or ''let's go''; ''let them eat cake'').\n\nA form identical to the infinitive can be used as a present [[subjunctive]] in certain contexts: ''It is important that he '''follow''' them'' or ''... that he '''be''' committed to the cause''. There is also a past subjunctive (distinct from the simple past only in the possible use of ''were'' instead of ''was''), used in some conditional sentences and similar: ''if I were'' (or ''was'') ''rich ...''; ''were he to arrive now ...''; ''I wish she were'' (or ''was'') ''here''. For details see [[English subjunctive]].\n\nThe [[passive voice]] is formed using the verb ''be'' (in the appropriate tense or form) with the past participle of the verb in question: ''cars are driven, he was killed, I am being tickled, it is nice to be pampered'', etc. The performer of the action may be introduced in a prepositional phrase with ''by'' (as in ''they were killed by the invaders'').\n\nThe [[English modal verbs]] consist of the core modals ''can'', ''could'', ''may'', ''might'', ''must'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''would'', as well as ''ought (to''), ''had better'', and in some uses ''dare'' and ''need''.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p303>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=303}}</ref> These do not inflect for person or number,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p303/> and do not have infinitive or participle forms (except synonyms, as with ''be/being/been able (to'') for the modals ''can/could''). The modals are used with the basic infinitive form of a verb (''I can swim, he may be killed'', ''we dare not move'', ''need they go?''), except for ''ought'', which takes ''to'' (''you ought to go'').\n\nThe [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'', along with the modal verbs and the other [[English auxiliary verbs|auxiliaries]], form a distinct class, sometimes called \"[[special verbs]]\" or simply \"auxiliaries\".<ref>C.D. Sidhu, ''An Intensive Course in English'', Orient Blackswan, 1976, p. 5.</ref> These have different syntax from ordinary [[lexical verb]]s, especially in that they make their [[interrogative]] forms by plain [[subject\u2013auxiliary inversion|inversion]] with the subject, and their [[negation|negative]] forms by adding ''not'' after the verb (''could I ...? I could not ...''). Apart from those already mentioned, this class may also include ''used to'' (although the forms ''did he use to?'' and ''he didn't use to'' are also found), and sometimes ''have'' even when not an auxiliary (forms like ''have you a sister?'' and ''he hadn't a clue'' are possible, though becoming less common). It also includes the auxiliary ''do'' (''does'', ''did''); this is used with the basic infinitive of other verbs (those not belonging to the \"special verbs\" class) to make their question and negation forms, as well as emphatic forms (''do I like you?''; ''he doesn't speak English''; ''we did close the fridge''). For more details of this, see [[do-support|''do''-support]].\n\nSome forms of the copula and auxiliaries often appear as [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s, as in ''I'm'' for ''I am'', ''you'd'' for ''you would'' or ''you had'', and ''John's'' for ''John is''. Their negated forms with following ''not'' are also often contracted (see {{slink||Negation}} below). For detail see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]].\n\n====Phrases====\nA verb together with its dependents, excluding its [[subject (grammar)|subject]], may be identified as a [[verb phrase]] (although this concept is not acknowledged in all theories of grammar<ref>[[Dependency grammar]]s reject the concept of finite verb phrases as clause constituents, regarding the subject as a dependent of the verb as well. See the [[verb phrase]] article for more information.</ref>). A verb phrase headed by a [[finite verb]] may also be called a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The dependents may be [[object (grammar)|object]]s, complements, and modifiers (adverbs or [[adverbial phrase]]s). In English, objects and complements nearly always come after the verb; a [[direct object]] precedes other complements such as prepositional phrases, but if there is an [[indirect object]] as well, expressed without a preposition, then that precedes the direct object: ''give me the book'', but ''give the book to me''. Adverbial modifiers generally follow objects, although other positions are possible (see under {{slink||Adverbs}} below). Certain verb\u2013modifier combinations, particularly when they have independent meaning (such as ''take on'' and ''get up''), are known as \"[[phrasal verb]]s\".\n\nFor details of possible patterns, see [[English clause syntax]]. See the [[English clause syntax#Non-finite clauses|Non-finite clauses]] section of that article for verb phrases headed by non-finite verb forms, such as infinitives and participles.\n\n===Adjectives===\nEnglish [[adjective]]s, as with other word classes, cannot in general be identified as such by their form,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p308>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=308}}</ref> although many of them are formed from nouns or other words by the addition of a suffix, such as ''-al'' (''habitual''), ''-ful'' (''blissful''), ''-ic'' (''atomic''), ''-ish'' (''impish'', ''youngish''), ''-ous'' (''hazardous''), etc.; or from other adjectives using a prefix: ''disloyal'', ''irredeemable'', ''unforeseen'', ''overtired''.\n\nAdjectives may be used [[attributive adjective|attributively]], as part of a noun phrase (nearly always preceding the noun they modify; for exceptions see [[postpositive adjective]]), as in ''the big house'', or [[predicate adjective|predicatively]], as in ''the house is big''. Certain adjectives are restricted to one or other use; for example, ''drunken'' is attributive (''a drunken sailor''), while ''drunk'' is usually predicative (''the sailor was drunk'').\n\n====Comparison====\nMany adjectives have [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] forms in ''-er'' and ''-est'',<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p309>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=309}}</ref> such as ''faster'' and ''fastest'' (from the positive form ''fast''). Spelling rules which maintain pronunciation apply to suffixing adjectives just as they do for similar treatment of [[English verbs#Past tense|regular past tense formation]]; these cover consonant doubling (as in ''bigger'' and ''biggest'', from ''big'') and the change of ''y'' to ''i'' after consonants (as in ''happier'' and ''happiest'', from ''happy'').\n\nThe adjectives ''good'' and ''bad'' have the irregular forms ''better, best'' and ''worse, worst''; also ''far'' becomes ''farther, farthest'' or ''further, furthest''. The adjective ''old'' (for which the regular ''older'' and ''oldest'' are usual) also has the irregular forms ''elder'' and ''eldest'', these generally being restricted to use in comparing [[sibling]]s and in certain independent uses. For the comparison of adverbs, see [[#Adverbs|Adverbs]] below.\n\nMany adjectives, however, particularly those that are longer and less common, do not have inflected comparative and superlative forms. Instead, they can be qualified with ''more'' and ''most'', as in ''beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful'' (this construction is also sometimes used even for adjectives for which inflected forms do exist).\n\nCertain adjectives are classed as [[ungradable adjective|ungradable]].<ref name=\"carter-mccarthy-p309\"/> These represent properties that cannot be compared on a scale; they simply apply or do not, as with ''pregnant'', ''dead'', ''unique''. Consequently, comparative and superlative forms of such adjectives are not normally used, except in a figurative, humorous or imprecise context. Similarly, such adjectives are not normally qualified with modifiers of degree such as ''very'' and ''fairly'', although with some of them it is idiomatic to use adverbs such as ''completely''. Another type of adjectives sometimes considered ungradable is those that represent an extreme degree of some property, such as ''delicious'' and ''terrified''.\n\n====Phrases====\nAn [[adjective phrase]] is a group of words that plays the role of an adjective in a sentence. It usually has a single adjective as its [[head (linguistics)|head]], to which [[modifier (linguistics)|modifier]]s and [[complement (linguistics)|complement]]s may be added.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p310>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=310}}</ref>\n\nAdjectives can be modified by a preceding adverb or adverb phrase, as in ''very warm'', ''truly imposing'', ''more than a little excited''. Some can also be preceded by a noun or quantitative phrase, as in ''fat-free'', ''two-metre-long''.\n\nComplements following the adjective may include:\n* [[prepositional phrase]]s: ''proud of him'', ''angry at the screen'', ''keen on breeding toads'';\n* [[infinitive]] phrases: ''anxious to solve the problem'', ''easy to pick up'';\n* [[content clause]]s, i.e. ''that'' clauses and certain others: ''certain that he was right'', ''unsure where they are'';\n* after comparatives, phrases or clauses with ''than'': ''better than you'', ''smaller than I had imagined''.\n\nAn adjective phrase may include both modifiers before the adjective and a complement after it, as in ''very difficult to put away''.\n\nAdjective phrases containing complements after the adjective cannot normally be used as attributive adjectives ''before'' a noun. Sometimes they are used [[postpositive adjective|attributively after the noun]], as in ''a woman proud of being a midwife'' (where they may be converted into relative clauses: ''a woman who is proud of being a midwife''), but it is wrong to say *''a proud of being a midwife woman''. Exceptions include very brief and often established phrases such as ''easy-to-use''. (Certain complements can be moved to after the noun, leaving the adjective before the noun, as in ''a better man than you'', ''a hard nut to crack''.)\n\nCertain attributive adjective phrases are formed from other parts of speech, without any adjective as their head, as in ''a two-bedroom house'', ''a no-jeans policy''.\n\n===Adverbs===\n[[Adverb]]s perform a wide range of functions. They typically modify verbs (or verb phrases), adjectives (or adjectival phrases), or other adverbs (or adverbial phrases).<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=311}}</ref> However, adverbs also sometimes qualify noun phrases ('''''only''' the boss''; '''''quite''' a lovely place''), pronouns and determiners ('''''almost''' all''), prepositional phrases ('''''halfway''' through the movie''), or whole sentences, to provide contextual comment or indicate an attitude ('''''Frankly''', I don't believe you'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=313}}</ref> They can also indicate a relationship between clauses or sentences (''He died, and '''consequently''' I inherited the estate'').<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313/>\n\nMany English adverbs are formed from adjectives by adding the ending ''-ly'', as in ''hopefully'', ''widely'', ''theoretically'' (for details of spelling and etymology, see ''[[-ly]]''). Certain words can be used as both adjectives and adverbs, such as ''fast'', ''straight'', and ''hard''; these are [[flat adverb]]s.  In earlier usage more flat adverbs were accepted in formal usage; many of these survive in idioms and colloquially. (''That's just '''plain''' ugly.'')  Some adjectives can also be used as flat adverbs when they actually describe the subject. (''The streaker ran '''naked''''', not **''The streaker ran nakedly''.)  The adverb corresponding to the adjective ''good'' is ''well'' (note that ''bad'' forms the regular ''badly'', although ''ill'' is occasionally used in some phrases).\n\nThere are also many adverbs that are not derived from adjectives,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311/> including adverbs of time, of frequency, of place,  of degree and with other meanings. Some suffixes that are commonly used to form adverbs from nouns are ''-ward[s]'' (as in ''homeward[s]'') and ''-wise'' (as in ''lengthwise'').\n\nMost adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by modification with ''more'' and ''most'': ''often'', ''more often'', ''most often''; ''smoothly'', ''more smoothly'', ''most smoothly'' (see also [[#Comparison|comparison of adjectives]], above). However, a few adverbs retain irregular inflection for [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] forms:<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311/> ''much'', ''more'', ''most''; ''a little'', ''less'', ''least''; ''well'', ''better'', ''best''; ''badly'', ''worse'', ''worst''; ''far'', ''further'' (''farther''), ''furthest'' (''farthest''); or follow the regular adjectival inflection: ''fast'', ''faster'', ''fastest''; ''soon'', ''sooner'', ''soonest''; etc.\n\nAdverbs indicating the manner of an action are generally placed after the verb and its objects (''We considered the proposal '''carefully'''''), although other positions are often possible (''We '''carefully''' considered the proposal''). Many adverbs of frequency, degree, certainty, etc. (such as ''often'', ''always'', ''almost'', ''probably'', and various others such as ''just'') tend to be placed before the verb (''they '''usually''' have chips''), although if there is an auxiliary or other \"special verb\" (see {{slink||Verbs}} above), then the normal position for such adverbs is after that special verb (or after the first of them, if there is more than one): ''I have '''just''' finished the crossword''; ''She can '''usually''' manage a pint''; ''We are '''never''' late''; ''You might '''possibly''' have been unconscious''. Adverbs that provide a connection with previous information (such as ''next'', ''then'', ''however''), and those that provide the context (such as time or place) for a sentence, are typically placed at the start of the sentence: '''''Yesterday''' we went on a shopping expedition.''<ref>[http://esl.about.com/od/grammarstructures/a/adverb_placement.htm esl.about.com]</ref>\n\nA special type of adverb is the adverbial particle used to form [[phrasal verb]]s (such as ''up'' in ''pick up'', ''on'' in ''get on'', etc.) If such a verb also has an object, then the particle may precede or follow the object, although it will normally follow the object if the object is a pronoun (''pick the pen up'' or ''pick up the pen'', but ''pick it up'').\n\n====Phrases====\nAn [[adverb phrase]] is a phrase that acts as an adverb within a sentence.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p312>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=312}}</ref> An adverb phrase may have an adverb as its [[head (linguistics)|head]], together with any modifiers (other adverbs or adverb phrases) and complements, analogously to the [[#Adjective phrases|adjective phrases]] described above. For example: ''very sleepily''; ''all too suddenly''; ''oddly enough''; ''perhaps shockingly for us''.\n\nAnother very common type of adverb phrase is the [[prepositional phrase]], which consists of a preposition and its object: ''in the pool''; ''after two years''; ''for the sake of harmony''.\n\n===Prepositions===\n[[Preposition]]s form a closed word class,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313/> although there are also certain phrases that serve as prepositions, such as ''in front of''. A single preposition may have a variety of meanings, often including temporal, spatial and abstract. Many words that are prepositions can also serve as adverbs. Examples of common English prepositions (including phrasal instances) are ''of'', ''in'', ''on'', ''over'', ''under'', ''to'', ''from'', ''with'', ''in front of'', ''behind'', ''opposite'', ''by'', ''before'', ''after'', ''during'', ''through'', ''in spite of'' or ''despite'', ''between'', ''among'', etc.\n\nA preposition is usually used with a noun phrase as its [[complement (grammar)|complement]]. A preposition together with its complement is called a [[prepositional phrase]].<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p314-315>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|pp=314\u2013315}}</ref> Examples are ''in England'', ''under the table'', ''after six pleasant weeks'', ''between the land and the sea''. A prepositional phrase can be used as a complement or post-modifier of a noun in a noun phrase, as in ''the man in the car'', ''the start of the fight''; as a complement of a verb or adjective, as in ''deal with the problem'', ''proud of oneself''; or generally as an adverb phrase (see above).\n\nEnglish allows the use of [[Preposition stranding|\"stranded\" prepositions]]. This can occur in interrogative and [[English relative clauses|relative clauses]], where the interrogative or relative pronoun that is the preposition's complement is moved to the start ([[wh-fronting|fronted]]), leaving the preposition in place. This kind of structure is avoided in some kinds of formal English. For example:\n*''What are you talking about?'' (Possible alternative version: ''About what are you talking?'')\n*''The song that you were listening to ...'' (more formal: ''The song to which you were listening ...'')\nNotice that in the second example the relative pronoun ''that'' could be omitted.\n\nStranded prepositions can also arise in [[English passive voice|passive voice]] constructions and other uses of passive [[past participle|past participial phrases]], where the complement in a prepositional phrase can become [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] in the same way that a verb's direct object would: ''it was looked at''; ''I will be operated on''; ''get your teeth seen to''. The same can happen in certain uses of [[infinitive]] phrases: ''he is nice to talk to''; ''this is the page to make copies of''.\n\n===Conjunctions===\n[[Conjunction (grammar)|Conjunction]]s express a variety of logical relations between items, phrases, clauses and sentences.<ref name=\"carter-mccarthy-p315\">{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=315}}</ref> The principal [[coordinating conjunction]]s in English are: ''and'', ''or'', ''but'', ''nor'', ''so'', ''yet'', and ''for''. These can be used in many grammatical contexts to link two or more items of equal grammatical status,<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p315/> for example:\n*Noun phrases combined into a longer noun phrase, such as ''John, Eric, and Jill'', ''the red coat or the blue one''. When ''and'' is used, the resulting noun phrase is plural. A determiner does not need to be repeated with the individual elements: ''the cat, the dog, and the mouse'' and ''the cat, dog, and mouse'' are both correct. The same applies to other modifiers. (The word ''but'' can be used here in the sense of \"except\": ''nobody but you''.)\n*Adjective or adverb phrases combined into a longer adjective or adverb phrase: ''tired but happy'', ''over the fields and far away''.\n*Verbs or verb phrases combined as in ''he washed, peeled, and diced the turnips'' (verbs conjoined, object shared); ''he washed the turnips, peeled them, and diced them'' (full verb phrases, including objects, conjoined).\n*Other equivalent items linked, such as prefixes linked in ''pre- and post-test counselling'',<ref>British Medical Association, ''Misuse of Drugs'', Chapter 4, \"Constraints of current practice.\"</ref> numerals as in ''two or three buildings'', etc.\n*Clauses or sentences linked, as in ''We came, '''but''' they wouldn't let us in. They wouldn't let us in, '''nor''' would they explain what we had done wrong.''\n\nThere are also [[correlative conjunction]]s, where as well as the basic conjunction, an additional element appears before the first of the items being linked.<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p315/> The common correlatives in English are:\n* ''either ... or'' (''either a man or a woman'');\n* ''neither ... nor'' (''neither clever nor funny'');\n* ''both ... and'' (''they both punished and rewarded them'');\n* ''not ... but'', particularly in ''not only ... but also'' (''not exhausted but exhilarated'', ''not only football but also many other sports'').\n\n[[Subordinating conjunction]]s make relations between clauses, making the clause in which they appear into a [[subordinate clause]].<ref name=carter-mccarthy-p316>{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=316}}</ref> Some common subordinating conjunctions in English are:\n*conjunctions of time, including ''after'', ''before'', ''since'', ''until'', ''when'', ''while'';\n*conjunctions of cause and effect, including ''because'', ''since'', ''now that'', ''as'', ''in order that'', ''so'';\n*conjunctions of opposition or concession, such as ''although'', ''though'', ''even though'', ''whereas'', ''while'';\n*conjunctions of condition: such as ''if'', ''unless'', ''only if'', ''whether or not'', ''even if'', ''in case (that)'';\n*the conjunction ''that'', which produces [[content clause]]s, as well as words that produce interrogative content clauses: ''whether'', ''where'', ''when'', ''how'', etc.\n\nA subordinating conjunction generally comes at the very start of its clause, although many of them can be preceded by qualifying adverbs, as in ''probably because ...'', ''especially if ...''. The conjunction ''that'' can be omitted after certain verbs, as in ''she told us (that) she was ready''. (For the use of ''that'' in relative clauses, see {{slink||Relative pronouns}} above.)\n\n===Case===\nAlthough English has largely lost its case system, [[personal pronouns]] still have three morphological cases that are simplified forms of the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[objective case|objective]] and [[genitive case]]s:<ref>The Chambers Dictionary, 11th edition</ref>\n\n* The ''[[nominative case]]'' (''[[subjective pronouns]]'' such as ''I'', ''he'', ''she'', ''we'', ''they'', ''who'', ''whoever''), used for the subject of a [[finite verb]] and sometimes for the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]].\n* The ''[[oblique case]]'' (''[[object pronoun]]s'' such as ''me'', ''him'', ''her'', ''us'', ''it'', ''us'', ''them'', ''whom'', ''whomever''), used for the direct or indirect [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb, for the object of a preposition, for an absolute disjunct, and sometimes for the complement of a copula.\n* The ''[[genitive case]]'' (''[[possessive pronouns]]'' such as ''my/mine'', ''his'', ''her(s)'', ''our(s)'', ''its'', ''our(s)'', ''their'', ''theirs'', ''whose''), used for a grammatical possessor. This is not always considered to be a case; see {{slink|English possessive|Status of the possessive as a grammatical case}}.\n\nMost English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the [[possessive case]], which has both a ''[[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]'' form (such as ''my'', ''our'') and a distinct ''independent'' form (such as ''mine'', ''ours'') (with two exceptions: the [[grammatical person|third person]] singular masculine and the third person singular neuter ''it'', which use the same form for both determiner and independent [''his car'', ''it is his'']), and a distinct ''[[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]]'' or ''intensive'' form (such as ''myself'', ''ourselves''). The [[Interrogative word|interrogative]] personal pronoun ''who'' exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms (''who'', ''whom'', ''whose'') and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms (''whoever'', ''whomever'', and ''whosever'').\n\nForms such as ''I'', ''he'', and ''we'' are used for the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (\"'''I''' kicked the ball\"), whereas forms such as ''me'', ''him'' and ''us'' are used for the [[object (grammar)|object]] (\"John kicked '''me'''\").<ref>Finkenstaedt, Thomas; Dieter Wolff (1973). Ordered profusion; studies in dictionaries and the English lexicon. C. Winter.</ref>\n\n===Declension===\n{{further|Declension}}\nNouns have distinct singular and plural forms; that is, they ''decline'' to reflect their [[grammatical number]]; consider the difference between ''book'' and ''books''. In addition, a few English pronouns have distinct [[nominative case|nominative]] (also called [[nominative case#Subjective|subjective]]) and [[oblique case|oblique]] (or objective) forms; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a [[verb]] or [[preposition]], or [[grammatical case|case]]. Consider the difference between ''he'' (subjective) and ''him'' (objective), as in \"He saw it\" and \"It saw him\"; similarly, consider ''[[Who (pronoun)|who]]'', which is subjective, and the objective ''whom''.\n\nFurther, these pronouns and a few others have distinct [[grammatical possession|possessive]] forms, such as ''his'' and ''whose''. By contrast, nouns have no distinct nominative and objective forms, the two being merged into a single ''plain case''. For example, ''chair'' does not change form between \"the chair is here\" (subject) and \"I saw the chair\" (direct object). Possession is shown by the [[clitic]] ''-'s'' attached to a possessive [[noun phrase]], rather than by declension of the noun itself.<ref>[[James Clackson]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJDjNp6wODoC&pg=PA90 ''Indo-European linguistics: an introduction''], p.90</ref>\n\n==Negation==\nAs noted above under {{slink||Verbs}}, a finite indicative verb (or its clause) is [[negation (linguistics)|negated]] by placing the word ''not'' after an auxiliary, modal or other \"[[special verb|special]]\" verb such as ''do'', ''can'' or ''be''. For example, the clause ''I go'' is negated with the appearance of the auxiliary ''do'', as ''I do not go'' (see [[do-support|''do''-support]]). When the '''affirmative''' already uses auxiliary verbs (''I am going''), no other auxiliary ''verbs'' are added to negate the clause (''I am not going''). (Until the period of early Modern English, negation was effected without additional auxiliary verbs: ''I go not.'')\n\nMost combinations of auxiliary verbs etc. with ''not'' have [[contraction (grammar)|contracted forms]]: ''don't'', ''can't'', ''isn't'', etc. (Also the uncontracted negated form of ''can'' is written as a single word ''cannot''.) On inversion of subject and verb (such as in questions; see below), the subject may be placed after a contracted negated form: ''Should he not pay?'' or ''Shouldn't he pay?''\n\nOther elements, such as noun phrases, adjectives, adverbs, infinitive and participial phrases, etc., can be negated by placing the word ''not'' before them: ''not the right answer'', ''not interesting'', ''not to enter'', ''not noticing the train'', etc.\n\nWhen other negating words such as ''never'', ''nobody'', etc. appear in a sentence, the negating ''not'' is omitted (unlike its equivalents in many languages): ''I saw nothing'' or ''I didn't see anything'', but not (except in non-standard speech) *''I didn't see nothing'' (see [[Double negative]]). Such negating words generally have corresponding [[negative polarity item]]s (''ever'' for ''never'', ''anybody'' for ''nobody'', etc.) which can appear in a negative context, but are not negative themselves (and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double negatives).\n\n==Clause and sentence structure==\n{{main|English clause syntax}}\nA typical [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] contains one [[independent clause]] and possibly one or more [[dependent clause]]s, although it is also possible to link together sentences of this form into longer sentences, using coordinating conjunctions (see above). A clause typically contains a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (a noun phrase) and a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (a verb phrase in the terminology used above; that is, a verb together with its objects and complements). A dependent clause also normally contains a subordinating conjunction (or in the case of relative clauses, a relative pronoun or phrase containing one).\n\n===Word order===\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2) word order]] to being almost exclusively [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of [[auxiliary verbs]] often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as ''he had hoped to try to open it''. In most sentences English marks grammatical relations only through word order. The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The [[Object\u2013subject\u2013verb]] (OSV) may on occasion be seen in English, usually in the [[future tense]] or used as a contrast with the conjunction \"but\", such as in the following examples: \"Rome I shall see!\", \"I hate oranges, but apples I'll eat!\".<ref>{{cite book| last = Crystal| first = David| authorlink = David Crystal| title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language | edition = 2nd| year = 1997| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 0-521-55967-7}}</ref>\n\n===Questions===\nLike many other Western European languages, English historically allowed [[question]]s to be formed by [[inversion (grammar)|inverting]] the positions of verb and [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. Modern English permits this only in the case of a small class of verbs (\"[[special verb]]s\"), consisting of auxiliaries as well as forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'' (see [[subject\u2013auxiliary inversion]]). To form a question from a sentence which does not have such an auxiliary or copula present, the auxiliary verb ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') needs to be inserted, along with inversion of the word order, to form a question (see [[do-support|''do''-support]]). For example:\n* She can dance. \u2192 Can she dance? (inversion of subject ''she'' and auxiliary ''can'')\n* I am sitting here. \u2192 Am I sitting here? (inversion of subject ''I'' and copula ''am'')\n* The milk goes in the fridge. \u2192 Does the milk go in the fridge? (no special verb present; ''do''-support required)\n\nThe above concerns [[yes-no question]]s, but inversion also takes place in the same way after other questions, formed with [[interrogative word]]s such as ''where'', ''what'', ''how'', etc. An exception applies when the interrogative word is the subject or part of the subject, in which case there is no inversion. For example:\n* I go. \u2192 Where do I go? (''wh''-question formed using inversion, with ''do''-support required in this case)\n* He goes. \u2192 Who goes? (no inversion, because the question word ''who'' is the subject)\n\nNote that inversion does not apply in [[indirect question]]s: ''I wonder where he is'' (not *''... where is he''). Indirect yes-no questions can be expressed using ''if'' or ''whether'' as the interrogative word: ''Ask them whether/if they saw him.''\n\n[[Negative (grammar)|Negative]] questions are formed similarly; however if the verb undergoing inversion has a [[English contractions|contraction]] with ''not'', then it is possible to invert the subject with this contraction as a whole. For example:\n* John is going. (affirmative)\n* John is not going. / John isn't going. (negative, with and without contraction)\n* Isn't John going? / Is John not going? (negative question, with and without contraction respectively)\n\nSee also {{slink|English auxiliaries and contractions|Contractions and inversion}}.\n\n===Dependent clauses===\nThe syntax of a dependent clause is generally the same as that of an independent clause, except that the dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun (or phrase containing such). In some situations (as already described) the conjunction or relative pronoun ''that'' can be omitted. Another type of dependent clause with no subordinating conjunction is the conditional clause formed by inversion (see below).\n\n===Other uses of inversion===\nThe clause structure with inverted subject and verb, used to form questions as described above, is also used in certain types of declarative sentence. This occurs mainly when the sentence begins with an adverbial or other phrase that is essentially negative or contains words such as ''only'', ''hardly'', etc.: ''Never have I known someone so stupid; Only in France can such food be tasted''.\n\nIn elliptical sentences (see below), inversion takes place after ''so'' (meaning \"also\") as well as after the negative ''neither'': ''so do I, neither does she''.\n\nInversion can also be used to form conditional clauses, beginning with ''should'', ''were'' (subjunctive), or ''had'', in the following ways:\n*''should I win the race'' (equivalent to ''if I win the race'');\n*''were he a soldier'' (equivalent to ''if he were a soldier'');\n*''were he to win the race'' (equivalent to ''if he were to win the race'', i.e. ''if he won the race'');\n*''had he won the race'' (equivalent to ''if he had won the race'').\nOther similar forms sometimes appear, but are less common. There is also a construction with subjunctive ''be'', as in ''be he alive or dead'' (meaning \"no matter whether he is alive or dead\").\n\nUse of inversion to express a third-person imperative is now mostly confined to the expression ''long live X'', meaning \"let X live long\".\n\n===Imperatives===\nIn an [[imperative mood|imperative]] sentence (one giving an order), there is usually no subject in the independent clause: ''Go away until I call you.'' It is possible, however, to include ''you'' as the subject for emphasis: ''You stay away from me.''\n\n===Elliptical constructions===\nMany types of elliptical construction are possible in English, resulting in sentences that omit certain redundant elements. Various examples are given in the article on [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]].\n\nSome notable elliptical forms found in English include:\n*Short statements of the form ''I can'', ''he isn't'', ''we mustn't''. Here the verb phrase (understood from the context) is reduced to a single auxiliary or other \"special\" verb, negated if appropriate. If there is no special verb in the original verb phrase, it is replaced by ''do/does/did'': ''he does'', ''they didn't''.\n*Clauses that omit the verb, in particular those like ''me too'', ''nor me'', ''me neither''. The latter forms are used after negative statements. (Equivalents including the verb: ''I do too'' or ''so do I''; ''I don't either'' or ''neither do I''.)\n*[[Tag question]]s, formed with a special verb and pronoun subject: ''isn't it?''; ''were there?''; ''am I not?''\n\n==History of English grammars==\n{{main|History of English grammars}}\nThe first published English grammar was a ''Pamphlet for Grammar'' of 1586, written by [[William Bullokar]] with the stated goal of demonstrating that English was just as rule-based as Latin. Bullokar's grammar was faithfully modeled on [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily's]] Latin grammar, ''Rudimenta Grammatices'' (1534), used in English schools at that time, having been \"prescribed\" for them in 1542 by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Bullokar wrote his grammar in English and used a \"reformed spelling system\" of his own invention; but many English grammars, for much of the century after Bullokar's effort, were written in Latin, especially by authors who were aiming to be scholarly. [[John Wallis]]'s ''Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae'' (1685) was the last English grammar written in Latin.\n\nEven as late as the early 19th century, [[Lindley Murray]], the author of one of the most widely used grammars of the day, was having to cite \"grammatical authorities\" to bolster the claim that grammatical cases in English are different from those in Ancient Greek or Latin.\n\nEnglish [[Part of speech|parts of speech]] are based on Latin and Greek parts of speech.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=snippet&q=dryden&f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=27\u201328|language=en}}</ref> Some English grammar rules were adopted from [[Latin]], for example [[John Dryden]] is thought to have created the rule [[Preposition stranding|no sentences can end in a preposition]] because Latin cannot end sentences in prepositions. The rule of no [[split infinitive]]s was adopted from Latin because Latin has no split infinitives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=524618639|title=From 'F-Bomb' To 'Photobomb,' How The Dictionary Keeps Up With English|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=onepage&q=latin&f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=47|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=snippet&q=split&f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=44|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n* [[Disputes in English grammar]]\n* [[English prefixes]]\n* [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Grammar books===\n*{{cite book|author=Aarts, Bas|year=2011|title=Oxford Modern English Grammar|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordmodernengl00aart/page/410 410]|isbn=978-0-19-953319-0|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordmodernengl00aart/page/410}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Biber, Douglas |author2=Johansson, Stig |author3=Leech, Geoffrey |author4=Conrad, Susan |author5=Finegan, Edward |year=1999|title=Longman grammar of spoken and written English|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|page=1203|isbn=0-582-23725-4}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Biber, Douglas |author2=Leech, Geoffrey |author3=Conrad, Susan |year=2002|title=Longman student grammar of spoken and written English|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|page=487|isbn=0-582-23726-2}}\n* {{cite book|author=Bryant, Margaret|title=A functional English grammar|year=1945|publisher=D.C.

The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule. This language was the forerunner of [[Modern English]]; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages\u2014particularly [[Latin]] and [[Norman language|Norman French]]\u2014the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language. An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words: \"dead\", \"cow\", \"house\" and \"strong\" are pronounced \"deed\", \"coo\", \"hoos\" and \"strang\"\u2014which is how they were pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon language. Other Geordie words with Anglo-Saxon origins include: \"larn\" (from the Anglo-Saxon \"laeran\", meaning \"teach\"), \"burn\" (\"stream\") and \"gan\" (\"go\").<ref name=\"GeordieOrigins\">{{cite web | title=North East dialect origins and the meaning of 'Geordie' | work=northeastengland.talktalk.net | url=http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/GeordieOrigins.htm | accessdate=5 February 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224114420/http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/GeordieOrigins.htm | archive-date=24 February 2008 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n\"Bairn\" and \"hyem\", meaning \"child\" and \"home\", respectively, are examples of Geordie words with origins in Scandinavia;<ref name=bairnHyemScandinavianOrig>{{cite web | url = http://libguides.ncl.ac.uk/c.php?g=130223&p=850959 | title = Geordie dictionary | last = University Staff | date = 23 October 2017 | website = libguides.ncl.ac.uk | publisher = Newcastle University Library | accessdate = 31 March 2018 | quote = Hyem: Home (of Scandinavian origin)}}</ref> ''barn'' and ''hjem'' are the corresponding modern Norwegian and Danish words.

The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule. This language was the forerunner of [[Modern English]]; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages\u2014particularly [[Latin]] and [[Norman language|Norman French]]\u2014the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language. An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words: \"dead\", \"cow\", \"house\" and \"strong\" are pronounced \"deed\", \"coo\", \"hoos\" and \"strang\"\u2014which is how they were pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon language. Other Geordie words with Anglo-Saxon origins include: \"larn\" (from the Anglo-Saxon \"laeran\", meaning \"teach\"), \"burn\" (\"stream\") and \"gan\" (\"go\").<ref name=\"GeordieOrigins\">{{cite web | title=North East dialect origins and the meaning of 'Geordie' | work=northeastengland.talktalk.net | url=http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/GeordieOrigins.htm | accessdate=5 February 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224114420/http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/GeordieOrigins.htm | archive-date=24 February 2008 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n\"Bairn\" and \"hyem\", meaning \"child\" and \"home\", respectively, are examples of Geordie words with origins in Scandinavia;<ref name=bairnHyemScandinavianOrig>{{cite web | url = http://libguides.ncl.ac.uk/c.php?g=130223&p=850959 | title = Geordie dictionary | last = University Staff | date = 23 October 2017 | website = libguides.ncl.ac.uk | publisher = Newcastle University Library | accessdate = 31 March 2018 | quote = Hyem: Home (of Scandinavian origin)}}</ref> ''barn'' and ''hjem'' are the corresponding modern Norwegian and Danish words.
