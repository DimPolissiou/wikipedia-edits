It was the primary exploration route taken by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] as they traveled up the Missouri River in 1804. There are several locations along the US&nbsp;75 corridor that feature former campsite locations of the expedition. Other cities and towns along the corridor were starting points for travelers and freight headed west on the Oregon Trail. US&nbsp;75 was one of the original U.S. highways from the initial 1926 plan, however its route has gone through dramatic changes throughout its lifetime. Prior to 1984, the highway left the state in Omaha as it traveled east through the city along the present-day [[Interstate 480 in Nebraska|I-480]]/[[U.S. Route 6 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;6]] corridor across the [[Missouri River]] into [[Iowa]]. In 1984, with the completion of [[Interstate 29 in Iowa]], a series of transfers between Iowa and Nebraska brought the US&nbsp;75 designation from the I-29 corridor into Nebraska from Omaha north to replace the routing of US&nbsp;73 which was truncated back to [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] at the same time.<ref name=\"aashto1984\">{{cite web|url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/AASHTO_USRN_1984-05-23.pdf |title = Route Numbering Committee Agenda |publisher = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date = May 23, 1984 |access-date = February 5, 2017 |page=5}}</ref>\n\n==Route description==\n===Kansas to Nebraska City===\n[[File:Auburn, Nebraska US75.JPG|thumb|left|US&nbsp;75 through downtown Auburn]]\nUS&nbsp;75 enters Nebraska along the Kansas state line south of [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] in [[Richardson County, Nebraska|Richardson County]]. The highway travels north through agricultural fields the comes to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 8|N-8]]. After crossing the south and north forks of the Big Nemaha River the highway enters [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] a small village founded as Noraville in 1872 along the [[Atchison and Nebraska Railroad]]. The highway continues north out of Dawson and less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later has a junction with the northern terminus of [[U.S. Route 73]]. The highway then makes a sweeping turn to jog {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} west before resuming a northerly course as it approaches an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 4|N-4]]. About {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway comes to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 62|N-62]]. Continuing due north, US&nbsp;75 travels {{convert|10|mi|km}} through the rolling hills of eastern Nebraska before entering the city of [[Auburn, Nebraska|Auburn]]. Here, the highway has an intersection with [[U.S. Route 136 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;136]], the Heritage Scenic Byway. The highway continues north out of Auburn and travels {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 67|N-67]]. The two routes run concurrently for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} before N-67 diverges to the west towards [[Brock, Nebraska|Brock]]. US&nbsp;75 maintains its northerly heading for the next {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} before transitioning to a divided highway at an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 128|N-128]]. The highway then travels past the Nebraska City Municipal Airport as it heads towards a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 2|N-2]] on the south side of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]]. Here, a business route of US&nbsp;75 continues north into the city while mainline US&nbsp;75 turns westerly and runs concurrently with N-2 along the [[Julius Sterling Morton]] Beltway as the highway bypasses the city on the southwest side. West of the city, the two highways diverge as N-2 heads west towards [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] and US&nbsp;75 resumes its northerly trek as a standard two-lane highway.<ref name=ndor/><ref name=\"google\">{{google maps |url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/40,-95.79813/42.44652,-96.38045/@41.2192341,-97.2652045,8z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m21!4m20!1m16!3m4!1m2!1d-95.9109873!2d40.9441498!3s0x87946f91bd46c703:0x7978ae93c7410093!3m4!1m2!1d-96.01853!2d41.43949!3s0x87939585c71ad81b:0x199a6fd577a5496e!3m4!1m2!1d-96.2293454!2d41.8072113!3s0x87923271d5e01dcb:0x12c3c1d6b4c4e152!4e1!1m1!4e1!3e0?hl=en|title=overview of U.S. Route 75 in Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Nebraska City to Bellevue===\n[[File:Offutt AFB at 1000 ft.JPG|thumb|left|Offutt Air Force Base with US&nbsp;75 along right edge of photo]]\nAfter leaving Nebraska City, the highway has a junction with Business Route US&nbsp;75 northwest of the city along G Road. From this point, continuing north, US&nbsp;75 generally runs parallel to, and within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of the [[Missouri River]] for the duration of length. For the next {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} the highway travels through rural agricultural fields before coming to an intersection with [[U.S. Route 34 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;34]] near [[Union, Nebraska|Union]]. Here, US&nbsp;34 joins up with US&nbsp;75 and the two highways run concurrently to the north for the next {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} before they come to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 1|N-1]] just east of [[Murray, Nebraska|Murray]]. Continuing north, the concurrent highways travel west of Beaver Lake, then come to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 66|N-66]] on the southwest side of [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska|Plattsmouth]]. US&nbsp;34 formerly turned east into Plattsmouth here to cross the Missouri River into Iowa via a tolled bridge, however a new bridge   was opened upstream in October 2014 and US&nbsp;34 was realigned to utilize the new crossing on the north side of the [[Platte River]] near [[La Platte, Nebraska|La Platte]].<ref name=\"newus34bridge\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transportationmatters.iowadot.gov/2014/10/us-34-bridge-over-the-missouri-river-vital-new-transportation-link.html|title=U.S. 34 Bridge Over the Missouri River Vital New Transportation Link|publisher=Iowa Department of Transportation|access-date=February 1, 2017|date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> As such, US&nbsp;34 continues concurrent with US&nbsp;75 along the western side of Plattsmouth, acting as a bypass as the road widens to four lanes. The highway crosses the Platte River then comes to an interchange where US&nbsp;34 departs to the east along the aforementioned new alignment while US&nbsp;75 continues north into [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]]. On the south side of Bellevue, US&nbsp;75 becomes a limited access freeway known as the Kennedy Freeway. The freeway passes to the west of [[Offutt Air Force Base]] just before it comes to an interchange with [[Nebraska Highway 370|N-370]].<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Freeway through Omaha===\n[[File:Omaha, Nebraska 2876-2874-2872 Redick Ave.JPG|thumb|Houses of the Minne Lusa Residential Historic District in Omaha]]\n[[File:Creighton mall west.JPG|thumb|West mall of Creighton University with US&nbsp;75 in the background]]\nThe freeway continues north through dense residential areas as it enters South [[Omaha]]. As the highway passes Chandler Road and bends to the northwest it crosses over the railroad before becoming a depressed freeway just before its interchange with Q Street. Shortly after another interchange, this time with [[U.S. Route 275 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;275]] and [[Nebraska Highway 92|N-92]]. Just {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway comes to a complex interchange with [[Interstate 80 in Nebraska|I-80]] and [[Interstate 480 (Iowa\u2013Nebraska)|I-480]] near the [[Hanscom Park]] area in [[Midtown Omaha]]. Here, US&nbsp;75 joins Interstate 480 where it becomes known as the Gerald Ford Freeway. Together, the two freeways run concurrently past the [[Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens]], where [[U.S. President]] [[Gerald R. Ford]] lived for a couple of weeks after his birth in 1913. The freeway continues north towards the newly developed [[Midtown Crossing at Turner Park]]. Opened in 2010, it's a seven building, {{convert|16|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed-use development containing luxury condominiums, apartments, and more than {{convert|225000|sqft}} of dining, entertainment, and shopping. Here, Interstate 480 departs to the east where it heads into [[Downtown Omaha]] before crossing the Missouri River into [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]]. US&nbsp;75 continues as the North Freeway past [[Creighton University]] into [[North Omaha]] where it has an incomplete interchange with [[Nebraska Highway 64|N-64]]. The freeway then has an interchange with the [[Sorensen Parkway]] and the Storz Expressway which heads east to [[Eppley Airfield]]. Shortly after, the freeway becomes a surface four-lane street as it travels through the [[Miller Park (Omaha, Nebraska)|Miller Park]] area and the [[Minne Lusa]] Residential Historic District, a large single-family residential development that was built by a single firm between 1915 and 1941. The highway then continues north through the [[Florence, Nebraska|Florence]] neighborhood, one of the oldest cities in Nebraska. Shortly after, the highway turns west just prior to [[Interstate 680 (Iowa\u2013Nebraska)|I-680]] and runs alongside it for about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} along McKinley Street before turning north and passing beneath the interstate. Here the highway leaves the city and continues on its path to the north.<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n===Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway===\n====Omaha to Sioux City, Iowa====\n[[File:Winnebago, Nebraska Hwy 75-77 3.JPG|thumb|left|US&nbsp;75/77 through downtown Winnebago]]\nThe portion of US&nbsp;75 north of Omaha to Interstate 129 is designated as the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway begins. Throughout the remainder of the highway's length parallel to the Missouri River, the highway passes near the locations of former campsites of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. As US&nbsp;75 continues north beyond the Omaha City Limits, the highway winds its way through rolling hills before entering the Missouri River plain just south of [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]]. From here, the highway continues its northward travel along the edge of the river plain towards [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]]. Here, in Blair, US&nbsp;75 comes to a junction with US&nbsp;30, The Lincoln Highway, and together the two routes run concurrently along Washington Street for {{convert|1/2|mi|m|spell=in}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 91|N-91]]. Here, US&nbsp;30 diverges to the southwest towards [[Fremont, Nebraska|Fremont]] while US&nbsp;75 resumes heading north. About {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} later the highway passes through the small village of [[Herman, Nebraska|Herman]] and {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later enters the city of [[Tekamah, Nebraska|Tekamah]] where it has an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 32|N-32]] just after crossing Tekamah Creek. The highway continues north out of Tekamah, still following the edge of the rolling hills and Missouri River plain passing through rich agricultural fields, for {{convert|15|mi|km}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 51|N-51]] on the south edge of [[Decatur, Nebraska|Decatur]] just west of the Onawa Materials Yard and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Areas, both [[enclave]]s of Nebraska that are situated on the eastern side of the [[Missouri River]] and are only accessible via roads in [[Iowa]]. US&nbsp;75 and N-51 run concurrently through Decatur for {{convert|1/2|mi|m|spell=in}} before N-51 departs to the east to cross the Missouri River into Iowa while US&nbsp;75 continues north out of town. Heading out of Decatur, the highway climbs back into the rolling hills as it turns northwest into the [[Omaha Reservation]] towards the tribal seat of [[Macy, Nebraska|Macy]]. North of Macy, the highway comes to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 94|N-94]] and {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} later intersects [[U.S. Route 77 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;77]] just south of [[Winnebago, Nebraska|Winnebago]]. Here the two highways run concurrently to the north as they emerge from the rolling hills back into the Missouri River plain as they pass through the village of [[Homer, Nebraska|Homer]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the two-lane highway becomes a four-lane divided highway as it approaches [[Dakota City, Nebraska|Dakota City]]. On the west side of Dakota City, the highways intersect [[Nebraska Highway 35|N-35]] before continuing on to the north. {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} later the highway approaches an interchange with [[Interstate 129|I-129]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;20]] on the southwest side of [[South Sioux City, Nebraska|South Sioux City]]. Here, US&nbsp;20 heads west towards [[O'Neill, Nebraska|O'Neill]] while US&nbsp;77 heads north into [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. US&nbsp;75 joins I-129 and US&nbsp;20 to head east across the southern portion of South Sioux City to the Sergeant Floyd Memorial Bridge which crosses the Missouri River and continues into Iowa.<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Lewis and Clark Expedition===\nPrior to the state highway system, travel across Nebraska was accomplished via foot, horseback, and horse-drawn wagons. Many important historical routes passed through or along the present day US&nbsp;75 corridor. After the acquisition of vast territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], President [[Thomas Jefferson]] commissioned an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory. A select group of U.S. Army volunteers led by Captain [[Meriweather Lewis]] and Second Lieutenant [[William Clark]], The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], which began on May 14, 1804 near [[St. Louis]], reached southeastern Nebraska in July of that year. As they traveled northwest along the Missouri River the expedition would set up camp at sites on land in present-day Nebraska at several locations. Many of these campsites are recognized by monuments established by the Nebraska Historical Society along the US&nbsp;75 corridor near the towns of [[Rulo, Nebraska|Rulo]], [[Brownville, Nebraska|Brownville]], [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska|Plattsmouth]], [[Omaha]], [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]], [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]], and [[Jackson, Nebraska|Jackson]].<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j13.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 13, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j15.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 15, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j21.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 21, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j27.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 27, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a2.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 30&ndash;August 2, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a3-4.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; August 3 and 4, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a21.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; August 21, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> US&nbsp;75 parallels the Missouri River for the majority of its length in Nebraska and provides access to many historical sites related to the expedition, as such the highway from Omaha north to Interstate 129 is designated the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway, one of nine scenic byways in the state of Nebraska.<ref name=\"ndorscenic\"/>\n\n===Oregon Trail===\nDiscovery of gold in Colorado and Montana promoted Nebraska City to a central hub for freight between 1858 and 1865 as thousands of wagons transported supplies via the Nebraska City Cutoff of the Oregon Trail west to Fort Kearny.<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/neb_city_ft_kearny_cutoff.htm|title=Nebraska City&ndash;Fort Kearny Cutoff|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|location=Otoe County, Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> As the shortest distance between Fort Kearny and the Missouri River,<ref name=\"springcreekaudobon\">{{cite web|url = http://springcreekprairie.audubon.org/sites/g/files/amh586/f/fort_kearny_cutoff.pdf|title = The Nebraska City-Fort Kearny Cutoff to the Oregon Trail|last = Murphy|first = David|publisher = Spring Creek Prairie Audubon Center|access-date = February 5, 2017}}</ref> this plowed furrow extended over {{convert|180|mi|km}} between Nebraska City and Fort Kearny and during the peak of its use in 1865, over {{convert|44|e6lb}} of supplies were shipped before the construction of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] provided a superior means of transportation.<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety1b\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/neb_city_ft_kearny_cutoff2.htm|title=Nebraska City&ndash;Fort Kearny Cutoff|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|location=York County, Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebroadside1\">{{cite book |last=Boye |first=Alan |date=1989 |title=The Complete Roadside Guide to Nebraska |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1ON6kaw0nXIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |page=7 |access-date=February 4, 2017 |isbn=978-0-8032-5968-3 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===United States Numbered Highway System===\nUS&nbsp;75 has existed since the inception of the US Numbered Highway System in 1926.

US&nbsp;75 was one of the original U.S. highways from the initial 1926 plan, however its route has gone through dramatic changes throughout its lifetime.

The highway continues north out of Dawson and less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later has a junction with the northern terminus of [[U.S. Route 73]]. The highway then makes a sweeping turn to jog {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} west before resuming a northerly course as it approaches an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 4|N-4]]. About {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway comes to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 62|N-62]]. Continuing due north, US&nbsp;75 travels {{convert|10|mi|km}} through the rolling hills of eastern Nebraska before entering the city of [[Auburn, Nebraska|Auburn]]. Here, the highway has an intersection with [[U.S. Route 136 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;136]], the Heritage Scenic Byway. The highway continues north out of Auburn and travels {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 67|N-67]]. The two routes run concurrently for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} before N-67 diverges to the west towards [[Brock, Nebraska|Brock]]. US&nbsp;75 maintains its northerly heading for the next {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} before transitioning to a divided highway at an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 128|N-128]]. The highway then travels past the Nebraska City Municipal Airport as it heads towards a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 2|N-2]] on the south side of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]]. Here, a business route of US&nbsp;75 continues north into the city while mainline US&nbsp;75 turns westerly and runs concurrently with N-2 along the [[Julius Sterling Morton]] Beltway as the highway bypasses the city on the southwest side. West of the city, the two highways diverge as N-2 heads west towards [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] and US&nbsp;75 resumes its northerly trek as a standard two-lane highway.<ref name=ndor/><ref name=\"google\">{{google maps |url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/40,-95.79813/42.44652,-96.38045/@41.2192341,-97.2652045,8z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m21!4m20!1m16!3m4!1m2!1d-95.9109873!2d40.9441498!3s0x87946f91bd46c703:0x7978ae93c7410093!3m4!1m2!1d-96.01853!2d41.43949!3s0x87939585c71ad81b:0x199a6fd577a5496e!3m4!1m2!1d-96.2293454!2d41.8072113!3s0x87923271d5e01dcb:0x12c3c1d6b4c4e152!4e1!1m1!4e1!3e0?hl=en|title=overview of U.S. Route 75 in Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Nebraska City to Bellevue===\n[[File:Offutt AFB at 1000 ft.JPG|thumb|left|Offutt Air Force Base with US&nbsp;75 along right edge of photo]]\nAfter leaving Nebraska City, the highway has a junction with Business Route US&nbsp;75 northwest of the city along G Road. From this point, continuing north, US&nbsp;75 generally runs parallel to, and within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of the [[Missouri River]] for the duration of length. For the next {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} the highway travels through rural agricultural fields before coming to an intersection with [[U.S. Route 34 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;34]] near [[Union, Nebraska|Union]].

Continuing north, the concurrent highways travel west of Beaver Lake, then come to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 66|N-66]] on the southwest side of [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska|Plattsmouth]]. US&nbsp;34 formerly turned east into Plattsmouth here to cross the Missouri River into Iowa via a tolled bridge, however a new bridge   was opened upstream in October 2014 and US&nbsp;34 was realigned to utilize the new crossing on the north side of the [[Platte River]] near [[La Platte, Nebraska|La Platte]].<ref name=\"newus34bridge\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transportationmatters.iowadot.gov/2014/10/us-34-bridge-over-the-missouri-river-vital-new-transportation-link.html|title=U.S. 34 Bridge Over the Missouri River Vital New Transportation Link|publisher=Iowa Department of Transportation|access-date=February 1, 2017|date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> As such, US&nbsp;34 continues concurrent with US&nbsp;75 along the western side of Plattsmouth, acting as a bypass as the road widens to four lanes. The highway crosses the Platte River then comes to an interchange where US&nbsp;34 departs to the east along the aforementioned new alignment while US&nbsp;75 continues north into [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]]. On the south side of Bellevue, US&nbsp;75 becomes a limited access freeway known as the Kennedy Freeway. The freeway passes to the west of [[Offutt Air Force Base]] just before it comes to an interchange with [[Nebraska Highway 370|N-370]].<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Freeway through Omaha===\n[[File:Omaha, Nebraska 2876-2874-2872 Redick Ave.JPG|thumb|Houses of the Minne Lusa Residential Historic District in Omaha]]\n[[File:Creighton mall west.JPG|thumb|West mall of Creighton University with US&nbsp;75 in the background]]\nThe freeway continues north through dense residential areas as it enters South [[Omaha]]. As the highway passes Chandler Road and bends to the northwest it crosses over the railroad before becoming a depressed freeway just before its interchange with Q Street. Shortly after another interchange, this time with [[U.S. Route 275 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;275]] and [[Nebraska Highway 92|N-92]]. Just {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway comes to a complex interchange with [[Interstate 80 in Nebraska|I-80]] and [[Interstate 480 (Iowa\u2013Nebraska)|I-480]] near the [[Hanscom Park]] area in [[Midtown Omaha]]. Here, US&nbsp;75 joins Interstate 480 where it becomes known as the Gerald Ford Freeway. Together, the two freeways run concurrently past the [[Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens]], where [[U.S. President]] [[Gerald R. Ford]] lived for a couple of weeks after his birth in 1913. The freeway continues north towards the newly developed [[Midtown Crossing at Turner Park]]. Opened in 2010, it's a seven building, {{convert|16|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed-use development containing luxury condominiums, apartments, and more than {{convert|225000|sqft}} of dining, entertainment, and shopping. Here, Interstate 480 departs to the east where it heads into [[Downtown Omaha]] before crossing the Missouri River into [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]]. US&nbsp;75 continues as the North Freeway past [[Creighton University]] into [[North Omaha]] where it has an incomplete interchange with [[Nebraska Highway 64|N-64]]. The freeway then has an interchange with the [[Sorensen Parkway]] and the Storz Expressway which heads east to [[Eppley Airfield]]. Shortly after, the freeway becomes a surface four-lane street as it travels through the [[Miller Park (Omaha, Nebraska)|Miller Park]] area and the [[Minne Lusa]] Residential Historic District, a large single-family residential development that was built by a single firm between 1915 and 1941. The highway then continues north through the [[Florence, Nebraska|Florence]] neighborhood, one of the oldest cities in Nebraska. Shortly after, the highway turns west just prior to [[Interstate 680 (Iowa\u2013Nebraska)|I-680]] and runs alongside it for about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} along McKinley Street before turning north and passing beneath the interstate.

Throughout the remainder of the highway's length parallel to the Missouri River, the highway passes near the locations of former campsites of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. As US&nbsp;75 continues north beyond the Omaha City Limits, the highway winds its way through rolling hills before entering the Missouri River plain just south of [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]]. From here, the highway continues its northward travel along the edge of the river plain towards [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]]. Here, in Blair, US&nbsp;75 comes to a junction with US&nbsp;30, The Lincoln Highway, and together the two routes run concurrently along Washington Street for {{convert|1/2|mi|m|spell=in}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 91|N-91]]. Here, US&nbsp;30 diverges to the southwest towards [[Fremont, Nebraska|Fremont]] while US&nbsp;75 resumes heading north. About {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} later the highway passes through the small village of [[Herman, Nebraska|Herman]] and {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later enters the city of [[Tekamah, Nebraska|Tekamah]] where it has an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 32|N-32]] just after crossing Tekamah Creek. The highway continues north out of Tekamah, still following the edge of the rolling hills and Missouri River plain passing through rich agricultural fields, for {{convert|15|mi|km}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 51|N-51]] on the south edge of [[Decatur, Nebraska|Decatur]] just west of the Onawa Materials Yard and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Areas, both [[enclave]]s of Nebraska that are situated on the eastern side of the [[Missouri River]] and are only accessible via roads in [[Iowa]]. US&nbsp;75 and N-51 run concurrently through Decatur for {{convert|1/2|mi|m|spell=in}} before N-51 departs to the east to cross the Missouri River into Iowa while US&nbsp;75 continues north out of town. Heading out of Decatur, the highway climbs back into the rolling hills as it turns northwest into the [[Omaha Reservation]] towards the tribal seat of [[Macy, Nebraska|Macy]]. North of Macy, the highway comes to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 94|N-94]] and {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} later intersects [[U.S. Route 77 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;77]] just south of [[Winnebago, Nebraska|Winnebago]]. Here the two highways run concurrently to the north as they emerge from the rolling hills back into the Missouri River plain as they pass through the village of [[Homer, Nebraska|Homer]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the two-lane highway becomes a four-lane divided highway as it approaches [[Dakota City, Nebraska|Dakota City]]. On the west side of Dakota City, the highways intersect [[Nebraska Highway 35|N-35]] before continuing on to the north. {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} later the highway approaches an interchange with [[Interstate 129|I-129]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;20]] on the southwest side of [[South Sioux City, Nebraska|South Sioux City]]. Here, US&nbsp;20 heads west towards [[O'Neill, Nebraska|O'Neill]] while US&nbsp;77 heads north into [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. US&nbsp;75 joins I-129 and US&nbsp;20 to head east across the southern portion of South Sioux City to the Sergeant Floyd Memorial Bridge which crosses the Missouri River and continues into Iowa.<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Lewis and Clark Expedition===\nPrior to the state highway system, travel across Nebraska was accomplished via foot, horseback, and horse-drawn wagons. Many important historical routes passed through or along the present day US&nbsp;75 corridor. After the acquisition of vast territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], President [[Thomas Jefferson]] commissioned an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory. A select group of U.S. Army volunteers led by Captain [[Meriweather Lewis]] and Second Lieutenant [[William Clark]], The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], which began on May 14, 1804 near [[St. Louis]], reached southeastern Nebraska in July of that year. As they traveled northwest along the Missouri River the expedition would set up camp at sites on land in present-day Nebraska at several locations. Many of these campsites are recognized by monuments established by the Nebraska Historical Society along the US&nbsp;75 corridor near the towns of [[Rulo, Nebraska|Rulo]], [[Brownville, Nebraska|Brownville]], [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska|Plattsmouth]], [[Omaha]], [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]], [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]], and [[Jackson, Nebraska|Jackson]].<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j13.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 13, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j15.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 15, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j21.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 21, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j27.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 27, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a2.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 30&ndash;August 2, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a3-4.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; August 3 and 4, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a21.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; August 21, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> US&nbsp;75 parallels the Missouri River for the majority of its length in Nebraska and provides access to many historical sites related to the expedition, as such the highway from Omaha north to Interstate 129 is designated the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway, one of nine scenic byways in the state of Nebraska.<ref name=\"ndorscenic\"/>\n\n===Oregon Trail===\nDiscovery of gold in Colorado and Montana promoted Nebraska City to a central hub for freight between 1858 and 1865 as thousands of wagons transported supplies via the Nebraska City Cutoff of the Oregon Trail west to Fort Kearny.<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/neb_city_ft_kearny_cutoff.htm|title=Nebraska City&ndash;Fort Kearny Cutoff|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|location=Otoe County, Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> As the shortest distance between Fort Kearny and the Missouri River,<ref name=\"springcreekaudobon\">{{cite web|url = http://springcreekprairie.audubon.org/sites/g/files/amh586/f/fort_kearny_cutoff.pdf|title = The Nebraska City-Fort Kearny Cutoff to the Oregon Trail|last = Murphy|first = David|publisher = Spring Creek Prairie Audubon Center|access-date = February 5, 2017}}</ref> this plowed furrow extended over {{convert|180|mi|km}} between Nebraska City and Fort Kearny and during the peak of its use in 1865, over {{convert|44|e6lb}} of supplies were shipped before the construction of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] provided a superior means of transportation.<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety1b\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/neb_city_ft_kearny_cutoff2.htm|title=Nebraska City&ndash;Fort Kearny Cutoff|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|location=York County, Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebroadside1\">{{cite book |last=Boye |first=Alan |date=1989 |title=The Complete Roadside Guide to Nebraska |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1ON6kaw0nXIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |page=7 |access-date=February 4, 2017 |isbn=978-0-8032-5968-3 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===United States Numbered Highway System===\nUS&nbsp;75 has existed since the inception of the US Numbered Highway System in 1926.

[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[Goofy]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] in turn try to return things to normal, but [[Chernabog]] keeps throwing them out. Afterwards, [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] dresses in his famous sorcerer outfit from ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and challenges Jafar to a magical duel using fireballs. Mickey's sorcerer hat is bounced off and there is very little time to put it back on, but then [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] saves the day by escaping the kitchen to the backstage room on the [[Magic Carpet (Aladdin)|magic carpet]] and giving [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] who gives Mickey the lamp to trap Jafar. Mickey sucks Jafar into the lamp, while the rest of the villains flee, restoring the house to normal.\n\n====''Once Upon a Halloween''====\nIn the film ''[[Once Upon a Halloween]]'', on the night before [[Halloween]], the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' plans to conquer [[Halloween]], and asks her cauldron to show you several villains to which one of them helps her in her plan.\n\n===Video games===\n\n====''Disney's Villains' Revenge''====\n''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]'' is a video game which tells the story of how the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]], [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]], [[Queen of Hearts (Disney)|Queen of Hearts]], and the Ringmaster from ''[[Dumbo]]'' change the story from the original movie to the way they wanted the story to end, with no \"Happily Ever After\".\n\n====''Kingdom Hearts'' series====\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of [[action role-playing game]]s developed and published by [[Disney Interactive Studios]] and [[Square Enix]], Disney villains play a major role as they seek to harness the power of darkness within the [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]. Led by [[Maleficent]], the villains are antagonists in different worlds, such as the [[Queen of Hearts (Disney)|Queen of Hearts]] of Wonderland, [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] of the Olympus Coliseum, [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]] of the city of Agrabah, [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]] of Atlantica, [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]] of Never Land, [[Chernabog]] of End of the World/Symphony of Sorcerery, [[Shan Yu]] of the Land of Dragons, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] of the Pride Land, The [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] of Dwarf Woodlands, [[Lady Tremaine]] of Castle of Dreams, and [[Claude Frollo (Disney)|Claude Frollo]] of La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches. [[Pete (Disney)|Peg Leg Pete]] appears as [[Maleficent]]'s main henchman in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Other villains outside the official line-up that also make appearances include [[Clayton (Tarzan)|Clayton]] and [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]] of Deep Jungle, [[Oogie Boogie]] of Halloween Town, [[Captain Barbossa]] of Port Royal, the [[Master Control Program (Tron)|Master Control Program]] & [[Sark (Tron)|Sark]] from ''[[Tron]]'' of Space Paranoids, [[Gantu|Captain Gantu]] of Deep Space, [[CLU (Tron)|CLU]] & [[Rinzler (Tron)|Rinzler]] of The Grid and The [[Beagle Boys]] of Country of the Musketeers. Monstro, the whale from [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]], is both a character and a location as well as a boss in [[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep#Final Mix|Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix]]. [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]]'s Castle and Prankster's Paradise remain the only worlds in the series so far where their main villains do not appear at all.\n\n====''Epic Mickey'' series====\n''[[Epic Mickey]]'' introduces new villains to the world of Disney, most of which are from old-style Disney movies and attractions. In the first game, Mickey unwittingly creates a monster called the Shadow Blot (not to be confused with the [[Phantom Blot]]). As Mickey tries to get rid of it, [[Yen Sid]] approaches and Mickey is forced to flee, leaving some of the Blot undestroyed. Years later, the Blot has Mickey kidnapped so that his heart can be used to escape Wasteland. With Oswald's help, Mickey returns home as the Blot is defeated.\n\nIn the second game, a character called [[The Mad Doctor (1933 film)|The Mad Doctor]] tries to rule in the Shadow Blot's stead. In the first game, the Mad Doctor supplied robots for the Blot. If the player choose the Hero path, The Mad Doctor turns from a robot into a toon. If the player chooses the Scrapper path, The Mad Doctor is left in the final battle room to rot. Lastly, at the end of the second game, several versions of Pete look like they're going to try to take over the Wasteland.\n\n===Novels===\n\n====''The Kingdom Keepers''====\nIn ''[[The Kingdom Keepers]]'', Disney villains form a group known as the \"Overtakers\".\n\n==Commentary==\nThe majority of Disney's villain characters are regarded as being age 55 or older. A study from [[Brigham Young University]] reviewed seventy years of Disney films, and found that 42% of the 93 characters reviewed reinforced negative stereotypes of elderly people by portraying those characters as evil or sinister. The conclusion was that Disney was influencing children to have preconceived notions about all older adults.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-458808/Disneys-villains-children-negative-images-elderly.html\n|title=Disney's villains 'give children negative images of the elderly'\n|date=2007-05-31\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n|author=Fiona MacRae\n|publisher=Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nDisney villains proved their mark in cinematic history when the American Film Institute named The Queen as the [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Heroes and Villains|10th greatest movie villain of all time]].

Monstro, the whale from [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]], is both a character and a location as well as a boss in [[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep#Final Mix|Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix]]. [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]]'s Castle and Prankster's Paradise remain the only worlds in the series so far where their main villains do not appear at all.\n\n====''Epic Mickey'' series====\n''[[Epic Mickey]]'' introduces new villains to the world of Disney, most of which are from old-style Disney movies and attractions. In the first game, Mickey unwittingly creates a monster called the Shadow Blot (not to be confused with the [[Phantom Blot]]). As Mickey tries to get rid of it, [[Yen Sid]] approaches and Mickey is forced to flee, leaving some of the Blot undestroyed. Years later, the Blot has Mickey kidnapped so that his heart can be used to escape Wasteland. With Oswald's help, Mickey returns home as the Blot is defeated.\n\nIn the second game, a character called [[The Mad Doctor (1933 film)|The Mad Doctor]] tries to rule in the Shadow Blot's stead. In the first game, the Mad Doctor supplied robots for the Blot. If the player choose the Hero path, The Mad Doctor turns from a robot into a toon. If the player chooses the Scrapper path, The Mad Doctor is left in the final battle room to rot. Lastly, at the end of the second game, several versions of Pete look like they're going to try to take over the Wasteland.\n\n===Novels===\n\n====''The Kingdom Keepers''====\nIn ''[[The Kingdom Keepers]]'', Disney villains form a group known as the \"Overtakers\".\n\n==Commentary==\nThe majority of Disney's villain characters are regarded as being age 55 or older. A study from [[Brigham Young University]] reviewed seventy years of Disney films, and found that 42% of the 93 characters reviewed reinforced negative stereotypes of elderly people by portraying those characters as evil or sinister. The conclusion was that Disney was influencing children to have preconceived notions about all older adults.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-458808/Disneys-villains-children-negative-images-elderly.html\n|title=Disney's villains 'give children negative images of the elderly'\n|date=2007-05-31\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n|author=Fiona MacRae\n|publisher=Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nDisney villains proved their mark in cinematic history when the American Film Institute named The Queen as the [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Heroes and Villains|10th greatest movie villain of all time]].

They can be horribly evil or grandiosely funny, but are ultimately tragic.</blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Thomas, Frank and Johnston, Ollie, ''The Disney Villain'' (1993) {{ISBN|1-56282-792-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56282-792-2}}\n\n{{DisneyConsumer}}\n{{Disney franchises}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of Disney characters|Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney animated villains| ]]\n", "name_user": "201.208.2.106", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_villain_characters"}
