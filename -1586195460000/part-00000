It was an [[Imperial State]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Bohemian king]] was a [[prince-elector]] of the empire. The kings of Bohemia, besides [[Bohemia]] itself, also ruled other [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|lands belonging to the Bohemian Crown]], which at various times included [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lusatia]], and parts of [[Saxony]], [[Brandenburg]], and [[Bavaria]].\n\nThe kingdom was established by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]] in the 12th century from the [[Duchy of Bohemia]], later ruled by the [[House of Luxembourg]], the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]], and since 1526 by the [[House of Habsburg]] and its successor house [[Habsburg-Lorraine]]. Numerous kings of Bohemia were also elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the capital [[Prague]] was the imperial seat in the late 14th century, and at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the territory became part of the Habsburg [[Austrian Empire]], and subsequently the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] from 1867. Bohemia retained its name and formal status as a separate Kingdom of Bohemia until 1918, known as a crown land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and its capital Prague was one of the empire's leading cities. The Czech language (called the Bohemian language in English usage until the 19th century)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radio.cz/en/section/letter/from-bohemia-to-czechia|title=From Bohemia to Czechia|last=\u0160itler|first=Ji\u0159\u00ed|date=July 12, 2016|website=Radio Prague|access-date=June 27, 2019}}</ref> was the main language of the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] and the nobility until 1627 (after the [[Bohemian Revolt]] was suppressed). German was then formally made equal with Czech and eventually prevailed as the language of the Diet until the [[Czech National Revival]] in the 19th century. German was also widely used as the language of administration in many towns after the return of Germans [[Ostsiedlung|immigrated and populated]] [[Sudetenland|some areas of the country]] in the 13th century after the [[Migration Period]]. The royal court used the Czech, Latin, and German languages, depending on the ruler and period.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], both the Kingdom and Empire were dissolved. Bohemia became the core part of the newly formed [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]].\n\n==History==\n===13th century (growth)===\nAlthough some former rulers of Bohemia had enjoyed a non-hereditary royal title during the 11th and 12th centuries ([[Vratislaus II of Bohemia|Vratislaus II]], [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus II]]), the kingdom was formally established in 1198 by [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Ottokar I]], who had his status acknowledged by [[Philip of Swabia]], elected [[King of the Romans]], in return for his support against the rival Emperor [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]]. In 1204 Ottokar's royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by [[Pope Innocent III]]. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] issued by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], elevating the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] to [[Realm|Kingdom]] status.\n\nUnder these terms, the Czech king was to be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the bishop of [[Prague]] was revoked. The king's successor was his son [[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I]], from his second marriage.\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmen unter Ottokar II.png|thumb|left|upright|Territories ruled by [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] in 1273]]\n[[File:Nejstar\u0161\u00ed dochovan\u00e9 barevn\u00e9 vyobrazen\u00ed znaku \u010cech, hrad Gozzoburg v Krem\u017ei.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|The oldest depiction of coat of arms of Bohemia, castle Gozzoburg in [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]]]]\n\nWenceslaus I's sister [[Agnes of Bohemia|Agnes]], later canonized, was an extraordinarily courageous and energetic woman for her time; she refused to marry the Holy Roman Emperor and instead devoted her life to spiritual works. Corresponding with the Pope, she established the [[Knights of the Cross with the Red Star]] in 1233, the first [[Military order (society)|military order]] in the Kingdom of Bohemia. Four other military orders were present in Bohemia: the [[Order of St. John of Jerusalem]] from c.&nbsp;1160; the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]] from the late 12th century; the [[Teutonic Order]] from c.&nbsp;1200\u20131421; and the [[Knights Templar]] from 1232 to 1312.<ref>[http://www.valka.cz/clanek_11869.html Ryt\u00ed\u0159sk\u00e9 \u0159\u00e1dy a \u010cechy]</ref>\n\n[[File:Codex Manesse Wenzel II. von B\u00f6hmen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] as depicted in the ''[[Codex Manesse]]'']]\n\nThe 13th century was the most dynamic period of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid reign]] over [[Bohemia]]. German Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]'s preoccupation with Mediterranean affairs and the dynastic struggles known as the Great Interregnum (1254\u201373) weakened imperial authority in Central Europe, thus providing opportunities for P\u0159emyslid assertiveness. At the same time, the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions (1220\u201342)]] absorbed the attention of Bohemia's eastern neighbors, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]].\n\n[[Ottokar II of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Ottokar II]] (1253\u201378) married a German princess, [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia|Margaret of Babenberg]], and became duke of [[Austria]]. He thereby acquired [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], and part of [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]]. He conquered the rest of Styria, most of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], and parts of [[Carniola]]. He was called \"the king of iron and gold\" (iron because of his conquests, gold because of his wealth). He campaigned as far as [[Prussia]], where he defeated the pagan natives and in 1256, founded a city he named Kr\u00e1lovec in Czech, which later became [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]]).\n\nIn 1260, Ottokar defeated Hungary in the [[Battle of Kressenbrunn]], where more than 200,000 men clashed. He ruled an area from [[Austria]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. From 1273, however, [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] king [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolf]] began to reassert imperial authority, checking Ottokar's power. He also had problems with rebellious nobility in Bohemia. All of Ottokar's German possessions were lost in 1276, and in 1278 he was abandoned by part of the Czech nobility and died in the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] against Rudolf.\n\nOttokar was succeeded by his son King [[Wenceslaus II]], who was crowned King of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]] in 1300. Wenceslaus II's son [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]] was crowned King of Hungary a year later. At this time, the Kings of Bohemia ruled from Hungary to the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nThe 13th century was also a period of large-scale German immigration, during the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'', often encouraged by the P\u0159emyslid kings. The Germans populated towns and mining districts on the Bohemian periphery and in some cases formed German colonies in the interior of the Czech lands. St\u0159\u00edbro, [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]], N\u011bmeck\u00fd Brod (present-day [[Havl\u00ed\u010dk\u016fv Brod]]), and [[Jihlava]] were important German settlements. The Germans brought their own code of law \u2013 the ''{{lang|la|ius teutonicum}}'' \u2013 which formed the basis of the later commercial law of Bohemia and [[Moravia]]. Marriages between Czech nobles and Germans soon became commonplace.\n\n===14th century (\"Golden Age\")===\n[[File:WenceslausIImap-en.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Territory under the control of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty around 1301]]\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|header=[[Prague groschen]] issued between 1300 and 1526\n | align = left\n | image1 = Grossi pragenses revers.jpg\n | alt1 = Medieval coin\n | image2 = Grossi pragenses avers.jpg\n | alt2 = Medieval coin\n | width = 100\n}}\n\nThe 14th century \u2013 particularly the reign of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] (1342\u201378) \u2013 is considered the Golden Age of Czech history. In 1306, the P\u0159emyslid line died out and, after a series of dynastic wars, [[John of Bohemia|John, Count of Luxembourg]], was elected Bohemian king. He married [[Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292\u20131330)|Elisabeth]], the daughter of Wenceslaus II. He was succeeded as king in 1346 by his son, Charles IV, the second king from the [[House of Luxembourg]]. Charles was raised at the French court and was cosmopolitan in attitude.\n\nCharles IV strengthened the power and prestige of the Bohemian kingdom. In 1344 he elevated the bishopric of [[Prague]], making it an archbishopric and freeing it from the jurisdiction of [[Mainz]], and the archbishop was given the right to crown Bohemian kings. Charles curbed the Bohemian, Moravian, and Silesian nobility, and rationalized the provincial administration of Bohemia and Moravia. He created the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]], incorporating Moravia, [[Silesia]] and [[Lusatia]].\n\n[[File:Night view of the Castle and Charles Bridge, Prague - 8034.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Prague Castle]], the ancient seat of Bohemian dukes and kings, Roman kings and emperors, and after 1918 the office of the Czechoslovak and Czech presidents]]\n\nIn 1355 Charles was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The next year he issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], defining and codifying the process of [[Imperial election|election to the Imperial throne]], with the Bohemian king among the seven electors. Issuance of the Golden Bull together with the ensuing acquisition of the Brandenburg Electorate gave the Luxemburgs two votes in the [[Prince-elector|electoral college]]. Charles also made [[Prague]] into an Imperial capital.\n\nExtensive building projects undertaken by the king included the founding of the New Town southeast of the old city. The royal castle, [[Hrad\u010dany]], was rebuilt. Of particular significance was the founding of [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1348. Charles intended to make Prague into an international center of learning, and the university was divided into Czech, Polish, Saxon, and Bavarian \"nations\", each with one controlling vote. Charles University, however, would become the nucleus of intense Czech particularism.\n\nCharles died in 1378, and the Bohemian crown went to his son, [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslas IV]]. He had also been elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1376, in the first election since his father's Golden Bull. He was deposed from the Imperial throne in 1400, however, having never been crowned Emperor.  His half-brother, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], was eventually crowned Emperor in Rome in 1433, ruling until 1437, and he was the last male member of the House of Luxemburg.\n\n===15th century (Hussite movement)===\nThe [[Hussite]] movement (1402\u201385) was primarily a religious, as well as national, manifestation. As a religious reform movement (the so-called [[Bohemian Reformation]]), it represented a challenge to papal authority and an assertion of national autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs. The Hussites defeated four crusades from the Holy Roman Empire, and the movement is viewed by many as a part of the (worldwide) [[Protestant Reformation]]. Because many of warriors of the crusades were Germans, although many were also Hungarians and Catholic Czechs, the Hussite movement is seen as a Czech national movement. In modern times it acquired anti-imperial and anti-German associations and has sometimes been identified as a manifestation of a long-term ethnic Czech\u2013German conflict.\n\nHussitism began during the long reign of [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslas IV]] (1378\u20131419), a period of papal schism and concomitant anarchy in the Holy Roman Empire. It was precipitated by a controversy at [[Charles University in Prague]]. In 1403 [[Jan Hus]] became rector of the university. A reformist preacher, Hus espoused the anti-papal and anti-hierarchical teachings of [[John Wycliffe]] of England, often referred to as the \"Morning Star of the Reformation\". Hus' teaching was distinguished by its rejection of what he saw as the wealth, corruption, and hierarchical tendencies of the Roman Catholic Church. He advocated the Wycliffe doctrine of clerical purity and poverty, and insisted on the laity receiving [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|communion]] under both kinds, bread and wine. (The Roman Catholic Church in practice reserved the cup, or wine, for the clergy.) The more moderate followers of Hus, the [[Utraquism|Utraquists]], took their name from the Latin ''{{lang|la|sub utraque specie}}'', meaning \"under each kind\". The [[Taborite]]s, a more radical sect, soon formed, taking their name from the city of [[T\u00e1bor]], their stronghold in southern Bohemia. They rejected church doctrine and upheld the Bible as the sole authority in all matters of belief.\n\n[[File:Silver mine, Kutna Hora.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]], a medieval silver-mining centre, was once the second most important town of the kingdom.]]\nSoon after Hus assumed office, German professors of theology demanded the condemnation of Wycliffe's writings. Hus protested, receiving the support of the Czech element at the university. Having only one vote in policy decisions against three for the Germans, the Czechs were outvoted,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and the orthodox position was maintained. In subsequent years, the Czechs demanded a revision of the university charter, granting more adequate representation to the native Czech faculty. The university controversy was intensified by the vacillating position of the Bohemian king Wenceslas. His favoring of Germans in appointments to councillor and other administrative positions had aroused the nationalist sentiments of the Czech nobility and rallied them to Hus' defense. The German faculties had the support of [[Zbyn\u011bk Zaj\u00edc]], [[Archbishop of Prague]], and the German clergy. For political reasons, Wenceslas switched his support from the Germans to Hus and allied with the reformers. On 18 January 1409, Wenceslas issued the [[Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]: (as was the case at other major universities in Europe) the Czechs would have three votes; the others, a single vote. In consequence, German faculty and students left Charles University en masse in the thousands, and many ended up founding the [[University of Leipzig]].\n\nHus' victory was short lived. He preached against the sale of [[indulgence]]s, which lost him the support of the king, who had received a percentage of such sales. In 1412 Hus and his followers were suspended from the university and expelled from Prague. For two years the reformers served as [[itinerant minister|itinerant preachers]] throughout Bohemia. In 1414 Hus was summoned to the [[Council of Constance]] to defend his views. Imprisoned when he arrived, he was never given a chance to defend his ideas. The council condemned him as a heretic and [[death by burning|burned him at the stake]] in 1415.\n\n[[File:Jan Zizka Vitkov Prague CZ 007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan \u017di\u017eka]], the leader of the [[Hussite]]s]]\nHus's death sparked the [[Hussite Wars]], decades of religious warfare. [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], the pro-papal king of [[Hungary]] and successor to the Bohemian throne after the death of Wenceslas in 1419, failed repeatedly to gain control of the kingdom despite aid by Hungarian and German armies. Riots broke out in Prague. Led by a Czech yeoman, [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]], the Taborites streamed into the capital. Religious strife pervaded the entire kingdom and was particularly intense in the German-dominated towns. Hussite Czechs and [[Catholic Germans]] turned on each other; many were massacred, and many German survivors fled or were exiled to the rest of the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Sigismund led or instigated various crusades against Bohemia with the support of Hungarians and Bohemian Catholics.\n\nThe Hussite Wars followed a pattern. When a crusade was launched against Bohemia, moderate and radical Hussites would unite and defeat it. Once the threat was over, the Hussite armies would focus on raiding the land of Catholic sympathizers.  Many historians have painted the Hussites as religious fanatics; they fought in part for a nationalist purpose: to protect their land from a King and a Pope who did not recognize the right of the Hussites to exist. Zizka led armies to storm castles, monasteries, churches, and villages, expelling the Catholic clergy, expropriating ecclesiastical lands, or accepting conversions.\n\nDuring the struggle against Sigismund, Taborite armies penetrated into areas of modern-day [[Slovakia]] as well. Czech refugees from the religious wars in Bohemia settled there, and from 1438 to 1453 a Czech noble, [[John Jiskra of Brand\u00fds]], controlled most of southern Slovakia from the centers of Z\u00f3lyom (today [[Zvolen]]) and Kassa (today [[Ko\u0161ice]]). Thus Hussite doctrines and the Czech Bible were disseminated among the Slovaks, providing the basis for a future link between the Czechs and their Slovak neighbors.\n\n[[File:344Wagenburg der Hussiten.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|The Hussite [[wagon fort]]]]\n\nWhen Sigismund died in 1437, the Bohemian estates elected [[Albert II of Germany|Albert of Austria]] as his successor. Albert died and his son, [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]] \u2013 so called because he was born after his father's death \u2013 was acknowledged as king. During Ladislaus' minority, Bohemia was ruled by a regency composed of moderate reform nobles who were Utraquists. Internal dissension among the Czechs provided the primary challenge to the regency. A part of the Czech nobility remained Catholic and loyal to the pope. A Utraquist delegation to the [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]] in 1433 had negotiated a seeming reconciliation with the Catholic Church. The [[Compacts of Basel]] accepted the basic tenets of Hussitism expressed in the Four Articles of Prague: communion under both kinds; free preaching of the Gospels; expropriation of church land; and exposure and punishment of public sinners. The pope, however, rejected the compact, thus preventing the reconciliation of Czech Catholics with the Utraquists.\n\n[[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], later to become the \"national\" king of Bohemia, emerged as leader of the Utraquist regency. George installed another Utraquist, [[John of Rokycan]], as archbishop of Prague and succeeded in uniting the more radical Taborites with the Czech Reformed Church. The Catholic party was driven out of Prague. After Ladislaus died of [[leukemia]] in 1457, the following year the Bohemian estates elected George of Pod\u011bbrady as king. Although George was noble-born, he was not a successor of royal dynasty; his election to the monarchy was not recognised by the Pope, or any other European monarchs.\n\nGeorge sought to establish a \"Charter of a [[Universal Peace Union]].\" He believed that all monarchs should work for a sustainable peace on the principle of national sovereignty of states, principles of non-interference, and solving problems and disputes before an International Tribunal. Also, Europe should unite to fight the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. States would have one vote each, with a leading role for France. George did not see a specific role for Papal authority.{{citation needed |date=August 2011}}\n\nCzech Catholic nobles joined in the League of Zelena Hora in 1465, challenging the authority of George of Pod\u011bbrady; the next year, [[Pope Paul II]] excommunicated George. The [[Bohemian War (1468-1478)]] pitted Bohemia against [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Frederick III of Habsburg]], and the Hungarian forces occupied most of Moravia. George of Pod\u011bbrady died in 1471.\n\n===After 1471: Jagiellonian and Habsburg rule===\n{{further|Czech lands: 1526\u20131648|Czech lands: 1648\u20131867|Czech lands: 1867\u20131918}}\n[[File:CeskySnem.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.7|The Bohemian Diet in 1564]]\n[[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich B\u00f6hmen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia by [[Hugo Gerard Str\u00f6hl]]]]\n\nUpon the death of the Hussite king, the Bohemian estates elected a Polish prince [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus Jagiellon]] as king, who negotiated the [[Peace of Olomouc]] in 1479. In 1490 he also became king of Hungary, and the Polish Jagellonian line ruled both Bohemia and Hungary. The Jagellonians governed Bohemia as absentee monarchs; their influence in the kingdom was minimal, and effective government fell to the regional nobility. Czech Catholics accepted the Compact of Basel in 1485 and were reconciled with the Utraquists. The Bohemian estrangement from the Empire continued after Vladislav had succeeded [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] in 1490 and both the Bohemian and the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian kingdom]] were held in [[personal union]]. Not considered an [[Imperial State]], the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were not part of the [[Imperial Circle]]s established by the 1500 [[Imperial Reform]].\n\nIn 1526 Vladislav's son, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis]], was decisively defeated by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] and subsequently died. As a result, the Turks conquered part of the Kingdom of Hungary, and the rest (mainly present-day Slovakia territory) came under Habsburg rule under the terms of King Louis' marriage contract. The Bohemian estates elected [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian Archduke]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], younger brother of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], to succeed Louis as king of Bohemia. Thus began almost four centuries of Habsburg rule for both Bohemia and Slovakia.\n\nThe incorporation of Bohemia into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] against the resistance of the local [[Protestant]] nobility sparked the 1618 [[Defenestrations of Prague|Defenestration of Prague]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Their defeat at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620 put an end to the Bohemian autonomy movement.\n\n=== Defeat and dissolution ===\n[[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich B\u00f6hmen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Hugo Gerard Str\u00f6hl|Str\u00f6hl's]] unofficial [[Work of art|artwork]] of the Coat of arms of the kingdom (with the [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]], [[Bohemian Crown Jewels]] part)]]\n\nIn 1740 the [[Prussian Army]] conquered Bohemian [[Silesia]] in the [[Silesian Wars]] and forced [[Maria Theresa]] in 1742 to cede the majority of Silesia, except the southernmost area with the duchies of Cieszyn, Krnov and Opava, to [[Prussia]]. In 1756 Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] faced an enemy coalition led by Austria, when Maria Theresa was preparing for war with Prussia to reclaim Silesia. The Prussian army conquered [[Saxony]] and in 1757 invaded Bohemia. In the [[Battle of Prague (1757)]] they defeated the Habsburgs and subsequently occupied Prague. More than one quarter of Prague was destroyed and the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] suffered heavy damage. In the [[Battle of Kol\u00edn]], however, Frederick lost and had to vacate Prague and retreat from Bohemia.\n\nWith the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Bohemian kingdom was incorporated into the now two years old [[Austrian Empire]] and the royal title retained alongside the title of [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Emperor]]. In the course of the 1867 [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]] the provinces of Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia became ''[[Imperial and Royal|k. k.]]'' crown lands of [[Cisleithania]]. The Bohemian Kingdom officially ceased to exist in 1918 by transformation into the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Republic]].\n\nThe current Czech Republic consisting of Bohemia, Moravia and [[Czech Silesia]] still uses most of the symbols of the Kingdom of Bohemia: a two-tailed lion in its coat-of-arms, red-white strips in the [[Flag of the Czech Republic|state flag]] and the [[Prague Castle|royal castle]] as the [[President of Czechia|president's]] office.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Bohemia rail map 1883 Rivnac.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Railway network of Bohemia in 1883]]\nBohemia was among the first countries in Europe to become industrialized. Mining of tin and silver began in [[Ore mountains]] in early 12th century.\n\n==Lands of the Bohemian Crown==\n[[File:Locator Lands of the Bohemian Crown within the Holy Roman Empire (1618).svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Lands of the Bohemian Crown in 1618]]\n{{further|Lands of the Bohemian Crown}}\n[[Bohemia]] proper (''\u010cechy'') with the [[County of Kladsko]] (''Hrabstv\u00ed kladsk\u00e9'') was the main area of the Kingdom of Bohemia. The [[Egerland]] (''Chebsko'') was ultimately obtained by King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] between 1291 and 1305; given in pawn to Bohemia by King [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV of Germany]] in 1322 and subsequently joined in personal union with Bohemia proper. In 1348 [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] created the '''Crown of Bohemia''' (''Koruna \u010desk\u00e1''), together with the incorporated provinces:\n\n* the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] (''Markrabstv\u00ed moravsk\u00e9''), acquired by [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] and [[Slavn\u00edk dynasty|Slavn\u00edk]] Bohemian rulers after the 955 [[Battle of Lechfeld]], lost in 999 to [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Poland]] and reconquered by Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] in 1019/1029 (uncertain dating);\n* [[Upper Lusatia]] (''Horn\u00ed Lu\u017eice''), incorporated by Charles' father King [[John of Bohemia]] in 1319 ([[Bautzen]] Land) and 1329 ([[G\u00f6rlitz]]), and [[Lower Lusatia]] (''Doln\u00ed Lu\u017eice'', former [[March of Lusatia]]), acquired by Charles IV from the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] duke [[Otto V, Duke of Bavaria|Otto V of Bavaria]] in 1367. The [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] ceded the Lusatias to the [[Electorate of Saxony]] by the 1635 [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]];\n* the Duchies of [[Silesia]] (''Slezsko''), acquired by the 1335 [[Treaty of Trentschin]] between King John of Bohemia and King [[Casimir III of Poland]]. Queen [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] lost Silesia in 1742 to the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king [[Frederick the Great]] by the [[Treaty of Breslau]], with the exception of [[Austrian Silesia]].\n* the northern part of the [[Upper Palatinate]] (\"[[Bohemian Palatinate]]\") at [[Sulzbach-Rosenberg|Sulzbach]], incorporated into the Bohemian crown by Charles IV in 1355. Charles exchanged parts of this territory for Brandenburg in 1373, while his son [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]] lost the rest in 1400 to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] under King [[Rupert of Germany]];\n* the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg Electorate]], acquired in 1373 by Charles IV from the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] duke [[Otto V, Duke of Bavaria|Otto V of Bavaria]].

It was an [[Imperial State]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Bohemian king]] was a [[prince-elector]] of the empire. The kings of Bohemia, besides [[Bohemia]] itself, also ruled other [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|lands belonging to the Bohemian Crown]], which at various times included [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lusatia]], and parts of [[Saxony]], [[Brandenburg]], and [[Bavaria]].\n\nThe kingdom was established by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]] in the 12th century from the [[Duchy of Bohemia]], later ruled by the [[House of Luxembourg]], the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]], and since 1526 by the [[House of Habsburg]] and its successor house [[Habsburg-Lorraine]]. Numerous kings of Bohemia were also elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the capital [[Prague]] was the imperial seat in the late 14th century, and at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the territory became part of the Habsburg [[Austrian Empire]], and subsequently the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] from 1867. Bohemia retained its name and formal status as a separate Kingdom of Bohemia until 1918, known as a crown land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and its capital Prague was one of the empire's leading cities. The Czech language (called the Bohemian language in English usage until the 19th century)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radio.cz/en/section/letter/from-bohemia-to-czechia|title=From Bohemia to Czechia|last=\u0160itler|first=Ji\u0159\u00ed|date=July 12, 2016|website=Radio Prague|access-date=June 27, 2019}}</ref> was the main language of the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] and the nobility until 1627 (after the [[Bohemian Revolt]] was suppressed). German was then formally made equal with Czech and eventually prevailed as the language of the Diet until the [[Czech National Revival]] in the 19th century. German was also widely used as the language of administration in many towns after the return of Germans [[Ostsiedlung|immigrated and populated]] [[Sudetenland|some areas of the country]] in the 13th century after the [[Migration Period]]. The royal court used the Czech, Latin, and German languages, depending on the ruler and period.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], both the Kingdom and Empire were dissolved. Bohemia became the core part of the newly formed [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]].\n\n==History==\n===13th century (growth)===\nAlthough some former rulers of Bohemia had enjoyed a non-hereditary royal title during the 11th and 12th centuries ([[Vratislaus II of Bohemia|Vratislaus II]], [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus II]]), the kingdom was formally established in 1198 by [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Ottokar I]], who had his status acknowledged by [[Philip of Swabia]], elected [[King of the Romans]], in return for his support against the rival Emperor [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]]. In 1204 Ottokar's royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by [[Pope Innocent III]]. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] issued by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], elevating the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] to [[Realm|Kingdom]] status.\n\nUnder these terms, the Czech king was to be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the bishop of [[Prague]] was revoked. The king's successor was his son [[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I]], from his second marriage.\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmen unter Ottokar II.png|thumb|left|upright|Territories ruled by [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] in 1273]]\n[[File:Nejstar\u0161\u00ed dochovan\u00e9 barevn\u00e9 vyobrazen\u00ed znaku \u010cech, hrad Gozzoburg v Krem\u017ei.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|The oldest depiction of coat of arms of Bohemia, castle Gozzoburg in [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]]]]\n\nWenceslaus I's sister [[Agnes of Bohemia|Agnes]], later canonized, was an extraordinarily courageous and energetic woman for her time; she refused to marry the Holy Roman Emperor and instead devoted her life to spiritual works. Corresponding with the Pope, she established the [[Knights of the Cross with the Red Star]] in 1233, the first [[Military order (society)|military order]] in the Kingdom of Bohemia. Four other military orders were present in Bohemia: the [[Order of St. John of Jerusalem]] from c.&nbsp;1160; the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]] from the late 12th century; the [[Teutonic Order]] from c.&nbsp;1200\u20131421; and the [[Knights Templar]] from 1232 to 1312.<ref>[http://www.valka.cz/clanek_11869.html Ryt\u00ed\u0159sk\u00e9 \u0159\u00e1dy a \u010cechy]</ref>\n\n[[File:Codex Manesse Wenzel II. von B\u00f6hmen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] as depicted in the ''[[Codex Manesse]]'']]\n\nThe 13th century was the most dynamic period of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid reign]] over [[Bohemia]]. German Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]'s preoccupation with Mediterranean affairs and the dynastic struggles known as the Great Interregnum (1254\u201373) weakened imperial authority in Central Europe, thus providing opportunities for P\u0159emyslid assertiveness. At the same time, the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions (1220\u201342)]] absorbed the attention of Bohemia's eastern neighbors, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]].\n\n[[Ottokar II of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Ottokar II]] (1253\u201378) married a German princess, [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia|Margaret of Babenberg]], and became duke of [[Austria]]. He thereby acquired [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], and part of [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]]. He conquered the rest of Styria, most of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], and parts of [[Carniola]]. He was called \"the king of iron and gold\" (iron because of his conquests, gold because of his wealth). He campaigned as far as [[Prussia]], where he defeated the pagan natives and in 1256, founded a city he named Kr\u00e1lovec in Czech, which later became [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]]).\n\nIn 1260, Ottokar defeated Hungary in the [[Battle of Kressenbrunn]], where more than 200,000 men clashed. He ruled an area from [[Austria]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. From 1273, however, [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] king [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolf]] began to reassert imperial authority, checking Ottokar's power. He also had problems with rebellious nobility in Bohemia. All of Ottokar's German possessions were lost in 1276, and in 1278 he was abandoned by part of the Czech nobility and died in the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] against Rudolf.\n\nOttokar was succeeded by his son King [[Wenceslaus II]], who was crowned King of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]] in 1300. Wenceslaus II's son [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]] was crowned King of Hungary a year later. At this time, the Kings of Bohemia ruled from Hungary to the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nThe 13th century was also a period of large-scale German immigration, during the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'', often encouraged by the P\u0159emyslid kings. The Germans populated towns and mining districts on the Bohemian periphery and in some cases formed German colonies in the interior of the Czech lands. St\u0159\u00edbro, [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]], N\u011bmeck\u00fd Brod (present-day [[Havl\u00ed\u010dk\u016fv Brod]]), and [[Jihlava]] were important German settlements. The Germans brought their own code of law \u2013 the ''{{lang|la|ius teutonicum}}'' \u2013 which formed the basis of the later commercial law of Bohemia and [[Moravia]]. Marriages between Czech nobles and Germans soon became commonplace.\n\n===14th century (\"Golden Age\")===\n[[File:WenceslausIImap-en.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Territory under the control of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty around 1301]]\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|header=[[Prague groschen]] issued between 1300 and 1526\n | align = left\n | image1 = Grossi pragenses revers.jpg\n | alt1 = Medieval coin\n | image2 = Grossi pragenses avers.jpg\n | alt2 = Medieval coin\n | width = 100\n}}\n\nThe 14th century \u2013 particularly the reign of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] (1342\u201378) \u2013 is considered the Golden Age of Czech history. In 1306, the P\u0159emyslid line died out and, after a series of dynastic wars, [[John of Bohemia|John, Count of Luxembourg]], was elected Bohemian king. He married [[Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292\u20131330)|Elisabeth]], the daughter of Wenceslaus II. He was succeeded as king in 1346 by his son, Charles IV, the second king from the [[House of Luxembourg]]. Charles was raised at the French court and was cosmopolitan in attitude.\n\nCharles IV strengthened the power and prestige of the Bohemian kingdom. In 1344 he elevated the bishopric of [[Prague]], making it an archbishopric and freeing it from the jurisdiction of [[Mainz]], and the archbishop was given the right to crown Bohemian kings. Charles curbed the Bohemian, Moravian, and Silesian nobility, and rationalized the provincial administration of Bohemia and Moravia. He created the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]], incorporating Moravia, [[Silesia]] and [[Lusatia]].\n\n[[File:Night view of the Castle and Charles Bridge, Prague - 8034.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Prague Castle]], the ancient seat of Bohemian dukes and kings, Roman kings and emperors, and after 1918 the office of the Czechoslovak and Czech presidents]]\n\nIn 1355 Charles was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The next year he issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], defining and codifying the process of [[Imperial election|election to the Imperial throne]], with the Bohemian king among the seven electors. Issuance of the Golden Bull together with the ensuing acquisition of the Brandenburg Electorate gave the Luxemburgs two votes in the [[Prince-elector|electoral college]]. Charles also made [[Prague]] into an Imperial capital.\n\nExtensive building projects undertaken by the king included the founding of the New Town southeast of the old city. The royal castle, [[Hrad\u010dany]], was rebuilt. Of particular significance was the founding of [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1348. Charles intended to make Prague into an international center of learning, and the university was divided into Czech, Polish, Saxon, and Bavarian \"nations\", each with one controlling vote. Charles University, however, would become the nucleus of intense Czech particularism.\n\nCharles died in 1378, and the Bohemian crown went to his son, [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslas IV]]. He had also been elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1376, in the first election since his father's Golden Bull. He was deposed from the Imperial throne in 1400, however, having never been crowned Emperor.  His half-brother, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], was eventually crowned Emperor in Rome in 1433, ruling until 1437, and he was the last male member of the House of Luxemburg.\n\n===15th century (Hussite movement)===\nThe [[Hussite]] movement (1402\u201385) was primarily a religious, as well as national, manifestation. As a religious reform movement (the so-called [[Bohemian Reformation]]), it represented a challenge to papal authority and an assertion of national autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs. The Hussites defeated four crusades from the Holy Roman Empire, and the movement is viewed by many as a part of the (worldwide) [[Protestant Reformation]]. Because many of warriors of the crusades were Germans, although many were also Hungarians and Catholic Czechs, the Hussite movement is seen as a Czech national movement. In modern times it acquired anti-imperial and anti-German associations and has sometimes been identified as a manifestation of a long-term ethnic Czech\u2013German conflict.\n\nHussitism began during the long reign of [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslas IV]] (1378\u20131419), a period of papal schism and concomitant anarchy in the Holy Roman Empire. It was precipitated by a controversy at [[Charles University in Prague]]. In 1403 [[Jan Hus]] became rector of the university. A reformist preacher, Hus espoused the anti-papal and anti-hierarchical teachings of [[John Wycliffe]] of England, often referred to as the \"Morning Star of the Reformation\". Hus' teaching was distinguished by its rejection of what he saw as the wealth, corruption, and hierarchical tendencies of the Roman Catholic Church. He advocated the Wycliffe doctrine of clerical purity and poverty, and insisted on the laity receiving [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|communion]] under both kinds, bread and wine. (The Roman Catholic Church in practice reserved the cup, or wine, for the clergy.) The more moderate followers of Hus, the [[Utraquism|Utraquists]], took their name from the Latin ''{{lang|la|sub utraque specie}}'', meaning \"under each kind\". The [[Taborite]]s, a more radical sect, soon formed, taking their name from the city of [[T\u00e1bor]], their stronghold in southern Bohemia. They rejected church doctrine and upheld the Bible as the sole authority in all matters of belief.\n\n[[File:Silver mine, Kutna Hora.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]], a medieval silver-mining centre, was once the second most important town of the kingdom.]]\nSoon after Hus assumed office, German professors of theology demanded the condemnation of Wycliffe's writings. Hus protested, receiving the support of the Czech element at the university. Having only one vote in policy decisions against three for the Germans, the Czechs were outvoted,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and the orthodox position was maintained. In subsequent years, the Czechs demanded a revision of the university charter, granting more adequate representation to the native Czech faculty. The university controversy was intensified by the vacillating position of the Bohemian king Wenceslas. His favoring of Germans in appointments to councillor and other administrative positions had aroused the nationalist sentiments of the Czech nobility and rallied them to Hus' defense. The German faculties had the support of [[Zbyn\u011bk Zaj\u00edc]], [[Archbishop of Prague]], and the German clergy. For political reasons, Wenceslas switched his support from the Germans to Hus and allied with the reformers. On 18 January 1409, Wenceslas issued the [[Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]: (as was the case at other major universities in Europe) the Czechs would have three votes; the others, a single vote. In consequence, German faculty and students left Charles University en masse in the thousands, and many ended up founding the [[University of Leipzig]].\n\nHus' victory was short lived. He preached against the sale of [[indulgence]]s, which lost him the support of the king, who had received a percentage of such sales. In 1412 Hus and his followers were suspended from the university and expelled from Prague. For two years the reformers served as [[itinerant minister|itinerant preachers]] throughout Bohemia. In 1414 Hus was summoned to the [[Council of Constance]] to defend his views. Imprisoned when he arrived, he was never given a chance to defend his ideas. The council condemned him as a heretic and [[death by burning|burned him at the stake]] in 1415.\n\n[[File:Jan Zizka Vitkov Prague CZ 007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan \u017di\u017eka]], the leader of the [[Hussite]]s]]\nHus's death sparked the [[Hussite Wars]], decades of religious warfare. [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], the pro-papal king of [[Hungary]] and successor to the Bohemian throne after the death of Wenceslas in 1419, failed repeatedly to gain control of the kingdom despite aid by Hungarian and German armies. Riots broke out in Prague. Led by a Czech yeoman, [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]], the Taborites streamed into the capital. Religious strife pervaded the entire kingdom and was particularly intense in the German-dominated towns. Hussite Czechs and [[Catholic Germans]] turned on each other; many were massacred, and many German survivors fled or were exiled to the rest of the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Sigismund led or instigated various crusades against Bohemia with the support of Hungarians and Bohemian Catholics.\n\nThe Hussite Wars followed a pattern. When a crusade was launched against Bohemia, moderate and radical Hussites would unite and defeat it. Once the threat was over, the Hussite armies would focus on raiding the land of Catholic sympathizers.  Many historians have painted the Hussites as religious fanatics; they fought in part for a nationalist purpose: to protect their land from a King and a Pope who did not recognize the right of the Hussites to exist. Zizka led armies to storm castles, monasteries, churches, and villages, expelling the Catholic clergy, expropriating ecclesiastical lands, or accepting conversions.\n\nDuring the struggle against Sigismund, Taborite armies penetrated into areas of modern-day [[Slovakia]] as well. Czech refugees from the religious wars in Bohemia settled there, and from 1438 to 1453 a Czech noble, [[John Jiskra of Brand\u00fds]], controlled most of southern Slovakia from the centers of Z\u00f3lyom (today [[Zvolen]]) and Kassa (today [[Ko\u0161ice]]). Thus Hussite doctrines and the Czech Bible were disseminated among the Slovaks, providing the basis for a future link between the Czechs and their Slovak neighbors.\n\n[[File:344Wagenburg der Hussiten.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|The Hussite [[wagon fort]]]]\n\nWhen Sigismund died in 1437, the Bohemian estates elected [[Albert II of Germany|Albert of Austria]] as his successor. Albert died and his son, [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]] \u2013 so called because he was born after his father's death \u2013 was acknowledged as king. During Ladislaus' minority, Bohemia was ruled by a regency composed of moderate reform nobles who were Utraquists. Internal dissension among the Czechs provided the primary challenge to the regency. A part of the Czech nobility remained Catholic and loyal to the pope. A Utraquist delegation to the [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]] in 1433 had negotiated a seeming reconciliation with the Catholic Church. The [[Compacts of Basel]] accepted the basic tenets of Hussitism expressed in the Four Articles of Prague: communion under both kinds; free preaching of the Gospels; expropriation of church land; and exposure and punishment of public sinners. The pope, however, rejected the compact, thus preventing the reconciliation of Czech Catholics with the Utraquists.\n\n[[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], later to become the \"national\" king of Bohemia, emerged as leader of the Utraquist regency. George installed another Utraquist, [[John of Rokycan]], as archbishop of Prague and succeeded in uniting the more radical Taborites with the Czech Reformed Church. The Catholic party was driven out of Prague. After Ladislaus died of [[leukemia]] in 1457, the following year the Bohemian estates elected George of Pod\u011bbrady as king. Although George was noble-born, he was not a successor of royal dynasty; his election to the monarchy was not recognised by the Pope, or any other European monarchs.\n\nGeorge sought to establish a \"Charter of a [[Universal Peace Union]].\" He believed that all monarchs should work for a sustainable peace on the principle of national sovereignty of states, principles of non-interference, and solving problems and disputes before an International Tribunal. Also, Europe should unite to fight the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. States would have one vote each, with a leading role for France. George did not see a specific role for Papal authority.{{citation needed |date=August 2011}}\n\nCzech Catholic nobles joined in the League of Zelena Hora in 1465, challenging the authority of George of Pod\u011bbrady; the next year, [[Pope Paul II]] excommunicated George. The [[Bohemian War (1468-1478)]] pitted Bohemia against [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Frederick III of Habsburg]], and the Hungarian forces occupied most of Moravia. George of Pod\u011bbrady died in 1471.\n\n===After 1471: Jagiellonian and Habsburg rule===\n{{further|Czech lands: 1526\u20131648|Czech lands: 1648\u20131867|Czech lands: 1867\u20131918}}\n[[File:CeskySnem.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.7|The Bohemian Diet in 1564]]\n[[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich B\u00f6hmen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia by [[Hugo Gerard Str\u00f6hl]]]]\n\nUpon the death of the Hussite king, the Bohemian estates elected a Polish prince [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus Jagiellon]] as king, who negotiated the [[Peace of Olomouc]] in 1479. In 1490 he also became king of Hungary, and the Polish Jagellonian line ruled both Bohemia and Hungary. The Jagellonians governed Bohemia as absentee monarchs; their influence in the kingdom was minimal, and effective government fell to the regional nobility. Czech Catholics accepted the Compact of Basel in 1485 and were reconciled with the Utraquists. The Bohemian estrangement from the Empire continued after Vladislav had succeeded [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] in 1490 and both the Bohemian and the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian kingdom]] were held in [[personal union]]. Not considered an [[Imperial State]], the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were not part of the [[Imperial Circle]]s established by the 1500 [[Imperial Reform]].\n\nIn 1526 Vladislav's son, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis]], was decisively defeated by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] and subsequently died. As a result, the Turks conquered part of the Kingdom of Hungary, and the rest (mainly present-day Slovakia territory) came under Habsburg rule under the terms of King Louis' marriage contract. The Bohemian estates elected [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian Archduke]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], younger brother of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], to succeed Louis as king of Bohemia. Thus began almost four centuries of Habsburg rule for both Bohemia and Slovakia.\n\nThe incorporation of Bohemia into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] against the resistance of the local [[Protestant]] nobility sparked the 1618 [[Defenestrations of Prague|Defenestration of Prague]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Their defeat at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620 put an end to the Bohemian autonomy movement.\n\n=== Defeat and dissolution ===\n[[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich B\u00f6hmen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Hugo Gerard Str\u00f6hl|Str\u00f6hl's]] unofficial [[Work of art|artwork]] of the Coat of arms of the kingdom (with the [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]], [[Bohemian Crown Jewels]] part)]]\n\nIn 1740 the [[Prussian Army]] conquered Bohemian [[Silesia]] in the [[Silesian Wars]] and forced [[Maria Theresa]] in 1742 to cede the majority of Silesia, except the southernmost area with the duchies of Cieszyn, Krnov and Opava, to [[Prussia]]. In 1756 Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] faced an enemy coalition led by Austria, when Maria Theresa was preparing for war with Prussia to reclaim Silesia. The Prussian army conquered [[Saxony]] and in 1757 invaded Bohemia. In the [[Battle of Prague (1757)]] they defeated the Habsburgs and subsequently occupied Prague. More than one quarter of Prague was destroyed and the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] suffered heavy damage. In the [[Battle of Kol\u00edn]], however, Frederick lost and had to vacate Prague and retreat from Bohemia.\n\nWith the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Bohemian kingdom was incorporated into the now two years old [[Austrian Empire]] and the royal title retained alongside the title of [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Emperor]]. In the course of the 1867 [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]] the provinces of Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia became ''[[Imperial and Royal|k. k.]]'' crown lands of [[Cisleithania]]. The Bohemian Kingdom officially ceased to exist in 1918 by transformation into the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Republic]].\n\nThe current Czech Republic consisting of Bohemia, Moravia and [[Czech Silesia]] still uses most of the symbols of the Kingdom of Bohemia: a two-tailed lion in its coat-of-arms, red-white strips in the [[Flag of the Czech Republic|state flag]] and the [[Prague Castle|royal castle]] as the [[President of Czechia|president's]] office.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Bohemia rail map 1883 Rivnac.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Railway network of Bohemia in 1883]]\nBohemia was among the first countries in Europe to become industrialized.

Complexity of an integer n   is the    minimum number of steps required to get n, where at each step one can either calculate a sum or a product of any two previously obtained numbers.

Upper bound to complexity by new definition is 3*ln(n)\\ln(ln(n)).\n\n==Example==\nFor instance, the number 11 may be represented using eight ones:\n:11 = (1 + 1 + 1) &times; (1 + 1 + 1) + 1 + 1.\nHowever, it has no representation using seven or fewer ones. Therefore, its complexity is eight.\n\nThe complexities of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... are\n:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, ... {{OEIS| A005245}}\n\nThe smallest numbers with complexity 1, 2, 3, ... are\n:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 17, 22, 23, 41, 47, ... {{OEIS|A005520}}\n\nBy new approach, the number 11 be represented using for steps:\n:[1] 1+1 = 2\n:[2] 1+2 = 3\n:[3] 3*3 = 9\n:[4] 2+9 = 11\nFor proof that one can not get 11 less then 4 steps we check all numbers with complexity less then 4:\n:Complexity 0:   1\n:Complexity 1:   2\n:Complexity 2:   3, 4\n:Complexity 3:   5, 6, 8, 9, 16\n\nThe upper bound for complexity you can see in this link: http://nbashaev.pythonanywhere.com/integer_complexity/\n\nThe smallest numbers with complexity 1, 2, 3, ... are\n: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 23, 59, 211, 619.\nAlso, Mordosevich's hypothesis try to describes all of smallest numbers.\n\n==Upper and lower bounds==\nThe question of expressing integers in this way was originally considered by {{harvtxt|Mahler|Popken|1953}}. They asked for the largest number with a given complexity {{mvar|k}};<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Mahler | first1 = K. | author1-link = Kurt Mahler\n | last2 = Popken | first2 = J.\n | journal = Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde\n | mr = 0053986\n | pages = 1\u201315\n | title = On a maximum problem in arithmetic\n | volume = 1\n | year = 1953}}.</ref> later, Selfridge showed that this number is\n:<math>2^x3^{(k-2x)/3} \\text{ where } x = -k\\bmod 3.</math>\nFor example, when {{math|1=''k'' = 10}}, {{math|1=''x'' = 2}} and the largest integer that can be expressed using ten ones is {{math|1=2{{sup|2}}{{hsp}}3{{sup|2}} = 36}}. Its expression is\n:(1 + 1) &times; (1 + 1) &times; (1 + 1 + 1) &times; (1 + 1 + 1).\nThus, the complexity of an integer {{mvar|n}} is at least {{math|3{{hsp}}log{{sub|3}}{{hsp}}''n''}}.  The complexity of {{mvar|n}} is at most {{math|3{{hsp}}log{{sub|2}}{{hsp}}''n''}} (approximately {{math|4.755{{hsp}}log{{sub|3}}{{hsp}}''n''}}): an expression of this length for {{mvar|n}} can be found by applying [[Horner's method]] to the [[binary representation]] of {{mvar|n}}.<ref name=\"guy\">{{citation\n | last = Guy | first = Richard K. | authorlink = Richard K.

The smallest example of a number whose optimal expression is not of this form is 353942783. It is a [[prime number]], and therefore also disproves a conjecture of [[Richard K.

The weight of the dinar is 1 [[mithqal]] (4.25 grams).\n\nThe word ''dinar'' comes from the Latin word [[denarius]], which was a silver coin. The name \"dinar\" is also used for [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]], and [[Kidarite]] gold coins, though it is not known what the contemporary name was.\n\nThe first dinars were issued by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Under the dynasties that followed the use of the dinar spread from Islamic Spain to Central Asia.\n\n==Background==\n\nAlthough there was a dictum that the Byzantine [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] was not to be used outside of the [[Byzantine empire]]{{Citation needed|reason=The dictum needs to be referenced. Yet it seems irrelevant as the powers of Mesopotamia, Syria and Arabia, the heartlands of the Muslim revival, do pay tribute to the Roman Empire of Byzants, in spite of the anti-feudal sentiment of Islam prior to the Caliphate becoming an economic polity under Caliph al'Malik. The Islamic areas of the Caliphate are not yet perceived as being outside of the Empire.|date=December 2019}}, there was some trade that involved these coins which then did not get re-minted by the emperors minting operations, and quickly became worn. Towards the end of the 7th century CE, Arabic copies of solidi \u2013 dinars issued by the [[caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] (685\u2013705&nbsp;CE), who had access to supplies of gold from the [[Greater Upper Nile (region)|upper Nile]] \u2013 began to circulate in areas outside of the Byzantine empire. These corresponded in weight to only {{convert|20|carat|g}}, but matched with the weight of the worn solidi that were circulating in those areas at the time. The two coins circulated together in these areas for a time.<ref name=Porteous1969>Porteous 1969</ref>\n\n==First dated coins==\nThe first dated coins that can be assigned to the Muslims are copies of silver [[Dirhams]] of the [[Sassanian]] ruler [[Yazdegerd III]], struck during the [[Caliphate]] of [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman]]. These coins differ from the original ones in that an Arabic inscription is found in the obverse margins, normally reading \"in the Name of Allah\". The subsequent series was issued using types based on drachmas of [[Khosrau II]], whose coins probably represented a significant proportion of the currency in circulation. \n\nIn parallel with the later Khosrau-type Arab-Sassanian coins, first issued under the Well-Guided Caliphs of Islam, a more extensive series was struck with Khosrau's name replaced by that of the local Arab governor or, in two cases, that of the Caliph. Historical evidence makes it clear that most of these coins bear [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra dates]]. The earliest Muslim copper coins are anonymous and undated but a series exists which may have been issued during the Caliphates of Uthman or [[Ali]]. These are crude copies of Byzantine 12-[[nummus]] pieces of [[Heraclius]] from [[Alexandria]].\n\n==First silver dirham==\n{{main|Dirham}}\n\n[[File:Silver Dirham.png|thumb|180px|Silver dirham of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], minted at Balkh al-Baida in [[Hijri year|AH]] 111 (= 729/30 [[Common Era|CE]]).]]\n\nBy the year AH&nbsp;75 (695&nbsp;CE) [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] had decided on changes to the coinage. A scattering of patterned pieces in silver exist from this date, based on Sassanian prototypes but with distinctive Arabic reverses. This experiment, which maintained the Sassanian weight standard of 3.5\u20134.0 grams was not proceeded with, and in AH&nbsp;79 (698&nbsp;CE) a completely new type of silver coin was struck at 14 mints to a new nominal weight of 2.97 grams. Unlike the contemporary gold coinage, this figure does not seem to have been achieved in practice. The average weight of sixty undamaged specimens of AH&nbsp;79\u201384 is only 2.71 grams, a figure very close to that for a unique coin of AH&nbsp;79 struck with no mint name (as was the standard procedure for the gold dinars produced in Damascus). These new coins which bore the name of 'dirham', established the style of the Arab-Sassanian predecessors at 25 to 28&nbsp;mm in diameter. Their design is composed of Arabic inscriptions surrounded by circles and annulets. \n\nOn each side there is a three- or four-line legend with a single circular inscription. Outside this are three line circles with, at first, five annulets surrounding them.

The marginal legend states: \"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, he was sent with guidance and the religion of truth to make it prevail over every other religion, averse though the idolaters may be\" (Quran 9:33)\n\n==First gold dinar==\n\nThe gold coins were first struck to the contemporary standard of 4.4 grams and with one or more Arabic Standing figures on the obverse and an Arabic legend on the reverse. Dated coins exist from AH&nbsp;74 and are named as 'Dinars'. These experimental issues were replaced in AH&nbsp;77, except in North Africa and Spain, by completely epigraphical designs very similar to the designs adopted for the silver pieces but with a shorter reverse legend and no annulets or inner circles.

Dinars, halves and thirds were struck, all to the new weight standard. Later coins are dated by [[indiction]], from Indiction II (AH&nbsp;84\u201385) changing to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] date in Roman numerals in AH&nbsp;94 with Arabic phrases appearing in the field from AH&nbsp;97. In AH&nbsp;100, North Africa came into line with the eastern issues although the mint is named as [[Ifriqiya]]. The legends are shorter and the reverse has a new central inscription: \"In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate\".

The weight of the dinar is 1 [[mithqal]] (4.25 grams).\n\nThe word ''dinar'' comes from the Latin word [[denarius]], which was a silver coin. The name \"dinar\" is also used for [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]], and [[Kidarite]] gold coins, though it is not known what the contemporary name was.\n\nThe first dinars were issued by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Under the dynasties that followed the use of the dinar spread from Islamic Spain to Central Asia.\n\n==Background==\n\nAlthough there was a dictum that the Byzantine [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] was not to be used outside of the [[Byzantine empire]]{{Citation needed|reason=The dictum needs to be referenced. Yet it seems irrelevant as the powers of Mesopotamia, Syria and Arabia, the heartlands of the Muslim revival, do pay tribute to the Roman Empire of Byzants, in spite of the anti-feudal sentiment of Islam prior to the Caliphate becoming an economic polity under Caliph al'Malik. The Islamic areas of the Caliphate are not yet perceived as being outside of the Empire.|date=December 2019}}, there was some trade that involved these coins which then did not get re-minted by the emperors minting operations, and quickly became worn. Towards the end of the 7th century CE, Arabic copies of solidi \u2013 dinars issued by the [[caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] (685\u2013705&nbsp;CE), who had access to supplies of gold from the [[Greater Upper Nile (region)|upper Nile]] \u2013 began to circulate in areas outside of the Byzantine empire. These corresponded in weight to only {{convert|20|carat|g}}, but matched with the weight of the worn solidi that were circulating in those areas at the time. The two coins circulated together in these areas for a time.<ref name=Porteous1969>Porteous 1969</ref>\n\n==First dated coins==\nThe first dated coins that can be assigned to the Muslims are copies of silver [[Dirhams]] of the [[Sassanian]] ruler [[Yazdegerd III]], struck during the [[Caliphate]] of [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman]]. These coins differ from the original ones in that an Arabic inscription is found in the obverse margins, normally reading \"in the Name of Allah\". The subsequent series was issued using types based on drachmas of [[Khosrau II]], whose coins probably represented a significant proportion of the currency in circulation. \n\nIn parallel with the later Khosrau-type Arab-Sassanian coins, first issued under the Well-Guided Caliphs of Islam, a more extensive series was struck with Khosrau's name replaced by that of the local Arab governor or, in two cases, that of the Caliph. Historical evidence makes it clear that most of these coins bear [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra dates]]. The earliest Muslim copper coins are anonymous and undated but a series exists which may have been issued during the Caliphates of Uthman or [[Ali]]. These are crude copies of Byzantine 12-[[nummus]] pieces of [[Heraclius]] from [[Alexandria]].\n\n==First silver dirham==\n{{main|Dirham}}\n\n[[File:Silver Dirham.png|thumb|180px|Silver dirham of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], minted at Balkh al-Baida in [[Hijri year|AH]] 111 (= 729/30 [[Common Era|CE]]).]]\n\nBy the year AH&nbsp;75 (695&nbsp;CE) [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] had decided on changes to the coinage. A scattering of patterned pieces in silver exist from this date, based on Sassanian prototypes but with distinctive Arabic reverses. This experiment, which maintained the Sassanian weight standard of 3.5\u20134.0 grams was not proceeded with, and in AH&nbsp;79 (698&nbsp;CE) a completely new type of silver coin was struck at 14 mints to a new nominal weight of 2.97 grams. Unlike the contemporary gold coinage, this figure does not seem to have been achieved in practice. The average weight of sixty undamaged specimens of AH&nbsp;79\u201384 is only 2.71 grams, a figure very close to that for a unique coin of AH&nbsp;79 struck with no mint name (as was the standard procedure for the gold dinars produced in Damascus). These new coins which bore the name of 'dirham', established the style of the Arab-Sassanian predecessors at 25 to 28&nbsp;mm in diameter. Their design is composed of Arabic inscriptions surrounded by circles and annulets. \n\nOn each side there is a three- or four-line legend with a single circular inscription. Outside this are three line circles with, at first, five annulets surrounding them. The side normally taken as the obverse has as its central legend the Kalima or shahada: \"There is no god except Allah alone, there is no partner with Him.\" Around it is the mint and date formula reading \"In the Name of Allah: this Dirham was struck in [mint name e.g. Damascus] the year [e.g. AH&nbsp;79]\".

It was released physically on March 12, 2003 through [[Avex Trax]], and digitally distributed worldwide on September 14, 2006 by Avex Entertainment Inc. It is her first compilation release in two years since ''[[A Best]]''; it premiered three months after her sixth studio album ''[[Rainbow (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|Rainbow]]''. The compilation compiles [[pop ballad|ballad]]-inspired singles released by Hamasaki between 1998 and 2003, whilst the material is divided into new-arrangement remixes and the original versions. With all the tracks written by Hamasaki, it includes two new songs\u2014 \"Rainbow\", which served as the album's promotional single, and a cover version of Japanese singer [[Yumi Matsutoya]]'s 1975 track \"Sotsugy\u014d Shashin\".\n\nReleased in six formats featuring a photograph by JFKK, ''A Ballads'' received favorable reviews from music critics. Many praised the collection for including some of Hamasaki's best vocal work, and commended the songwriting. Minor criticism was aimed on the newer renditions of the original songs. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, reaching number one on the [[Oricon Albums Chart]], making it Hamasaki's second compilation and eighth album to reach the top spot. It was certified Million by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. The album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements.\n\n==Background and material==\nIn December 2002, Hamasaki released her sixth studio album ''[[Rainbow (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|Rainbow]]''. Early issues of the album included a code number and [[URL address]] that allowed customers to visit an exclusive website that promoted the album and listen to a 40-second demo of her unfinished song \"Rainbow\".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Rainbow|others=Ayumi Hamasaki|first=Ayumi|last=Hamasaki|year=2002|type=CD Album; Liner notes|publisher=[[Avex Trax]]|id=AVCD-17239|location=Japan}}</ref> During its promotion, [[Avex Trax]] and Hamasaki received over 100,000 messages from fans, telling them their opinions about the unfinished demo.

It is her first compilation release in two years since ''[[A Best]]''; it premiered three months after her sixth studio album ''[[Rainbow (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|Rainbow]]''. The compilation compiles [[pop ballad|ballad]]-inspired singles released by Hamasaki between 1998 and 2003, whilst the material is divided into new-arrangement remixes and the original versions. With all the tracks written by Hamasaki, it includes two new songs\u2014 \"Rainbow\", which served as the album's promotional single, and a cover version of Japanese singer [[Yumi Matsutoya]]'s 1975 track \"Sotsugy\u014d Shashin\".\n\nReleased in six formats featuring a photograph by JFKK, ''A Ballads'' received favorable reviews from music critics. Many praised the collection for including some of Hamasaki's best vocal work, and commended the songwriting. Minor criticism was aimed on the newer renditions of the original songs. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, reaching number one on the [[Oricon Albums Chart]], making it Hamasaki's second compilation and eighth album to reach the top spot. It was certified Million by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. The album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements.\n\n==Background and material==\nIn December 2002, Hamasaki released her sixth studio album ''[[Rainbow (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|Rainbow]]''.

Its density reaches 13.3 inhabitants per km \u00b2.\n\nThis region holds the largest population of [[Aymara people|Aymara]] <ref>http://transparencia.dgop.cl/OtrosAntecedentes/docs/Guia_asuntos_indigenas.pdf</ref> and a significant number of immigrants from neighboring [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] <ref>https://www.extranjeria.gob.cl/estadisticas-migratorias/</ref>. Included are those of [[Asia]]n descent, such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]; and [[Arab]]s from [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Syria]]. Most of the country's [[Afro-Chilean]]s live in the Arica province, descended from slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries <ref>http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-93990.html</ref>. There are a large number of [[Romani people|Roma people]] or Gypsies in the Arica province as well, originated from [[Eastern Europe]] in the late 19th century. <ref>http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/articles-123219_recurso_2.pdf</ref>\n\nAt the level of cities, the most populated are: [[Arica]], with 175,441 inhabitants and [[Putre]], with 1235 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\nThe region lies within the [[Norte Grande]] (''Far North'') [[Natural regions of Chile|natural region]]. It combines deserts, green valleys, the steep and volcanic [[Andes]] mountains, and the [[Altiplano]] (high plain) to the east. A narrow coastal strip of low-lying land no more than {{convert|2|km|0}} wide separates the Pacific's [[Nazca plate]] from the Andes. Its [[Parinacota (volcano)|Parinacota volcano]] is the region's highest elevation at {{convert|6348|m|0}} and lies on the northern border with Bolivia in [[Lauca National Park]].\n\n==Hydrology==\nThe region's two main rivers are the [[Lauca River|Lauca]], which drains into Bolivia's Coipasa salt flat ([[Lago Coipasa]]), and the [[Lluta River|Lluta]], which flows into the Pacific Ocean. [[Lake Chungar\u00e1]] at {{convert|4517|m|0}} above sea level ranks as one of the highest in the world.<ref name=\"CINVER-A&P\"/>\n\n==Climate==\nA desert climate dominates the region. Near the coast, cloudiness can limit the temperature swing throughout the day, but in other drier areas, temperatures can vary greatly as is typical in deserts. A marginal desert region can be found over {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, which sees milder temperatures and summer rains.<ref name=\"CINVER-A&P\"/>\n\n==Border dispute with Peru==\n{{Main|Chilean\u2013Peruvian maritime dispute}}\nOn January 26, 2007, Peru\u2019s government issued a protest against [[Chile]]\u2019s demarcation of the coastal frontier the two countries share. According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, the Chilean legislatures had endorsed a plan regarding the Arica y Parinacota region which did not comply with the current established territorial demarcation. Moreover, it is alleged that the proposed Chilean law included an assertion of [[sovereignty]] over {{convert|19000|sqm|0|abbr=on}} of land in Peru's [[Tacna Region]]. According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, Chile has defined a new region \"without respecting the Concordia demarcation.\"<ref name=\"xinhua\"/>\n\nFor its part, the Chilean government has asserted that the region in dispute is not a coastal site named Concordia, but instead refers to boundary stone No. 1, which is located to the northeast and 200 meters inland.<ref name=\"xinhua\">{{cite web |title= Peru protests against Chile's new definition of territory |publisher= Xinhua People\u2019s Daily online |url= http://english.people.com.cn/200701/27/eng20070127_345352.html | accessdate=27 January 2007}}</ref> A possible border dispute was averted when the Chilean Constitutional Court formally ruled on January 26, 2007, against the legislation.

The maritime boundary extends only to 80 nautical miles off of the coast.

Included are those of [[Asia]]n descent, such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]; and [[Arab]]s from [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Syria]]. Most of the country's [[Afro-Chilean]]s live in the Arica province, descended from slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries <ref>http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-93990.html</ref>.

A narrow coastal strip of low-lying land no more than {{convert|2|km|0}} wide separates the Pacific's [[Nazca plate]] from the Andes. Its [[Parinacota (volcano)|Parinacota volcano]] is the region's highest elevation at {{convert|6348|m|0}} and lies on the northern border with Bolivia in [[Lauca National Park]].\n\n==Hydrology==\nThe region's two main rivers are the [[Lauca River|Lauca]], which drains into Bolivia's Coipasa salt flat ([[Lago Coipasa]]), and the [[Lluta River|Lluta]], which flows into the Pacific Ocean. [[Lake Chungar\u00e1]] at {{convert|4517|m|0}} above sea level ranks as one of the highest in the world.<ref name=\"CINVER-A&P\"/>\n\n==Climate==\nA desert climate dominates the region.

She describes herself as spending nights in tears and prayer and being in this condition for several months. On June 26, 1842, she was [[baptize]]d by John Hobart in [[Casco Bay]] in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited Jesus to come again.

James later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We were married August 30, 1846, and from that hour to the present she has been my crown of rejoicing ...

N. Loughborough, who had seen White in vision 50 times since 1852, and her husband, James White, listed several physical characteristics that marked the visions:\n#\"In passing into vision, she gives three enrapturing shouts of \"Glory!\" which echo and re-echo, the second, and especially the third, fainter but more thrilling than the first, the voice resembling that of one quite a distance from you, and just going out of hearing.\"{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}} \n#For a few moments ''she would swoon'', having no strength.  Then she would be instantly ''filled with superhuman strength'', sometimes rising to her feet and walking about the room. She frequently moved hands, arms, and head in gestures that were free and graceful. But to whatever position she moved a hand or arm, it could not be hindered nor controlled by even the strongest person.  In 1845, she held her parents' 18.5 pound family Bible in her outstretched left hand for half an hour.  She weighed 80 pounds at the time.{{sfn|White|1985|p=92}} \n#''She did not breathe'' during the entire period of a vision that ranged ''from fifteen minutes to three hours''.  Yet, her pulse beat regularly and her countenance remained pleasant as in the natural state.{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n#''Her eyes were always open without blinking''; her head was raised, looking upward with a pleasant expression as if staring intently at some distant object.  Several physicians, at different times, conducted tests to check her lack of breathing and other physical phenomena.{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n#She was utterly ''unconscious of everything transpiring around her'', and viewed herself as removed from this world, and in the presence of heavenly beings.{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n#When she came out of vision, all seemed total darkness whether in the day time or a well-lighted room at night.  She would exclaim with a long-drawn sigh, as she took her first natural breath, \"D-a-r-k.\" She was then limp and strengthless.{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\nMrs. Martha Amadon added:  \"There was never an excitement among those present during a vision; nothing caused fear. It was a solemn, quiet scene.\"{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\n====First vision====\nIn December 1844, White allegedly experienced her first vision during a prayer meeting at the home of Mrs. Haines on Ocean Street in South Portland, Maine.\n\n<blockquote>At this time I visited one of our Advent sisters, and in the morning we bowed around the family altar. It was not an exciting occasion, and there were but five of us present, all females. While praying, the power of God came upon me as I never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God's glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City ...<ref>White, Arthur L. 1985, \"Chapter 7 \u2013 (1846\u20131847) Entering Marriage Life\", Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827\u20131862, page 56</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this vision the \"Advent people\" were traveling a high and dangerous path towards the city of New Jerusalem [heaven]. Their path was lit from behind by \"a bright (light) ... which an angel told me was the midnight cry.\" Some of the travelers grew weary and were encouraged by Jesus; others denied the light, the light behind them went out, and they fell \"off the path into the dark and wicked world below.\"<ref>White, Arthur L. 1985, \"Chapter 7 \u2013 (1846\u20131847) Entering Marriage Life\", Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827\u20131862, page 57</ref> The vision continued with a portrayal of Christ's second coming, following which the Advent people entered the [[New Jerusalem]]; and ended with her returning to earth feeling lonely, desolate and longing for that \"better world.\"\n \nAs Godfrey T. Anderson said, \"In effect, the vision assured the Advent believers of eventual triumph despite the immediate despair into which they had plunged.\"<ref>Godfrey T. Anderson, \"Sectarianism and Organisation, 1846\u20131864,\" in ''Adventism in America'': a History, ed. Gary Land (Berrien Springs: Andrews University Press, 1998), 31.</ref>\n\n====Second and third visions====\nIn February 1845, White allegedly experienced her second vision in [[Exeter, Maine]] known as the \"Bridegroom\" vision. Together with the third vision about the new earth, the visions \"gave continued meaning to the October 1844 experience and supported the developing sanctuary rationale. Additionally they played an important role in countering the spiritualizing views of many fanatical Adventists by portraying the Father and Jesus as literal beings and heaven as a physical place.\"<ref>Merlin D. Burt, \"The Historical Background, Interconnected Development, and Integration of the Doctrines of the Heavenly Sanctuary, the Sabbath, and Ellen G. White's Role in Sabbatarian Adventism from 1844\u20131849\", PhD, Andrews University, 2002, 170.</ref>\n\n====Public testimony====\nFearing people would not accept her testimony, White did not initially share her visions with the wider Millerite community. In a meeting at her parents' home when she received what she regarded as confirmation of her ministry:\n\n<blockquote>While praying, the thick darkness that had enveloped me was scattered, a bright light, like a ball of fire, came towards me, and as it fell upon me, my strength was taken away. I seemed to be in the presence of Jesus and the angels. Again it was repeated, 'Make known to others what I have revealed to you.'<ref>White, Arthur L. 1985, \"Chapter 7 \u2013 (1846\u20131847) Entering Marriage Life\", Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827\u20131862, page 63</ref></blockquote>\n\nSoon White was giving her testimony in public meetings \u2014 some of which she arranged herself \u2014 and in her regular Methodist class meetings in private homes.\n\n<blockquote>I arranged meetings with my young friends, some of whom were considerably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A number of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded to them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I determined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls, for whom I had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.<ref>Ellen G. White, ''Testimonies for the Church Vol.1'', (1855\u20131868)</ref></blockquote>\n\nNews of her visions spread and White was soon traveling and speaking to groups of Millerite followers in Maine and the surrounding area. Her visions were not publicized further afield until January 24, 1846, when her account of the first vision: \"Letter From Sister Harmon\" was published in the ''Day Star'', a Millerite paper published in Cincinnati, Ohio by Enoch Jacobs. White had written to Jacobs to encourage him and although she stated the letter was not written for publication,<ref>[http://text.egwwritings.org/publication.php?pubtype=Periodical&bookCode=DS&lang=en&collection=2&section=all&year=1846&month=March&day=14 Day Star. Letter from Sister Harmon, Falmouth Mass., Feb., 15, 1846]</ref> Jacobs printed it anyway. Through the next few years it was republished in various forms and is included as part of her first book, ''Christian Experience and Views'', published in 1851.\n\nTwo Millerites claimed to have had visions prior to White \u2013 [[William Foy|William Ellis Foy]] (1818\u20131893), and [[Hazen Foss]] (1818?\u20131893), White's brother-in-law.

One of the best examples of her personal counsels is found in a 9-volume series of books entitled ''[[Testimonies for the Church]]'', that contains edited testimonies published for the general edification of the church. The spoken and written versions of her visions played a significant part in establishing and shaping the organizational structure of the emerging Adventist Church. Her visions and writings continue to be used by church leaders in developing the church's policies and for [[Christian devotional literature|devotional]] reading.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn March 14, 1858, at Lovett's Grove, near [[Bowling Green, Ohio]], White received a vision while attending a funeral service. On that day James White wrote that \"God manifested His power in a wonderful manner\" adding that \"several had decided to keep the Lord's Sabbath and go with the people of God.\" In writing about the vision, she stated that she received practical instruction for church members, and more significantly, a cosmic sweep of the conflict \"between Christ and His angels, and Satan and his angels.\" Ellen White would expand upon this great controversy theme which would eventually culminate in the ''Conflict of the Ages'' series.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | title = My Christian Experience, Views, And Labors In Connection With The Rise And Progress Of The Third Angel's Message\n  | author = Ellen G.

Because of criticism from the evangelical community, in the 1940s and 1950s church leaders such as [[LeRoy Edwin Froom]] and Roy Allan Anderson attempted to help evangelicals understand Seventh-day Adventists better by engaging in extended dialogue that resulted in the publication of ''[[Questions on Doctrine]]'' (1956) that explained Adventist beliefs in evangelical language.\n\nEvangelical [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] of the [[Christian countercult movement|countercult]] [[Christian Research Institute]] \"rejected White's prophetic claims,\" yet saw her \"as a genuine Christian believer,\" unlike her contemporaries [[Joseph Smith]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]], and [[Charles Taze Russell]]. Kenneth Samples, a successor of Martin in his interaction with Adventism, also denies White's prophetic claims yet \"believe[s] she, at minimum, had some good biblical and theological instincts.\"<ref name=\"SamplesQOD\">[[Kenneth Samples|Samples, Kenneth]] (2007). \"[http://qod.andrews.edu/docs/08_kenneth_samples.pdf Evangelical Reflections on Seventh-day Adventism: Yesterday and Today].\" [[Questions on Doctrine#50th anniversary conference|''Questions on Doctrine'' 50th anniversary conference]]</ref>\n\n===Adventist statement of belief about the ''Spirit of Prophecy''===\n{{Main|Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)}}\nWhite's writings are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)|Spirit of Prophecy]]'' by Adventists. The term is dually applied to the [[Holy Spirit]] which inspired her writings.\n\nEarly Sabbatarian Adventists, many of whom had come out of the [[Christian Connexion]], were anti-creedal. However, as early as 1872 Adventists produced a statement of Adventist beliefs. This list was refined during the 1890s and formally included in the SDA Yearbook in 1931 with 22 points. In 1980 a statement of 27 Fundamental Beliefs was adopted, to which one was added to in 2005 to make the current list of [[28 Fundamentals|fundamental beliefs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Seventh-day Adventist 28 Fundamental Beliefs|url=https://www.adventist.org/fileadmin/adventist.org/files/articles/official-statements/28Beliefs-Web.pdf|website=Official Site of the Seventh-day Adventist world church|publisher=General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}</ref> White is referenced in the fundamental belief on spiritual gifts. This doctrinal statement says:\n\n<blockquote>One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. ({{bibleverse||Joel|2:28,29|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|2:14\u201321|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Hebrews|1:1\u20133|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:17|NIV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|19:10|NIV}}.)<ref>[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/ Fundamental Beliefs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{See also|Inspiration of Ellen G. White#Sources and plagiarism charges}}\nCritics have voiced doubts as to the reliability of Ellen G. White as a true prophet and the authenticity of her visions.\n[[Ronald Numbers|Ronald L. Numbers]], an American historian of science and a graduate of the [[Loma Linda University School of Medicine]], criticized Mrs. White for her views on health and masturbation, the gist of his criticism being that she followed the [[Consensus (medical)|medical consensus]] of her epoch.<ref name=numbers>{{cite book|last1=Numbers|first1=Ronald L.|authorlink1=Ronald Numbers|title=Prophetess of health: a study of Ellen G.

From the appearance of Sylvester Graham's ''Lecture to Young Men on Chastity'' in 1834 this subject had played an integral and highly visible role in health-reform literature. Alcott, Coles, Trail, and Jackson, among others, had all spoken out on the dangers of what they regarded as excessive or abnormal sexual activities, particularly masturbation, which was thought to cause a frightening array of pathological conditions ranging from dyspepsia and consumption to insanity and loss of spirituality. By carefully couching their appeal in humanitarian terms, they had largely avoided offending the sensibilities of a prudish public. Theirs was a genuinely moral crusade against what Jackson called ''\"the great, crying sin of our time.\"''}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Larson|first1= David|title= Revisiting Ellen White on Masturbation|url= https://spectrummagazine.org/node/851|access-date= 1 July 2019|journal= Spectrum|date= 6 August 2008|issn= 0890-0264|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061214/https://spectrummagazine.org/article/column/2008/08/06/revisiting-ellen-white-masturbation|archive-date= 7 January 2018}}</ref> Numbers argues that she [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] [[vitalism|vitalist]] writers (such as [[Horace Mann]] and Larkin B.

N. Loughborough, who had seen White in vision 50 times since 1852, and her husband, James White, listed several physical characteristics that marked the visions:\n#\"In passing into vision, she gives three enrapturing shouts of \"Glory!\" which echo and re-echo, the second, and especially the third, fainter but more thrilling than the first, the voice resembling that of one quite a distance from you, and just going out of hearing.\"{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}} \n#For a few moments ''she would swoon'', having no strength.  Then she would be instantly ''filled with superhuman strength'', sometimes rising to her feet and walking about the room. She frequently moved hands, arms, and head in gestures that were free and graceful. But to whatever position she moved a hand or arm, it could not be hindered nor controlled by even the strongest person.  In 1845, she held her parents' 18.5 pound family Bible in her outstretched left hand for half an hour.  She weighed 80 pounds at the time.{{sfn|White|1985|p=92}} \n#''She did not breathe'' during the entire period of a vision that ranged ''from fifteen minutes to three hours''.  Yet, her pulse beat regularly and her countenance remained pleasant as in the natural state.{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n#''Her eyes were always open without blinking''; her head was raised, looking upward with a pleasant expression as if staring intently at some distant object.  Several physicians, at different times, conducted tests to check her lack of breathing and other physical phenomena.{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n#She was utterly ''unconscious of everything transpiring around her'', and viewed herself as removed from this world, and in the presence of heavenly beings.{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n#When she came out of vision, all seemed total darkness whether in the day time or a well-lighted room at night.  She would exclaim with a long-drawn sigh, as she took her first natural breath, \"D-a-r-k.\" She was then limp and strengthless.{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\nMrs. Martha Amadon added:  \"There was never an excitement among those present during a vision; nothing caused fear. It was a solemn, quiet scene.\"{{sfn|White|1985|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\n====First vision====\nIn December 1844, White allegedly experienced her first vision during a prayer meeting at the home of Mrs. Haines on Ocean Street in South Portland, Maine.\n\n<blockquote>At this time I visited one of our Advent sisters, and in the morning we bowed around the family altar. It was not an exciting occasion, and there were but five of us present, all females. While praying, the power of God came upon me as I never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God's glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City ...<ref>White, Arthur L. 1985, \"Chapter 7 \u2013 (1846\u20131847) Entering Marriage Life\", Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827\u20131862, page 56</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this vision the \"Advent people\" were traveling a high and dangerous path towards the city of New Jerusalem [heaven]. Their path was lit from behind by \"a bright (light) ... which an angel told me was the midnight cry.\" Some of the travelers grew weary and were encouraged by Jesus; others denied the light, the light behind them went out, and they fell \"off the path into the dark and wicked world below.\"<ref>White, Arthur L. 1985, \"Chapter 7 \u2013 (1846\u20131847) Entering Marriage Life\", Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827\u20131862, page 57</ref> The vision continued with a portrayal of Christ's second coming, following which the Advent people entered the [[New Jerusalem]]; and ended with her returning to earth feeling lonely, desolate and longing for that \"better world.\"\n \nAs Godfrey T. Anderson said, \"In effect, the vision assured the Advent believers of eventual triumph despite the immediate despair into which they had plunged.\"<ref>Godfrey T. Anderson, \"Sectarianism and Organisation, 1846\u20131864,\" in ''Adventism in America'': a History, ed. Gary Land (Berrien Springs: Andrews University Press, 1998), 31.</ref>\n\n====Second and third visions====\nIn February 1845, White allegedly experienced her second vision in [[Exeter, Maine]] known as the \"Bridegroom\" vision. Together with the third vision about the new earth, the visions \"gave continued meaning to the October 1844 experience and supported the developing sanctuary rationale. Additionally they played an important role in countering the spiritualizing views of many fanatical Adventists by portraying the Father and Jesus as literal beings and heaven as a physical place.\"<ref>Merlin D. Burt, \"The Historical Background, Interconnected Development, and Integration of the Doctrines of the Heavenly Sanctuary, the Sabbath, and Ellen G. White's Role in Sabbatarian Adventism from 1844\u20131849\", PhD, Andrews University, 2002, 170.</ref>\n\n====Public testimony====\nFearing people would not accept her testimony, White did not initially share her visions with the wider Millerite community. In a meeting at her parents' home when she received what she regarded as confirmation of her ministry:\n\n<blockquote>While praying, the thick darkness that had enveloped me was scattered, a bright light, like a ball of fire, came towards me, and as it fell upon me, my strength was taken away. I seemed to be in the presence of Jesus and the angels. Again it was repeated, 'Make known to others what I have revealed to you.'<ref>White, Arthur L. 1985, \"Chapter 7 \u2013 (1846\u20131847) Entering Marriage Life\", Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827\u20131862, page 63</ref></blockquote>\n\nSoon White was giving her testimony in public meetings \u2014 some of which she arranged herself \u2014 and in her regular Methodist class meetings in private homes.\n\n<blockquote>I arranged meetings with my young friends, some of whom were considerably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A number of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded to them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I determined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls, for whom I had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.<ref>Ellen G. White, ''Testimonies for the Church Vol.1'', (1855\u20131868)</ref></blockquote>\n\nNews of her visions spread and White was soon traveling and speaking to groups of Millerite followers in Maine and the surrounding area. Her visions were not publicized further afield until January 24, 1846, when her account of the first vision: \"Letter From Sister Harmon\" was published in the ''Day Star'', a Millerite paper published in Cincinnati, Ohio by Enoch Jacobs. White had written to Jacobs to encourage him and although she stated the letter was not written for publication,<ref>[http://text.egwwritings.org/publication.php?pubtype=Periodical&bookCode=DS&lang=en&collection=2&section=all&year=1846&month=March&day=14 Day Star.

Through the next few years it was republished in various forms and is included as part of her first book, ''Christian Experience and Views'', published in 1851.\n\nTwo Millerites claimed to have had visions prior to White \u2013 [[William Foy|William Ellis Foy]] (1818\u20131893), and [[Hazen Foss]] (1818?\u20131893), White's brother-in-law.

One of the best examples of her personal counsels is found in a 9-volume series of books entitled ''[[Testimonies for the Church]]'', that contains edited testimonies published for the general edification of the church. The spoken and written versions of her visions played a significant part in establishing and shaping the organizational structure of the emerging Adventist Church. Her visions and writings continue to be used by church leaders in developing the church's policies and for [[Christian devotional literature|devotional]] reading.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn March 14, 1858, at Lovett's Grove, near [[Bowling Green, Ohio]], White received a vision while attending a funeral service. On that day James White wrote that \"God manifested His power in a wonderful manner\" adding that \"several had decided to keep the Lord's Sabbath and go with the people of God.\" In writing about the vision, she stated that she received practical instruction for church members, and more significantly, a cosmic sweep of the conflict \"between Christ and His angels, and Satan and his angels.\" Ellen White would expand upon this great controversy theme which would eventually culminate in the ''Conflict of the Ages'' series.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | title = My Christian Experience, Views, And Labors In Connection With The Rise And Progress Of The Third Angel's Message\n  | author = Ellen G.

The first home that she and her husband owned is now part of the Historic Adventist Village in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]], [[Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.adventistheritage.org Adventist Heritage Site]</ref> Her other homes are privately owned with the exception of her home in [[Cooranbong, New South Wales|Cooranbong]], Australia, which she named \"Sunnyside,\" and her last home in [[Saint Helena, California|Saint Helena]], [[California]], which she named \"[[Elmshaven (Ellen Gould White House)|Elmshaven]]\".<ref>[http://www.elmshaven.org Elmshaven website]</ref> These latter two homes are owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the \"Elmshaven\" home is also a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n\n===Avondale College===\nWhite inspired and guided the foundation of [[Avondale College]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteestate.org/about/egwbio.asp#avondale |title=Ellen G.

Avondale College is the main Seventh-day Adventist [[tertiary institution]] in the [[South Pacific Division of Seventh-day Adventists|South-Pacific Division]].\n\n==Biographical writings==\nEllen White wrote her own biography first published in 1860 as ''My Christian Experience, Views, and Labors, in Connection With the Rise and Progress of the Third Angel's Message.'' This she expanded in 1880 as ''Life Sketches of James White and Ellen G. White'' which was later expanded again by White and several authors who covered the remainder of her life, published in 1915 it remains in print as ''Life Sketches of Ellen G. White'' (abbreviated as LS).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/41.4 |title = Life Sketches of Ellen G. White}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1863458.Life_Sketches_of_Ellen_G_White |title = Life Sketches of Ellen G. White}}</ref>\n\nThe most comprehensive biography of White is an extensive six-volume work called \"Ellen G. White: A Biography\" written by her grandson, [[Arthur L. White]].  Thousands of articles and books have been written about various aspects of Ellen G. White's life and ministry. A large number of these can be found in the libraries at [[Loma Linda University]] and [[Andrews University]], the two primary Seventh-day Adventist institutions with major research collections about Adventism. An \"Encyclopedia of Ellen G. White\" is being produced by two faculty at Andrews University: Jerry Moon,<ref>[http://www.andrews.edu/~jmoon/ Jerry Moon Faculty bio] at Andrews University</ref> chair of the church history department, and Denis Fortin,<ref>[http://www.andrews.edu/~fortind/ Denis Fortin Faculty bio] at Andrews University</ref> dean of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary.\n\n===Theatre===\n\n''Red Books: Our Search for Ellen White'' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] about White, a co-founder of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and the various [[Inspiration of Ellen White|perceptions of her]] throughout the [[History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church|history of the church]]. It was produced by the Dramatic Arts Society of [[Pacific Union College]] in [[California]]. It was based on interviews collected from over 200 individuals. The title derives from [[List of Ellen White writings|White's books]], which were traditionally bound with a red cover.<ref>{{cite news|title=PUC theater turns attention to school's founder, Ellen White|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/article_163309a2-96a1-5bbc-b04c-c1ebf3a0f8c6.html|accessdate=December 21, 2010|newspaper=[[Napa Valley Register]]|date=March 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>[http://old.spectrummagazine.org/onlinecommunity/reviews/070425zytkoskee.html Red Books: Our Search for Ellen White.

Because of criticism from the evangelical community, in the 1940s and 1950s church leaders such as [[LeRoy Edwin Froom]] and Roy Allan Anderson attempted to help evangelicals understand Seventh-day Adventists better by engaging in extended dialogue that resulted in the publication of ''[[Questions on Doctrine]]'' (1956) that explained Adventist beliefs in evangelical language.\n\nEvangelical [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] of the [[Christian countercult movement|countercult]] [[Christian Research Institute]] \"rejected White's prophetic claims,\" yet saw her \"as a genuine Christian believer,\" unlike her contemporaries [[Joseph Smith]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]], and [[Charles Taze Russell]]. Kenneth Samples, a successor of Martin in his interaction with Adventism, also denies White's prophetic claims yet \"believe[s] she, at minimum, had some good biblical and theological instincts.\"<ref name=\"SamplesQOD\">[[Kenneth Samples|Samples, Kenneth]] (2007). \"[http://qod.andrews.edu/docs/08_kenneth_samples.pdf Evangelical Reflections on Seventh-day Adventism: Yesterday and Today].\" [[Questions on Doctrine#50th anniversary conference|''Questions on Doctrine'' 50th anniversary conference]]</ref>\n\n===Adventist statement of belief about the ''Spirit of Prophecy''===\n{{Main|Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)}}\nWhite's writings are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)|Spirit of Prophecy]]'' by Adventists. The term is dually applied to the [[Holy Spirit]] which inspired her writings.\n\nEarly Sabbatarian Adventists, many of whom had come out of the [[Christian Connexion]], were anti-creedal. However, as early as 1872 Adventists produced a statement of Adventist beliefs. This list was refined during the 1890s and formally included in the SDA Yearbook in 1931 with 22 points. In 1980 a statement of 27 Fundamental Beliefs was adopted, to which one was added to in 2005 to make the current list of [[28 Fundamentals|fundamental beliefs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Seventh-day Adventist 28 Fundamental Beliefs|url=https://www.adventist.org/fileadmin/adventist.org/files/articles/official-statements/28Beliefs-Web.pdf|website=Official Site of the Seventh-day Adventist world church|publisher=General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}</ref> White is referenced in the fundamental belief on spiritual gifts. This doctrinal statement says:\n\n<blockquote>One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. ({{bibleverse||Joel|2:28,29|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|2:14\u201321|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Hebrews|1:1\u20133|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:17|NIV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|19:10|NIV}}.)<ref>[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/ Fundamental Beliefs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{See also|Inspiration of Ellen G. White#Sources and plagiarism charges}}\nCritics have voiced doubts as to the reliability of Ellen G. White as a true prophet and the authenticity of her visions.\n[[Ronald Numbers|Ronald L. Numbers]], an American historian of science and a graduate of the [[Loma Linda University School of Medicine]], criticized Mrs. White for her views on health and masturbation, the gist of his criticism being that she followed the [[Consensus (medical)|medical consensus]] of her epoch.<ref name=numbers>{{cite book|last1=Numbers|first1=Ronald L.|authorlink1=Ronald Numbers|title=Prophetess of health: a study of Ellen G.

From the appearance of Sylvester Graham's ''Lecture to Young Men on Chastity'' in 1834 this subject had played an integral and highly visible role in health-reform literature. Alcott, Coles, Trail, and Jackson, among others, had all spoken out on the dangers of what they regarded as excessive or abnormal sexual activities, particularly masturbation, which was thought to cause a frightening array of pathological conditions ranging from dyspepsia and consumption to insanity and loss of spirituality. By carefully couching their appeal in humanitarian terms, they had largely avoided offending the sensibilities of a prudish public. Theirs was a genuinely moral crusade against what Jackson called ''\"the great, crying sin of our time.\"''}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Larson|first1= David|title= Revisiting Ellen White on Masturbation|url= https://spectrummagazine.org/node/851|access-date= 1 July 2019|journal= Spectrum|date= 6 August 2008|issn= 0890-0264|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061214/https://spectrummagazine.org/article/column/2008/08/06/revisiting-ellen-white-masturbation|archive-date= 7 January 2018}}</ref> Numbers argues that she [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] [[vitalism|vitalist]] writers (such as [[Horace Mann]] and Larkin B.
