He is a [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] who was elected in a 2013 [[by-election]]. He represents the riding of [[Windsor\u2014Tecumseh (provincial electoral district)|Windsor\u2014Tecumseh]].\n\n==Background==\nHatfield was born in [[St. Martins, New Brunswick]]. As an army brat, he frequently moved, living in Fort Churchill, Manitoba, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Oromocto, New Brunswick, St. John's, Newfoundland, Port Alberni, British Columbia, and Pembroke, Ontario. It was in Pembroke, Ontario where he started a broadcast career at CHOV radio and television in 1974. Hatfield then worked in radio and television in St. John's, Newfoundland and Leamington, Ontario.\n\nHe worked as a weekend reporter with the Windsor Star before joining CBC radio in Windsor as a local reporter. In 1978, he transferred to CBC television in Windsor. For the most part of his career he has been a reporter, although he also spent time as an announcer, writer, and producer. Hatfield was part of the Windsor Experiment which introduced multi-skilling and cross-skilling to CBC operations. Reporters started shooting their own television stories, and camera operators were trained as reporters - becoming video journalists.\n\nAlthough he covered the education and automotive beats, most of his time with CBC Television was spent as Windsor's Municipal Affairs Reporter. For many years he hosted a popular segment called \u201cPercy\u2019s Political Panel\u201d where many up and coming would-be politicians got their first notice in the public eye. Some went on to get elected at the municipal, provincial and federal levels.\n\nHatfield\u00a0 was heavily involved with his union while working at the CBC. Initially, it was the old Canadian Wire Service Guild, the CWSG, where besides serving as a local Shop Steward he served ten years on his National Executive.\u00a0The CWSG was a Local of The Newspaper Guild, (TNG) based in Washington DC. Hatfield was elected as the national Secretary of the CWSG and the Chair of the Canadian District Council of the Newspaper Guild.\u00a0 The CWSG evolved into the Canadian Media Guild and he was elected Vice-President for Central Canada then elected At-Large as a member of the International Executive Board (the I.E.B.) of the Newspaper Guild, the first Canadian ever elected to an \u201cat large\u201d position with the Guild.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSoon after, TNG merged with and became a Sector within the Communications Workers of America, (the CWA) based in Washington DC. After three terms as an \u201cAt Large\u201d member, the I.E.B. was downsized, dropping the \u201cAt Large\u201d positions\u00a0 and Hatfield went on to serve two terms as the Easter Canadian Vice-President of the TNG/CWA. In 2000, he was given the rare honour of being recognized by his Union with the CMG's Meritorious Service Award. It is something he is most proud of, and the award hangs in his office at the Provincial Parliament in Toronto.\n\n''\u201cIn recognition of his extraordinary commitment and outstanding contribution to the Canadian Wire Service Guild and the growth of the Canadian Media Guild. For twenty years he has given his time, effort and considerable expertise. \u00a0As a consensus - builder he has helped build a solid foundation for the Canadian Media Guild upon which we can forge future successes.\u201d''\n\nHatfield holds a bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Windsor.\u00a0 He and Gale were married in 1975, raised two children and now are the proud \u201cGrammy and Poppy\u201d to six beautiful grandchildren, four girls and two boys.\n\n==Politics==\nWhen he retired from the CBC in August 2006 he wasted no time in getting involved in municipal politics. That fall he was elected to the first of two terms as a City Councillor in Windsor.\n\nAs a Councillor Hatfield served two terms on the National Board of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and was elected three times to the board of the [[Association of Municipalities of Ontario]] (AMO). In 2011, Hatfield served as an AMO Chair of the Large Urban Caucus. He has served on numerous City of Windsor and Agency committees including the AMO Host Committee, Arena Board, Armouries Reuse Committee, CAO Performance Review Committee, Clean City Committee, Council Support Services Review Committee, Development Charges Task Force, Environmental Master Plan Implementation Committee, Essex Region Conservation Authority, Heritage Committee, International Relations Committee, Museum Facility Steering Committee, Olde Riverside BIA, Planning & Economic Development Standing Committee, Planning Advisory Committee, Public Health Unit, Roseland Golf Club Board of Directors, Social Development Standing Committee, Solid Waste Authority, Tourism Windsor - Transitional Board, Transit Windsor Board of Directors, War Memorial Committee, WFCU Steering Committee, Windsor BIA Advisory Committee, Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation Board, Windsor Essex County Health Unit, Windsor Essex Environment Committee, Windsor Licensing Commission, and the Windsor Public Library Board.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.percyhatfield.com/about|title=MPP|work=Percy Hatfield|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHatfield was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in a [[by-election]] on August 1, 2013, as the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic]] candidate in the riding of [[Windsor\u2014Tecumseh (provincial electoral district)|Windsor\u2014Tecumseh]].

The CSG is a region-based forum that fosters the exchange of insights and ideas to help state and provincial officials shape public policy. Hatfield's appointment was the first time that the Legislative Assembly of Ontario was offered a seat on the CSG Executive Committee.\n\nHe was also appointed by Speaker Arnott to serve as a member of the Midwest-Canada Relations Committee for the Midwestern Legislative Conference. This committee provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and consideration of mutual concerns, and has explored subjects ranging from border security, energy, and most recently trade-related issues and the future of Canada \u2013 US relations.\n\nIn December 2017, he introduced the bill ''Poet Laureate of Ontario Act In Memory of Gord Downie'' to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario;

After three terms as an \u201cAt Large\u201d member, the I.E.B. was downsized, dropping the \u201cAt Large\u201d positions\u00a0 and Hatfield went on to serve two terms as the Easter Canadian Vice-President of the TNG/CWA. In 2000, he was given the rare honour of being recognized by his Union with the CMG's Meritorious Service Award. It is something he is most proud of, and the award hangs in his office at the Provincial Parliament in Toronto.\n\n''\u201cIn recognition of his extraordinary commitment and outstanding contribution to the Canadian Wire Service Guild and the growth of the Canadian Media Guild. For twenty years he has given his time, effort and considerable expertise. \u00a0As a consensus - builder he has helped build a solid foundation for the Canadian Media Guild upon which we can forge future successes.\u201d''\n\nHatfield holds a bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Windsor.\u00a0 He and Gale were married in 1975, raised two children and now are the proud \u201cGrammy and Poppy\u201d to six beautiful grandchildren, four girls and two boys.\n\n==Politics==\nWhen he retired from the CBC in August 2006 he wasted no time in getting involved in municipal politics. That fall he was elected to the first of two terms as a City Councillor in Windsor.\n\nAs a Councillor Hatfield served two terms on the National Board of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and was elected three times to the board of the [[Association of Municipalities of Ontario]] (AMO). In 2011, Hatfield served as an AMO Chair of the Large Urban Caucus.
