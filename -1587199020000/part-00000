In an article in Wines and Vines Magazine in 1970, Finkel was the first to use the term ''\"boutique wines\"'' to describe small, family owned wines of quality. \n\nHe was the first importer to introduce Belgian beer along with craft beers from England, Scotland, Belgium, France, Norway, and Germany to America through Merchant du Vin. He designed the labels for beers including [[Ayinger Brewery|Ayinger]] Celebrator, [[Samuel Smith Brewery|Samuel Smith]] Celebrated Oatmeal Stout, Organic Chocolate Stout, Imperial Stout and Winter Welcome, [[Lindeman's]] Cuv\u00e9e Ren\u00e9, and Pike Brewing Company. \n\nIn 2011, [[Draft (magazine)|Draft Magazine]] named Charles as one of 10 Beer Innovators.

He was replaced as [[CBS/Fox Video]] president in January 1983 by a former [[Columbia Pictures]] executive, Larry Hilford. Hilford was verbal critic of the video rental business, but with the studio looking at a likely loss, he attempted to make the out of the results. CBS/Fox and other home video units increased prices of the cassettes by around 67% to maximize income. They also move to encourage customer purchasing instead of renting.

Fox Video was under president Bob DeLellis, a 1984 hire at CBS/Fox and rose to group vice president and president in 1991.

Four months for ''New Hope'' and until the fall of 1997 for ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi''. Sales topped 30 million copies over expectations.

With DVD being a Warner Home Video property, the company did not initial issue DVDs instead advocated for digital VHS tapes then the disposable Divx. Divx was DVD variant that had limited viewing time launched by Circuit City consumer electronics chain in June 1998. With DVD's low cost at $20 and Divx at $4.50, the DVD format won quickly out over Divx. News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch wanted a deal with Time Warner cable for the soon to launch [[Fox News]] and a lower dial position for [[Fox Family Channel]], Mechanic adopted the DVD format to smooth the deal.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nBy 1998, Wyatt became permanent president of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. Wyatt then became head of Fox Consumer Product, which put together the video and licensing unit. Wyatt had to drop the licensing half as the home video unit boomed. DVD sales were so strong that they factored into green-lighting theatrical films.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWyatt reorganized the Fox Home Entertainment through a partnership with replicator Cinram and lead the way in using data mining to increase its retail business partner's margins. Being ahead of the other studios, TCFHE began picking up additional outside labels as distribution clients with their fees covering the company's overhead. Fox Home Entertainment won multiple Vendor of the Year awards. Wyatt's system was a great edge for years.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nTV-on-DVD business was intiated by Wyatt through the release of whole season of ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', which started the binge-watching concept. However, the videocassette rental business was declining such that video rental chains signed revenue-sharing deals with the studios, so additional copies of hits could be brought in a lower price and share sales for more customer satisfaction.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWith the DVD boom, the company was able to have various promotional stunts for their video releases from ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[Cast Away]]''. For the Simpsons release, there was ''The Simpsons on Ice'' in Bryant Park, turned the Empire State Building yellow and handed out yellow Santa hats that were all over town. ''Cast Away'' had a US Coast Guard rescue co-star \u2018Wilson,\u2019 the volleyball, at sea during their water safety awareness campaign.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nMechanic left Fox in June 2000 while Wyatt resigned in December 2002.

''Passion'' sold 15 million DVDs. TCFHE continued obtaining additional Christian films' domestic home video rights for movie like \"[[Mother Teresa of Calcutta (film)|Mother Teresa]]\" and the \"[[Beyond the Gates of Splendor]]\" documentary.

Mechanic had been the one to install the \"Vault\" moratorium strategy at Disney.

Total revenue for the expanded business unit would have been over $800 million with Fox Videos providing the bulk at $650 million. Mechanic kept DeLellis as president of the expanded unit's North American operation with Jeff Yap as international president. By May 1995, Fox had Magnet under a worldwide label deal for 10 to 12 title through 1996. TCFHE would also be responsible for DVD when they hit the market.<ref name=bbd>{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=20th+century+fox+home+entertainment+1995&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinzfKh_aLWAhWF4IMKHfRvA94Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&q=20th%20century%20fox%20home%20entertainment%201995&f=false|title=20th Century Fox Forms Distrib Arm For Growing Bix|work=Billboard|last=Goldstein|first=Seth|date=May 6, 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMechanic had Fox Home Entertainment institute the moratorium strategy with the August 1995 release of the three original ''Star Wars'' movies giving them a sales window before going off the market forever. Four months for ''New Hope'' and until the fall of 1997 for ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi''. Sales topped 30 million copies over expectations. The company's 1996 release of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' sold 18 million-unit making the industry's bestselling live-action home video release.<ref name=\"mpn\"/>\n\nWith the May 1997 departure of DeLellis, a quick rotation of presidents lead Fox Home Entertainment, Yapp for four months then an interim president Pat Wyatt, head of Twentieth Century Fox Licensing & Merchandising, in September 1997. With DVD being a Warner Home Video property, the company did not initial issue DVDs instead advocated for digital VHS tapes then the disposable Divx. Divx was DVD variant that had limited viewing time launched by Circuit City consumer electronics chain in June 1998. With DVD's low cost at $20 and Divx at $4.50, the DVD format won quickly out over Divx. News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch wanted a deal with Time Warner cable for the soon to launch [[Fox News]] and a lower dial position for [[Fox Family Channel]], Mechanic adopted the DVD format to smooth the deal.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nBy 1998, Wyatt became permanent president of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. Wyatt then became head of Fox Consumer Product, which put together the video and licensing unit. Wyatt had to drop the licensing half as the home video unit boomed. DVD sales were so strong that they factored into green-lighting theatrical films.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWyatt reorganized the Fox Home Entertainment through a partnership with replicator Cinram and lead the way in using data mining to increase its retail business partner's margins. Being ahead of the other studios, TCFHE began picking up additional outside labels as distribution clients with their fees covering the company's overhead. Fox Home Entertainment won multiple Vendor of the Year awards. Wyatt's system was a great edge for years.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nTV-on-DVD business was intiated by Wyatt through the release of whole season of ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', which started the binge-watching concept. However, the videocassette rental business was declining such that video rental chains signed revenue-sharing deals with the studios, so additional copies of hits could be brought in a lower price and share sales for more customer satisfaction.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWith the DVD boom, the company was able to have various promotional stunts for their video releases from ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[Cast Away]]''. For the Simpsons release, there was ''The Simpsons on Ice'' in Bryant Park, turned the Empire State Building yellow and handed out yellow Santa hats that were all over town. ''Cast Away'' had a US Coast Guard rescue co-star \u2018Wilson,\u2019 the volleyball, at sea during their water safety awareness campaign.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nMechanic left Fox in June 2000 while Wyatt resigned in December 2002. [[Jim Gianopulos]] replaced Mechanic while executive vice president of domestic marketing and sales, Mike Dunn, took over from Wyatt. Wyatt left to start a direct-to-video film production and financing company for Japanese-style animated programming.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nIn 2004, 20th Century Fox passed on theatrical distribution, while picking up domestic home video rights on ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. ''Passion'' sold 15 million DVDs. TCFHE continued obtaining additional Christian films' domestic home video rights for movie like \"[[Mother Teresa of Calcutta (film)|Mother Teresa]]\" and the \"[[Beyond the Gates of Splendor]]\" documentary. After a 2005 test with a [[Fox Faith]] website, in 2006, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment launched its own film production banner for religious films using the same name.<ref>{{cite news |last=Munoz |first=Lorenza |title=Fox Puts Faith in Christian Films |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-sep-19-fi-faith19-story.html |accessdate=June 18, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nEffective October 1, 2005, 20th Century Fox Scandinavia was split into two, 20th Century Fox Theatrical Sweden and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Scandinavia.

This also started Fox's [[Digital HD]] program where customers could download or stream 600 Fox films on connected devices at less than $15/film through multiple major platforms. However, Digital HD was soon dropped as 4K, or [[Ultra HD]], was introduced in 2012. In 2014, a high-tech think tank, [[Fox Innovation Lab]], was formed under 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nIn September 2015, the first Ultra HD Blu-ray player was introduced leading TCFE to have future movies released same day in Ultra HD Blu-ray as regular Blu-ray and DVD.
