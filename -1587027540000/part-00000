The earliest known example is ''[[Rugosodon]]'', a rodent-like omnivore living 160 million years ago in what is today China.\n\nDuring the Cretaceous, the multituberculates [[Evolutionary radiation|radiated]] into a wide variety of [[morphotype]]s, including the squirrel-like arboreal [[Ptilodontidae|ptilodonts]]. Most species of multituberculata appear to have been wiped out during the [[K-T event]] (the extinction of the dinosaurs), but they seem to have been among the first to recover and diversify again. The peculiar shape of their last lower [[premolar]] is their most outstanding feature. These teeth were larger and more elongated than the other cheek-teeth and had an [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusive]] surface forming a serrated slicing blade. Though it can be assumed that this was used for crushing seeds and nuts, it is believed that most small multituberculates also supplemented their diet with insects, worms, and fruits.<ref name=\"Agusti-3\" /> Tooth marks attributed to multituberculates are known on ''[[Champsosaurus]]'' fossils, indicating that at least some of these mammals were [[scavenger]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2010.00957.x | volume=53 | title=Mammalian tooth marks on the bones of dinosaurs and other Late Cretaceous vertebrates | journal=Palaeontology | pages=703\u2013709 | last1 = Longrich | first1 = Nicholas R. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = Michael J.}}</ref>\n\nA ptilodont that throve in North America was ''[[Ptilodus]]''. Thanks to the well-preserved ''Ptilodus'' specimens found in the [[Bighorn Basin]], [[Wyoming]], we know that these multituberculates were able to [[Anatomical terms of motion|abduct and adduct]] their [[hallux|big toes]], and thus that their foot mobility was similar to that of modern squirrels, which descend trees head first.<ref name=\"Agusti-3\" />\n\n[[File:Catopsbaatar.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration of ''[[Catopsbaatar]]'']]\n\nIn Europe, another family of multituberculates were equally successful&mdash;the [[Kogaionidae]], first discovered in [[Ha\u0163eg]], [[Romania]]. They also developed an enlarged blade-like lower premolar. The ''[[Hainina]]'', the most successful genus, was originally believed to be a ptilodont. However, more detailed analysis of this genus revealed a smaller number of dental cusps and a retained fifth premolar&mdash;a unique combination of primitive and advanced features indicating that ''Hainina'' were related to some Jurassic genera and that enlarged, blade-like premolars were acquired independently in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"Agusti-3\" />\n\nAnother group of multituberculates, the [[Taeniolabidoidea|taeniolabids]], were heavier and more massively built, indicating that they lived a fully terrestrial life. The largest specimens weighted probably as much as 100&nbsp;kg, making them comparable in size to large rodents like ''[[Castoroides]]''.<ref name=\"Williamson et al 2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Brusatte|first2=Stephen L.|last3=Secord|first3=Ross|last4=Shelley|first4=Sarah|title=A new taeniolabidoid multituberculate (Mammalia) from the middle Puercan of the Nacimiento Formation, New Mexico, and a revision of taeniolabidoid systematics and phylogeny|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=177|pages=183\u2013208|date=2015|doi=10.1111/zoj.12336|quote=Taeniolabidoids underwent a modest taxonomic radiation during the early Palaeocene of North America and underwent a dramatic increase in body size, with Taeniolabis taoensis possibly exceeding 100 kg}}</ref>\nThey reached their highest diversity in Asia during the late Cretaceous and Paleocene, which suggests that they originated from there.<ref name=\"Agusti-3\" />\n\nAbout 80 [[genus|genera]] of Multituberculata are known, including ''[[Lambdopsalis]]'', ''[[Ptilodus]]'' and ''[[Meniscoessus]]''. In the northern hemisphere, during the late Cretaceous, more than half of typical land mammalian species were multituberculates. While most mammals \u2014 along with birds and other dinosaurs and most other types of life \u2014 were wiped out during the [[K-T event]] (the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago), a large proportion of the mammals that show up in the fossil record after the extinction are multituberculates.\n\nThe group went on to dominate land in the next twenty million years of the [[paleocene]], but it appears that increasing competition from [[placental mammal]]s drove them to extinction by the end of the [[Eocene]], about 40 million years ago.\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Taeniolabis taoensis.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''Taeniolabis taoensis'']]\nIn their 2001 study, [[Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska|Kielan-Jaworowska]] and [[J\u00f8rn Hurum|Hurum]] found that most multituberculates could be referred to two suborders: \"[[Plagiaulacida]]\" and [[Cimolodonta]]. The exception is the genus ''[[Arginbaatar]]'', which shares characteristics with both groups.\n\n\"Plagiaulacida\" is [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]], representing the more primitive [[evolutionary grade]] and possibly the more derived [[Gondwanatheria]]. Its members are the more basal Multituberculata, though gondwanatherians are rather derived. Chronologically, they ranged from perhaps the middle Jurassic (unnamed material), until the lower [[Cretaceous]]. This group is further subdivided into three informal groupings: the [[Plagiaulacida#Allodontid line|allodontid line]], the [[Plagiaulacida#Paulchoffatiid line|paulchoffatiid line]], and the [[Plagiaulacida#Plagiaulacid line|plagiaulacid line]].\n\n[[Gondwanatheria]] is a monophyletic group that was diverse in the [[Late Cretaceous]] of [[South America]], [[India]], [[Madagascar]] and possibly [[Africa]] and occurs onwards into the [[Cenozoic]] of [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]]. Though their identity as multituberculates has been disputed, most recent phylogenetic studies recover them as the sister group to cimolodonts. There are two major families, [[Ferugliotheriidae]] and [[Sudamericidae]], with a few taxa like ''[[Greniodon]]'' and ''[[Groeberia]]'' being uncertainly placed. ''[[Patagonia (mammal)|Patagonia]]'' is the youngest multituberculate known, occurring in the [[Miocene]] of Argentina.\n\n[[Cimolodonta]] is, apparently, a natural ([[monophyletic]]) suborder. This includes the more derived Multituberculata, which have been identified from the lower Cretaceous to the [[Eocene]]. The superfamilies [[Djadochtatherioidea]], [[Taeniolabidoidea]], [[Ptilodontoidea]] are recognized, as is the [[Paracimexomys group]]. Additionally, there are the families [[Cimolomyidae]], [[Boffius|Boffiidae]], [[Eucosmodontidae]], [[Kogaionidae]], [[Microcosmodontidae]] and the two genera ''[[Uzbekbaatar]]'' and ''[[Viridomys]]''. More precise placement of these types awaits further discoveries and analysis.<ref name=\"Dykes\">Dykes ''Multituberculata (Cope 1884)''</ref>{{better source|date=April 2015|reason=Dykes' site is

For one thing, it relies on the assumption that these mammals are \"inferior\" to more derived placentals, and ignores the fact that rodents and multituberculates had co-existed for at least 15 million years. According to some researchers, multituberculate \"decline\" is shaped by sharp extinction events, most notably after the [[Tiffanian]], where a sudden drop in diversity occurs. Finally, the youngest known multituberculates do not exemplify patterns of competitive exclusion; the Oligocene ''[[Ectypodus]]'' is a rather generalistic species, rather than a specialist. This combination of factors suggests that, rather than gradually declining due to pressure from rodents and similar placentals, multituberculates simply could not cope with climatic and vegetation changes, as well as the rise of new predatory eutherians, such as [[Miacidae|miacids]].<ref name=\"Ostrander 1984\"/>\n\nMore recent studies show a mixed effect. Multituberculate faunas in North America and Europe do indeed decline in correlation to the introduction of rodents in these areas. However, [[Asia]]n multituberculate faunas co-existed with rodents with minimal extinction events, implying that competition was not the main cause for the extinction of Asiatic multituberculates. As a whole, it seems that Asian multituberculates, unlike North American and European species, never recovered from the [[KT event]], which allowed the evolution and propagation of rodents in the first place.<ref name=\"Wood 2010\"/> A recent study seems to indeed indicate that eutherians recovered more quickly from the KT event than multituberculates.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pires | first1 = Mathias M. | last2 = Rankin | first2 = Brian D. | last3 = Silvestro | first3 = Daniele | last4 = Quental | first4 = Tiago B. | year = 1804 | title = Diversification dynamics of mammalian clades during the K\u2013Pg mass extinction | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 9| page = 2058 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2018.0458 | pmid = 30258031 | pmc = 6170748 }}</ref>\n\nCompetition between gondwanatherians and rodents and/or other [[Glires]] is untested, with a wide span of time between the youngest representatives of the former in [[India]], [[Africa]] and [[Madagascar]] in the [[Maastrichtian]] and the first representatives of the latter in the [[Palaeocene]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = K.D. | last2 = Deleon | first2 = V.B. | last3 = Mmissian | first3 = P. | last4 = Rana | first4 = R.S. | last5 = Sahni | first5 = A. | last6 = Singh | first6 = L. | last7 = Smith | first7 = T. | year = 2007 | title = Early Eocene lagomorph (Mammalia) from western India and the early diversification of Lagomorpha | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2007.1661 | pmid = 18285282 | pmc = 2602686 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 275 | issue = 1639| pages = 1203\u20131208 }}</ref> [[Eocene]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marivaux | first1 = Laurent | last2 = Essid | first2 = El Mabrouk | last3 = Marzougui | first3 = Wissem | last4 = Ammar | first4 = Hayet Khayati | last5 = Adnet | first5 = Sylvain | last6 = Marandat | first6 = Bernard | last7 = Merzeraud | first7 = Gilles | last8 = Tabuce | first8 = Rodolphe | last9 = Vianey-Liaud | first9 = Monique | year = 2014 | title = A new and primitive species of Protophiomys (Rodentia, Hystricognathi) from the late middle Eocene of Djebel el K\u00e9bar, Central Tunisia | url = https://hal.umontpellier.fr/hal-01813425/file/P91_2014_Palaeovertebrata_Tunisia-Kebar-Rodents_Marivaux-et-al.pdf| journal = Palaeovertebrata | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201317 | doi = 10.18563/pv.38.1.e2 }}</ref> and [[Oligocene]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Poux | first1 = C. | last2 = Madsen | first2 = O. | last3 = Marquard | first3 = E. | last4 = Vieites | first4 = D.

Although several lineages became extinct during the faunal turnover at the end of the Cretaceous, multituberculates as a whole managed very successfully to cross the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] and reached their peak of diversity during the Paleocene. They were an important component of nearly all Paleocene faunas of Europe and North America, and of some late Paleocene faunas of Asia. Multituberculates were also most diverse in size during the Paleocene, ranging from the size of a very small [[mouse]] to that of a [[panda]]. However, in Asia, Palaeocene and Eocene multituberculates compose a very small percentage of the overall local mammalian fauna, having never managed to recover from the KT event in the same way that their North American and European counterparts did.<ref name=\"Wood 2010\">{{Cite thesis |last=Wood |first= D.

The earliest known example is ''[[Rugosodon]]'', a rodent-like omnivore living 160 million years ago in what is today China. \n\nDuring the Cretaceous, the multituberculates [[Evolutionary radiation|radiated]] into a wide variety of [[morphotype]]s, including the squirrel-like arboreal [[Ptilodontidae|ptilodonts]]. Most species of multituberculata appear to have been wiped out during the [[K-T event]] (the extinction of the dinosaurs), but they seem to have been among the first to recover and diversify again. The peculiar shape of their last lower [[premolar]] is their most outstanding feature. These teeth were larger and more elongated than the other cheek-teeth and had an [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusive]] surface forming a serrated slicing blade. Though it can be assumed that this was used for crushing seeds and nuts, it is believed that most small multituberculates also supplemented their diet with insects, worms, and fruits.<ref name=\"Agusti-3\" /> Tooth marks attributed to multituberculates are known on ''[[Champsosaurus]]'' fossils, indicating that at least some of these mammals were [[scavenger]]s.<ref>Mammalian tooth marks on the bones of dinosaurs and other Late Cretaceous vertebrates, First published: 16 June 2010 + DOI: 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2010.00957.x</ref>\n\nA ptilodont that throve in North America was ''[[Ptilodus]]''. Thanks to the well-preserved ''Ptilodus'' specimens found in the [[Bighorn Basin]], [[Wyoming]], we know that these multituberculates were able to [[Anatomical terms of motion|abduct and adduct]] their [[hallux|big toes]], and thus that their foot mobility was similar to that of modern squirrels, which descend trees head first.<ref name=\"Agusti-3\" />\n\n[[File:Catopsbaatar.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration of ''[[Catopsbaatar]]'']]\n\nIn Europe, another family of multituberculates were equally successful&mdash;the [[Kogaionidae]], first discovered in [[Ha\u0163eg]], [[Romania]]. They also developed an enlarged blade-like lower premolar. The ''[[Hainina]]'', the most successful genus, was originally believed to be a ptilodont. However, more detailed analysis of this genus revealed a smaller number of dental cusps and a retained fifth premolar&mdash;a unique combination of primitive and advanced features indicating that ''Hainina'' were related to some Jurassic genera and that enlarged, blade-like premolars were acquired independently in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"Agusti-3\" />\n\nAnother group of multituberculates, the [[Taeniolabidoidea|taeniolabids]], were heavier and more massively built, indicating that they lived a fully terrestrial life. The largest specimens weighted probably as much as 100&nbsp;kg, making them comparable in size to large rodents like ''[[Castoroides]]''.<ref name=\"Williamson et al 2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Brusatte|first2=Stephen L.|last3=Secord|first3=Ross|last4=Shelley|first4=Sarah|title=A new taeniolabidoid multituberculate (Mammalia) from the middle Puercan of the Nacimiento Formation, New Mexico, and a revision of taeniolabidoid systematics and phylogeny|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=177|pages=183\u2013208|date=2015|doi=10.1111/zoj.12336|quote=Taeniolabidoids underwent a modest taxonomic radiation during the early Palaeocene of North America and underwent a dramatic increase in body size, with Taeniolabis taoensis possibly exceeding 100 kg}}</ref>\nThey reached their highest diversity in Asia during the late Cretaceous and Paleocene, which suggests that they originated from there.<ref name=\"Agusti-3\" />\n\nAbout 80 [[genus|genera]] of Multituberculata are known, including ''[[Lambdopsalis]]'', ''[[Ptilodus]]'' and ''[[Meniscoessus]]''. In the northern hemisphere, during the late Cretaceous, more than half of typical land mammalian species were multituberculates. While most mammals \u2014 along with birds and other dinosaurs and most other types of life \u2014 were wiped out during the [[K-T event]] (the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago), a large proportion of the mammals that show up in the fossil record after the extinction are multituberculates.\n\nThe group went on to dominate land in the next twenty million years of the [[paleocene]], but it appears that increasing competition from [[placental mammal]]s drove them to extinction by the end of the [[Eocene]], about 40 million years ago.\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Taeniolabis taoensis.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''Taeniolabis taoensis'']]\nIn their 2001 study, [[Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska|Kielan-Jaworowska]] and [[J\u00f8rn Hurum|Hurum]] found that most multituberculates could be referred to two suborders: \"[[Plagiaulacida]]\" and [[Cimolodonta]]. The exception is the genus ''[[Arginbaatar]]'', which shares characteristics with both groups.\n\n\"Plagiaulacida\" is [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]], representing the more primitive [[evolutionary grade]] and possibly the more derived [[Gondwanatheria]]. Its members are the more basal Multituberculata, though gondwanatherians are rather derived. Chronologically, they ranged from perhaps the middle Jurassic (unnamed material), until the lower [[Cretaceous]]. This group is further subdivided into three informal groupings: the [[Plagiaulacida#Allodontid line|allodontid line]], the [[Plagiaulacida#Paulchoffatiid line|paulchoffatiid line]], and the [[Plagiaulacida#Plagiaulacid line|plagiaulacid line]].\n\n[[Gondwanatheria]] is a monophyletic group that was diverse in the [[Late Cretaceous]] of [[South America]], [[India]], [[Madagascar]] and possibly [[Africa]] and occurs onwards into the [[Cenozoic]] of [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]]. Though their identity as multituberculates has been disputed, most recent phylogenetic studies recover them as the sister group to cimolodonts. There are two major families, [[Ferugliotheriidae]] and [[Sudamericidae]], with a few taxa like ''[[Greniodon]]'' and ''[[Groeberia]]'' being uncertainly placed. ''[[Patagonia (mammal)|Patagonia]]'' is the youngest multituberculate known, occurring in the [[Miocene]] of Argentina.\n\n[[Cimolodonta]] is, apparently, a natural ([[monophyletic]]) suborder. This includes the more derived Multituberculata, which have been identified from the lower Cretaceous to the [[Eocene]]. The superfamilies [[Djadochtatherioidea]], [[Taeniolabidoidea]], [[Ptilodontoidea]] are recognized, as is the [[Paracimexomys group]]. Additionally, there are the families [[Cimolomyidae]], [[Boffius|Boffiidae]], [[Eucosmodontidae]], [[Kogaionidae]], [[Microcosmodontidae]] and the two genera ''[[Uzbekbaatar]]'' and ''[[Viridomys]]''. More precise placement of these types awaits further discoveries and analysis.<ref name=\"Dykes\">Dykes ''Multituberculata (Cope 1884)''</ref>{{better source|date=April 2015|reason=Dykes' site is defunct}}<!--- ref for entire section -->\n\n===Taxonomy===\n[[File:Multituberculata.png|thumb|Multituberculate phylogenetic tree based off L.

For one thing, it relies on the assumption that these mammals are \"inferior\" to more derived placentals, and ignores the fact that rodents and multituberculates had co-existed for at least 15 million years. According to some researchers, multituberculate \"decline\" is shaped by sharp extinction events, most notably after the [[Tiffanian]], where a sudden drop in diversity occurs. Finally, the youngest known multituberculates do not exemplify patterns of competitive exclusion; the Oligocene ''[[Ectypodus]]'' is a rather generalistic species, rather than a specialist. This combination of factors suggests that, rather than gradually declining due to pressure from rodents and similar placentals, multituberculates simply could not cope with climatic and vegetation changes, as well as the rise of new predatory eutherians, such as [[Miacidae|miacids]].<ref name=\"Ostrander 1984\"/>\n\nMore recent studies show a mixed effect. Multituberculate faunas in North America and Europe do indeed decline in correlation to the introduction of rodents in these areas. However, [[Asia]]n multituberculate faunas co-existed with rodents with minimal extinction events, implying that competition was not the main cause for the extinction of Asiatic multituberculates. As a whole, it seems that Asian multituberculates, unlike North American and European species, never recovered from the [[KT event]], which allowed the evolution and propagation of rodents in the first place.<ref name=\"Wood 2010\"/> A recent study seems to indeed indicate that eutherians recovered more quickly from the KT event than multituberculates.<ref>Mathias M.

Although several lineages became extinct during the faunal turnover at the end of the Cretaceous, multituberculates as a whole managed very successfully to cross the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] and reached their peak of diversity during the Paleocene. They were an important component of nearly all Paleocene faunas of Europe and North America, and of some late Paleocene faunas of Asia. Multituberculates were also most diverse in size during the Paleocene, ranging from the size of a very small [[mouse]] to that of a [[panda]]. However, in Asia, Palaeocene and Eocene multituberculates compose a very small percentage of the overall local mammalian fauna, having never managed to recover from the KT event in the same way that their North American and European counterparts did.<ref name=\"Wood 2010\">{{Cite thesis |last=Wood |first= D.

It was originally released in 2003 as a part of the [[Capcom Five]] under director [[Hideki Kamiya]] and producer [[Atsushi Inaba]]. The game was later ported to the [[PlayStation 2]] by the same design team under the name [[Clover Studio]], subtitled in Japan {{nihongo|'''''Aratanaru Kib\u014d'''''|\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u5e0c\u671b||lit. \"A New Hope\"|lead=yes}}. The game's story concerns Joe, an avid movie-goer whose girlfriend Silvia is kidnapped during a film starring Joe's favorite [[superhero]], Captain Blue. Joe is shortly thereafter thrust into Movieland, where Silvia is taken by the villainous group known as Jadow. After accepting a special V-Watch from Captain Blue, Joe transforms into the [[tokusatsu]]-style persona \"Viewtiful Joe\" and sets out to rescue her.\n\nThe gameplay of ''Viewtiful Joe'' features traditional [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Platform game|platform]] [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] intermixed with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] graphics. Abilities known as \"VFX Powers\" grant the player special actions for combat and puzzle-solving, such as slowing down or speeding up time. ''Viewtiful Joe'' was critically acclaimed for its unique visual style and gameplay, earning itself a number of awards from various media publications. A minor commercial success, the game spawned a few [[#Legacy|sequels]] with releases seen on other consoles such as the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) and [[Nintendo DS]]. An [[anime]] [[Viewtiful Joe (TV series)|adaption of the game]] and a [[manga]] series were also produced.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Viewtiful Joe''{{'}}s core gameplay is similar to a traditional side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]]. Taking control of Joe, the player is mostly limited to moving left, right, up, and down on a fixed 2D path. The game contains platforming elements such as the ability to jump and double jump. Combat consists of fighting multiple enemies on screen at once, with the enemies appearing from all directions, including the foreground and background. Joe has the ability to punch, kick, and dodge\u2014which he can do by leaping upward or ducking. Dodging enemies' attacks successfully temporarily dazes them, leaving them wide open for attack.<ref name=\"EuroG\">{{cite web | author=Bramwell, Tom | date=13 October 2003 | title=Viewtiful Joe Review // GC | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_viewtifuljoe_gc | publisher=Eurogamer | accessdate=2009-02-22 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229130920/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_viewtifuljoe_gc | archivedate=29 December 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The player has certain number of [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] in the form of \"Life Marks\" located above the VFX Gauge, which decrease whenever Joe takes damage.

When the V-Watch glows, say the word, \u201cHenshin!\u201d}}</ref> Joe promptly does so, inventing his own [[catchphrase]]: \"Henshin-a-go-go, baby!\"\n\nWith the guidance of Captain Blue, Joe fights his way through a number of Movieland's locations such as cities, caves, an underwater base, and a [[submarine]], often travelling via his trusty, robot aircraft \"Six Machine\". One by one, Joe defeats the members of the Jadow, the game's [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. These include Dark Fiend Charles the 3rd, Iron [[Ogre]] Hulk Davidson, Aquatic Terror Gran Bruce, a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of Viewtiful Joe, and Blade Master Alastor. Before fighting Alastor, he reveals that in order for the Jadow to break out of Movieland and into the land of humans, they need the \"[[DNA]] of the Creator\", namely Silvia.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Viewtiful Joe |developer=Capcom Production Studio 4|publisher=Capcom|date=26 June 2003|platform=Nintendo GameCube|quote='''Alastor:''' The key to our success lies in the DNA of the Creator.

Joe and Six Machine race off into outer space after her in the game's final episode.\n\nFinding Silvia atop the control room of a space station, Joe discovers that Captain Blue has been behind the plot the entire time. The former hero reveals that he is the creator of the film in which they currently exist and that he is Silvia's seemingly-deceased father.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Viewtiful Joe |developer=Capcom Production Studio 4|publisher=Capcom|date=26 June 2003|platform=Nintendo GameCube|quote='''Captain Blue:''' Foolish boy, you still don\u2019t get it, do you?

Joe tells him off, telling him that he's no hero. Joe summons Six Majin, and the two engage in combat. When the fight ends, Captain Blue and Viewtiful Joe abandon their respective vehicles and face off in a final battle within the space station.\n\nJoe is victorious, and Captain Blue, finally coming to his senses, thanks the young hero for stopping him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon thought of as a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns of a large number of [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Viewtiful Joe |developer=Capcom Production Studio 4|publisher=Capcom|date=26 June 2003|platform=Nintendo GameCube|quote='''Captain Blue:''' Like I said, there\u2019s more to this story.

The game's story concerns Joe, an avid movie-goer whose girlfriend Silvia is kidnapped during a film starring Joe's favorite [[superhero]], Captain Blue. Joe is shortly thereafter thrust into Movieland, where Silvia is taken by the villainous group known as Jadow. After accepting a special V-Watch from Captain Blue, Joe transforms into the [[tokusatsu]]-style persona \"Viewtiful Joe\" and sets out to rescue her.\n\nThe gameplay of ''Viewtiful Joe'' features traditional [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Platform game|platform]] [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] intermixed with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] graphics. Abilities known as \"VFX Powers\" grant the player special actions for combat and puzzle-solving, such as slowing down or speeding up time. ''Viewtiful Joe'' was critically acclaimed for its unique visual style and gameplay, earning itself a number of awards from various media publications. A minor commercial success, the game spawned a few [[#Legacy|sequels]] with releases seen on other consoles such as the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) and [[Nintendo DS]]. An [[anime]] [[Viewtiful Joe (TV series)|adaption of the game]] and a [[manga]] series were also produced.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Viewtiful Joe''{{'}}s core gameplay is similar to a traditional side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]]. Taking control of Joe, the player is mostly limited to moving left, right, up, and down on a fixed 2D path. The game contains platforming elements such as the ability to jump and double jump. Combat consists of fighting multiple enemies on screen at once, with the enemies appearing from all directions, including the foreground and background. Joe has the ability to punch, kick, and dodge\u2014which he can do by leaping upward or ducking. Dodging enemies' attacks successfully temporarily dazes them, leaving them wide open for attack.<ref name=\"EuroG\">{{cite web | author=Bramwell, Tom | date=13 October 2003 | title=Viewtiful Joe Review // GC | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_viewtifuljoe_gc | publisher=Eurogamer | accessdate=2009-02-22 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229130920/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_viewtifuljoe_gc | archivedate=29 December 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The player has certain number of [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] in the form of \"Life Marks\" located above the VFX Gauge, which decrease whenever Joe takes damage.

The setting is divided between [[Earth]], or the [[Reality|real world]], and \"Movieland\", the game's fictional world of films. The plot begins in a movie theatre on Earth in which the game's central character Joe and his girlfriend Silvia are watching a [[tokusatsu]] drama starring the aged superhero Captain Blue. The movie's antagonist, having seemingly defeated Captain Blue, suddenly reaches out of the screen and abducts Silvia, taking her into Movieland. Joe is likewise picked up and taken into Movieland by Captain Blue's giant [[mecha]], \"Six Majin\". Inside the movie, Joe must rescue Silvia from the evil Jadow, the game's organization of [[villain]]s. To help him, Captain Blue entrusts him with a V-Watch, a device Joe can use to transform into a superhero upon saying the word \"henshin (transform).\"<ref>{{cite video game|title=Viewtiful Joe |developer=Capcom Production Studio 4|publisher=Capcom|date=26 June 2003|platform=Nintendo GameCube|quote='''Captain Blue:''' Ahh, your heroness has awakened.

One by one, Joe defeats the members of the Jadow, the game's [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. These include Dark Fiend Charles the 3rd, Iron [[Ogre]] Hulk Davidson, Aquatic Terror Gran Bruce, a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of Viewtiful Joe, and Blade Master Alastor. Before fighting Alastor, he reveals that in order for the Jadow to break out of Movieland and into the land of humans, they need the \"[[DNA]] of the Creator\", namely Silvia.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Viewtiful Joe |developer=Capcom Production Studio 4|publisher=Capcom|date=26 June 2003|platform=Nintendo GameCube|quote='''Alastor:''' The key to our success lies in the DNA of the Creator.

Joe and Six Machine race off into outer space after her in the game's final episode.\n\nFinding Silvia atop the control room of a space station, Joe discovers that Captain Blue has been behind the plot the entire time.

He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon thought of as a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns of a large number of [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] heading towards Earth.

Sign language should not be confused with [[body language]], a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].\n\nWherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed as handy means of communication and they form the core of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as [[Child of deaf adult|children of deaf adults]].\n\nIt is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own native sign language, and some have more than one.

One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: \"If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?\"<ref name=\"bauman2008\">{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=978-0-8166-4619-7}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself.

Oxford: Halton, 1680.</ref> in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an \"arthrological\" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;<ref>See Wilkins (1641) above.

Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.\n\n[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.<ref>Charles de La Fin (1692).

In 1755, Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.<ref>Canlas (2006).</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College.

While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.<ref>Johnston (1989).</ref> The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.<ref>Taub (2001).</ref> This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.\n\nSign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s, from the Greek word for \"hand\", in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s, from Greek for \"voice\", of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although crude distinctions are often also made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].<ref>Fabian Bross (2016).

More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions \"function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information\".<ref>Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research.

Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.{{Which|date=June 2019}}\n\nToday, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category \"sign languages\" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,<ref>p. 970-972.

Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as \"inventors\" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.\n\nAs a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.\n\nOn the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.<ref>Nakamura (1995).</ref>\n\nSimilarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.\n\n=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===\n[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|\"Hello\" in ASL (American sign language)]]\n[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of \"hello\" in ASL (American sign language)]]\nSign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.\n\nOne way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[Classifier constructions in sign languages|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.\n\nThe large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry<ref>Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.</ref> or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).\n\n=== Non-manual elements ===\nSign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.\n\nAt the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.<ref>Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |editor1=Josep Quer i Carbonell |editor2=Carlo Cecchetto |editor3=Rannveig Sverrisd \u00c3ttir |year=2017 |isbn=9781501511806 |oclc=1012688117}}</ref>\n\nWhile the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).<ref>Fabian Bross & Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}.

Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.<ref>Baker, Charlotte (1977).

New York: Academic Press</ref>\n\n=== Iconicity ===\n[[Iconicity]] is similarity or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to [[Arbitrariness#Linguistics|arbitrariness]]. The first studies on iconicity in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.<ref>Frishberg (1975)</ref><ref>Klima & Bellugi (1979)</ref> Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, when deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.<ref>Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. \"The Signs of Language.\" Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.</ref> Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.<ref>Brentari, Diane. \"Introduction.\" Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.</ref> Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.\n\nIn 1978, Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to suggest that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.<ref>Brown, R. (1978). ''Why Are Signed Languages Easier to Learn than Spoken Languages? Part Two. Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 32(3), 25.''{{doi|10.2307/3823113}}</ref>  In his study, Brown found that when a group of six hearing children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than another group of six children that were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties. In contrast to Brown, linguists [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]] and Richard Meier found that iconicity \"appears to have virtually no impact on the acquisition of American Sign Language\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The crosslinguistic study of language acquisition|last=Newport|first=Elissa|last2=Meier|first2=Richard|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1985|isbn=0898593670|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/crosslinguistics0001unse/page/881 881\u2013938]|url=https://archive.org/details/crosslinguistics0001unse/page/881}}</ref>\n\nA central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or \"English on the hands.\" One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.\n\nThe [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.<ref name=\"Taub 2001\">Taub (2001)</ref> In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation (\"[[construal]]\" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.<ref>Wilcox (2004)</ref>\n\nThe cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.<ref name=\"Wilcox 2000\">Wilcox (2000)</ref> In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for \"ask\" has parts of its form that are iconic (\"movement away from the mouth\" means \"something coming from the mouth\"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).<ref name=\"Meir 2010\">Meir (2010)</ref>\n\nMany signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is \"learning\". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as \"double mapped\".<ref name=\"Taub 2001\"/><ref name=\"Wilcox 2000\"/><ref name=\"Meir 2010\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Classification ===\n{{See also|List of sign languages}}\n[[File:Sign language families.svg|thumb|300px|Sign language families I|\n|'''The classification of Sign Language families'''\n{{Legend|#5d6a8f|[[French Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#1e2f5d|[[American Sign Language]] (ASL) cluster}}\n{{Legend|#93a1c7|[[Russian Sign Language]] cluster}}\n{{Legend|#a8d3db|[[Czech Sign Language]] cluster}}\n{{Legend|#9c6cd0|[[Danish Sign Language]] family}}\n{{Legend|#a596d8|[[Swedish Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#b08660|[[German Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#660066|[[Vietnamese sign languages]] & some Thai and Lao SLs}}\n{{Legend|#383834|[[Arab sign-language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#99ff00|[[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#ff9691|[[Chinese Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#bd4b31|[[Japanese Sign Language family]] (including Taiwanese Sign Language)}}\n{{Legend|#4b874b|[[BANZSL]] family (British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language)}}\n{{Legend|#1c5e31|[[South African Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#fff200|Isolated languages}}\n{{Legend|#e6e6e6|No data}}]]\nAlthough sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.\n\nSign languages may be classified by how they arise.\n\nIn non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.\n\nA [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |editor1-last= Marschark |editor1-first= Marc |editor2-last= Spencer |editor2-first= Patricia Elizabeth |title= Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0mmJAgAAQBAJ |volume= 2 |location= New York |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-539003-2 |oclc= 779907637 |access-date= 2016-11-05 }}</ref> The most famous of these is probably the extinct [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] of the US, but there are also numerous village languages scattered throughout Africa, Asia, and America.\n\n[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.\n\nBoth contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.\n\n[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&nbsp;\u2013 it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the \"gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa\", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.<ref>Frishberg (1987).

There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.\n** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].\n* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.\n* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.\n* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a \"cluster\" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.\n* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].\n* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].\n\nThe only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.<ref>Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.</ref> The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.{{refn |Wittmann's classification went into Ethnologue's database where it is still cited.<ref>{{cite web |editor1=Simons, Gary F. |editor2=Charles D.

He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Typology ===\n{{See also|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.\n\nSign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.\n\nSign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.\n\nBrentari<ref name=\"Brentari1998\">Brentari, Diane (1998): A prosodic model of sign language phonology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref><ref>Brentari, Diane (2002): Modality differences in sign language phonology and morphophonemics. In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35\u201336; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref> classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).\n\nAnother aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zeshan | first1 = Ulrike | last2 = Ernesto Escobedo Delgado | first2 = Cesar | last3 = Dikyuva | first3 = Hasan | last4 = Panda | first4 = Sibaji | last5 = de Vos | first5 = Connie | year = 2013 | title = Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology | url = | journal = Linguistic Typology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 357\u2013396 }}</ref> Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.\n\n=== Acquisition ===\n{{See also|Language acquisition}}\n\nChildren who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}</ref>\n\nThe Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the [[brain plasticity|plasticity]] of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|website=ACFOS|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThe acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don't have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262\u2013290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}</ref>\n\n=== Written forms ===\n{{anchor|Notation}}<!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here -->\nSign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form.

Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press</ref> is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.\n* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.\n* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].\n* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.\n* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.\n* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).\n*The Alphabetic Writing System for sign languages (''Sistema de escritura alfab\u00e9tica'', SEA, by its Spanish name and acronym), developed by linguist \u00c1ngel Herrero Blanco and two deaf researchers, Juan Jos\u00e9 Alfaro and Inmacualada Cascales, was published as a book in 2003<ref>{{Cite book|title=Escritura alfab\u00e9tica de la Lengua de Signos Espa\u00f1ola : once lecciones|last=Herrero Blanco, \u00c1ngel L.|date=2003|publisher=Publicaciones de la Universidad de Alicante|others=Alfaro, Juan Jos\u00e9,, Cascales, Inmaculada|isbn=9781282574960|location=San Vicente del Raspeig [Alicante]|oclc=643124997}}</ref> and made accessible in [[Spanish Sign Language]] on-line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/seccion/signos/psegundonivel.jsp?seccion=signos&conten=materiales&pagina=cat_materiales1&tit3=Lecciones+de+escritura+alfab%25E9tica+de+LSE|title=Biblioteca de signos - Materiales|website=www.cervantesvirtual.com|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> This system makes use of the letters of the Latin alphabet with a few diacritics to represent sign through the morphemic sequence S L C Q D F (bimanual sign, place, contact, handshape, direction and internal form). The resulting words are meant to be read by signing. The system is designed to be applicable to any sign language with minimal modification and to be usable through any medium without special equipment or software. Non-manual elements can be encoded to some extent, but the authors argue that the system does not need to represent all elements of a sign to be practical, the same way written oral language doesn't.

It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.\nIn the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSigns may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.\n\n=== Legal recognition ===\n{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}\nSome sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.\n\nThe interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.\n\nWith recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent deep learning based [[machine translation of sign languages|machine translation algorithms]] have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.<ref>{{cite conference |last=Huang |first=Jie |last2=Zhou |first2=Wengang |last3=Zhang |first3=Qilin |last4=Li |first4=Houqiang |last5=Li |first5=Weiping |title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation |conference=32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), Feb. 2-7, 2018, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA |date=2018-01-30 |url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-29 |arxiv=1801.10111 }}</ref> \n{{clear}}\n\n=== Remote interpreting ===\n<!-- Note: the following text was originally copied from [[Language interpretation#Video interpreting|Language interpretation]]\nbut has been adapted extensively to fit into the context of this article.\n -->\n[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|upright|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]\n{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}\n\nInterpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.\n\nHowever, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Interpretation on television ===\n[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]\n\nSign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.\n\n[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.<ref>{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | accessdate=2008-01-30 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.<ref name=\"RNID\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 }}</ref>  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed.

Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.\n\n=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===\n{{Main|Manually coded language}}\n\nWhen Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.\n\n=== \"Baby sign language\" with hearing children ===\n{{Main|Baby sign language}}\n\nSome hearing parents teach signs to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs are seen as a beneficial option for better communication.<ref>Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.</ref> Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.{{cn|date=February 2020}} This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants. When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThis is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.\n\n=== Home sign ===\n{{Main|Home sign}}\n\nInformal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes \"kitchen sign\").<ref>Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow & Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].</ref>\n\nHome sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.<ref>The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard.

Sign language should not be confused with [[body language]], a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].\n\nWherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed as handy means of communication and they form the core of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as [[Child of deaf adult|children of deaf adults]].\n\nIt is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists 137 sign languages.<ref>{{citation\n |contribution  = Deaf sign language\n |title         = Ethnologue: Languages of the World\n |year          = 2013\n |edition       = 17th\n |publisher     = SIL International\n |accessdate    = 2013-12-03\n |editor1-last  = Lewis\n |editor1-first = M.

One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: \"If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?\"<ref name=\"bauman2008\">{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=978-0-8166-4619-7}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. [[Pedro Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] (1520\u20131584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1= K.E..|title=A Disability History of the United States |date=2012 |publisher= Beacon Press |isbn=9780807022047 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[Juan Pablo Bonet]] published {{lang|es|Reducci\u00f3n de las letras y arte para ense\u00f1ar a hablar a los mudos}} (\u2018Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak\u2019) in Madrid.<ref>Pablo Bonet, J. de (1620) ''Reduction de las letras y Arte para ense\u00f1ar \u00e1 ablar los Mudos''.

''Mercury, the Swift and Silent Messenger''. The book is a work on cryptography, and fingerspelling was referred to as one method of \"secret discoursing, by signes and gestures\".  Wilkins gave an example of such a system: \"Let the tops of the fingers signifie the five vowels; the middle parts, the first five consonants; the bottomes of them, the five next consonants; the spaces betwixt the fingers the foure next.  One finger laid on the side of the hand may signifie T.  Two fingers V the consonant; Three W.  The little finger crossed X.  The wrist Y.  The middle of the hand Z.\" (1641:116-117)</ref> public speaking, or communication by deaf people.<ref>John Bulwer's \"Chirologia: or the natural language of the hand.\", published in 1644, London, mentions that alphabets are in use by deaf people, although Bulwer presents a different system which is focused on public speaking.</ref> In 1648, [[John Bulwer]] described \"Master Babington\", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, \"contryved on the joynts of his fingers\", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of [[tactile signing]].<ref>Bulwer, J. (1648) ''Philocopus, or the Deaf and Dumbe Mans Friend'', London: Humphrey and Moseley.</ref>\n\nIn 1680, [[George Dalgarno]] published ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor'',<ref>Dalgarno, George. ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor''. Oxford: Halton, 1680.</ref> in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an \"arthrological\" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;<ref>See Wilkins (1641) above. Wilkins was aware that the systems he describes are old, and refers to Bede's account of Roman and Greek finger alphabets.</ref> some have speculated that they can be traced to early [[Ogham]] manual alphabets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |title=Session 9 |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102335/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 }}</ref><ref>Montgomery, G. \"The Ancient Origins of Sign Handshapes\" ''Sign Language Studies'' '''2'''(3) (2002): 322-334.</ref>\n\nThe [[vowel]]s of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern [[two-handed alphabet]] appeared in 1698 with ''Digiti Lingua'' (Latin for ''Language'' [or ''Tongue''] ''of the Finger''), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak.<ref>Moser H.M., O'Neill J.J., Oyer H.J., Wolfe S.M., Abernathy E.A., and Schowe, B.M. \"Historical Aspects of Manual Communication\" ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'' '''25''' (1960) 145-151.<br />\nand Hay, A. and Lee, R. ''A Pictorial History of the evolution of the British Manual Alphabet'' (British Deaf History Society Publications: Middlesex, 2004)</ref>  He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.\n\n[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.<ref>Charles de La Fin (1692). ''Sermo mirabilis, or, The silent language whereby one may learn ... how to impart his mind to his friend, in any language ... being a wonderful art kept secret for several ages in Padua, and now published only to the wise and prudent ...'' London, Printed for Tho. Salusbury... and sold by Randal Taylor... 1692. {{OCLC|27245872}}</ref> He described such codes for both English and Latin.\n\nBy 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.<ref>Daniel Defoe (1720). \"The Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell\"</ref> Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.\n\nFrenchman [[Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e|Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e]] published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.<ref>Canlas (2006).</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College.

The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language.

While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.<ref>Johnston (1989).</ref> The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.<ref>Taub (2001).</ref> This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.\n\nSign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s, from the Greek word for \"hand\", in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s, from Greek for \"voice\", of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although crude distinctions are often also made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].<ref>Fabian Bross (2016).

More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions \"function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information\".<ref>Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research.

Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.{{Which|date=June 2019}}\n\nToday, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category \"sign languages\" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,<ref>p. 970-972.

Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as \"inventors\" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.\n\nAs a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.\n\nOn the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.<ref>Nakamura (1995).</ref>\n\nSimilarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.\n\n=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===\n[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|\"Hello\" in ASL (American sign language)]]\n[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of \"hello\" in ASL (American sign language)]]\nSign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.\n\nOne way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[Classifier constructions in sign languages|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.\n\nThe large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry<ref>Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.</ref> or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).\n\n=== Non-manual elements ===\nSign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.\n\nAt the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.<ref>Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |editor1=Josep Quer i Carbonell |editor2=Carlo Cecchetto |editor3=Rannveig Sverrisd \u00c3ttir |year=2017 |isbn=9781501511806 |oclc=1012688117}}</ref>\n\nWhile the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).<ref>Fabian Bross & Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}.

Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.<ref>Baker, Charlotte (1977).

New York: Academic Press</ref>\n\n=== Iconicity ===\n[[Iconicity]] is similarity or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to [[Arbitrariness#Linguistics|arbitrariness]]. The first studies on iconicity in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.<ref>Frishberg (1975)</ref><ref>Klima & Bellugi (1979)</ref> Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, when deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.<ref>Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. \"The Signs of Language.\" Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.</ref> Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.<ref>Brentari, Diane. \"Introduction.\" Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.</ref> Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.\n\nIn 1978, Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to suggest that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.<ref>Brown, R. (1978). ''Why Are Signed Languages Easier to Learn than Spoken Languages? Part Two. Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 32(3), 25.''{{doi|10.2307/3823113}}</ref>  In his study, Brown found that when a group of six hearing children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than another group of six children that were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties. In contrast to Brown, linguists [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]] and Richard Meier found that iconicity \"appears to have virtually no impact on the acquisition of American Sign Language\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The crosslinguistic study of language acquisition|last=Newport|first=Elissa|last2=Meier|first2=Richard|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1985|isbn=0898593670|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/crosslinguistics0001unse/page/881 881\u2013938]|url=https://archive.org/details/crosslinguistics0001unse/page/881}}</ref>\n\nA central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or \"English on the hands.\" One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.\n\nThe [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.<ref name=\"Taub 2001\">Taub (2001)</ref> In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation (\"[[construal]]\" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.<ref>Wilcox (2004)</ref>\n\nThe cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.<ref name=\"Wilcox 2000\">Wilcox (2000)</ref> In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for \"ask\" has parts of its form that are iconic (\"movement away from the mouth\" means \"something coming from the mouth\"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).<ref name=\"Meir 2010\">Meir (2010)</ref>\n\nMany signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is \"learning\". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as \"double mapped\".<ref name=\"Taub 2001\"/><ref name=\"Wilcox 2000\"/><ref name=\"Meir 2010\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Classification ===\n{{See also|List of sign languages}}\n[[File:Sign language families.svg|thumb|300px|Sign language families I|\n|'''The classification of Sign Language families'''\n{{Legend|#5d6a8f|[[French Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#1e2f5d|[[American Sign Language]] (ASL) cluster}}\n{{Legend|#93a1c7|[[Russian Sign Language]] cluster}}\n{{Legend|#a8d3db|[[Czech Sign Language]] cluster}}\n{{Legend|#9c6cd0|[[Danish Sign Language]] family}}\n{{Legend|#a596d8|[[Swedish Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#b08660|[[German Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#660066|[[Vietnamese sign languages]] & some Thai and Lao SLs}}\n{{Legend|#383834|[[Arab sign-language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#99ff00|[[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#ff9691|[[Chinese Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#bd4b31|[[Japanese Sign Language family]] (including Taiwanese Sign Language)}}\n{{Legend|#4b874b|[[BANZSL]] family (British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language)}}\n{{Legend|#1c5e31|[[South African Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#fff200|Isolated languages}}\n{{Legend|#e6e6e6|No data}}]]\nAlthough sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.\n\nSign languages may be classified by how they arise.\n\nIn non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.\n\nA [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |editor1-last= Marschark |editor1-first= Marc |editor2-last= Spencer |editor2-first= Patricia Elizabeth |title= Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0mmJAgAAQBAJ |volume= 2 |location= New York |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-539003-2 |oclc= 779907637 |access-date= 2016-11-05 }}</ref> The most famous of these is probably the extinct [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] of the US, but there are also numerous village languages scattered throughout Africa, Asia, and America.\n\n[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.\n\nBoth contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.\n\n[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&nbsp;\u2013 it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the \"gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa\", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.<ref>Frishberg (1987).

There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.\n** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].\n* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.\n* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.\n* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a \"cluster\" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.\n* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].\n* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].\n\nThe only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.<ref>Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.</ref> The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.{{refn |Wittmann's classification went into Ethnologue's database where it is still cited.<ref>{{cite web |editor1=Simons, Gary F. |editor2=Charles D.

He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Typology ===\n{{See also|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.\n\nSign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.\n\nSign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.\n\nBrentari<ref name=\"Brentari1998\">Brentari, Diane (1998): A prosodic model of sign language phonology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref><ref>Brentari, Diane (2002): Modality differences in sign language phonology and morphophonemics. In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35\u201336; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref> classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).\n\nAnother aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zeshan | first1 = Ulrike | last2 = Ernesto Escobedo Delgado | first2 = Cesar | last3 = Dikyuva | first3 = Hasan | last4 = Panda | first4 = Sibaji | last5 = de Vos | first5 = Connie | year = 2013 | title = Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology | url = | journal = Linguistic Typology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 357\u2013396 }}</ref> Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.\n\n=== Acquisition ===\n{{See also|Language acquisition}}\n\nChildren who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}</ref>\n\nThe Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the [[brain plasticity|plasticity]] of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|website=ACFOS|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThe acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don't have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262\u2013290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}</ref>\n\n=== Written forms ===\n{{anchor|Notation}}<!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here -->\nSign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form.

Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press</ref> is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.\n* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.\n* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].\n* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.\n* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.\n* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).\n*The Alphabetic Writing System for sign languages (''Sistema de escritura alfab\u00e9tica'', SEA, by its Spanish name and acronym), developed by linguist \u00c1ngel Herrero Blanco and two deaf researchers, Juan Jos\u00e9 Alfaro and Inmacualada Cascales, was published as a book in 2003<ref>{{Cite book|title=Escritura alfab\u00e9tica de la Lengua de Signos Espa\u00f1ola : once lecciones|last=Herrero Blanco, \u00c1ngel L.|date=2003|publisher=Publicaciones de la Universidad de Alicante|others=Alfaro, Juan Jos\u00e9,, Cascales, Inmaculada|isbn=9781282574960|location=San Vicente del Raspeig [Alicante]|oclc=643124997}}</ref> and made accessible in [[Spanish Sign Language]] on-line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/seccion/signos/psegundonivel.jsp?seccion=signos&conten=materiales&pagina=cat_materiales1&tit3=Lecciones+de+escritura+alfab%25E9tica+de+LSE|title=Biblioteca de signos - Materiales|website=www.cervantesvirtual.com|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> This system makes use of the letters of the Latin alphabet with a few diacritics to represent sign through the morphemic sequence S L C Q D F (bimanual sign, place, contact, handshape, direction and internal form). The resulting words are meant to be read by signing. The system is designed to be applicable to any sign language with minimal modification and to be usable through any medium without special equipment or software. Non-manual elements can be encoded to some extent, but the authors argue that the system does not need to represent all elements of a sign to be practical, the same way written oral language doesn't.

It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.\nIn the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSigns may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.\n\n=== Legal recognition ===\n{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}\nSome sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.\n\nThe interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.\n\nWith recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent deep learning based [[machine translation of sign languages|machine translation algorithms]] have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.<ref>{{cite conference |last=Huang |first=Jie |last2=Zhou |first2=Wengang |last3=Zhang |first3=Qilin |last4=Li |first4=Houqiang |last5=Li |first5=Weiping |title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation |conference=32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), Feb. 2-7, 2018, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA |date=2018-01-30 |url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-29 |arxiv=1801.10111 }}</ref> \n{{clear}}\n\n=== Remote interpreting ===\n<!-- Note: the following text was originally copied from [[Language interpretation#Video interpreting|Language interpretation]]\nbut has been adapted extensively to fit into the context of this article.\n -->\n[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|upright|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]\n{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}\n\nInterpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.\n\nHowever, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Interpretation on television ===\n[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]\n\nSign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.\n\n[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.<ref>{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | accessdate=2008-01-30 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.<ref name=\"RNID\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 }}</ref>  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed.

Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.\n\n=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===\n{{Main|Manually coded language}}\n\nWhen Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.\n\n=== \"Baby sign language\" with hearing children ===\n{{Main|Baby sign language}}\n\nSome hearing parents teach signs to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs are seen as a beneficial option for better communication.<ref>Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.</ref> Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.{{cn|date=February 2020}} This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants. When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThis is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.\n\n=== Home sign ===\n{{Main|Home sign}}\n\nInformal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes \"kitchen sign\").<ref>Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow & Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].</ref>\n\nHome sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.<ref>The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard.

However, the [[Slam Dunk Contest]] was not held, due to the risk of player injuries, lack of new dunking tricks and lack of big-name players in recent competitions. Instead, a 2Ball competition was held. [[Los Angeles Lakers]] guard [[Kobe Bryant]] became the youngest All-Star starter at age 19. Michael Jordan won his third All-Star MVP.\n* The Washington Bullets were renamed the \"Wizards\". They began the season at [[US Airways Arena (Washington, D.C.)|US Airways Arena]], then in December, they played their first game at the MCI Center (now [[Capital One Arena]]) during this season.\n* Due to the demolition of [[The Omni]] and the construction of the new [[Philips Arena]], the Atlanta Hawks split home games between [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum|Alexander Coliseum]] (Their original home where they played for four seasons when they moved to Atlanta in 1968.) and the [[Georgia Dome]].\n* [[Golden State Warriors]] swingman [[Latrell Sprewell]] made headlines by choking Warriors head coach [[P.

The Jazz had home-court advantage by virtue of the head-to-head match-up (the Jazz won the season series 2\u20130).\n* Two new records were set in Game 3 of the NBA Finals: biggest margin of victory (42 points) and fewest points scored in an NBA Finals game (54) in the Bulls' rout of the Jazz.\n* The [[San Antonio Spurs]] set a league record for the biggest single-season turnaround (36 wins), breaking their own record set in the [[1989\u201390 NBA season]]; it was later broken by [[2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season|the 2007\u201308 Boston Celtics]].\n* Following head coach [[Phil Jackson]]'s decision to not return to the Bulls, [[Michael Jordan]] announced his second retirement from the NBA during the following offseason. This was Jordan's final season with the Chicago Bulls. Scottie Pippen was traded for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. Dennis Rodman was not re-signed either, leading to the end of an era for the Bulls and the NBA.\n* [[Houston Rockets]] guard [[Clyde Drexler]] retired after fifteen seasons, twelve of which he spent with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], where he led the team to two NBA Finals, in [[1990 NBA Finals|1990]] and [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]].

The Nuggets also equaled the longest single-season losing streak with 23 consecutive losses, sharing the mark with [[1995\u201396 Vancouver Grizzlies season|the 1995\u201396 Vancouver Grizzlies]].\n* All the Western Conference teams who missed the playoffs had 55 or more losses. Four of them lost more than 62 games. The ninth-placed [[Sacramento Kings]] finished the season with a 27\u201355 record, losing nineteen of their last twenty games.

All the Eastern Conference teams who missed the playoffs had 31 or more wins except for the [[Toronto Raptors]], who finished with a 16\u201366 record.\n* [[Violet Palmer]] and [[Dee Kantner]] became the first two female officials in NBA history (as well as any of the four major professional sports leagues). Kantner would be fired following the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], while Palmer would go on to have long 19-year career before retiring after the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\n==1997\u201398 NBA changes==\n* The [[Atlanta Hawks]] split their home games playing in the [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Georgia Dome]], due to the demolition of [[The Omni]].\n* The [[Charlotte Hornets]] changed their uniforms adding teal (home), and purple (road) to the side of their jerseys.\n* The [[Chicago Bulls]] removed the pinstripes from their alternate uniforms.\n* The [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] slightly changed their uniforms.\n* The [[Golden State Warriors]] changed their logo and  uniforms, changing their colors to navy, orange and gold.\n* The [[Indiana Pacers]] changed their uniforms adding pinstripes to their jerseys.\n* The [[New Jersey Nets]] changed their logo and uniforms, replacing blue with navy to go with red in their color scheme.\n* The [[New York Knicks]] changed their home uniforms, adding blue to the side of their jerseys.

However, the [[Slam Dunk Contest]] was not held, due to the risk of player injuries, lack of new dunking tricks and lack of big-name players in recent competitions. Instead, a 2Ball competition was held. [[Los Angeles Lakers]] guard [[Kobe Bryant]] became the youngest All-Star starter at age 19. Michael Jordan won his third All-Star MVP.\n* The Washington Bullets were renamed the \"Wizards\". They began the season at [[US Airways Arena (Washington, D.C.)|US Airways Arena]], then in December, they played their first game at the MCI Center (now [[Capital One Arena]]) during this season.\n* Due to the demolition of [[The Omni]] and the construction of the new [[Philips Arena]], the Atlanta Hawks split home games between [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum|Alexander Coliseum]] (Their original home where they played for four seasons when they moved to Atlanta in 1968.) and the [[Georgia Dome]].\n* [[Golden State Warriors]] swingman [[Latrell Sprewell]] made headlines by choking Warriors head coach [[P.

Sprewell would be traded to the [[New York Knicks]] in the off-season that followed.\n* [[Michael Jordan]] passed [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] as the all-time leader in points scored in the NBA Playoffs.\n* The Utah Jazz and the Chicago Bulls shared the league's best record at 62\u201320, and met each other in the NBA Finals. The Jazz had home-court advantage by virtue of the head-to-head match-up (the Jazz won the season series 2\u20130).\n* Two new records were set in Game 3 of the NBA Finals: biggest margin of victory (42 points) and fewest points scored in an NBA Finals game (54) in the Bulls' rout of the Jazz.\n* The [[San Antonio Spurs]] set a league record for the biggest single-season turnaround (36 wins), breaking their own record set in the [[1989\u201390 NBA season]]; it was later broken by [[2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season|the 2007\u201308 Boston Celtics]].\n* Following head coach [[Phil Jackson]]'s decision to not return to the Bulls, [[Michael Jordan]] announced his second retirement from the NBA during the following offseason. This was Jordan's final season with the Chicago Bulls. Scottie Pippen was traded for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. Dennis Rodman was not re-signed either, leading to the end of an era for the Bulls and the NBA.\n* [[Houston Rockets]] guard [[Clyde Drexler]] retired after fifteen seasons, twelve of which he spent with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], where he led the team to two NBA Finals, in [[1990 NBA Finals|1990]] and [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]]. He won his only NBA championship in [[1995 NBA Finals|1995]] while playing for the Rockets.\n* [[Dallas Mavericks]] forward [[A.C.

Other NBA teams were outfitted by [[Starter Clothing Line]], [[Puma AG|Puma]], [[Reebok]] or [[Champion (sportswear)|Champion]].\n* The [[Denver Nuggets]] lost 71 games, joining [[1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers season|the 1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers]], [[1986\u201387 Los Angeles Clippers season|1986\u201387 Los Angeles Clippers]], and [[1992\u201393 Dallas Mavericks season|1992\u201393 Dallas Mavericks]] (plus subsequently [[2009\u201310 New Jersey Nets season|the 2009\u201310 Nets]] and [[2015\u201316 Philadelphia 76ers season|2015\u201316 76ers]]) as the only teams to lose 70 games in a season. The Nuggets also equaled the longest single-season losing streak with 23 consecutive losses, sharing the mark with [[1995\u201396 Vancouver Grizzlies season|the 1995\u201396 Vancouver Grizzlies]].\n* All the Western Conference teams who missed the playoffs had 55 or more losses. Four of them lost more than 62 games. The ninth-placed [[Sacramento Kings]] finished the season with a 27\u201355 record, losing nineteen of their last twenty games. The Kings finished fourteen games behind the #8 seeded [[Houston Rockets]] at 41\u201341, whilst the tenth-placed [[Dallas Mavericks]] ended with a 20\u201362 record. All the Eastern Conference teams who missed the playoffs had 31 or more wins except for the [[Toronto Raptors]], who finished with a 16\u201366 record.\n* [[Violet Palmer]] and [[Dee Kantner]] became the first two female officials in NBA history (as well as any of the four major professional sports leagues). Kantner would be fired following the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], while Palmer would go on to have long 19-year career before retiring after the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\n==1997\u201398 NBA changes==\n* The [[Atlanta Hawks]] split their home games playing in the [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Georgia Dome]], due to the demolition of [[The Omni]].\n* The [[Charlotte Hornets]] changed their uniforms adding teal (home), and purple (road) to the side of their jerseys.\n* The [[Chicago Bulls]] removed the pinstripes from their alternate uniforms.\n* The [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] slightly changed their uniforms.\n* The [[Golden State Warriors]] changed their logo and  uniforms, changing their colors to navy, orange and gold.\n* The [[Indiana Pacers]] changed their uniforms adding pinstripes to their jerseys.\n* The [[New Jersey Nets]] changed their logo and uniforms, replacing blue with navy to go with red in their color scheme.\n* The [[New York Knicks]] changed their home uniforms, adding blue to the side of their jerseys.

At the time, the building served as a prison, where notably [[Winston Churchill]] was briefly imprisoned.<ref name=\"winstonchurchill.org\">The Churchill Centre: {{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/myths/churchill-trivia/540-war|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308071358/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/myths/churchill-trivia/540-war|archivedate=8 March 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=2013-02-16|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe school was part of the [[White South Africans|whites-only]] education system, until the abolition of [[apartheid]].\n\n=== Pretoria High School (1901-1903) ===\n\nWith Pretoria under British control, it became apparent to [[Lord Milner]], the [[Provincial Secretary|Colonial Secretary]] at the time, that the educational facilities in the city needed attention as there was no secondary school for English-speaking pupils. The [[Staats Model School]] was duly refurbished. It was renamed ''Pretoria High School'' and became the first of the so-called ''Milner schools'' in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], opening on 3 June 1901 with Charles Hope - who also founded [[Potchefstroom Boys High]] as [[headmaster]].  Initial enrolment was 32 pupils, both boys and girls, which increased to 132 by August of that year. Mr Hope left 15 months later, along with the girls, who were finally accommodated into the old building of the former [[Transvaal Republic]]'s ''Staatsmeischjeskool'' (State Girls' School), which was renamed [[Pretoria High School for Girls]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Pretoria College (1903-1909) ===\n\nUnder the new headmaster, Harold Atkinson, enrolment increased to 100 boys by 1903. The name of the school was also changed to ''Pretoria College''. Mr Atkinson left at the end of 1905 and was succeeded by J F Acheson who stayed with the school until it moved from Skinner Street to its current site in 1909. Formal devolution between primary and high school pupils only occurred in 1905.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== The new buildings and bilingualism (1910-1920) ===\n\nMilner's intention was to create a stable educational infrastructure in the new colony's capital and duly set aside {{convert|200|ha}} of ground to the south-east of central Pretoria for the construction of new academic institutions. The southern most {{convert|60|ha}}, which included the ''[[Waterkloof]] Kop'' (English: Waterkloof Hill), was chosen as the new site for Pretoria Boys High School. The architect, [[Patrick Eagle]], met the challenge by designing an edifice rivalling its larger contemporary, Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s [[Union Buildings]]. Eagle chose to site the main buildings on the ridge of the hill giving the school its well-known dramatic setting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\nOne year later, the four colonies of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], [[Orange Free State]], [[Natal Province|Natal]] and the [[Cape Colony|Cape]]  formed the [[Union of South Africa]]. Keen to forge unity between English and Dutch (Afrikaner) South Africans, Smuts' influence was evident when, on 6 April 1910, the school absorbed 100 boys and staff from the Dutch-medium Eendracht High School to form a dual-medium high school. The combined school was now named ''Pretoria High School for Boys - Pretoria Hogere school voor Jongens''. Smuts would later send his own sons to the school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Devolution and re-establishment (1920) ===\n\nThe dual-medium institution would last ten years. By 1920, the divide between English and Afrikaans speakers had become apparent nationwide; this was reflected in the need for a separate Afrikaans high school in Pretoria. Consequently, the [[Afrikaanse Ho\u00ebr Seunskool]] was formed immediately south of its parent, becoming the first Afrikaans-medium high school in the country, several years before [[Afrikaans]] attained official recognition as a language (and not a semi-[[Creole language|Creole]] of Dutch). The two schools enjoy close ties to this day, especially in an enthusiastic but friendly rivalry in sporting events. PBHS would now be left in its present form, known as Pretoria Boys High School, an English-medium public school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Headmasters since 1909 ===\n\n* William Hofmeyr (1909-1935)\n* Daniel Matheson (1936-1949)\n* Noel Pollock (1950-1955)\n* Desmond Abernethy (1956-1973)\n* Malcolm Armstrong (1974-1989)\n* William E.

The background colours of the four quadrants were the colours of the first four houses when given permanent names, i.e. Town red, Solomon gold, Sunnyside black and Rissik green.\n\n=== The school songs ===\n\nThe official school song, ''Tis Here We Learn To Live'', was written in the 1930s by two ''Old Boys''. The composer of the music, Dr George Findlay, was a prominent Pretoria [[dermatologist]]. However, the school later adopted [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]], originally the school song of [[Harrow School]] in [[London]]. It is this song that is sung at all school [[valedictions]]. The official school song was relegated to obscurity until it was revived as the school's rugby anthem.\n\n== Culture and activities ==\n\n=== Cultural activities ===\n\nCultural activities include a well-established musical tradition, with a formal [[symphony]] [[orchestra]], [[choir]], [[pipe band]], [[jazz]] ensemble and [[Folk music|folk]] group. Other activities include Photography, Fantasy and Historical war games, Aeronautical Society, Film, Wildlife, Drama, Debating, Chess, and many others.\n\n=== Athletics and leisure ===\n\nSporting facilities include soccer, [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standard athletics grounds, [[tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[basketball]] courts, a [[gym]]nasium, [[field hockey|hockey]] fields, two swimming pools including one for [[waterpolo]], an [[AstroTurf]] and a rock-climbing wall. There is also a man-made [[pine|pine forest]], an old [[shooting range]] which has been converted for the purpose of archery, an [[amphitheatre]] and an artificial lake, ''Loch Armstrong''. The grounds form a protected bird sanctuary and are home to several different species of birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.\n\n== School buildings ==\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\n=== Houses ===\n\nPretoria Boys High School is made up of ten constituent houses, each with its own unique culture and identity. House assemblies are held weekly, and house prefects are appointed annually. Annual inter-house sports meetings take place in which every pupil is strongly encouraged to participate. The inter-house swim meet (gala) is the most popular and well-attended of sport meetings.\n\n=== Boarding houses ===\n\n* Solomon\n* Rissik\n* School\n\n=== Day-boy houses ===\n\n* Abernethy\n* Arcadia\n* Armstrong\n* Hofmeyr\n* Matheson\n* Sunnyside\n* Town\n\n== The Old Boys Association ==\n\nPretoria Boys High School has a network of ''Old Boys'', forming one of the largest alumni organisations in South Africa. ''Pretoria Boys High School Old Boys Association'' publishes an annual journal and review, ''The Phobian'', which is distributed to ''Old Boys'' across the globe. Members of the association meet annually at the school for the annual dinner, and regular reunions of each matriculating group are organised 10, 20, 30 and 40 years on, echoing the refrain of the school song, [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]].\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n[[File:Max Theiler nobel.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Professor]] [[Max Theiler]] (1899\u20131972), 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] laureate, for developing a [[vaccine]] against [[yellow fever]]]]\n[[File:Nobel Prize 17 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Professor [[Michael Levitt]] (1947-), 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] laureate]]\n[[File:Edwin Cameron in robes.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Honourable]] [[Edwin Cameron]] (1953-), [[judge]] of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]]]]\n[[File:Elon Musk 2015.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Elon Musk]] (1971-), [[business magnate]] and founder of [[SpaceX]] and a co-founder of [[Zip2]], [[PayPal]], and [[Tesla Motors]]]]\nThe school has produced two [[List of South African Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize laureates]], eighteen [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholars]], eight [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] [[judge]]s, an [[archbishop]],{{clarify|date=June 2016}} two [[Premier League|English Premier League]] football players, seven national [[cricket]]ers and four [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] rugby players{{sfn|Illsley|2001}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Eddie Barlow]], South African cricketer\n* [[James Botten|Jackie Botten]], South African cricketer\n* [[Edwin Cameron]], Constitutional Court [[judge]] and AIDS activist\n* [[Billy Downer]], Advocate of the Supreme Court, National Prosecutor and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]]\n* [[David B.

The [[Staats Model School]] was duly refurbished. It was renamed ''Pretoria High School'' and became the first of the so-called ''Milner schools'' in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], opening on 3 June 1901 with Charles Hope - who also founded [[Potchefstroom Boys High]] as [[headmaster]].  Initial enrolment was 32 pupils, both boys and girls, which increased to 132 by August of that year. Mr Hope left 15 months later, along with the girls, who were finally accommodated into the old building of the former [[Transvaal Republic]]'s ''Staatsmeischjeskool'' (State Girls' School), which was renamed [[Pretoria High School for Girls]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Pretoria College (1903-1909) ===\n\nUnder the new headmaster, Harold Atkinson, enrolment increased to 100 boys by 1903. The name of the school was also changed to ''Pretoria College''. Mr Atkinson left at the end of 1905 and was succeeded by J F Acheson who stayed with the school until it moved from Skinner Street to its current site in 1909. Formal devolution between primary and high school pupils only occurred in 1905.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== The new buildings and bilingualism (1910-1920) ===\n\nMilner's intention was to create a stable educational infrastructure in the new colony's capital and duly set aside {{convert|200|ha}} of ground to the south-east of central Pretoria for the construction of new academic institutions. The southern most {{convert|60|ha}}, which included the ''[[Waterkloof]] Kop'' (English: Waterkloof Hill), was chosen as the new site for Pretoria Boys High School. The architect, [[Patrick Eagle]], met the challenge by designing an edifice rivalling its larger contemporary, Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s [[Union Buildings]]. Eagle chose to site the main buildings on the ridge of the hill giving the school its well-known dramatic setting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\nOne year later, the four colonies of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], [[Orange Free State]], [[Natal Province|Natal]] and the [[Cape Colony|Cape]]  formed the [[Union of South Africa]]. Keen to forge unity between English and Dutch (Afrikaner) South Africans, Smuts' influence was evident when, on 6 April 1910, the school absorbed 100 boys and staff from the Dutch-medium Eendracht High School to form a dual-medium high school. The combined school was now named ''Pretoria High School for Boys - Pretoria Hogere school voor Jongens''. Smuts would later send his own sons to the school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Devolution and re-establishment (1920) ===\n\nThe dual-medium institution would last ten years. By 1920, the divide between English and Afrikaans speakers had become apparent nationwide; this was reflected in the need for a separate Afrikaans high school in Pretoria. Consequently, the [[Afrikaanse Ho\u00ebr Seunskool]] was formed immediately south of its parent, becoming the first Afrikaans-medium high school in the country, several years before [[Afrikaans]] attained official recognition as a language (and not a semi-[[Creole language|Creole]] of Dutch). The two schools enjoy close ties to this day, especially in an enthusiastic but friendly rivalry in sporting events. PBHS would now be left in its present form, known as Pretoria Boys High School, an English-medium public school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Headmasters since 1909 ===\n\n* William Hofmeyr (1909-1935)\n* Daniel Matheson (1936-1949)\n* Noel Pollock (1950-1955)\n* Desmond Abernethy (1956-1973)\n* Malcolm Armstrong (1974-1989)\n* William E.

The shield component of the badge is divided into four quadrants, with the book representing learning, the tools the wealth of the Transvaal through gold mining, the tree growth and the ox wagon the Transvaal. The background colours of the four quadrants were the colours of the first four houses when given permanent names, i.e. Town red, Solomon gold, Sunnyside black and Rissik green.\n\n=== The school songs ===\n\nThe official school song, ''Tis Here We Learn To Live'', was written in the 1930s by two ''Old Boys''. The composer of the music, Dr George Findlay, was a prominent Pretoria [[dermatologist]]. However, the school later adopted [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]], originally the school song of [[Harrow School]] in [[London]]. It is this song that is sung at all school [[valedictions]]. The official school song was relegated to obscurity until it was revived as the school's rugby anthem.\n\n== Culture and activities ==\n\n=== Cultural activities ===\n\nCultural activities include a well-established musical tradition, with a formal [[symphony]] [[orchestra]], [[choir]], [[pipe band]], [[jazz]] ensemble and [[Folk music|folk]] group. Other activities include Photography, Fantasy and Historical war games, Aeronautical Society, Film, Wildlife, Drama, Debating, Chess, and many others.\n\n=== Athletics and leisure ===\n\nSporting facilities include soccer, [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standard athletics grounds, [[tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[basketball]] courts, a [[gym]]nasium, [[field hockey|hockey]] fields, two swimming pools including one for [[waterpolo]], an [[AstroTurf]] and a rock-climbing wall. There is also a man-made [[pine|pine forest]], an old [[shooting range]] which has been converted for the purpose of archery, an [[amphitheatre]] and an artificial lake, ''Loch Armstrong''. The grounds form a protected bird sanctuary and are home to several different species of birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.\n\n== School buildings ==\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\n=== Houses ===\n\nPretoria Boys High School is made up of ten constituent houses, each with its own unique culture and identity. House assemblies are held weekly, and house prefects are appointed annually. Annual inter-house sports meetings take place in which every pupil is strongly encouraged to participate. The inter-house swim meet (gala) is the most popular and well-attended of sport meetings.\n\n=== Boarding houses ===\n\n* Solomon\n* Rissik\n* School\n\n=== Day-boy houses ===\n\n* Abernethy\n* Arcadia\n* Armstrong\n* Hofmeyr\n* Matheson\n* Sunnyside\n* Town\n\n== The Old Boys Association ==\n\nPretoria Boys High School has a network of ''Old Boys'', forming one of the largest alumni organisations in South Africa. ''Pretoria Boys High School Old Boys Association'' publishes an annual journal and review, ''The Phobian'', which is distributed to ''Old Boys'' across the globe. Members of the association meet annually at the school for the annual dinner, and regular reunions of each matriculating group are organised 10, 20, 30 and 40 years on, echoing the refrain of the school song, [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]].\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n[[File:Max Theiler nobel.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Professor]] [[Max Theiler]] (1899\u20131972), 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] laureate, for developing a [[vaccine]] against [[yellow fever]]]]\n[[File:Nobel Prize 17 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Professor [[Michael Levitt]] (1947-), 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] laureate]]\n[[File:Edwin Cameron in robes.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Honourable]] [[Edwin Cameron]] (1953-), [[judge]] of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]]]]\n[[File:Elon Musk 2015.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Elon Musk]] (1971-), [[business magnate]] and founder of [[SpaceX]] and a co-founder of [[Zip2]], [[PayPal]], and [[Tesla Motors]]]]\nThe school has produced two [[List of South African Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize laureates]], eighteen [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholars]], eight [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] [[judge]]s, an [[archbishop]],{{clarify|date=June 2016}} two [[Premier League|English Premier League]] football players, seven national [[cricket]]ers and four [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] rugby players{{sfn|Illsley|2001}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Eddie Barlow]], South African cricketer\n* [[James Botten|Jackie Botten]], South African cricketer\n* [[Edwin Cameron]], Constitutional Court [[judge]] and AIDS activist\n* [[Billy Downer]], Advocate of the Supreme Court, National Prosecutor and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]]\n* [[David B.
