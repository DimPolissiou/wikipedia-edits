She was of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[German people|German]] descent. She had a younger sister, [[Helene Costello|Helene]], and the two made their first film appearances in the years 1909\u20131915 as child actresses for the [[Vitagraph Film Company]]. They played supporting roles in several films starring their father, who was a popular matinee idol at the time. Dolores Costello's earliest listed credit on the [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] is in the role of a fairy in a 1909 adaptation of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:John Barrymore and family 1934.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Costello with husband [[John Barrymore]] and their children, John Drew and Dolores, 1934]]\nThe two sisters appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] together as chorines and their success resulted in contracts with [[Warner Brothers Studios]]. In 1926, following small parts in feature films, she was selected by [[John Barrymore]] to star opposite him in ''[[The Sea Beast]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rainho|first1=Manny|title=This Month in Movie History|journal=Classic Images|date=March 2015|issue=477|page=26}}</ref> a loose adaptation of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] soon began starring her in her own vehicles. Meanwhile, she and [[John Barrymore|Barrymore]] became romantically involved and married in 1928.\n\nWithin a few years of achieving stardom, the delicately beautiful blonde-haired actress had become a successful and highly regarded film personality in her own right. As a young adult her career developed to the degree that in 1926, she was named a [[WAMPAS Baby Stars|WAMPAS Baby Star]], and had acquired the nickname \"The Goddess of the Silver Screen\".\n\nWarners alternated Costello between films with contemporary settings and elaborate costume dramas. In 1927, she was re-teamed with [[John Barrymore]] in ''[[When a Man Loves]]'', an adaptation of ''[[Manon Lescaut]]''.  In 1928, she co-starred with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] in ''[[Noah's Ark (1928 film)|Noah's Ark]]'', a part-talkie epic directed by [[Michael Curtiz]].\n\n[[File:Tenderloin poster.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Theater poster for ''[[Tenderloin (film)|Tenderloin]]'' (1928) starring Dolores Costello]]\n\nCostello spoke with a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]] and found it difficult to make the transition to talking pictures, but after two years of voice coaching she was comfortable speaking before a microphone. One of her early sound film appearances was with her sister Helene in [[Warner Bros.]]'s all-star extravaganza, ''[[The Show of Shows]]'' (1929).\n\nHer acting career became less a priority for her following the birth of her first child, Dolores Ethel Mae \"DeeDee\" Barrymore, on April 8, 1930, and she retired from the screen in 1931 to devote time to her family. Her second child, [[John Drew Barrymore]], was born on June 4, 1932, but the marriage proved difficult due to her husband's increasing [[alcoholism]], and they divorced in 1935.\n\nShe resumed her career a year later and achieved some successes, most notably in ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' ([[1936 in film|1936]]), and ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' ([[1942 in film|1942]]).  She retired permanently from acting following her appearance in ''[[This is the Army]]'' (1943), again under the direction of [[Michael Curtiz]].\n\nMaking a rare radio appearance, Costello appeared as the Danish Countess Elsa on the radio program ''Suspense'' with an air date of August 28, 1943. The title of the episode is ''The King's Birthday'' written by Corporal Leonard Pellitier US Army.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1939, she married Dr. John Vruwink, an obstetrician who was her physician during her pregnancies, but they divorced in 1950. Costello spent the remaining years of her life in semi-seclusion, managing an avocado farm. Her film career was largely ruined by the destructive effects of early film makeup, which ravaged her complexion too severely to camouflage.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aHSKSzyw8TEC&pg=PA89 ''Olive Borden: The Life and Films of Hollywood's Joy Girl''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Michelle Vogel] page&nbsp;89; Retrieved February&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2016</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PBIc4Mq_SFoC&pg=PA222 ''Orson Welles: A Biography''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Barbara Leaming] page&nbsp;222; Retrieved February&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2016</ref>  Her final film was ''This Is the Army'' (1943). In the 1970s her house was inundated in a flash flood which caused a good deal of damage to her property and memorabilia from her movie career and life with [[John Barrymore]].\n\nShortly before her death, she was interviewed for the documentary series ''[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]]'' (1980) discussing her film career. She died from [[emphysema]] in [[Fallbrook, California]], in 1979, and is interred in [[Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles]].\n\nDolores Costello has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for her contributions to Motion Pictures, at 1645 Vine Street.\n\n==Filmography==\n[[File:Dolores Costello, Ziegfeld girl, by Alfred Cheney Johnston, ca. 1923.jpg|thumb|Costello as a [[Ziegfeld girl]], c. 1923]]\n\n===Child roles===\nDolores Costello appeared as a child actress in many films made between 1909  and 1915 .

Cooper learned to fly as a child, and after service in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during [[World War II]], he was commissioned into the [[United States Air Force]] in 1949. After service as a fighter pilot, he qualified as a test pilot in 1956, and was selected as an astronaut in 1959.\n\nIn 1963 Cooper piloted the longest and last Mercury spaceflight, [[Mercury-Atlas 9]]. During that 34-hour mission he became the first American to spend an entire day in space, the first to sleep in space, and the last American launched on an entirely solo [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] mission. Despite a series of severe equipment failures, he managed to successfully complete the mission under manual control, guiding his spacecraft, which he named ''[[Faith 7]]'', to a [[splashdown]] just {{convert|4|mi}} ahead of the recovery ship. Cooper became the first astronaut to make a second orbital flight when he flew as Command Pilot of [[Gemini 5]] in 1965. Along with Pilot [[Pete Conrad]], he set a new space endurance record by traveling {{convert|3312993|mi}} in 190 hours and 56 minutes\u2014just short of eight days\u2014showing that astronauts could survive in space for the length of time necessary to go from the Earth to the Moon and back.\n\nCooper liked to race cars and boats, and entered the $28,000 Salton City {{Convert|500|mi|km|abbr=}} boat race, and the Southwest Championship Drag Boat races in 1965, and the 1967 Orange Bowl Regatta with fire fighter [[Red Adair]]. In 1968, he entered the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], but NASA management ordered him to withdraw due to the dangers involved. After serving as backup commander of the [[Apollo 10]] mission, he was superseded by [[Alan Shepard]], and retired from NASA and the Air Force with the rank of [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] in 1971.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLeroy Gordon Cooper Jr. was born on March 6, 1927, in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]],{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=336}} the only child of Leroy Gordon Cooper Sr. and his wife Hattie Lee {{nee}} Herd.<ref name=40thmerc7 /> His mother was a school teacher.

After the war, Cooper&nbsp;Sr. completed his high school education; Hattie Lee was one of his teachers, although she was only two years older than him. He joined the [[Oklahoma National Guard]], flying a [[Curtiss JN-4]] biplane, despite never having formal military pilot training. He graduated from college and law school, and became a [[State court (United States)|state district judge]].

He became a [[flight commander]] of the [[525th Fighter Squadron|525th Fighter Bomber Squadron]]. While in Germany, he attended the European Extension of the [[University of Maryland University College|University of Maryland]]. He returned to the United States in 1954, and studied for two years at the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] (AFIT) in [[Ohio]]. He completed his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aerospace Engineering]] there on August 28, 1956.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=337}}{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=13}}\n\nWhile at AFIT, Cooper met [[Gus Grissom]], a fellow USAF officer, and the two became good friends. They were involved in an accident on takeoff from [[Lowry Field]] on June 23, 1956, when the [[Lockheed T-33]] Cooper was piloting suddenly lost power. He aborted the takeoff, but the landing gear collapsed and the aircraft skidded erratically for {{convert|2000|ft}}, and crashed at the end of the runway, bursting into flames. Cooper and Grissom escaped unscathed, although the aircraft was a total loss.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=13}}\n\nCooper and Grissom attended the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|USAF Experimental Flight Test School]] (Class 56D) at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]] in 1956.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=13}} After graduation Cooper was posted to the [[Air Force Test Center|Flight Test Engineering Division]] at Edwards, where he served as a [[test pilot]] and [[project manager]] testing the [[F-102A]] and [[F-106 Delta Dart|F-106B]].<ref name=40thmerc7 /> He also flew the [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]], [[Cessna T-37 Tweet|T-37]], [[F-86]], [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] and [[F-104]].{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=14}} By the time he left Edwards, he had logged more than 2,000 hours of flight time, of which 1,600 hours were in [[jet aircraft]].{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=13}}\n\n== NASA career ==\n=== Project Mercury ===\n{{Main|Project Mercury}}\n[[File:Mercury Suit Gordon Cooper.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cooper in his Mercury spacesuit, the [[Navy Mark IV]] ]]\nIn January 1959, Cooper received unexpected orders to report to Washington, D.C. There was no indication what it was about, but his commanding officer, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] Marcus F. Cooper (no relation) recalled an announcement in the newspaper saying that a contract had been awarded to [[McDonnell Aircraft]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to build a space capsule, and advised Cooper not to volunteer for astronaut training. On February 2, 1959, Cooper attended a [[NASA]] briefing on [[Project Mercury]] and the part astronauts would play in it. Cooper went through the selection process with another 109 pilots,{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=7\u201310}} and was not surprised when he was accepted as the youngest of the first seven American astronauts.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=12\u201315}} Others were though; Slayton later recalled that \"When I heard Gordo's name, my first reaction was, something's wrong. Gordo was an engineer at Edwards. As far as I was concerned, he wasn't even a test pilot.\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=73}}\n\nDuring the selection interviews, Cooper had been asked about his domestic relationship, and had lied, saying that he and Trudy had a good, stable marriage. In fact, she had left him four months before in the wake of a lengthy affair he had with a married woman, and was living with their daughters in San Diego while he occupied a bachelor's quarters at Edwards. Aware that NASA wanted to project an image of its astronauts as loving family men, and that his story would not stand up to scrutiny, he drove down to San Diego to see Trudy at the first opportunity. Lured by the prospect of a great adventure for herself and her daughters, she agreed to go along with the charade and pretend that they were a happily married couple.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nThe identities of the [[Mercury Seven]] were announced at a press conference at [[Dolley Madison House]] in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=274\u2013275}} [[Scott Carpenter]], Gordon Cooper, [[John Glenn]], Gus Grissom, [[Wally Schirra]], [[Alan Shepard]], and [[Deke Slayton]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=42\u201347}} Each was assigned a different portion of the project along with other special assignments. Cooper specialized in the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone rocket]], which would be used for the first, [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]s.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=22\u201323}} He also chaired the Emergency Egress Committee, responsible for working out emergency [[launch pad]] escape procedures,{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=34}} and engaged [[Bo Randall]] to develop a personal [[survival knife]] for astronauts to carry.{{sfn|Cooper et al.|2010|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nThe astronauts drew their salaries as military officers, and an important component of that was flight pay. In Cooper's case, it amounted to $145 a month ({{Inflation|US|145|1959|fmt=eq}}). NASA saw no reason to provide the astronauts with aircraft, so they had to fly to meetings around the country on commercial airlines. To continue earning their flight pay, Grissom and Slayton would go out on the weekend to [[Langley Air Force Base]], and attempt to put in the required four hours a month, competing for T-33 aircraft with senior deskbound colonels and generals. Cooper traveled to [[McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base]] in [[Tennessee]], where a friend let him fly higher-performance F-104B jets. This came up when Cooper had lunch with [[William Hines]], a reporter for ''[[The Washington Star]]'', and was duly reported in the paper. Cooper then discussed the issue with [[Congressman]] [[James G. Fulton]]. The matter was taken up by the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]]. Within weeks the astronauts had priority access to USAF F-102s, something that Cooper considered a \"hot plane\", but which could still take off from and land at short civilian airfields; but it did not make Cooper popular with senior NASA management.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Wolfe|1979|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nAfter [[General Motors]] executive [[Ed Cole]] presented Shepard with a brand-new [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Jim Rathmann]], a racing car driver who won the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1960, and was a Chevrolet dealer in [[Melbourne, Florida]], convinced Cole to turn this into an ongoing marketing campaign. Henceforth, astronauts would be able to lease brand-new Corvettes for a dollar a year. All of the Mercury Seven but Glenn soon took up the offer. Cooper, Grissom and Shepard were soon racing their Corvettes around Cape Canaveral, with the police ignoring their exploits. From a marketing perspective, it was very successful, and helped the highly priced Corvette become established as a desirable brand. Cooper held licenses with the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) and the [[National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing]] (NASCAR). He also enjoyed racing speedboats,{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=36}} and had affairs with the female astronaut [[groupie]]s.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=336}}\n\nCooper served as [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) for NASA's first [[sub-orbital spaceflight]], by [[Alan Shepard]] in [[Mercury-Redstone 3]],{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=28\u201330}} and [[Scott Carpenter]]'s orbital flight on [[Mercury-Atlas 7]],{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=47}} and was backup pilot for [[Wally Schirra]] in [[Mercury-Atlas 8]].{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=337}}\n\n=== Mercury-Atlas 9 ===\n{{Main|Mercury-Atlas 9}}\n[[File:Cooper - GPN-2000-000997.jpg|thumb|[[Mercury-Atlas 9]] lifts off from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14]] on May&nbsp;15, 1963]]\nCooper was designated for the next mission, [[Mercury-Atlas 9]] ({{nowr|MA-9}}). Apart from the grounded Slayton, he was the only one of the Mercury Seven who had not yet flown in space. Some officials at NASA Headquarters (HQ) were unenthusiastic about Cooper, considering his complaints about flight pay and other incidents as evidence of a disturbing lack of judgment.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=121\u2013122}} His laid-back attitude and Oklahoma accent did not help.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=336}} Slayton later recalled: \"Cooper was a capable pilot and could do the job, so I recommended him. There was some grumbling out of HQ so I said: 'Either we fly him on {{nowr|MA-9}}, or we send him back to the Air Force now. It isn't fair to keep this guy hanging around if we're not gonna fly him.'\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=122}} NASA management did not want to send one of its astronaut heroes back to the Air Force, so Cooper's selection was publicly announced on November&nbsp;14, 1962, with Shepard designated as his backup.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=122}}\n\nProject Mercury had begun with a goal of ultimately flying an 18-orbit, {{nowr|27-hour}} mission, known as the manned one-day mission.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=486\u2013487}} On November&nbsp;9, senior staff at the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] decided to fly a {{nowr|22-orbit}} mission as {{nowr|MA-9}}.

When Atlas {{nowr|130-D}}, the booster designated for {{nowr|MA-9}}, first emerged from the factory in San Diego on January&nbsp;30, 1963, it failed to pass inspection and was returned to the factory.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=489\u2013490}} For Schirra's {{nowr|MA-8}}&nbsp;mission, 20&nbsp;modifications had been made to the Mercury spacecraft; for Cooper's {{nowr|MA-9}}, 183&nbsp;changes were made.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=489\u2013490}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=127}} Cooper decided to name his spacecraft, Mercury Spacecraft No.&nbsp;20, ''[[Faith 7]]''. NASA public affairs officers could see the newspaper headlines if the spacecraft were lost at sea: \"NASA loses Faith\".{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=492}}\n\nAfter an argument with NASA Deputy Administrator [[Walter C. Williams]] over last-minute changes to his [[pressure suit]] to insert a new medical probe, Cooper was nearly replaced by Shepard.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=37\u201339}} This was followed by Cooper [[wikt:buzz#Verb|buzzing]] Hangar&nbsp;S at [[Cape Canaveral]] in an {{nowr|[[F-102]]}} and lighting the [[afterburner]].{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=37\u201339}} Williams told Slayton he was prepared to replace Cooper with Shepard.

Cooper worked closely with the production company, and every line uttered by Quaid was reportedly attributable to Cooper's recollection. Quaid met with Cooper before the casting call and learned his mannerisms.

Cooper learned to fly as a child, and after service in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during [[World War II]], he was commissioned into the [[United States Air Force]] in 1949. After service as a fighter pilot, he qualified as a test pilot in 1956, and was selected as an astronaut in 1959.\n\nIn 1963 Cooper piloted the longest and last Mercury spaceflight, [[Mercury-Atlas 9]]. During that 34-hour mission he became the first American to spend an entire day in space, the first to sleep in space, and the last American launched on an entirely solo [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] mission. Despite a series of severe equipment failures, he managed to successfully complete the mission under manual control, guiding his spacecraft, which he named ''[[Faith 7]]'', to a [[splashdown]] just {{convert|4|mi}} ahead of the recovery ship. Cooper became the first astronaut to make a second orbital flight when he flew as Command Pilot of [[Gemini 5]] in 1965. Along with Pilot [[Pete Conrad]], he set a new space endurance record by traveling {{convert|3312993|mi}} in 190 hours and 56 minutes\u2014just short of eight days\u2014showing that astronauts could survive in space for the length of time necessary to go from the Earth to the Moon and back.\n\nCooper liked to race cars and boats, and entered the $28,000 Salton City {{Convert|500|mi|km|abbr=}} boat race, and the Southwest Championship Drag Boat races in 1965, and the 1967 Orange Bowl Regatta with fire fighter [[Red Adair]]. In 1968, he entered the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], but NASA management ordered him to withdraw due to the dangers involved. After serving as backup commander of the [[Apollo 10]] mission, he was superseded by [[Alan Shepard]], and retired from NASA and the Air Force with the rank of [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] in 1971.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLeroy Gordon Cooper Jr. was born on March 6, 1927, in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]],{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=336}} the only child of Leroy Gordon Cooper Sr. and his wife Hattie Lee {{nee}} Herd.<ref name=40thmerc7 /> His mother was a school teacher.

He joined the [[Oklahoma National Guard]], flying a [[Curtiss JN-4]] biplane, despite never having formal military pilot training.

While in Germany, he attended the European Extension of the [[University of Maryland University College|University of Maryland]]. He returned to the United States in 1954, and studied for two years at the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] (AFIT) in [[Ohio]].

Cooper (no relation) recalled an announcement in the newspaper saying that a contract had been awarded to [[McDonnell Aircraft]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to build a space capsule, and advised Cooper not to volunteer for astronaut training. On February 2, 1959, Cooper attended a [[NASA]] briefing on [[Project Mercury]] and the part astronauts would play in it. Cooper went through the selection process with another 109 pilots,{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=7\u201310}} and was not surprised when he was accepted as the youngest of the first seven American astronauts.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=12\u201315}} Others were though; Slayton later recalled that \"When I heard Gordo's name, my first reaction was, something's wrong.

As far as I was concerned, he wasn't even a test pilot.\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=73}}\n\nDuring the selection interviews, Cooper had been asked about his domestic relationship, and had lied, saying that he and Trudy had a good, stable marriage. In fact, she had left him four months before in the wake of a lengthy affair he had with a married woman, and was living with their daughters in San Diego while he occupied a bachelor's quarters at Edwards. Aware that NASA wanted to project an image of its astronauts as loving family men, and that his story would not stand up to scrutiny, he drove down to San Diego to see Trudy at the first opportunity. Lured by the prospect of a great adventure for herself and her daughters, she agreed to go along with the charade and pretend that they were a happily married couple.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nThe identities of the [[Mercury Seven]] were announced at a press conference at [[Dolley Madison House]] in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=274\u2013275}} [[Scott Carpenter]], Gordon Cooper, [[John Glenn]], Gus Grissom, [[Wally Schirra]], [[Alan Shepard]], and [[Deke Slayton]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=42\u201347}} Each was assigned a different portion of the project along with other special assignments.

In Cooper's case, it amounted to $145 a month ({{Inflation|US|145|1959|fmt=eq}}). NASA saw no reason to provide the astronauts with aircraft, so they had to fly to meetings around the country on commercial airlines. To continue earning their flight pay, Grissom and Slayton would go out on the weekend to [[Langley Air Force Base]], and attempt to put in the required four hours a month, competing for T-33 aircraft with senior deskbound colonels and generals. Cooper traveled to [[McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base]] in [[Tennessee]], where a friend let him fly higher-performance F-104B jets. This came up when Cooper had lunch with [[William Hines]], a reporter for ''[[The Washington Star]]'', and was duly reported in the paper. Cooper then discussed the issue with [[Congressman]] [[James G. Fulton]]. The matter was taken up by the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]]. Within weeks the astronauts had priority access to USAF F-102s, something that Cooper considered a \"hot plane\", but which could still take off from and land at short civilian airfields; but it did not make Cooper popular with senior NASA management.{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Wolfe|1979|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nAfter [[General Motors]] executive [[Ed Cole]] presented Shepard with a brand-new [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Jim Rathmann]], a racing car driver who won the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1960, and was a Chevrolet dealer in [[Melbourne, Florida]], convinced Cole to turn this into an ongoing marketing campaign. Henceforth, astronauts would be able to lease brand-new Corvettes for a dollar a year. All of the Mercury Seven but Glenn soon took up the offer. Cooper, Grissom and Shepard were soon racing their Corvettes around Cape Canaveral, with the police ignoring their exploits. From a marketing perspective, it was very successful, and helped the highly priced Corvette become established as a desirable brand. Cooper held licenses with the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) and the [[National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing]] (NASCAR).

It survived the fragmentation and [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire |title = Byzantine Empire |work = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}</ref> During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. \"Byzantine Empire\" is a term created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the '''Roman Empire''' ({{lang-el|\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd}}, [[Romanization of Greek|tr.]] {{transl|grc|''Basileia Rh\u014dmai\u014dn''}}; {{lang-la|Imperium Romanum}}),{{sfn|Kazhdan|Epstein|1985|p=1}} or '''Romania''' ({{lang-el|\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}}, tr. {{transl|grc|''Rh\u014dmania''}}), and to themselves as Romans.\n\nSeveral signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire's [[Greek East and Latin West]] diverged. [[Constantine I]] ({{reign|324|337}}) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital and legalised [[Christianity]]. Under [[Theodosius I]] ({{reign|379|395}}), Christianity became the [[state religion]] and [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I|other religious practices were proscribed]]. In the reign of [[Heraclius]] ({{reign|610|641}}), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin.{{sfnm|Ostrogorsky|1969|1pp=105\u201307, 109|Norwich|1998|2p=97|Haywood|2001|3pp=2.17, 3.06, 3.15}} \n\nAlthough the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from [[ancient Rome]] insofar as it was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]].{{sfnm|1a1=Millar|1y=2006|1pp=2, 15|2a1=James|2y=2010|2p=5|3a1=Freeman|3y=1999|3pp=431, 435\u201337, 459\u201362|4a1=Baynes|4a2=Moss|4y=1948|4p=xx|5a1=Ostrogorsky|5y=1969|5p=27|6a1=Kaldellis|6y=2007|6pp=2\u20133|7a1=Kazhdan|7a2=Constable|7y=1982|7p=12|8a1=Norwich|8y=1998|8p=383}}\n\nThe borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery. During the reign of [[Justinian I]] ({{reign|527|565}}), the empire reached its greatest extent, after reconquering much of the historically Roman western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]], including North Africa, Italy and Rome, which it held for two more centuries. The [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] exhausted the empire's resources and during the [[Early Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, lost its richest provinces, Egypt and Syria, to the Arab caliphate.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iSWPAgAAQBAJ |title=Warfare, State And Society in the Byzantine World 560\u20131204 |work= |page=47 |isbn=978-1-135-36437-3 |last1=Haldon |first1=John |last2=Haldon |first2=Shelby Cullom Davis 3.0.

In 740 a major Byzantine victory took place at the [[Battle of Akroinon]] where the Byzantines destroyed the Umayyad army once again.\n\nLeo III the Isaurian's son and successor, [[Constantine V]], won noteworthy victories in northern Syria and also thoroughly undermined Bulgarian strength.<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|pp=67\u201368}}.</ref> In 746, profiting by the [[Third Fitna|unstable conditions]] in the Umayyad Caliphate, which was falling apart under [[Marwan II]], Constantine V invaded Syria and captured [[Kahramanmara\u015f|Germanikeia]] and the [[Battle of Keramaia]] resulted in a major Byzantine naval victory over the Umayyad fleet. Coupled with military defeats on other fronts of the Caliphate and internal instability, Umayyad expansion came to an end.\n\n==== Religious dispute over iconoclasm ====\n{{Main|Byzantine iconoclasm}}\nThe 8th and early 9th centuries were also dominated by controversy and religious division over [[Iconoclasm]], which was the main political issue in the Empire for over a century. [[Icon]]s (here meaning all forms of religious imagery) were banned by Leo and Constantine from around 730, leading to revolts by [[iconodule]]s (supporters of icons) throughout the empire. After the efforts of empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]], the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] met in 787 and affirmed that icons could be venerated but not worshipped. Irene is said to have endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but, according to [[Theophanes the Confessor]], the scheme was frustrated by Aetios, one of her favourites.<ref name=\"G89\">{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|pp=167\u201370}}; {{harvnb|Garland|1999|p=89}}.</ref>\n\nIn the early 9th century, Leo V reintroduced the policy of iconoclasm, but in 843 empress [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Theodora]] restored the veneration of icons with the help of [[Methodios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Methodios]].<ref name=\"P11\">{{harvnb|Parry|1996|pp=11\u201315}}.</ref> Iconoclasm played a part in the further alienation of East from West, which worsened during the so-called [[Photian schism]], when [[Pope Nicholas I]] challenged the elevation of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]] to the patriarchate.<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|p=267}}.</ref>\n\n=== Macedonian dynasty and resurgence (867\u20131025) ===\n{{see also|Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty}}\n[[File:ByzantineEmpire867AD4-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|The Byzantine Empire, c. 867]]\n\nThe accession of [[Basil I]] to the throne in 867 marks the beginning of the [[Macedonian dynasty]], which would rule for the next two and a half centuries.

According to [[George Ostrogorsky]], Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement.<ref name=\"M194\"/> The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|2014|p=118}}.</ref> Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole.

The Despotate continued on as an independent state by paying an annual tribute to the Ottomans. Incompetent rule, failure to pay the annual tribute and a revolt against the Ottomans finally led to Mehmed II's invasion of Morea in May 1460.\n\nA few holdouts remained for a time. The island of [[Monemvasia]] refused to surrender and it was first ruled for a short time by an Aragonese corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to place themselves under the Pope's protection before the end of 1460. The [[Mani Peninsula]], on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of the local clans and then that area came under Venice's rule. The very last holdout was [[Salmeniko]], in the Morea's northwest. [[Graitzas Palaiologos]] was the military commander there, stationed at [[Salmeniko Castle]]. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1907|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/journalofhelleni27sociuoft#page/236/mode/1up p. 236]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Empire of Trebizond]], which had [[Georgian expedition to Chaldia|split away]] from the Byzantine Empire just weeks before Constantinople was taken by the Crusaders in 1204, became the last remnant and last de facto successor state to the Byzantine Empire. Efforts by the [[David of Trebizond|Emperor David]] to recruit European powers for an anti-Ottoman crusade provoked war between the Ottomans and Trebizond in the summer of 1461. After a month-long siege, David surrendered the city of Trebizond on 14 August 1461. The Empire of Trebizond's Crimean principality, the [[Principality of Theodoro]] (part of the [[Perateia]]), lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in December 1475.\n\n[[File:Byzantine imperial flag, 14th century.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Byzantine flags and insignia|Flag of the late Empire]] under the Palaiologoi, sporting the [[tetragrammic cross]] symbol of the [[Palaiologos dynasty]]]]\n\nA nephew of the last Emperor, Constantine XI, [[Andreas Palaiologos]] claimed to have inherited the title of [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived under the protection of the [[Papal States]] for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself ''Imperator Constantinopolitanus'' (\"Emperor of Constantinople\"), and sold his succession rights to both [[Charles VIII of France]] and the [[Catholic Monarchs]].\n\n[[Constantine XI]] died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he might have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed II after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed [[Hass Murad Pasha|Has Murad]], became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lowry|2003|pp=115\u201316}}.</ref>\n\nMehmed II and his successors continued to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|the demise of the Ottoman Empire]] in the early 20th century following [[World War 1]]. They considered that they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine had done before, and they continued to refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants ([[Orthodox Christians]]) as [[R\u00fbm]]. Meanwhile, the [[Danubian Principalities]] (whose rulers also considered themselves the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2000|p=213}}.</ref>) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.\n\nAt his death, the role of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], [[Grand duke]] of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]]. He had married Andreas' sister, [[Sophia Palaiologina]], whose grandson, [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]], would become the first [[Tsar]] of Russia (''tsar'', or ''czar'', meaning ''caesar'', is a term traditionally applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople.

The elaborate system of titulature and precedence gave the court prestige and influence.

For example, embassies to the capital would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople, not only as a potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays.<ref name=\"N1\"/> According to [[Dimitri Obolensky]], the preservation of the ancient civilisation in Europe was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.<ref name=\"O3\">{{harvnb|Obolensky|1994|p=3}}.</ref>\n\n== Science, medicine and law ==\n{{See also|Byzantine science|Byzantine medicine|Byzantine law|List of Byzantine inventions}}\n[[File:Hagia Sophia Interior Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Interior panorama of the [[Hagia Sophia]], the patriarchal [[basilica]] in Constantinople designed 537 CE by [[Isidore of Miletus]], the first compiler of Archimedes' various works.

Europe, in particular, could not match Byzantine economic strength until late in the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Constantinople]] operated as a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]], in particular as the primary western terminus of the famous [[Silk Road]].

Finally, the government often collected part of the surplus through taxation, and put it back into circulation, through redistribution in the form of salaries to state officials, or in the form of investment in public works.<ref name=\"L3-4\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{see also|Third Rome|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\n[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol7v.jpg|thumb|King [[David]] in robes of a Byzantine emperor; miniature from the [[Paris Psalter]] ]]\n\nByzantium has been often identified with absolutism, orthodox spirituality, orientalism and exoticism, while the terms \"Byzantine\" and \"Byzantinism\" have been used as bywords for decadence, complex bureaucracy, and repression. Both Eastern and Western European authors have often perceived Byzantium as a body of religious, political, and philosophical ideas contrary to those of the West. Even in [[History of modern Greece|19th-century Greece]], the focus was mainly on the classical past, while Byzantine tradition had been associated with negative connotations.<ref name=\"A1\">{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|pp=277\u201381}}.</ref>\n\nThis traditional approach towards Byzantium has been partially or wholly disputed and revised by modern studies, which focus on the positive aspects of Byzantine culture and legacy. [[Averil Cameron]] regards as undeniable the Byzantine contribution to the formation of medieval Europe, and both Cameron and Obolensky recognise the major role of Byzantium in shaping Orthodoxy, which in turn occupies a central position in the history and societies of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Serbia and other countries.<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|pp=186\u2013277}}.</ref> The Byzantines also preserved and copied classical manuscripts, and they are thus regarded as transmitters of classical knowledge, as important contributors to modern European civilisation, and as precursors of both [[Renaissance humanism]] and Slav Orthodox culture.<ref name=\"C311\"/>\n\nAs the only stable long-term state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging forces to the East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were directly related to the respective progress of Islam.<ref name=\"C311\">{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|p=261}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, Sultan [[Mehmed II]] took the title \"''Kaysar-i R\u00fbm''\" (the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] equivalent of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of Rome), since he was determined to make the Ottoman Empire the heir of the Eastern Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|B\u00e9har|1999|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|1998|p=71}}.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|Byzantine Empire|Christianity|Greece|Middle Ages}}\n* [[Byzantine Army]]\n* [[Byzantine philosophy]]\n* [[Byzantine Rite]]\n* [[Index of Byzantine Empire-related articles]]\n* [[Legacy of the Roman Empire]]\n* [[Family trees of the Byzantine imperial dynasties]]\n* [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty]]\n* [[List of Byzantine emperors]]\n* [[List of Byzantine inventions]]\n* [[List of Byzantine revolts and civil wars]]\n* [[List of Byzantine wars]]\n* [[List of Roman dynasties]]\n* [[Despotate of the Morea]]\n\n== Annotations ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n====Primary sources====\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Choniates |first=Nicetas |author-link=Nicetas Choniates |title=Translations and Reprints from the Original Sources of European History by D.C.

It survived the fragmentation and [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire |title = Byzantine Empire |work = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}</ref> During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. \"Byzantine Empire\" is a term created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the '''Roman Empire''' ({{lang-el|\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd}}, [[Romanization of Greek|tr.]] {{transl|grc|''Basileia Rh\u014dmai\u014dn''}}; {{lang-la|Imperium Romanum}}),{{sfn|Kazhdan|Epstein|1985|p=1}} or '''Romania''' ({{lang-el|\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}}, tr. {{transl|grc|''Rh\u014dmania''}}), and to themselves as Romans.\n\nSeveral signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire's [[Greek East and Latin West]] diverged. [[Constantine I]] ({{reign|324|337}}) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital and legalised [[Christianity]]. Under [[Theodosius I]] ({{reign|379|395}}), Christianity became the [[state religion]] and [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I|other religious practices were proscribed]]. In the reign of [[Heraclius]] ({{reign|610|641}}), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin.{{sfnm|Ostrogorsky|1969|1pp=105\u201307, 109|Norwich|1998|2p=97|Haywood|2001|3pp=2.17, 3.06, 3.15}} \n\nAlthough the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from [[ancient Rome]] insofar as it was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]].{{sfnm|1a1=Millar|1y=2006|1pp=2, 15|2a1=James|2y=2010|2p=5|3a1=Freeman|3y=1999|3pp=431, 435\u201337, 459\u201362|4a1=Baynes|4a2=Moss|4y=1948|4p=xx|5a1=Ostrogorsky|5y=1969|5p=27|6a1=Kaldellis|6y=2007|6pp=2\u20133|7a1=Kazhdan|7a2=Constable|7y=1982|7p=12|8a1=Norwich|8y=1998|8p=383}}\n\nThe borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery. During the reign of [[Justinian I]] ({{reign|527|565}}), the empire reached its greatest extent, after reconquering much of the historically Roman western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]], including North Africa, Italy and Rome, which it held for two more centuries. The [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] exhausted the empire's resources and during the [[Early Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, lost its richest provinces, Egypt and Syria, to the Arab caliphate.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iSWPAgAAQBAJ |title=Warfare, State And Society in the Byzantine World 560\u20131204 |work= |page=47 |isbn=978-1-135-36437-3 |last1=Haldon |first1=John |last2=Haldon |first2=Shelby Cullom Davis 3.0.

This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in [[Anatolia]].\n\nThe empire recovered during the [[Komnenian restoration]] and by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city.<ref>Pounds, Norman John Greville.

None of his immediate successors had any particular military or political talent and the imperial administration increasingly fell into the hands of the civil service. Incompetent efforts to revive the Byzantine economy resulted in severe [[inflation]] and a debased gold currency. The army was now seen as both an unnecessary expense and a political threat. A number of standing local units were demobilised, further augmenting the army's dependence on mercenaries, who could be retained and dismissed on an as-needed basis.<ref name=\"PM\">Markham, \"[http://faculty.uml.edu/ethan_spanier/Teaching/documents/TheBattleofManzikert.pdf The Battle of Manzikert]\".</ref>\n\n[[File:The seizure of Edessa in Syria by the Byzantine army and the Arabic counterattack from the Chronicle of John Skylitzes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The seizure of [[Edessa]] (1031) by the Byzantines under [[George Maniakes]] and the counterattack by the [[Seljuk Turks]]]]\n\nAt the same time, Byzantium was faced with new enemies.

This led to a short-lived revival of Byzantine fortunes under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] but the war-ravaged Empire was ill-equipped to deal with the enemies that surrounded it. To maintain his campaigns against the Latins, Michael pulled troops from Asia Minor and levied crippling taxes on the peasantry, causing much resentment.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=179}}; {{harvnb|Reinert|2002|p=260}}.</ref> Massive construction projects were completed in Constantinople to repair the damage of the Fourth Crusade but none of these initiatives was of any comfort to the farmers in Asia Minor suffering raids from Muslim ghazis.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|reinert|2002|p=257}}.\">{{harvnb|Reinert|2002|p=257}}.</ref>\n\nRather than holding on to his possessions in Asia Minor, Michael chose to expand the Empire, gaining only short-term success. To avoid another sacking of the capital by the Latins, he forced the Church to submit to Rome, again a temporary solution for which the peasantry hated Michael and Constantinople.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|reinert|2002|p=257}}.\"/> The efforts of [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]] and later his grandson [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos III]] marked Byzantium's last genuine attempts in restoring the glory of the Empire. However, the use of mercenaries by Andronikos II would often backfire, with the [[Catalan Company]] ravaging the countryside and increasing resentment towards Constantinople.<ref>{{harvnb|Reinert|2002|p=261}}.</ref>\n\n==== Rise of the Ottomans and fall of Constantinople ====\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Ottoman Wars|Fall of Constantinople}}\n[[File:Constantinople 1453.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]] in 1453, depicted in a 15th-century French miniature]]\n\nThe situation became worse for Byzantium during the civil wars after Andronikos III died. A [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347|six-year-long civil war]] devastated the empire, allowing the Serbian ruler [[Stefan Du\u0161an]] ({{reign|1331|1346}}) to overrun most of the Empire's remaining territory and establish a [[Serbian Empire]]. In 1354, an earthquake at [[Gelibolu|Gallipoli]] devastated the fort, allowing the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] (who were hired as mercenaries during the civil war by [[John VI Kantakouzenos]]) to establish themselves in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Reinert|2002|p=268}}.</ref> By the time the Byzantine civil wars had ended, the Ottomans had defeated the Serbians and subjugated them as vassals. Following the [[Battle of Kosovo]], much of the Balkans became dominated by the Ottomans.<ref>{{harvnb|Reinert|2002|p=270}}.</ref>\n\nThe Byzantine emperors appealed to the West for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid in return for a reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the [[Holy See|See of Rome]]. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented the authority of Rome and the [[Latin Rite]].<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1990|pp=71\u201372}}.</ref> Some Western troops arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.<ref name=\"R84-85\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1990|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref>\n\nConstantinople by this stage was underpopulated and dilapidated. The population of the city had collapsed so severely that it was now little more than a cluster of villages separated by fields. On 2 April 1453, [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Sultan Mehmed]]'s army of 80,000 men and large numbers of irregulars laid siege to the city.<ref name=\"R84-86\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1990|pp=84\u201386}}.</ref> Despite a desperate last-ditch defence of the city by the massively outnumbered Christian forces (c. 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreign),<ref name=\"R84-85\"/> [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople finally fell]] to the Ottomans after a two-month siege on 29 May 1453. The last Byzantine emperor, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], was last seen casting off his imperial regalia and throwing himself into hand-to-hand combat after the walls of the city were taken.<ref>{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=300}}.</ref>\n\n=== Political aftermath ===\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450.svg|thumb|upright|left|The Eastern Mediterranean just before the fall of Constantinople]]\nBy the time of the fall of Constantinople, the only remaining territory of the Byzantine Empire was the [[Despotate of the Morea]] ([[Peloponnese]]), which was ruled by brothers of the last Emperor, [[Thomas Palaiologos]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos]]. The Despotate continued on as an independent state by paying an annual tribute to the Ottomans. Incompetent rule, failure to pay the annual tribute and a revolt against the Ottomans finally led to Mehmed II's invasion of Morea in May 1460.\n\nA few holdouts remained for a time. The island of [[Monemvasia]] refused to surrender and it was first ruled for a short time by an Aragonese corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to place themselves under the Pope's protection before the end of 1460. The [[Mani Peninsula]], on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of the local clans and then that area came under Venice's rule. The very last holdout was [[Salmeniko]], in the Morea's northwest. [[Graitzas Palaiologos]] was the military commander there, stationed at [[Salmeniko Castle]]. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1907|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/journalofhelleni27sociuoft#page/236/mode/1up p. 236]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Empire of Trebizond]], which had [[Georgian expedition to Chaldia|split away]] from the Byzantine Empire just weeks before Constantinople was taken by the Crusaders in 1204, became the last remnant and last de facto successor state to the Byzantine Empire. Efforts by the [[David of Trebizond|Emperor David]] to recruit European powers for an anti-Ottoman crusade provoked war between the Ottomans and Trebizond in the summer of 1461. After a month-long siege, David surrendered the city of Trebizond on 14 August 1461. The Empire of Trebizond's Crimean principality, the [[Principality of Theodoro]] (part of the [[Perateia]]), lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in December 1475.\n\n[[File:Byzantine imperial flag, 14th century.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Byzantine flags and insignia|Flag of the late Empire]] under the Palaiologoi, sporting the [[tetragrammic cross]] symbol of the [[Palaiologos dynasty]]]]\n\nA nephew of the last Emperor, Constantine XI, [[Andreas Palaiologos]] claimed to have inherited the title of [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived under the protection of the [[Papal States]] for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself ''Imperator Constantinopolitanus'' (\"Emperor of Constantinople\"), and sold his succession rights to both [[Charles VIII of France]] and the [[Catholic Monarchs]].\n\n[[Constantine XI]] died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he might have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed II after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed [[Hass Murad Pasha|Has Murad]], became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lowry|2003|pp=115\u201316}}.</ref>\n\nMehmed II and his successors continued to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|the demise of the Ottoman Empire]] in the early 20th century following [[World War 1]]. They considered that they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine had done before, and they continued to refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants ([[Orthodox Christians]]) as [[R\u00fbm]]. Meanwhile, the [[Danubian Principalities]] (whose rulers also considered themselves the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2000|p=213}}.</ref>) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.\n\nAt his death, the role of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], [[Grand duke]] of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]]. He had married Andreas' sister, [[Sophia Palaiologina]], whose grandson, [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]], would become the first [[Tsar]] of Russia (''tsar'', or ''czar'', meaning ''caesar'', is a term traditionally applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. The idea of the [[Russian Empire]] as the successive [[Third Rome]] was kept alive until its demise with the [[Russian Revolution]].<ref>{{harvnb|Seton-Watson|1967|p=31}}.</ref>\n\n== Government and bureaucracy ==\n{{Main|Byzantine bureaucracy}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer  =\n| align   = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1  = Byzantine Empire Themata-750-en.svg\n| width1  = 220\n| alt1   = Map of Byzantine Empire showing the themes in circa 750\n| caption1 = The ''themes'', c. 750\n| image2  = Byzantine Empire Themata-950-en.svg\n| width2  = 220\n| alt2   = Map of Byzantine Empire showing the themes in circa 950\n| caption2 = The ''themes'', c. 950\n}}\n\nIn the Byzantine state, the [[List of Byzantine emperors|emperor]] was the sole and [[absolute ruler]], and his power was regarded as having divine origin.<ref>{{harvnb|Mango|2007|pp=259\u201360}}.</ref> The [[Byzantine Senate|Senate]] had ceased to have real political and legislative authority but remained as an honorary council with titular members.

The elaborate system of titulature and precedence gave the court prestige and influence. Officials were arranged in strict order around the emperor, and depended upon the imperial will for their ranks. There were also actual administrative jobs, but authority could be vested in individuals rather than offices.<ref name=\"L34\">{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|pp=157\u201358}}; {{harvnb|Neville|2004|p=34}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries, civil service constituted the clearest path to aristocratic status, but, starting in the 9th century, the civil aristocracy was rivalled by an aristocracy of nobility.

During this period, Alexios I undertook important administrative reforms, including the creation of new courtly dignities and offices.<ref name=\"L13\">{{harvnb|Neville|2004|p=13}}.</ref>\n\n=== Diplomacy ===\n{{Main|Byzantine diplomacy}}\n\n[[File:John the Grammarian as ambassador before Theophilos and Mamun.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The embassy of [[Patriarch John VII of Constantinople|John the Grammarian]] in 829, between the emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] and the Abbasid caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] ]]\n\nAfter the fall of Rome, the key challenge to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople.

The [[Bureau of Barbarians]] in Constantinople handled matters of protocol and record keeping for any issues related to the \"[[barbarians]]\", and thus had, perhaps, a basic intelligence function itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Antonucci|1993|pp=11\u201313}}; {{harvnb|Seeck|1876|pp=31\u201333}}</ref> John B.

For example, embassies to the capital would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople, not only as a potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays.<ref name=\"N1\"/> According to [[Dimitri Obolensky]], the preservation of the ancient civilisation in Europe was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.<ref name=\"O3\">{{harvnb|Obolensky|1994|p=3}}.</ref>\n\n== Science, medicine and law ==\n{{See also|Byzantine science|Byzantine medicine|Byzantine law|List of Byzantine inventions}}\n[[File:Hagia Sophia Interior Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Interior panorama of the [[Hagia Sophia]], the patriarchal [[basilica]] in Constantinople designed 537 CE by [[Isidore of Miletus]], the first compiler of Archimedes' various works.

Just as God ruled in Heaven, so the Emperor, made in his image, should rule on earth and carry out his commandments&nbsp;... It saw itself as a universal empire. Ideally, it should embrace all the peoples of the Earth who, ideally, should all be members of the one true Christian Church, its own Orthodox Church.

The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative, and financial routine of administering religious affairs, and this routine was applied to the [[Christian Church]]. Following the pattern set by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the Byzantines viewed the Emperor as a representative or messenger of [[Jesus|Christ]], responsible particularly for the propagation of Christianity among pagans, and for the \"externals\" of the religion, such as administration and finances. As [[Cyril Mango]] points out, the Byzantine political thinking can be summarised in the motto \"One God, one empire, one religion\".<ref name=\"M108\">{{harvnb|Mango|2007|p=108}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya 01.jpg|thumb|[[Our Lady of Saidnaya Monastery]], in present-day Syria, is traditionally held to have been founded by emperor [[Justinian I]].]]\nThe imperial role in the affairs of the Church never developed into a fixed, legally defined system.<ref name=\"M14\">{{harvnb|Meyendorff|1982|p=13}}.</ref> On the other way around, with the decline of Rome, and internal dissension in the other Eastern Patriarchates, the Church of Constantinople became, between the 6th and 11th centuries, the richest and most influential center of [[Christendom]];<ref name=\"M19\">{{harvnb|Meyendorff|1982|p=19}}.</ref> even when the Empire was reduced to only a shadow of its former self, the Church continued to exercise significant influence both inside and outside of the imperial frontiers.

An imperial decree of 388, which was later incorporated into the ''[[Codex Justinianeus]]'', orders the population of the Empire \"to assume the name of Catholic Christians\", and regards all those who will not abide by the law as \"mad and foolish persons\"; as followers of \"heretical dogmas\".<ref>[http://www.uwyo.edu/lawlib/blume-justinian/ajc-edition-1/_files/docs/book-1pdf/book%201-1.pdf Justinian Code: Book 1, Title 1]; {{harvnb|Blume|2008|loc=Headnote C. 1.1}}; {{harvnb|Mango|2007|p=108}}.</ref>\n[[File:Basilica of San Vitale - triumphal arch mosaics.jpg|thumbnail|left|Triumphal arch mosaics of [[Jesus Christ]] and the Apostles.

This led to a [[Byzantine iconoclasm|significant religious crisis]], which ended in the mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, a new wave of pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people.

Both Eastern and Western European authors have often perceived Byzantium as a body of religious, political, and philosophical ideas contrary to those of the West.

[[Averil Cameron]] regards as undeniable the Byzantine contribution to the formation of medieval Europe, and both Cameron and Obolensky recognise the major role of Byzantium in shaping Orthodoxy, which in turn occupies a central position in the history and societies of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Serbia and other countries.<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|pp=186\u2013277}}.</ref> The Byzantines also preserved and copied classical manuscripts, and they are thus regarded as transmitters of classical knowledge, as important contributors to modern European civilisation, and as precursors of both [[Renaissance humanism]] and Slav Orthodox culture.<ref name=\"C311\"/>\n\nAs the only stable long-term state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging forces to the East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans.
