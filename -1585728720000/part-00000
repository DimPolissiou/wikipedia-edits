The PM made this announcement during a speech at the Netaji Stadium, marking the 75th anniversary of the hoisting of the Indian flag by Bose there.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/01/india-strips-islands-british-colonial-names-renames-freedom/|title=Indian PM strips islands of British colonial names \u2013 and renames them after freedom fighter|last=Bedi|first=Rahul|date=1 January 2019|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103005058/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/01/india-strips-islands-british-colonial-names-renames-freedom/|archive-date=3 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-renames-3-islands-of-andaman-and-nicobar/articleshow/67311674.cms |title=PM Modi renames 3 Andaman & Nicobar islands as tribute to Netaji |work=The Economic Times |date=31 December 2018 |access-date=2 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103010545/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-renames-3-islands-of-andaman-and-nicobar/articleshow/67311674.cms |archive-date=3 January 2019 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n===The Sisters===\nThe Sisters are two small uninhabited islands, East Sister Island and West Sister Island, in the Andaman Archipelago, at the northern side of the Duncan Passage, about {{convert|6|km|nmi|abbr=on}} southeast of Passage Island and {{convert|18|km|nmi|abbr=on}} north of North Brother. The islands are about {{convert|820.21|feet|abbr=off}} apart, connected by a [[coral reef]]; they are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister Island.\n\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sisters were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing. The islands may have been a waystation on the way to their temporary settlement of [[Rutland Island]] between 1890 and 1930.\n\nThe islands have been designated as a [[wildlife refuge]] since 1987, with an area of {{convert|0.36|km2}}.\n\n==Flora==\n[[File:Map of Nicobar and Andaman Islands-en.svg|thumb|Map of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with an extra detailed area around Port Blair.]]\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\n\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns, and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\n\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\n# Giant [[evergreen forest]]\n# Andamans tropical evergreen forest\n# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]\n# Canebrakes\n# Wet bamboo brakes\n# Andamans semi-evergreen forest\n# Andamans moist deciduous forest\n# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest\n# [[Littoral]] forest\n# [[Mangrove forest]]\n# Brackish water mixed forest\n# Submontane forest\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Ross island - Andaman.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep, Andaman]]\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\n\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\n\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many [[caves]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in [[China]] for [[bird's nest soup]].<ref name=\"soup\">R. Sankaran (1999), ''[http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf The impact of nest collection on the Edible-nest Swiftlet in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704194845/http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}''.

Ten species are endemic to these Islands. [[Mount Harriet National Park]] is one of the richest areas of butterfly and moth diversity on these islands.\n\nThe islands are well known for prized [[shellfish]], especially from the genera ''[[Turbo (genus)|Turbo]]'', ''[[Trochus]]'', ''[[Murex]]'' and ''[[Nautilus]]''. Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. [[Giant clam]]s, [[green mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s support edible shellfishery. The shells of [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] are burnt in kilns to produce edible [[Lime (material)|lime]].\n\nThere are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.<ref>India Year Book 2015</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{India census population\n|title= Population growth\n|1951= 30971\n|1961= 63548\n|1971= 115133\n|1981= 188741\n|1991= 280661\n|2001= 356152\n|2011= 380581\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote=Source:Census of India<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>\n|1901=24649|1911=26459|1921=27086|1931=29463|1941=33768}}\n\n{{As of|2011}} [[Census of India]], the population of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 379,944, of which 202,330 (53.25%) were male and 177,614 (46.75%) were female.

On 1 August 1974, the Nicobar islands were hived off into another revenue district with district headquarters at Car Nicobar under a Deputy Commissioner. In 1982, the post of [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Lieutenant Governor]] was created who replaced the Chief Commissioner as the head of administration.

The islands are about {{convert|820.21|feet|abbr=off}} apart, connected by a [[coral reef]]; they are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister Island.\n\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sisters were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing. The islands may have been a waystation on the way to their temporary settlement of [[Rutland Island]] between 1890 and 1930.\n\nThe islands have been designated as a [[wildlife refuge]] since 1987, with an area of {{convert|0.36|km2}}.\n\n==Flora==\n[[File:Map of Nicobar and Andaman Islands-en.svg|thumb|Map of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with an extra detailed area around Port Blair.]]\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\n\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns, and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\n\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\n# Giant [[evergreen forest]]\n# Andamans tropical evergreen forest\n# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]\n# Canebrakes\n# Wet bamboo brakes\n# Andamans semi-evergreen forest\n# Andamans moist deciduous forest\n# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest\n# [[Littoral]] forest\n# [[Mangrove forest]]\n# Brackish water mixed forest\n# Submontane forest\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Ross island - Andaman.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep, Andaman]]\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\n\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\n\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many [[caves]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in [[China]] for [[bird's nest soup]].<ref name=\"soup\">R.

Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. [[Giant clam]]s, [[green mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s support edible shellfishery. The shells of [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] are burnt in kilns to produce edible [[Lime (material)|lime]].\n\nThere are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.<ref>India Year Book 2015</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{India census population\n|title= Population growth\n|1951= 30971\n|1961= 63548\n|1971= 115133\n|1981= 188741\n|1991= 280661\n|2001= 356152\n|2011= 380581\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote=Source:Census of India<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>\n|1901=24649|1911=26459|1921=27086|1931=29463|1941=33768}}\n\n{{As of|2011}} [[Census of India]], the population of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 379,944, of which 202,330 (53.25%) were male and 177,614 (46.75%) were female.

Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays.

Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Def Leppard]] followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"[[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]]\" or \"[[headbanging|headbangers]]\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became popular with groups such as [[Bon Jovi]] and [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]. [[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more aggressive styles: [[thrash metal]] broke into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], while other [[extreme metal|extreme subgenres of heavy metal]] such as [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] remain [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena.

American noise band Today is the Day used synthesizers on their 1996 self titled album to powerfully add to their din. Voivod even put synthesizers to use for the first time on 1991's Angel Rat and 1993's The Outer Limits, played by both guitarist Piggy and drummer Away.

Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".<ref name=W24/> In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures\u2014generally made up of [[eighth note|8th]] or [[sixteenth note|16th notes]]. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a [[staccato]] attack created by using a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] technique on the rhythm guitar.<ref>\"Master of Rhythm: The Importance of Tone and Right-hand Technique\", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 99</ref>\n\nBrief, abrupt, and detached [[rhythmic cell]]s are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called [[riff]]s, which help to establish thematic [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as [[whole note]]- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo [[power ballad]]s. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".<ref name=W24/> By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos.

Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] and [[Phrygian mode]]s.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 46</ref> Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-\u266dVI-\u266dVII, I-\u266dVII-(\u266dVI), or I-\u266dVI-IV-\u266dVII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and \u266dII (I-\u266dII-I, I-\u266dII-III, or I-\u266dII-VII for example). Tense-sounding [[chromatic]] or [[tritone]] relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.<ref>Marshall, Wolf. \"Power Lord\u2014Climbing Chords, Evil Tritones, Giant Callouses\", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 29</ref><ref name=MH>Dunn, Sam (2005).

Also that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music.

As [[musicologists]] Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, \"Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions'. An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]]. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music'.\"<ref>See Cook and Dibben (2001), p. 56</ref>\n\n===Lyrical themes===\n{{Main|Heavy metal lyrics}}\nAccording to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath, and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired, have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music\". They take as an example Sabbath's second album ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma\u2014'[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]' and '[[Fairies Wear Boots]]' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)\u2014as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory '[[War Pigs]]' and '[[Hand of Doom (Black Sabbath song)|Hand of Doom]]'.\"<ref>Hatch and Millward (1989), p. 167</ref> Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic\u2014a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 36</ref>\n\n[[File:King Diamond live 2006 Moscow 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Two members from the band King Diamond are shown at a concert performance.

His 1962 novel ''[[The Soft Machine]]'' includes a character known as \"Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid\". Burroughs' next novel, ''[[Nova Express]]'' (1964), develops the theme, using ''heavy metal'' as a metaphor for addictive drugs: \"With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms\u2014Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes\u2014And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music\".<ref>[[William S.

After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's [[Judas Priest]], which debuted with ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' in 1974. In Christe's description,\n\n<blockquote>Black Sabbath's audience was ... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of [[Thin Lizzy]], in the stagecraft of [[Alice Cooper]], in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow. ...

Another hard rock band that featured all-female members, [[The Runaways]], was founded in 1975; two members, [[Joan Jett]] and [[Lita Ford]], later had successful solo careers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/lita-ford-17169494|title=Lita Ford|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323060710/https://www.biography.com/people/lita-ford-17169494|archive-date=March 23, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1978, with the rise of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], the band [[Girlschool]] was founded, later collaborating with [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] under the pseudonym [[Headgirl]] in 1980. In 1996, Finnish band [[Nightwish]] was founded and has featured women as vocalists. This was followed by more women fronting heavy metal bands, such as [[Halestorm]], [[Within Temptation]], [[Arch Enemy]], and [[Epica (band)|Epica]] among others. In Japan, the 2010s brought a boom of all-female metal bands including [[Destrose]], [[Aldious]], [[Mary's Blood]], [[Cyntia]], and [[Lovebites (band)|Lovebites]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The DESTROSE Connection ~The Prologue~ | work = JaME | url = https://www.jame-world.com/en/article/136224-the-destrose-connection-the-prologue.html| date= March 17, 2016| accessdate = August 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = \u6d5c\u7530\u9ebb\u91cc\u304b\u3089LOVEBITES\u307e\u3067\u30fc\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\u30baHR/HM\u3001\u6ce2\u4e71\u4e07\u4e08\u306e30\u5e74\u53f2 | url = https://realsound.jp/2017/11/post-125465.html |date=November 7, 2017| work = Real Sound | language = Japanese | accessdate = August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWomen have had an important role behind the scenes, such as [[Gaby Hoffmann (manager)|Gaby Hoffmann]] and [[Sharon Osbourne]].

In the 1980s, American conservative groups like the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC) and the [[Parent Teacher Association]] (PTA) coopted feminist views on anti-woman violence to form attacks on metal's rhetoric and imagery.<ref name=\"Hill\"/> According to [[Robert Christgau]] in 2001, metal, along with hip hop, have made \"reflexive and violent sexism \u2026 current in the music\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Dansby|first=Andrew|date=February 16, 2001|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/critic-christgau-wraps-the-90s-249682/|title=Critic Christgau Wraps the '90s|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA general consensus among media and culture scholars posits sexism's existence, to varying degrees, across different subgenres and scenes of metal. In ''Gender, Metal and the Media'' (2016), British sociologist and music academic Rosemary Lucy Hill cites a variety of historical research and finds, in summary, \"sexist attitudes and behaviours of peers at hard rock and metal events; symbolic violence, such as the violently misogynistic imagery in artwork and lyrics; women being faced with a barrage of questions to prove the authenticity of their fandom; the dominance of men in bands and prejudice faced by women musicians; and women fans being represented in the media as groupies, more interested in the musician than the music\". Other academics find that femininity is largely suppressed in metal culture, and that metal listeners are more likely to subscribe to misogynistic attitudes and stereotyping of [[gender role]]s, more so than in other music genres, with many of these findings corroborated by interviews with female participants.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Rosemary Lucy|date=January 2016|chapter=Metal and Sexism|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309760064_Metal_and_Sexism|accessdate=February 15, 2020|title=Gender, Metal and the Media|pages=133-158|chapter-url-access=registration|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-55441-3_6}}</ref>\n\nIn response to such claims, debates in the metal media have centered on defining and contextualizing sexism. Hill claims that \"understanding what counts as sexism is complex and requires critical work by fans when sexism is normalised.\" Citing her own research, including interviews of British female fans, she finds that metal offers them an opportunity to feel liberated and genderless, albeit if assimilated into a culture that is largely neglectful of women.<ref name=\"Hill\"/>\n\nIn 2018, ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' editor Eleanor Goodman published an article titled \"Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?\", interviewing veteran industry people and artists about the plight of women in metal. Some expressed a history of difficulty receiving professional respect from male counterparts. Among those interviewed was Wendy Dio, who had worked in label, booking, and legal capacities in the music industry before her marriage to and management of metal artist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. She said that after marrying Dio, her professional reputation became reduced to her marital role as his wife and her competency was questioned. Gloria Cavalera, former manager of [[Sepultura]] and wife of the band's former frontman [[Max Cavalera]], said that since 1996 she has received misogynistic hate-mail and death threats from fans accusing her of causing Max's departure from the group. She added that, \"Women take a lot of crap. This whole [[#metoo]] thing, do they think it just started? That has gone on since the pictures of the cavemen pulling girls by their hair. Women have always been pushed to the back. I personally think it\u2019s still difficult for women in the industry today, because there\u2019s not a lot of them, even in bands.\" In her article, Goodman also cited disproportionate gender figures in ''Metal Hammer''{{'}}s [[Facebook]] page \u2013 75% of [[Like (Facebook)|Likes]] being from men, as opposed to 25% from women \u2013 and in bands playing the 2018 [[Bloodstock Open Air]] festival \u2013 [[Nightwish]] was the only act of the 17 with a female member.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Goodman|first=Eleanor|date=February 12, 2018|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/does-metal-have-a-sexism-problem|title=Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Heavy metal genres]]\n* [[List of heavy metal bands]]\n* [[List of heavy metal festivals]]\n* [[Timeline of heavy metal music]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Denis Arnold|Arnold, Denis]] (1983). \"Consecutive Intervals\", in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music|The New Oxford Companion to Music]]'', Volume 1: A-J.

Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".<ref name=W24/> In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures\u2014generally made up of [[eighth note|8th]] or [[sixteenth note|16th notes]]. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a [[staccato]] attack created by using a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] technique on the rhythm guitar.<ref>\"Master of Rhythm: The Importance of Tone and Right-hand Technique\", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 99</ref>\n\nBrief, abrupt, and detached [[rhythmic cell]]s are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called [[riff]]s, which help to establish thematic [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as [[whole note]]- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo [[power ballad]]s. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".<ref name=W24/> By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 [[beats per minute]]) to extremely fast [[blast beat]] tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).<ref name=Berry/>\n\n====Harmony====\nOne of the signatures of the genre is the guitar [[power chord]].<ref>Walser (1993), p. 2</ref> In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main [[interval (music)|interval]], generally the [[perfect fifth]], though an [[octave]] may be added as a doubling of the [[Root (chord)|root]].

Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] and [[Phrygian mode]]s.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 46</ref> Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-\u266dVI-\u266dVII, I-\u266dVII-(\u266dVI), or I-\u266dVI-IV-\u266dVII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and \u266dII (I-\u266dII-I, I-\u266dII-III, or I-\u266dII-VII for example).

As [[musicologists]] Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, \"Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions'. An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]]. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music'.\"<ref>See Cook and Dibben (2001), p. 56</ref>\n\n===Lyrical themes===\n{{Main|Heavy metal lyrics}}\nAccording to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath, and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired, have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music\". They take as an example Sabbath's second album ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma\u2014'[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]' and '[[Fairies Wear Boots]]' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)\u2014as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory '[[War Pigs]]' and '[[Hand of Doom (Black Sabbath song)|Hand of Doom]]'.\"<ref>Hatch and Millward (1989), p. 167</ref> Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic\u2014a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 36</ref>\n\n[[File:King Diamond live 2006 Moscow 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Two members from the band King Diamond are shown at a concert performance.

Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. [[AC/DC]], which debuted with ''[[High Voltage (Australian album)|High Voltage]]'' in 1975, is a prime example.

After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's [[Judas Priest]], which debuted with ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' in 1974. In Christe's description,\n\n<blockquote>Black Sabbath's audience was ... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of [[Thin Lizzy]], in the stagecraft of [[Alice Cooper]], in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow. ...

Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, [[disco]], and more mainstream rock.<ref name=gnwtey/> With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and \"[[lo-fi (music)|lo-fi]]\", [[do it yourself]] ethos.

One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 [[US Festival]] in California, where the \"heavy metal day\" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 45</ref>\n\nBetween 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 12</ref> Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including ''[[Kerrang!]]'' (in 1981) and ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' (in 1984), as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, ''Billboard'' declared, \"Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers.

In the 1980s, American conservative groups like the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC) and the [[Parent Teacher Association]] (PTA) coopted feminist views on anti-woman violence to form attacks on metal's rhetoric and imagery.<ref name=\"Hill\"/> According to [[Robert Christgau]] in 2001, metal, along with hip hop, have made \"reflexive and violent sexism \u2026 current in the music\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Dansby|first=Andrew|date=February 16, 2001|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/critic-christgau-wraps-the-90s-249682/|title=Critic Christgau Wraps the '90s|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA general consensus among media and culture scholars posits sexism's existence, to varying degrees, across different subgenres and scenes of metal. In ''Gender, Metal and the Media'' (2016), British sociologist and music academic Rosemary Lucy Hill cites a variety of historical research and finds, in summary, \"sexist attitudes and behaviours of peers at hard rock and metal events; symbolic violence, such as the violently misogynistic imagery in artwork and lyrics; women being faced with a barrage of questions to prove the authenticity of their fandom; the dominance of men in bands and prejudice faced by women musicians; and women fans being represented in the media as groupies, more interested in the musician than the music\". Other academics find that femininity is largely suppressed in metal culture, and that metal listeners are more likely to subscribe to misogynistic attitudes and stereotyping of [[gender role]]s, more so than in other music genres, with many of these findings corroborated by interviews with female participants.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Rosemary Lucy|date=January 2016|chapter=Metal and Sexism|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309760064_Metal_and_Sexism|accessdate=February 15, 2020|title=Gender, Metal and the Media|pages=133-158|chapter-url-access=registration|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-55441-3_6}}</ref>\n\nIn response to such claims, debates in the metal media have centered on defining and contextualizing sexism. Hill claims that \"understanding what counts as sexism is complex and requires critical work by fans when sexism is normalised.\" Citing her own research, including interviews of British female fans, she finds that metal offers them an opportunity to feel liberated and genderless, albeit if assimilated into a culture that is largely neglectful of women.<ref name=\"Hill\"/>\n\nIn 2018, ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' editor Eleanor Goodman published an article titled \"Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?\", interviewing veteran industry people and artists about the plight of women in metal. Some expressed a history of difficulty receiving professional respect from male counterparts. Among those interviewed was Wendy Dio, who had worked in label, booking, and legal capacities in the music industry before her marriage to and management of metal artist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. She said that after marrying Dio, her professional reputation became reduced to her marital role as his wife and her competency was questioned. Gloria Cavalera, former manager of [[Sepultura]] and wife of the band's former frontman [[Max Cavalera]], said that since 1996 she has received misogynistic hate-mail and death threats from fans accusing her of causing Max's departure from the group. She added that, \"Women take a lot of crap. This whole [[#metoo]] thing, do they think it just started? That has gone on since the pictures of the cavemen pulling girls by their hair.
