The men were from several communities or villages of the [[Iatmul people]] and the [[Kwoma people]].\n\nThe New Guinea Sculpture Garden is located in a small, wooded grove on the Stanford campus next to a dormitory.  In addition to wooden and stone artworks, the garden also features landscaping and plants organized by Wallace M. Ruff, Professor Emeritus of Landscape Architecture, [[University of Oregon]], and research Fellow in the Department of Architecture and Building, [[Papua New Guinea University of Technology]], Lae, Papua New Guinea.  He was assisted by one of his students, Kora Korawali. The landscaping evokes the Sepik environment \u2013 river flanked by embankments - as well as the central plaza in Sepik villages, in front of an [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Men%27s_house_in_Tambunum_village,_Sepik_River,_Papua_New_Guinea_(rear_view).jpg all-male cult house or men\u2019s house], which are used for the staging of rituals.\n\nThe entrance to the Garden is an open space, like the Sepik flood plain.  But visitors quickly stroll into a forest of sculptures and trees reminiscent of a majestic Sepik cult house.\n\nThe Garden is roughly organized into four zones. Near the entrance is a large, wooden eagle atop the shoulders of an ancestresses. This statue resembles the finials that often adorn Iatmul cult houses.  Behind the eagle is a cluster of about a dozen, enormously tall wooden poles carved with exquisitely elaborate Iatmul and Kwoma motifs and patterns.  A series of brightly painted Kwoma poles forms another aesthetic cluster, while the third area of the Garden consists of large sculptures in pumice, an entirely new medium for the carvers since stone is rare in the Sepik flood plain.  At night, the objects are aglow from ground-level spot lights. \nThe stone sculptures largely represent Sepik mythological creatures modeled after Western sculptures found elsewhere on the Stanford campus. The carved poles subtly blend traditional and modem motifs so that, for example, ancestresses wear grass skirts. Many of the carvings beautifully wind around the natural contours of the wood, a sense of three-dimensionality that was not traditionally incorporated into Sepik carving.  One of the most brilliant works in the Garden is a bare pole that contains only a hint of the sculpture it might have become.  This work, titled \"untitled,\u201d expresses the processual aspects of the Garden, and the unfinalizability and partiality of any interpretation.\n\nThe Garden wonderfully plays with themes of light and shadow, revelation and concealment, nature and culture. It is and is not mysterious, contemplative, quiet, and surreal.\n\nThe logistics of the project were enormous. Mason raised $250,000 in individual donations. One could sponsor a fern for $250, a palm tree for $500, a bench for $750, and so forth. Large donations are acknowledged, like the artworks themselves, by name. Corporate donors included Bechtel Corporation, Chevron, and Airnuigini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea. Funds were also supplied by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Stanford University, and affluent Palo Alto families. The University allowed the Garden a permanent site.  Mason arranged for several dozen hardwood trees to be shipped to the campus from Asia.  The ten woodcarvers were flown to California from the Sepik by way of Hong Kong, a journey that far exceeded any of their previous travels.  Once they arrived, the carvers were the toast of Palo Alto and multicultural Stanford. They dined at catered events in mansions and performed with African-American drummers outside dormitories.  The carvers, working on a six-month educational visa, were given local donations by individuals, organizations, and businesses of food, medical care, clothing, transportation, recreation, materials, and a trip to Disneyland.  One of the Iatmul artists, Teddy Balangu from Palimbei village, later was an artist-in-residence at the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]] (University of British Columbia).<ref>http://moa.ubc.ca/portfolio_page/sepik-artist-in-residence/</ref>  He also spent time at Alcheringa Gallery in Victoria, British Columbia.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.alcheringa-gallery.com/teddy-sapame-balangu.html | title=Teddy ( Sapame ) Balangu / Alcheringa Gallery - Contemporary Aboriginal Art}}</ref>\n\nThe \"spirit of the project\" framed the carvers as \"artists\" and not as exotic, anonymous specimens of primitive savagery and mystery.  By labeling the men as \"master carvers,\u201d the project positioned them in Western category defined by rare artistic genius, a category defined by the very terms of connoisseurship that once marginalized Melanesian art as something less refined than Western masterpieces or so-called High Art.  This way, visitors approached the carvers and their works not as primitives and crafts but as authentic artists and art.\n\nHowever, in [[Iatmul people|Iatmul]] society, there is no comparable category of \"master carver\" in the local lexicon or social structure.  Ironically, then, the Garden fostered the Western appreciation of non-Western art by substituting one western category for another.  One of the great aesthetic joys of the Sculpture Garden is the visual contemplation of the ironies that arise from the cross-cultural dialogue and categorization of artworks in the contemporary, transnational or globalized world.\n\nA goal of the project was not to recreate a traditional Melanesian setting but, as Mason himself reported, to create \u201can opportunity to experiment with and reinterpret New Guinea aesthetic perspectives within the new context of a Western public art space.\"  The carvers, it was hoped, would blend traditional, Sepik River themes with the ideals of Western modern art such as individualistic expression and the creation of art solely for a contemplative gaze (so-called \u2018art for art\u2019s sake\u2019).  That is, the carvers were given an opportunity to \u2018break free,\u2019 in a sense, from the conventional aesthetic constraints of the village in the Papua New Guinea \u2013 to create art not possible in a Sepik River setting.\n\nMuch of the success of the project resulted from the interplay of different yet not-necessarily compatible cross-cultural categories: Melanesia/West, traditional/modern, art/culture, and so forth.  Thus the men were brought to Stanford University on the basis of their Sepik River or Papua New Guinean identity; but once there, they were encouraged to think of themselves not as Papua New Guineans but as artists.  Moreover, the artists were given considerable input into the project, thus intentionally dispersing \u2018curatorial authority\u2019 such that, in contrast to most museums, the \u2018tribal\u2019 artists are lent considerable \u2018voice\u2019 in the final display of their works, and in choose how and what works to display.  Similarly, the Garden foregrounds the individuality of the artists \u2013 identifying them by name on each piece, which rarely, if ever, occurs in museum displays of \u2018traditional\u2019 tribal art.\nAn essential part of the six-month process was a variety of collaborative programs: daily site tours, bamboo flute performances by the carvers, a public lecture series, Friday night barbeques, \"story-time\" with the artists, and outreach programs for school children, such as on-site bark painting. These interactive encounters are vital to the authenticity of the works.\n\nThe sculptures that received the greatest amount of press and attention were two carvings in wood and pumice respectively that intentionally resemble Rodin sculptures displayed elsewhere on the Stanford campus, \"[[The Thinker]]\" and \"[[The Gates of Hell]].\"  Both sculptures were carved by the two Iatmul men from Tambunum village. According to Simon, when he saw The Thinker in the [[Iris & B.

The spacecraft consists a Crew Module (CM) manufactured by [[Lockheed Martin]] and the [[European Service Module]] (ESM) manufactured by [[Airbus Defence and Space]]. Capable of supporting a crew of six beyond [[low Earth orbit]], Orion can last 21 days undocked and up to six months docked. It is equipped with [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar power]], an [[NASA Docking System|automated docking system]], and [[glass cockpit]] interfaces modeled after those used in the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. A single [[AJ10]] engine provides the spacecraft's primary propulsion, while eight [[R-4D|R-4D-11]] engines, and six pods of custom [[reaction control system]] engines developed by Airbus, provide the spacecraft's secondary propulsion. Although compatible with other [[launch vehicle]]s, Orion is primarily designed to launch atop a [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) rocket, with a tower [[launch escape system]].\n\nOrion was conceived by Lockheed Martin as a proposal for the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] (CEV) to be used in NASA's [[Constellation program]]. Lockheed Martin's proposal defeated a competing proposal by [[Northrop Grumman]], and was selected by NASA in 2006 to be the CEV. Originally designed with a service module featuring a new \"Orion Main Engine\" and a pair of circular solar panels, the spacecraft was to be launched atop the [[Ares I]] rocket with either a traditional launch escape system {{citation needed span|1=or the experimental [[Max Launch Abort System]] equipped.|date=March 2020}} Following the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010, Orion was heavily redesigned for use in NASA's Journey to Mars initiative; later named Moon to Mars. The SLS replaced the Ares I as Orion's primary launch vehicle, and the service module was replaced with a design based on the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]. A development version of Orion's CM was launched in 2014 during [[Exploration Flight Test-1]], while at least four test articles have been produced. As of 2020, three flight-worthy Orion spacecraft are under construction, with an additional one ordered,{{Efn|NASA has ordered two additional CMs from Lockheed Martin,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foust|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Foust|title=NASA awards long-term Orion production contract to Lockheed Martin|url=https://spacenews.com/nasa-awards-long-term-orion-production-contract-to-lockheed-martin/|website=[[SpaceNews]]|accessdate=10 December 2019|date=24 September 2019|quote=The Orion Production and Operations Contract includes an initial order of three Orion spacecraft, for missions Artemis 3, 4 and 5, for $2.7 billion.}}</ref> though as of the 2019 ESA Ministerial Council, only one additional ESM has been ordered by ESA from Airbus Defence and Space.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Clark|first=Stephen|title=Earth observation, deep space exploration big winners in new ESA budget|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/29/earth-observation-deep-space-exploration-big-winners-in-new-esa-budget/|website=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=10 December 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210090653/https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/29/earth-observation-deep-space-exploration-big-winners-in-new-esa-budget/|archivedate=10 December 2019|date=29 November 2019|quote=ESA member states put up money for two Orion service modules at this week's summit in Seville.

class of [[Reusable spacecraft|partially reusable]] [[space capsule]] planned to use in [[NASA]]'s [[human spaceflight]] programs. The spacecraft consists a Crew Module (CM) manufactured by [[Lockheed Martin]] and the [[European Service Module]] (ESM) manufactured by [[Airbus Defence and Space]]. Capable of supporting a crew of six beyond [[low Earth orbit]], Orion can last 21 days undocked and up to six months docked. It is equipped with [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar power]], an [[NASA Docking System|automated docking system]], and [[glass cockpit]] interfaces modeled after those used in the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. A single [[AJ10]] engine provides the spacecraft's primary propulsion, while eight [[R-4D|R-4D-11]] engines, and six pods of custom [[reaction control system]] engines developed by Airbus, provide the spacecraft's secondary propulsion. Although compatible with other [[launch vehicle]]s, Orion is primarily designed to launch atop a [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) rocket, with a tower [[launch escape system]].\n\nOrion was conceived by Lockheed Martin as a proposal for the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] (CEV) to be used in NASA's [[Constellation program]]. Lockheed Martin's proposal defeated a competing proposal by [[Northrop Grumman]], and was selected by NASA in 2006 to be the CEV. Originally designed with a service module featuring a new \"Orion Main Engine\" and a pair of circular solar panels, the spacecraft was to be launched atop the [[Ares I]] rocket with either a traditional launch escape system {{citation needed span|1=or the experimental [[Max Launch Abort System]] equipped.|date=March 2020}} Following the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010, Orion was heavily redesigned for use in NASA's Journey to Mars initiative; later named Moon to Mars. The SLS replaced the Ares I as Orion's primary launch vehicle, and the service module was replaced with a design based on the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]. A development version of Orion's CM was launched in 2014 during [[Exploration Flight Test-1]], while at least four test articles have been produced. As of 2020, three flight-worthy Orion spacecraft are under construction, with an additional one ordered,{{Efn|NASA has ordered two additional CMs from Lockheed Martin,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foust|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Foust|title=NASA awards long-term Orion production contract to Lockheed Martin|url=https://spacenews.com/nasa-awards-long-term-orion-production-contract-to-lockheed-martin/|website=[[SpaceNews]]|accessdate=10 December 2019|date=24 September 2019|quote=The Orion Production and Operations Contract includes an initial order of three Orion spacecraft, for missions Artemis 3, 4 and 5, for $2.7 billion.}}</ref> though as of the 2019 ESA Ministerial Council, only one additional ESM has been ordered by ESA from Airbus Defence and Space.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Clark|first=Stephen|title=Earth observation, deep space exploration big winners in new ESA budget|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/29/earth-observation-deep-space-exploration-big-winners-in-new-esa-budget/|website=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=10 December 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210090653/https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/29/earth-observation-deep-space-exploration-big-winners-in-new-esa-budget/|archivedate=10 December 2019|date=29 November 2019|quote=ESA member states put up money for two Orion service modules at this week's summit in Seville.

It was to be based on the Orion spacecraft that Lockheed Martin was developing for [[NASA]]. It would be a lighter, less capable and cheaper version of the full Orion.\n\nThe intention of designing Orion Lite would be to provide a stripped-down version of the Orion that would be available for missions to the [[International Space Station]] earlier than the more capable Orion, which is designed for longer duration missions to the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]].<ref name=\"MSNBCspace200908\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32418057 |title=Company pitches 'lite' spaceship to NASA |publisher=NBC News |first=Amy |last=Klamper |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=7 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nBigelow began working with Lockheed Martin in 2004.

While Orion Lite would have the same exterior dimensions as the Orion, there would be no need for the deep space infrastructure present in the Orion configuration. As such, the Orion Lite would be able to support larger crews of around 7 people as the result of greater habitable interior volume and the reduced weight of equipment needed to support an exclusively low-Earth-orbit configuration.<ref name=PS20090814>\n[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-amp-space/article/2009-08/space-hotel-visionary-proposes-modified-spaceship-nasa Space Hotel Visionary Proposes Modified \"Orion Lite\" Spaceship for NASA: Bigelow Airspace's concept is for low Earth-orbit missions only], ''[[Popular Science]]'', Jeremy Hsu, 14 August 2009</ref>\n\n====Recovery====\n\nIn order to reduce the weight of Orion Lite, the more durable heat shield of the Orion would be replaced with a lighter weight heat shield designed to support the lower temperatures of Earth atmospheric re-entry from low Earth orbit.

Filled with gentle reflections on love and loss, mixed in with the star bassist's signature sense of humour and funky beats, it is exactly the record the world needed.\" Barnabe praised Thundercat's implementation of humor elements on the album, particularly praising the song \"Dragonball Durag\". Barnabe further stated that the album \"manifests as a beautiful ebb and flow of emotional states, philosophical musings and plain old comedy.\"<ref name=\"exclaim-review\"/> Roisin O'Connor of ''[[The Independent]]'' favorably compared the album to its predecessor, ''Drunk'', stating that both records \"continue to reflect on Thundercat's acceptance of his own mortality, veering away from an almost-claustrophobic grief and into deeper contemplation.\"<ref name=\"independent-review\"/> Writing for ''[[NME]]'', Sam Moore stated that the album's \"magic moment comes as Thundercat links up with [[Steve Lacy (guitarist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]] and '80s funk hero [[Steve Arrington]] on 'Black Qualls'; the disco-funk tune should be up for consideration as the best song of 2020. Its inclusion here gives a comforting indication that, for all of the album's heavy rumination on life, death and healing, Thundercat can still kick back when required.\" Moore commented on the album's lyrics, which depicts a variety of themes, stating that \" Thundercat's lyrical reflections on grief, uncertainty and gradual healing are threaded through 'It Is What It Is'.\"<ref name=\"nme-review\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s reviewer Reed Jackson gave the album a positive review, but also criticized the composition and songwriting on a few of the album's tracks. Jackson also called it more \"unpolished\" than its predecessor, while at the same time praising Thundercat's bass playing.<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\nIn a more mixed review, Kitty Empire of [[The Observer|''The Observer'']] stated that \"The track-listing also finds ample time for these more dense jazz-funk fusions \u2013 hyper-speed snippets like How Sway, where Bruner reminds listeners he isn't from the mainstream, he's just visiting from somewhere altogether gnarlier. It all makes for an album that gently weeps, then does a set of star jumps. Bruners quick mind and faster fingers dash off on tangents, never quite exploring his grooves to their fullest extents.\" Empire continued by stating the album's drawback lays with the fact that it switches through emotions too often. She stated that Thundercat \"doesn't sit with one emotion, be it high or low, for a sustained length of time. When the title track glides in, at a luxurious five minutes (even if it is in two parts), you wish Thundercat had given all his ideas the benefit of the album's title \u2013 ''It Is What It Is''.

Filled with gentle reflections on love and loss, mixed in with the star bassist's signature sense of humour and funky beats, it is exactly the record the world needed.\" Barnabe praised Thundercat's implementation of humor elements on the album, particularly praising the song \"Dragonball Durag\". Barnabe further stated that the album \"manifests as a beautiful ebb and flow of emotional states, philosophical musings and plain old comedy.\"<ref name=\"exclaim-review\"/> Roisin O'Connor of ''[[The Independent]]'' favorably compared the album to its predecessor, ''Drunk'', stating that both records \"continue to reflect on Thundercat's acceptance of his own mortality, veering away from an almost-claustrophobic grief and into deeper contemplation.\"<ref name=\"independent-review\"/> Writing for ''[[NME]]'', Sam Moore stated that the album's \"magic moment comes as Thundercat links up with [[Steve Lacy (guitarist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]] and '80s funk hero [[Steve Arrington]] on 'Black Qualls'; the disco-funk tune should be up for consideration as the best song of 2020. Its inclusion here gives a comforting indication that, for all of the album's heavy rumination on life, death and healing, Thundercat can still kick back when required.\" Moore commented on the album's lyrics which depicts a variety of themes, stating that \" Thundercat's lyrical reflections on grief, uncertainty and gradual healing are threaded through 'It Is What It Is'.\"<ref name=\"nme-review\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s reviewer Reed Jackson gave the album a positive review, but also criticized the composition and songwriting on a few of the album's tracks. Jackson also called it more \"unpolished\" than its predecessor, while at the same time praising Thundercat's bass playing.<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\nIn a more mixed review, Kitty Empire of [[The Observer|''The Observer'']] stated that \"The track-listing also finds ample time for these more dense jazz-funk fusions \u2013 hyper-speed snippets like How Sway, where Bruner reminds listeners he isn't from the mainstream, he's just visiting from somewhere altogether gnarlier. It all makes for an album that gently weeps, then does a set of star jumps. Bruners quick mind and faster fingers dash off on tangents, never quite exploring his grooves to their fullest extents.\" Empire continued by stating the album's drawback lays with the fact that it switches through emotions too often. She stated that Thundercat \"doesn't sit with one emotion, be it high or low, for a sustained length of time.

Boats were as long as {{Convert|69|ft|m|abbr=}} and sailed as fast as {{Convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=}}, a record exceeding any other conveyance in 1885, set by the ''[[Icicle (yacht)|Icicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first American Challenge Pennant occurred in 1881 on the Hudson river with five ice-yacht clubs competing.

At the stern was a steering runner, attached to a rudder-like structure. to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. These boats used conventional gaff mainsails and jibs, attached to the mast by travellers. A tiller or wheel stern controls the steering runner.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 19th century iceboats evolved into a box, riding on cross-pieces, supported by runners. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.<ref name=\":03\" /> In 1879 the archetypical Hudson River iceboat began to emerge. The ''Robert Scott'', designed and built by H. Relyea, had a single backbone and wire guy-ropes. The mast on subsequent boats were stepped further forward than in the past with shortened jibs were shortened and the center of effort and resistance brought into balance, aligning both with the main runners.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/03/07/as-the-hudson-river-freezes-over-classic-ice-yachts-emerge/|title=As The Hudson River Freezes, Classic Ice Yachts Emerge|last=Fisher|first=Daniel|date=March 7, 2014|website=Forbes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The shallow cockpit box became elliptical.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the early 1900s some smaller iceboats, called ''scooters'', were designed to traverse both ice and water with a shallow, oval {{Convert|15*5|ft|m|abbr=}} hull on fixed runners. These sailing craft were steered by manipulating the sails, there being no rudder.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]] in a boat named the ''Beau Skeeter''.<ref name=\":4\" /> This boat led to the \"Skeeter\" class, and the ''Skeeter Ice Boat Club'' formed on [[Geneva Lake]], Wisconsin.

Racing craft typically carry one person.\n\nA related activity, [[land sailing]], employs sailing craft similar to iceboats, but riding on wheels instead of runners.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ice boat (Quebec).jpg|thumb|Ice boat on [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Quebec City]], ca 1858-1860]]\n[[File:Ice yachters on Hudson River near Barrytown, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Classic iceboats on the [[Hudson River]] at [[Barrytown, New York|Barrytown, NY]]|alt=Several boats with their sails at various stages of dismantling surrounding a large vehicle with a wooded promontory behind them.

Initially boats were used for commerce, but soon evolved into pleasure craft\u2014\"ice yachts\".

The first recorded boat, built in 1790 by Oliver Booth of Poughkeepsie, was a square box atop three runners, the two forward runners being nailed to the box and the third acted as a rudder operated by a tiller.

Boats were as long as {{Convert|69|ft|m|abbr=}} and sailed as fast as {{Convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=}}, a record exceeding any other conveyance in 1885, set by the ''[[Icicle (yacht)|Icicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first American Challenge Pennant occurred in 1881 on the Hudson river with five ice-yacht clubs competing.

In Canada, there were venues on [[Lake Ontario]] (Kingston) and the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA European ice sailing club formed first in Sweden (1901), followed by the European Ice Yachting Union, which formed in 1928 with member states Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, Austria, and Germany.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:Vinckboons Landscape with skaters.jpg|thumb|Dutch Iceboats, 17th century]]\n17th-century Dutch ice yachts consisted of flat-bottomed sailboats atop a cross-wise plank, resting on outboard metal runners, which carried the bulk of the weight of the craft. At the stern was a steering runner, attached to a rudder-like structure. to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. These boats used conventional gaff mainsails and jibs, attached to the mast by travellers. A tiller or wheel stern controls the steering runner.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 19th century iceboats evolved into a box, riding on cross-pieces, supported by runners. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.<ref name=\":03\" /> In 1879 the archetypical Hudson River iceboat began to emerge. The ''Robert Scott'', designed and built by H. Relyea, had a single backbone and wire guy-ropes. The mast on subsequent boats were stepped further forward than in the past with shortened jibs were shortened and the center of effort and resistance brought into balance, aligning both with the main runners.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/03/07/as-the-hudson-river-freezes-over-classic-ice-yachts-emerge/|title=As The Hudson River Freezes, Classic Ice Yachts Emerge|last=Fisher|first=Daniel|date=March 7, 2014|website=Forbes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The shallow cockpit box became elliptical.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the early 1900s some smaller iceboats, called ''scooters'', were designed to traverse both ice and water with a shallow, oval {{Convert|15*5|ft|m|abbr=}} hull on fixed runners. These sailing craft were steered by manipulating the sails, there being no rudder.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]] in a boat named the ''Beau Skeeter''.<ref name=\":4\" /> This boat led to the \"Skeeter\" class, and the ''Skeeter Ice Boat Club'' formed on [[Geneva Lake]], Wisconsin.

Runners are made of iron or steel with sharpened edges, which hold onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails, as they develop [[Forces on sails|propulsive lift]].
