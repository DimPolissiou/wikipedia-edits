It closely studies the pressure difference and aerodynamics of a vehicle to ensure safety and efficiency. Since most of the studies are related to fluids, it is applied to any moving vehicle, such as cars.\n\n=== Marine engineering ===\n{{Main|Marine engineering}}\nMarine engineering is associated with anything on or near the ocean. Examples are, but not limited to, ships, submarines, oil rigs, structure, watercraft propulsion, on-board design and development, plants, harbors, and so on. It requires a combined knowledge in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering,and some programming abilities.\n\n==Practice==\nOne who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].\n\n==Methodology==\n[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|upright|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]\n\nIn the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.\n\nIf multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.\n\nConstraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.\n\n===Problem solving===\n[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]\nEngineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/47499-what-is-engineering.html|title=What is Engineering? {{!}} Types of Engineering|last=Nature|first=Jim Lucas 2014-08-22T00:44:14Z Human|website=livescience.com|language=en|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUsually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of \"[[level of invention|low-level]]\" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theoriesaboutengineering.org/genrich_altshuller.html|title=Theories About Engineering \u2013 Genrich Altshuller|website=theoriesaboutengineering.org|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEngineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-compare-scientific-method|title=Comparing the Engineering Design Process and the Scientific Method|website=Science Buddies|language=en-US|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEngineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure.\n\nThe study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asce.org/forensic-engineering/forensic-engineering/|title=Forensic Engineering {{!}} ASCE|website=www.asce.org|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Computer use===\n[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|left|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry.

As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.\n\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nOne of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software.  It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.\n\nThese allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics.

Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.\n\nBy its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.\n\nEngineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.\n\nEngineering is a key driver of innovation and human development.

Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.<ref name=\"Fung\">{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P.

[[Engineering management]] or \"Management engineering\" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical & electronics, power distribution & generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.\n\n===Other fields===\nIn [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles.

It requires a combined knowledge in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering,and some programming abilities.\n\n==Practice==\nOne who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].\n\n==Methodology==\n[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|upright|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]\n\nIn the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.\n\nIf multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.\n\nConstraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.\n\n===Problem solving===\n[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]\nEngineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/47499-what-is-engineering.html|title=What is Engineering? {{!}} Types of Engineering|last=Nature|first=Jim Lucas 2014-08-22T00:44:14Z Human|website=livescience.com|language=en|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUsually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of \"[[level of invention|low-level]]\" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theoriesaboutengineering.org/genrich_altshuller.html|title=Theories About Engineering \u2013 Genrich Altshuller|website=theoriesaboutengineering.org|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEngineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-compare-scientific-method|title=Comparing the Engineering Design Process and the Scientific Method|website=Science Buddies|language=en-US|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEngineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure.\n\nThe study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asce.org/forensic-engineering/forensic-engineering/|title=Forensic Engineering {{!}} ASCE|website=www.asce.org|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Computer use===\n[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|left|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]\n\nAs with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.\n\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nOne of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software.  It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.\n\nThese allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Arbe\n  | first = Katrina\n  | title = PDM: Not Just for the Big Boys Anymore\n  | publisher = ThomasNet\n  | date = May 7, 2001\n  | url = http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2001/05/pdm_not_just_fo.html\n  | accessdate = December 30, 2006\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100806185926/http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2001/05/pdm_not_just_fo.html\n  | archive-date = August 6, 2010\n  | url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\nThere are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.\n\nIn recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Arbe\n  | first = Katrina\n  | title = The Latest Chapter in CAD Software Evaluation\n  | publisher = ThomasNet\n  | date = May 22, 2003\n  | url = http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2003/05/the_latest_chap.html\n  | accessdate = December 30, 2006\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100806132726/http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2003/05/the_latest_chap.html\n  | archive-date = August 6, 2010\n  | url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Social context==\n{{Original research section|date=July 2010}}\n[[File:Kismet-IMG 6007-gradient.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robotic]] [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]\nThe engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.\n\nBy its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.\n\nEngineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.\n\nEngineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.<ref name=\"MDG\">{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&faculty=14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&faculty=14 |archivedate=October 6, 2006|url-status=dead|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:ElementBlack2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Radar, [[GPS]], [[lidar]], ... are all combined to provide proper navigation and [[obstacle avoidance]] (vehicle developed for 2007 [[DARPA Urban Challenge]])]]\n\nAll overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios.

Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession.

[[Engineering management]] or \"Management engineering\" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical & electronics, power distribution & generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.\n\n===Other fields===\nIn [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Financial engineering]] has similarly borrowed the term.\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Engineering}}}}\n{{Main|Outline of engineering}}\n;Lists\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Engineering society]]\n* [[List of aerospace engineering topics]]\n* [[List of basic chemical engineering topics]]\n* [[List of electrical engineering topics]]\n* [[List of engineering topics]]\n* [[List of engineers]]\n* [[List of genetic engineering topics]]\n* [[List of mechanical engineering topics]]\n* [[List of nanoengineering topics]]\n* [[List of software engineering topics]]\n{{Div col end}}\n;Glossaries\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Glossary of areas of mathematics]]\n* [[Glossary of biology]]\n* [[Glossary of chemistry terms|Glossary of chemistry]]\n* [[Glossary of engineering]]\n* [[Glossary of physics]]\n{{Div col end}}\n;Related subjects\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Controversies over the term Engineer]]\n* [[Design]]\n* [[Earthquake engineering]]\n* [[Engineer]]\n* [[Engineering economics]]\n* [[Engineering education]]\n* [[Engineering education research]]\n* [[Engineers Without Borders]]\n* [[Forensic engineering]]\n* [[Global Engineering Education]]\n* [[Industrial design]]\n* [[Infrastructure]]\n* [[Mathematics]]\n* [[Open-source hardware]]\n* [[Planned obsolescence]]\n* [[Reverse engineering]]\n* [[Science and technology]]\n* [[Structural failure]]\n* [[Sustainable engineering]]\n* [[Women in engineering]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Blockley|first=David|title=Engineering: a very short introduction|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-957869-6}}\n* {{cite book |editor=[[Richard C.

The majority of lakes dry up as the result of the filling with [[lacustrine deposits]], sediment deposited from a river into a lake over thousands of years. Factors that influence the water level decreasing includes [[Lacustrine deposits|fluvial-lacustrine]] sediment build up, [[Evaporation pond|evaporation]], natural drainage and [[geophysical]] processes. Ancient Lakes have such a prolonged life when compared to younger more ordinary lakes due to the local active [[rift zones]] and [[Subsidence|subsided]] sections of land called [[graben]]s.\n\nFor example, [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia, the deepest lake in the world is an ancient lake created by the [[Baikal Rift Zone]]; 25\u201330 million years old, {{Convert|5387|ft|}} deep. Compared to the North American [[Great Lakes]], which were formed by the last glacial period by glacial scouring and the pooling of [[meltwater]]: 14,000 years old, max depth of lakes ranging from {{Convert|200-1300|ft||-1}} deep.\n\n* [[Rift lake]]s\n* Landslide and ice dam lakes\n* [[Salt lake]]s\n* [[Oxbow lake]]s\n* [[Volcanic crater lake|Crater lake]]s\n* [[Glacial lake]]s\n* [[Subglacial lake]]s\n\n==Formation of ancient lakes==\nAncient lake formation is similar to that of a [[rift valley]]. Formation occurs within a graben that is located on an active rift zone. Grabens are sections of land, formed along [[Divergent boundary|divergent plate boundaries]], which have subsided between two parallel plates. The location of the graben above the active rift zone results in a lake bottom that is constantly dropping in depth and walls increasing in height.\n\n==Importance to evolution==\nAncient lakes allow scientists to study the  mechanisms of environmental changes over glacial-interglacial timescales. Evolutionary characteristics including [[sexual selection]], [[adaptive radiation]] and [[punctuated equilibrium]] are studied in ancient lakes due to their prolonged existence and  general geographic isolation. Most of the research has been associated with the endemic fauna and diatoms that exists in these isolated lakes, concentrating on [[Lake Baikal]], the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[African Great Lakes]]. Information is derived from the associations of the [[Lacustrine deposits|fluvial-lacustrine]], [[Profundal|fluctuating profundal]] and [[Evaporation pond|evaporative facies]].\n\n== List of ancient lakes ==\nThese are the 20 ancient lakes in the world that have existed for more than 1 million years.<ref name=\"marine-rutgers\">{{cite web |title = Ancient lakes of the world |format=website |url = https://marine.rutgers.edu/~cfree/ancient-lakes-of-the-world/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200209063201/https://marine.rutgers.edu/~cfree/ancient-lakes-of-the-world/ |archivedate = January 20, 2020 | publisher = Christopher M.

Ancient Lakes have such a prolonged life when compared to younger more ordinary lakes due to the local active [[rift zones]] and [[Subsidence|subsided]] sections of land called [[graben]]s.\n\nFor example, [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia, the deepest lake in the world is an ancient lake created by the [[Baikal Rift Zone]]; 25\u201330 million years old, {{Convert|5387|ft|}} deep. Compared to the North American [[Great Lakes]], which were formed by the last glacial period by glacial scouring and the pooling of [[meltwater]]: 14,000 years old, max depth of lakes ranging from {{Convert|200-1300|ft||-1}} deep.\n\n* [[Rift lake]]s\n* Landslide and ice dam lakes\n* [[Salt lake]]s\n* [[Oxbow lake]]s\n* [[Volcanic crater lake|Crater lake]]s\n* [[Glacial lake]]s\n* [[Subglacial lake]]s\n\n==Formation of ancient lakes==\nAncient lake formation is similar to that of a [[rift valley]]. Formation occurs within a graben that is located on an active rift zone. Grabens are sections of land, formed along [[Divergent boundary|divergent plate boundaries]], which have subsided between two parallel plates. The location of the graben above the active rift zone results in a lake bottom that is constantly dropping in depth and walls increasing in height.\n\n==Importance to evolution==\nAncient lakes allow scientists to study the  mechanisms of environmental changes over glacial-interglacial timescales. Evolutionary characteristics including [[sexual selection]], [[adaptive radiation]] and [[punctuated equilibrium]] are studied in ancient lakes due to their prolonged existence and  general geographic isolation. Most of the research has been associated with the endemic fauna and diatoms that exists in these isolated lakes, concentrating on [[Lake Baikal]], the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[African Great Lakes]]. Information is derived from the associations of the [[Lacustrine deposits|fluvial-lacustrine]], [[Profundal|fluctuating profundal]] and [[Evaporation pond|evaporative facies]].\n\n== List of ancient lakes ==\nThese are the 20 ancient lakes in the world that have existed for more than 1 million years.<ref name=\"marine-rutgers\">{{cite web |title = Ancient lakes of the world |format=website |url = https://marine.rutgers.edu/~cfree/ancient-lakes-of-the-world/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200209063201/https://marine.rutgers.edu/~cfree/ancient-lakes-of-the-world/ |archivedate = January 20, 2020 | publisher = Christopher M.

In 1797 historical accounts of the city inspired the famous poem ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' by the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\n== Description ==\nShangdu was located in what is now Shangdu Town, Zhenglan Banner, [[Inner Mongolia]], {{convert|350|km|mi}} north of Beijing. It is about {{convert|28|km|mi}} northwest of the modern town of [[Dolon Nor|Duolun]]. The layout of the capital is roughly square shaped with sides of about 2,200&nbsp;m; it consists of an \"outer city\", and an \"inner city\" in the southeast of the capital which has also roughly a square layout with sides about 1,400&nbsp;m, and the palace, where Kublai Khan stayed in summer. The palace has sides of roughly 550&nbsp;m, covering an area of around 40% the size of the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing. The most visible modern-day remnants are the earthen walls though there is also a ground-level, circular brick platform in the centre of the inner enclosure.\n\nThe city, originally named '''Kaiping''' ({{linktext|\u5f00\u5e73}}, ''K\u0101ip\u00edng''), was designed by Chinese architect [[Liu Bingzhong]] from 1252 to 1256,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/asianart/timeperiod_china.jsp?ctry=China&pd=Yuan|title=Yuan dynasty|publisher=[[Princeton University Art Museum]]}}</ref> and Liu implemented a \"profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Chinese imperial city planning|author=Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=1999|page=153|isbn=0-8248-2196-3|quote=Liu Bingzhong implemented a preconceived and profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture.}}</ref> In 1264 it was renamed Shangdu. At its zenith, over 100,000 people lived within its walls. In 1369 Shangdu was occupied by the [[Ming dynasty|Ming army]], put to the torch and its name reverted to Kaiping. The last reigning Khan, [[Toghun Tem\u00fcr]], fled the city, which was abandoned for several hundred years.<ref name=\"man\">{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|title=Kublai Khan: From Xanadu to Superpower|year=2006|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|location=London|isbn=9780553817188|pages=104\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nIn 1872, Steven Bushell, affiliated with the British Legation in Beijing, visited the site and reported that remains of temples, blocks of marble, and tiles were still to be found there.

In about 1298\u201399, he dictated the following account, one of the most complete descriptions of the city as it existed:\n{{quote|And when you have ridden three days from the city last mentioned, [[Points_of_the_compass|between north-east and north]], you come to a city called Chandu, which was built by the Khan now reigning.

The Khan himself goes every week to see his birds sitting in\nmew, and sometimes he rides through the park with a leopard behind him on\nhis horse's [[Rump_(animal)|croup]]; and then if he sees any animal that takes his fancy, he\nslips his leopard at it, and the game when taken is made over to\nfeed the hawks in mew. This he does for [[Sport#Etymology|diversion]].\n\nMoreover at a spot in the Park where there is a charming wood he has\nanother Palace built of [[Wicker|cane]], of which I must give you a description. It\nis gilt all over, and most elaborately finished inside. It is [[wiktionary:stay#Etymology_2|stayed]] on\ngilt and [[Lacquerware|lacquered]] columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail\nof which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the\n[[architrave]], and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to\nsupport the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes,\ncovered with a [[Varnish|varnish]] so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will\nrot them. These canes are a good 3 [[Palm_(unit)|palms]] in girth, and from 10 to 15 [[Pace_(unit)|paces]]\nin length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are\nsplit so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house\nis roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent\nthe wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these\ncanes, which I may mention serve also for a great variety of other\nuseful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can\nbe taken down and put up again with great [[wiktionary:celerity|celerity]]; and it can all be\ntaken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When\nerected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200\ncords of silk.\n\nThe Khan abides at this Park of his, dwelling sometimes in the Marble\nPalace and sometimes in the Cane Palace for three months of the year, to\nwit, June, July and August; preferring this residence because it is by no\nmeans hot; in fact it is a very cool place. When the 28th day of [the Moon\nof] August arrives he takes his departure, and the Cane Palace is taken to\npieces.

Unfortunately Coleridge's writing was interrupted by an unnamed \"[[Person from Porlock|person on business from Porlock]]\", causing him to forget much of the dream, but his images of Shangdu became one of the best-known poems in the English language.\n\nColeridge described how he wrote the poem in the preface to his collection of poems, ''Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep'', published in 1816:\n <blockquote>\"In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire. In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in 'Purchas's Pilgrimes':\n\nHere the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto. And thus ten miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall.\nThe Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines; if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effort. On awakening he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved.\" \"A person on business from Porlock\" interrupted him and he was never able to recapture more than \"some eight or ten scattered lines and images.\"<ref>Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ''Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep'', 2nd edition, William Bulmer, London, 1816.</ref></blockquote>\n\nColeridge's description of Shangdu has echoes of the works of both Marco Polo and Samuel Purchas.  In his description of Shangdu, Marco Polo wrote:\n<blockquote>\"...Round this Palace a wall is built, inclosing a compass of sixteen miles, and inside the Park there are fountains and rivers and brooks and beautiful meadows, with all kinds of wild animals (excluding such as are of ferocious nature)...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo/Book_1/Chapter_61 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104224538/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo/Book_1/Chapter_61 |archivedate=2016-01-04 }} The Travels of Marco Polo, Book 1/Chapter 61, ''Of the City of Chandu, and the Kaan's Palace There''. from Wikisource, translated by Henry Yule.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis became, in Purchas's book ''Purchas his Pilgrimes'':\n\n<blockquote>In Xandu did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sumpuous house of pleasure, which may be moved from place to place.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis became, in Coleridge's poem:\n\n:In Xanadu did Kubla Khan\n:A stately pleasure-dome decree:\n:Where Alph, the sacred river, ran\n:Through caverns measureless to man\n:Down to a sunless sea.\n\n:So twice five miles of fertile ground\n:With walls and towers were girdled round:\n:And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,\n:Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;\n:And here were forests ancient as the hills,\n:Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

It was the name of [[Charles Foster Kane]]'s [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|estate]] in the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', that of [[Mandrake the Magician]] in the long-running comic strip, as well as the upstate retreat of villain Xanatos in [[Gargoyles_(TV_series)]]. The title of the 1980 film [[Xanadu (film)|''Xanadu'']] starring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] is a reference to Coleridge's poem, which also led to the song by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and Newton-John, \"[[Xanadu (Olivia Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra song)|Xanadu]]\".\n\nIn the [[Kurt Vonnegut]] novel, ''[[Timequake]]'', Xanadu is the name of a retreat for prolific writers in a resort on [[Cape Cod]].  Xanadu was featured in the short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] called \"A Miracle of Rare Device\", written in 1962 and republished in 1964 in the collection ''The Machineries of Joy''. The story was later made into a television episode. ''[[In Xanadu]]'' is a 1989 travel book by [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]]; at the age of 22 he sets off along the Silk Road from [[Antioch]].\n\nIn early 1980, [[Teena Marie]] had a US R&B top 40 hit with \"Behind the Groove\" that mentions Xanadu.

In the sci-fi/cyberpunk/fantasy novels ''[[Otherland]]'' by [[Tad Williams]], Paul Jonas passes through a \"simworld\", or highly realistic simulation, of Xanadu, as described in Coleridge's poem.\n\nXanadu is revealed to be an alternate name for the utopian city of Tralla-La, a setting from the [[Scrooge McDuck]] [[Disney]] comic books, originally created by [[Carl Barks]] and expanded on by [[Don Rosa]] in his story \"Return To Xanadu\", where it is revealed that Genghis Khan had the capital of his empire placed there after he occupied the city, and hid the massive treasury of the Mongul Empire in the massive underground reservoir that drained the river flowing through the city, creating the \"sunless sea\" mentioned in Coleridge's poem.\n\nThe city name is also the name of one of the most popular RPGs of the 1980s for several home computers, called [[Xanadu_(video_game)|Xanadu: Dragonslayer II]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of mythological places]]\n*[[Karakorum]], the earlier Mongol capital founded by [[Genghis Khan]], and built in stone by [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] in 1220\n*[[Shangri-La]]\n*[[Shambhala]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.maplandia.com/china/nei-mongol-zizhiqu/shangdu/ Shangdu Google Satellite Map]\n*[https://www.ancient.eu/Xanadu/ Xanadu - Ancient History Encyclopedia]\n* [https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5326/ Sites of the Yuan Dynasty Upper Capital (Xanadu) and Middle Capital ] ([http://whc.unesco.org UNESCO World Heritage])\n\n{{Yuan dynasty topics}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in China}}\n\n[[Category:Medieval cities]]\n[[Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Inner Mongolia]]\n[[Category:Yuan dynasty]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in China]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in China]]\n[[Category:Kublai Khan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Overquotation|date=July 2016}}\n\n{{other uses}}\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n|WHS         = Site of Xanadu\n|Criteria    = Cultural: ii, iii, iv, vi\n|ID          = 1389\n|Year        = 2012\n|Location    = Shangdu Town, [[Zhenglan Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China\n|Area        = 25,131.27 ha\n|Buffer_zone = 150,721.96 ha\n|Coordinates = {{coord|42|21|35|N|116|10|45|E}}\n|locmapin    = China Inner Mongolia#China\n|map_caption = Location of Shangdu\n}}\n{{Chinese\n|c = {{linktext|\u4e0a|\u90fd}}\n|p = Sh\u00e0ngd\u016b\n|w = Shang-tu<br>Shangtu\n|l = Upper Capital\n|showflag = p\n}}\n[[File:Xanadu on Map of Asia.JPG|thumb|Shangdu (here spelled ''Ciandu'', as [[Marco Polo]] spelled it) on the French map of Asia made by [[Sanson d'Abbeville]], geographer of King [[Louis XIV]], dated 1650.

In 1797 historical accounts of the city inspired the famous poem ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' by the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\n== Description ==\nShangdu was located in what is now Shangdu Town, Zhenglan Banner, [[Inner Mongolia]], {{convert|350|km|mi}} north of Beijing. It is about {{convert|28|km|mi}} northwest of the modern town of [[Dolon Nor|Duolun]]. The layout of the capital is roughly square shaped with sides of about 2,200&nbsp;m; it consists of an \"outer city\", and an \"inner city\" in the southeast of the capital which has also roughly a square layout with sides about 1,400&nbsp;m, and the palace, where Kublai Khan stayed in summer. The palace has sides of roughly 550&nbsp;m, covering an area of around 40% the size of the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing. The most visible modern-day remnants are the earthen walls though there is also a ground-level, circular brick platform in the centre of the inner enclosure.\n\nThe city, originally named '''Kaiping''' ({{linktext|\u5f00\u5e73}}, ''K\u0101ip\u00edng''), was designed by Chinese architect [[Liu Bingzhong]] from 1252 to 1256,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/asianart/timeperiod_china.jsp?ctry=China&pd=Yuan|title=Yuan dynasty|publisher=[[Princeton University Art Museum]]}}</ref> and Liu implemented a \"profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Chinese imperial city planning|author=Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=1999|page=153|isbn=0-8248-2196-3|quote=Liu Bingzhong implemented a preconceived and profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture.}}</ref> In 1264 it was renamed Shangdu. At its zenith, over 100,000 people lived within its walls. In 1369 Shangdu was occupied by the [[Ming dynasty|Ming army]], put to the torch and its name reverted to Kaiping.

This he does for [[Sport#Etymology|diversion]].\n\nMoreover at a spot in the Park where there is a charming wood he has\nanother Palace built of [[Wicker|cane]], of which I must give you a description. It\nis gilt all over, and most elaborately finished inside. It is [[wiktionary:stay#Etymology_2|stayed]] on\ngilt and [[Lacquerware|lacquered]] columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail\nof which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the\n[[architrave]], and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to\nsupport the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes,\ncovered with a [[Varnish|varnish]] so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will\nrot them. These canes are a good 3 [[Palm_(unit)|palms]] in girth, and from 10 to 15 [[Pace_(unit)|paces]]\nin length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are\nsplit so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house\nis roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent\nthe wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these\ncanes, which I may mention serve also for a great variety of other\nuseful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can\nbe taken down and put up again with great [[wiktionary:celerity|celerity]]; and it can all be\ntaken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When\nerected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200\ncords of silk.\n\nThe Khan abides at this Park of his, dwelling sometimes in the Marble\nPalace and sometimes in the Cane Palace for three months of the year, to\nwit, June, July and August; preferring this residence because it is by no\nmeans hot; in fact it is a very cool place. When the 28th day of [the Moon\nof] August arrives he takes his departure, and the Cane Palace is taken to\npieces.

The dream caused him to begin the poem known as '[[Kubla Khan]]'.  Unfortunately Coleridge's writing was interrupted by an unnamed \"[[Person from Porlock|person on business from Porlock]]\", causing him to forget much of the dream, but his images of Shangdu became one of the best-known poems in the English language.\n\nColeridge described how he wrote the poem in the preface to his collection of poems, ''Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep'', published in 1816:\n <blockquote>\"In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire. In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in 'Purchas's Pilgrimes':\n\nHere the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto.

Carnera won by [[knockout]] in round two.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=11-12}} He won his first six bouts, then lost to Franz Diener by disqualification in round one at [[Leipzig]]. Then, he won seven more bouts in a row before meeting [[Young Stribling]]. He and Stribling exchanged disqualification wins, Carnera winning the first in four rounds, and Stribling winning the rematch in round seven. In Carnera's next bout he avenged his defeat to Diener with a knockout in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=22}}\n\nIn 1930, he moved to the United States, where he toured extensively, winning his first seventeen bouts there by knockout. [[George Godfrey (boxer born 1897)|George Godfrey]] broke the knockout streak in [[Philadelphia]] by losing to Carnera by disqualification in the fifth round.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=52}} In 1932, Carnera faced the tallest heavyweight in history up to that point, [[Santa Camar\u00e3o]], a {{height|ft=6|in=8}} [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fighter. Carnera won the fight in a sixth-round knockout.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=93-94}}\n\nOn 10 February 1933, he knocked out [[Ernie Schaaf]] in thirteen rounds in New York City. Schaaf died four days later.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=100}} Schaaf had suffered a severe beating and knockout in a bout with future heavyweight champion [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] six months earlier, on 31 August 1932.

There is disagreement regarding how many times Carnera was knocked down, with sources giving conflicting totals of 7, 10, 11 (per [[Associated Press]]) and 12 (per [[The Ring Magazine|''The Ring'' magazine]] founder [[Nat Fleischer]], ringside for the fight, who wrote that Carnera was knocked down 12 times and slipped once after a missed punch).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Primo_Carnera_vs._Max_Baer |title=Primo Carnera vs. Max Baer\u2013 Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter that, Carnera won his next four fights, three of them as part of a South American tour that took him to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, as well as two exhibitions fought on the South American continent. But then, on 25 June 1935, he was knocked out in six rounds by [[Joe Louis]].\n\nFor the next two and a half years, he won five and lost three of eight total fights. But in 1938, Carnera, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], had to have a kidney removed, which forced him into retirement by 1944.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=179}} Carnera's record was 89 wins and 14 losses. His 72 wins by knockout made him a member of the exclusive club of boxers that won 50 or more bouts by knockout.\n\nCarnera died in 1967 in his native town of a combination of [[liver]] disease and complications from diabetes.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=7, 214}}\n\n====Legacy in boxing====\nCarnera was the third European to hold the world heavyweight championship after [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] and [[Max Schmeling]]. He would be the last until [[Ingemar Johansson]] claimed the title against [[Floyd Patterson]] in 1959, over a quarter of a century later.\n\nCarnera was also the first boxer to win the European Heavyweight title and subsequently become World Heavyweight champion.\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Tommy Loughran]] held the record for the greatest weight differential between two combatants in a world title fight ({{convert|86|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or}})<ref>{{cite news |title=TOMMY LOUGHRAN DIES AT 79 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/10/obituaries/tommy-loughran-dies-at-79.html |work=The New York Times |date=10 July 1982 |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> for 73 years until the reign of [[Nikolai Valuev]], who owns the current record for the {{convert|105+1/2|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight advantage he held in his 2006 defense against [[Monte Barrett]].\n\nValuev also broke Carnera's record of {{convert|270|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to become the heaviest world champion in history, weighing as high as {{convert|328|lb|kg|abbr=on}} during his reign. Carnera still ranks as the second-heaviest, over eighty years after he held the title.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=209}}\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] in Italy was the first Heavyweight title fight to be held in Europe since [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s title defence against [[Frank Moran]] in Paris in 1913. It would be the last such occasion until [[Muhammad Ali]] defended the title against [[Henry Cooper]] in London in 1966. Carnera-Uzcudun was the first World Heavyweight championship fight to be contested between two Europeans. It would be another sixty years, when [[Lennox Lewis]] defended the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] heavyweight title against fellow-Englishman [[Frank Bruno]] in 1993, that this would occur again. \n\nTrailing only [[Ezzard Charles]]'s 95 wins, Carnera holds the second-most victories of all heavyweight champions with 88.

During his tenure as world champion he played a fictional version of himself in the 1933 film ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' starring Max Baer and [[Myrna Loy]]. Here he plays the heavyweight champion who barely holds onto his title with a draw decision after a furious fight with Baer. The film was made just the year before Carnera fought Baer for real, in a bout that was as wild as the film version, but ended with a knockout loss for Carnera.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}}\n\nCarnera had a silent bit part in the 1949 movie [[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|''Mighty Joe Young'']].{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}} He played himself in the tug-of-war scene with the giant gorilla. After being pulled by the ape into a pool of water, Carnera throws a couple of futile punches to Joe's chin.\n\nHe also played a bully boy wrestler in [[Carol Reed]]'s film [[A Kid for Two Farthings (film)|''A Kid for Two Farthings'']] (1955) based around London's [[Petticoat Lane Market]] where he has a match against a local bodybuilder who is marrying [[Diana Dors]].\n\nPrimo appeared in at least ten Italian films between 1939 and 1943,<ref name=\"IMDM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138712/|title=Primo Carnera|publisher=}}</ref> as well as several in the 1950s, like [[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047365/|title=Prince Valiant|date=5 April 1954|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref> in the role of Sligon.

But the next year, after three losses against [[Luigi Musina]] his talent for [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] was discovered. In 1946 he became a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and was immediately a huge success at the box office. For several years he was one of the top draws in wrestling. Carnera continued to be an attraction into the 1960s. Max Baer attended at least one of Carnera's wrestling matches.<ref>[http://www.mmbolding.com/Heavyweights/Boxer_vs._Wrestler_Primo_Carnera.htm The Strange Case of Carnera, By Jack Sher, ''Sport'', February 1948]</ref> Carnera won his debut on 22 August 1946, when he defeated Tommy O'Toole in California.

In response, Carnera unsuccessfully sued the film's company.\n\nCarnera played himself in the 1949 movie ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''.\n\nCarnera was played by Matthew G. Taylor in the 2005 film ''[[Cinderella Man]]'', a film about the life of fellow boxer [[James J. Braddock]].\n\nIn 2008, the actor Andrea Iaia played Carnera in the Italian biographical film ''[[Carnera: The Walking Mountain]]'', directed by Renzo Martinelli.\n\nIn 2013, Emporio Elaborazioni Meccaniche named a motorbike, the 1983 BMW R80RT Carnera, in honor of Carnera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gessato.com/2013/08/03/the-carnera-by-emporio-elaborazioni-meccaniche/|title=The Carnera by Emporio Elaborazioni Meccaniche|first=|last=Holly|date=3 August 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===In comics===\nIn 1947, ''[[Carnera (comics)|Carnera]]'', an Italian [[comic book]] series sporting a fictional version of Primo Carnera, was produced.<ref name=\"auto\">Maria Grazia Perini. \"Carnera\".

Carnera won by [[knockout]] in round two.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=11-12}} He won his first six bouts, then lost to Franz Diener by disqualification in round one at [[Leipzig]]. Then, he won seven more bouts in a row before meeting [[Young Stribling]]. He and Stribling exchanged disqualification wins, Carnera winning the first in four rounds, and Stribling winning the rematch in round seven. In Carnera's next bout he avenged his defeat to Diener with a knockout in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=22}}\n\nIn 1930, he moved to the United States, where he toured extensively, winning his first seventeen bouts there by knockout. [[George Godfrey (boxer born 1897)|George Godfrey]] broke the knockout streak in [[Philadelphia]] by losing to Carnera by disqualification in the fifth round.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=52}} In 1932, Carnera faced the tallest heavyweight in history up to that point, [[Santa Camar\u00e3o]], a {{height|ft=6|in=8}} [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fighter. Carnera won the fight in a sixth-round knockout.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=93-94}}\n\nOn 10 February 1933, he knocked out [[Ernie Schaaf]] in thirteen rounds in New York City. Schaaf died four days later.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=100}} Schaaf had suffered a severe beating and knockout in a bout with future heavyweight champion [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] six months earlier, on 31 August 1932.

Carnera became world champion by knocking out Sharkey in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=117}}\n\nHe retained the title against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] and [[Tommy Loughran]], both by decision in 15 rounds, but in his next fight on 14 June 1934 against [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], Carnera was knocked down multiple times in 11 rounds, before referee Arthur Donovon stopped the fight. There is disagreement regarding how many times Carnera was knocked down, with sources giving conflicting totals of 7, 10, 11 (per [[Associated Press]]) and 12 (per [[The Ring Magazine|''The Ring'' magazine]] founder [[Nat Fleischer]], ringside for the fight, who wrote that Carnera was knocked down 12 times and slipped once after a missed punch).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Primo_Carnera_vs._Max_Baer |title=Primo Carnera vs. Max Baer\u2013 Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter that, Carnera won his next four fights, three of them as part of a South American tour that took him to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, as well as two exhibitions fought on the South American continent. But then, on 25 June 1935, he was knocked out in six rounds by [[Joe Louis]].\n\nFor the next two and a half years, he won five and lost three of eight total fights. But in 1938, Carnera, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], had to have a kidney removed, which forced him into retirement by 1944.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=179}} Carnera's record was 89 wins and 14 losses. His 72 wins by knockout made him a member of the exclusive club of boxers that won 50 or more bouts by knockout.\n\nCarnera died in 1967 in his native town of a combination of [[liver]] disease and complications from diabetes.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=7, 214}}\n\n====Legacy in boxing====\nCarnera was the third European to hold the world heavyweight championship after [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] and [[Max Schmeling]]. He would be the last until [[Ingemar Johansson]] claimed the title against [[Floyd Patterson]] in 1959, over a quarter of a century later.\n\nCarnera was also the first boxer to win the European Heavyweight title and subsequently become World Heavyweight champion.\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Tommy Loughran]] held the record for the greatest weight differential between two combatants in a world title fight ({{convert|86|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or}})<ref>{{cite news |title=TOMMY LOUGHRAN DIES AT 79 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/10/obituaries/tommy-loughran-dies-at-79.html |work=The New York Times |date=10 July 1982 |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> for 73 years until the reign of [[Nikolai Valuev]], who owns the current record for the {{convert|105+1/2|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight advantage he held in his 2006 defense against [[Monte Barrett]].\n\nValuev also broke Carnera's record of {{convert|270|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to become the heaviest world champion in history, weighing as high as {{convert|328|lb|kg|abbr=on}} during his reign. Carnera still ranks as the second-heaviest, over eighty years after he held the title.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=209}}\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] in Italy was the first Heavyweight title fight to be held in Europe since [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s title defence against [[Frank Moran]] in Paris in 1913. It would be the last such occasion until [[Muhammad Ali]] defended the title against [[Henry Cooper]] in London in 1966. Carnera-Uzcudun was the first World Heavyweight championship fight to be contested between two Europeans. It would be another sixty years, when [[Lennox Lewis]] defended the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] heavyweight title against fellow-Englishman [[Frank Bruno]] in 1993, that this would occur again. \n\nTrailing only [[Ezzard Charles]] and his 95 wins, Carnera holds the second-most victories of all heavyweight champions with 88.

During his tenure as world champion he played a fictional version of himself in the 1933 film ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' starring Max Baer and [[Myrna Loy]]. Here he plays the heavyweight champion who barely holds onto his title with a draw decision after a furious fight with Baer. The film was made just the year before Carnera fought Baer for real, in a bout that was as wild as the film version, but ended with a knockout loss for Carnera.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}}\n\nCarnera had a silent bit part in the 1949 movie [[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|''Mighty Joe Young'']].{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}} He played himself in the tug-of-war scene with the giant gorilla. After being pulled by the ape into a pool of water, Carnera throws a couple of futile punches to Joe's chin.\n\nHe also played a bully boy wrestler in [[Carol Reed]]'s film [[A Kid for Two Farthings (film)|''A Kid for Two Farthings'']] (1955) based around London's [[Petticoat Lane Market]] where he has a match against a local bodybuilder who is marrying [[Diana Dors]].\n\nPrimo appeared in at least ten Italian films between 1939 and 1943,<ref name=\"IMDM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138712/|title=Primo Carnera|publisher=}}</ref> as well as several in the 1950s, like [[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047365/|title=Prince Valiant|date=5 April 1954|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref> in the role of Sligon.

But the next year, after three losses against [[Luigi Musina]] his talent for [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] was discovered. In 1946 he became a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and was immediately a huge success at the box office. For several years he was one of the top draws in wrestling. Carnera continued to be an attraction into the 1960s. Max Baer attended at least one of Carnera's wrestling matches.<ref>[http://www.mmbolding.com/Heavyweights/Boxer_vs._Wrestler_Primo_Carnera.htm The Strange Case of Carnera, By Jack Sher, ''Sport'', February 1948]</ref> Carnera won his debut on 22 August 1946, when he defeated Tommy O'Toole in California. On 23 October 1946, Carnera won his 41st consecutive wrestling match by defeating Jules Strongbow.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=187}} On 19 November 1946, Carnera beat Harry Kruskamp to remain undefeated at 65-0-0.\n\nPrimo Carnera went 120 straight wrestling matches undefeated (119-0-1) before suffering his first loss to Yvon Robert in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, on 20 August 1947. Carnera's greatest victory took place on 7 December 1947 when he defeated former world heavyweight champion [[Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis]].\n\nIn May 1948, Carnera took a 143-1-1 record against world heavyweight champion [[Lou Thesz]].

A highlight was the appearance of [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], playing a fighter the mob could not fix who destroys the giant in his first fair fight. Critics drew parallels with the real-life Baer-Carnera fight two decades before. In response, Carnera unsuccessfully sued the film's company.\n\nCarnera played himself in the 1949 movie ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''.\n\nCarnera was played by Matthew G.
