Fate was on the executive board of the paper and also served as the secretary to the board for the newspaper.{{sfn|Lueras|1974|p=6}}\n\nRecognizing the limited educational opportunities for Native Alaskans, Fate became involved in the Fairbanks Native Association's education committee {{sfn|Strickler|2011|p=76}}{{sfn|''The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner''|1964|p=9}} in 1962. She worked on a six-year study of the educational system to evaluate the reasons why education was substandard in Alaska.

However, on July 8, Halladay's leg was broken by a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] left fielder [[Kevin Mench]].<ref name=\"ESPN1\" /> As a result, he was replaced in the All-Star Game by [[Matt Clement]] of the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], while [[Mark Buehrle]] of the [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] was named the starting pitcher for the American League. Despite rehabilitation of his leg, Halladay would sit out the remainder of the season.\n\nOn March 16, [[2006 Toronto Blue Jays season|2006]], Halladay signed a [[United States dollar|$]]40 million three-year contract extension through 2010.<ref name=\"ESPN1\">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2371102|title=Halladay agrees to extension through 2010|date=March 16, 2006|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|access-date=December 17, 2009}}</ref> During that year, Halladay finished near the top of the MLB in wins with 16. He was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve on July 3, along with four of his Blue Jays teammates. It marked the second-most appearances in club history, and Halladay's fourth as an All-Star. Although Halladay's strikeout total was lower in 2006 than in previous seasons, his [[ground ball/fly ball ratio]], complete games, and innings pitched were all among the American League leaders.\n\n====2007\u20132009====\nHalladay was the American League [[Pitcher of the Month|pitcher of the month]] in April [[2007 Toronto Blue Jays season|2007]], going 4\u20130, highlighted by a 10-inning complete game win over the [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. However, he pitched poorly in his two starts in May, and on May 11 was placed on the disabled list and underwent an [[appendectomy]]. He returned to the rotation in his usual form on May 31 against the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Halladay went 7 innings, giving up just six hits and allowing no runs on his way to his 100th career win. 2007 also saw Halladay hit his first career RBI. Against the [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] on June 10, his ground ball single to center field allowed [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] to score. He shut out the [[2007 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] on July 22, allowing only three hits.\n\nIn [[2008 Toronto Blue Jays season|2008]], for the sixth consecutive year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record.<ref name=\"YahooSports1\">{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/6134/news|title=Roy Halladay - Toronto - Major League Baseball - Yahoo!

His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched [[Josh Beckett]] in his season debut.\n\nIn his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the [[2008 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]], in a 4\u20131 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the [[2008 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], he was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of [[Nyjer Morgan]]. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman [[Scott Rolen]], ending the inning. Halladay was able to walk back to the dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given a clean bill of health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] against the [[Seattle Mariners]] on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' [[Mark Mulder]] for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out [[Lance Berkman]]. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since [[Luis Tiant]] in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]].

Halladay lost his next game to [[2009 Texas Rangers season|Texas]], giving up 5 earned runs over 8 innings only to go on and win his next 6 games to bring his record up to 8\u20131 with a 2.75 ERA. With season-ending injuries to planned 2009 Jays' starters [[Dustin McGowan]] and [[Shawn Marcum]], and with #2 starter [[Jesse Litsch]] on the disabled list early in the season, Halladay led a staff of young, mostly inexperienced starters. Halladay was named the AL Player of the Week for the period ending May 17.

He often led the league in innings pitched and complete games, while ranking among the leaders in WHIP and ERA.\n\nPrior to and during each start, Halladay had a distinct trademark in which he went into a complete \"isolation mode,\" immersing himself in complete concentration in order to plan every pitch he would pitch while on the mound. During this time, he would not talk to anyone except the manager or the pitching coach.

In 133.0 innings, he went 8\u20138 with a 4.20 ERA. He walked 39 batters, seven more than he had walked in 2003 when he had pitched twice as many innings. He later revealed that he had been injured throughout the entire season with a \"tired throwing arm\", which he believed was from intense workouts in preseason.\n\nThe [[2005 Toronto Blue Jays season|2005]] season began successfully for Halladay, as he posted a 12\u20134 record with a 2.41 ERA in 19 starts. He was selected to his third All-Star team and was slated to be the starting pitcher for the [[American League]] at the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[Comerica Park|Detroit]]. However, on July 8, Halladay's leg was broken by a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] left fielder [[Kevin Mench]].<ref name=\"ESPN1\" /> As a result, he was replaced in the All-Star Game by [[Matt Clement]] of the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], while [[Mark Buehrle]] of the [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] was named the starting pitcher for the American League.

It marked the second-most appearances in club history, and Halladay's fourth as an All-Star.

However, he pitched poorly in his two starts in May, and on May 11 was placed on the disabled list and underwent an [[appendectomy]]. He returned to the rotation in his usual form on May 31 against the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Halladay went 7 innings, giving up just six hits and allowing no runs on his way to his 100th career win. 2007 also saw Halladay hit his first career RBI. Against the [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] on June 10, his ground ball single to center field allowed [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] to score.

His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched [[Josh Beckett]] in his season debut.\n\nIn his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the [[2008 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]], in a 4\u20131 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the [[2008 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], he was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of [[Nyjer Morgan]]. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman [[Scott Rolen]], ending the inning. Halladay was able to walk back to the dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given a clean bill of health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] against the [[Seattle Mariners]] on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' [[Mark Mulder]] for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out [[Lance Berkman]]. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since [[Luis Tiant]] in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]].

Halladay's efficiency and durability were reflected in his total innings pitched every year, also due to his ability to strike out hitters and induce ground ball outs to escape jams. He often led the league in innings pitched and complete games, while ranking among the leaders in WHIP and ERA.\n\nPrior to and during each start, Halladay had a distinct trademark in which he went into a complete \"isolation mode,\" immersing himself in complete concentration in order to plan every pitch he would pitch while on the mound. During this time, he would not talk to anyone except the manager or the pitching coach. He would not even reply to a \"hello\" or wave from a teammate or spectator, nor talk to the media until he had been relieved or completed the game.<ref name=\"Sports Illustrated\">{{cite news|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Why+is+baseball%27s+best+pitcher+also+the+hardest+worker+in+-+04.05.10+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=423852833&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1167875%2F1%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|title=What Makes Roy Run|date=April 5, 2010|access-date=August 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Verducci|work=Sports Illustrated}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHalladay had two children, Braden and Ryan,<ref name=\"family\" /> with his wife, Brandy (n\u00e9e Gates).
