Strong economic growth has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs, but coupled with severe restrictions on building new housing units, it has resulted in an [[California housing shortage|extreme housing shortage]] which has driven rents to extremely high levels.  ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'' notes that large cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles both attribute their recent increases in homeless people to the housing shortage, with the result that homelessness in California overall has increased by 15% from 2015 to 2017.<ref name=\"SacBee_homeless\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article168107042.html|title=How California's housing crisis happened|last=Hart|first=Angela|date=2017-08-21|accessdate=2018-01-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001045844/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article168107042.html|archive-date=2017-10-01|url-status=live|newspaper=The Sacramento Bee|quote=Cities that have seen dramatic rent increases, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, attribute their spikes in homelessness directly to a state housing shortage that has led to an unprecedented affordability crisis.}}</ref><ref name=SFChron_homeless_crisis>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/California-s-homelessness-crisis-moves-to-the-12182026.php | title=California's homelessness crisis expands to country | last1=Fagan | first1=Kevin | last2=Graham | first2=Alison | newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2017-09-08 | accessdate=2017-12-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911021612/http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/California-s-homelessness-crisis-moves-to-the-12182026.php | archive-date=2017-09-11 | url-status=live }}</ref> In September 2019, the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] released a report in which they stated that [[deregulation]] of the housing markets would reduce homelessness in some of the most constrained markets by estimates of 54% in San Francisco, 40% in Los Angeles,{{ r | CEA_1 | p=1 | q=The first cause we consider is the overregulation of housing markets, which raises homelessness by increasing the price of a home.

Still, these results suggest that the severe homelessness problems in a number of metropolitan areas are in large part a direct result of city-created regulations on housing. These findings are also broadly consistent with results from Raphael (2010), who uses a different methodology to assess how housing market regulation drives up homelessness rates. Using an index of housing market regulation by metropolitan area, he finds that deregulation could reduce overall United States homelessness by 7 to 22 percent.

Jennifer Wolch identifies some of these factors to include the loss of jobs from deindustrialization, a rapid rise in housing prices, and the elimination of social welfare programs.<ref name=\":1\">Wolch, Jennifer R., and M. J. Dear. ''Malign Neglect: Homelessness in an American City''. Jossey-Bass, 1993.</ref> The economic shift from production oriented jobs in factories towards the service industry resulted in a loss of wages as factory jobs were more lucrative. This decrease in wages was compounded by the fact housing prices continued to rise, with average real estate value in the Bay Area increasing by 100% between 1984 and 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paragon-re.com/trend/3-recessions-2-bubbles-and-a-baby|title=30+ Years of Bay Area Real Estate Cycles}}</ref> As these economic changes were occurring, social events also impacted the city's homeless population. The [[Deinstitutionalization in the United States|deinstitutionalization movement]] of the 1970s had succeeded, and saw the mass transfer of mental health patients to community based clinics. This transfer was not smooth, as many previously institutionalized patients found themselves back in society with less support than they were accustomed to and few possessed the professional skills or resources needed to successfully transition.<ref>Dear, Michael J. ''Landscapes of Despair: from Deinstitutionalization to Homelessness''. Princeton Univ Press, 2016.</ref> The failure of deinstitutionalization is often attributed to the cuts to mental health services made at the same time, with mental health budgets decreasing by a third between 1978 and 1982.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, the homeless population has had a disproportionate rate of mental health needs ever since the 80's.\n\n=== Feinstein years (1978-1988) ===\n[[Dianne Feinstein]], was the first mayor of San Francisco that had to address the homeless issue. Her administration operated under the belief that the growing homeless problem was a temporary issue that was an effect of a recent [[Early 1980s recession|recession]]. The response to the problem was to open temporary shelters that provided a sandwich and a bed for a night with the hope that those served could find permanent housing soon.<ref name=\":4\">Green, Mathew. \u201cTIMELINE: The Frustrating Political History of Homelessness in San Francisco.\u201d ''KQED'', 23 Mar. 2018, www.kqed.org/lowdown/22644.</ref>  This program proved to be underfunded and unprepared for the demand and the homeless population continued to grow.\n\n=== Agnos administration (1988-1992) ===\nFeinstein's successor, [[Art Agnos]], took a more involved approach to address the homeless problem as part of a broader progressive mayoral campaign. Agnos' view of homelessness was that it was the result of structural inequalities and could only be resolved by intervention from state welfare programs.<ref name=\":6\">Parson, Sean Michael. \u201cAn Ungovernable Force?

A group of young anarcho-activists, [[Food Not Bombs]], began to distribute free vegetarian meals to homeless people in parks around the [[Haight-Ashbury|Haight]], which was opposed by a group representing developers and business interests.<ref name=\":6\" /> Tensions between activists, who argued they were just providing aid to the residents the city didn't support, and the city eventually escalated in the city arresting activists and confiscating their supplies. Clashes between the city and activists continued off and on over the course of the following year, until confrontations over the usage of [[Civic Center Plaza]] escalated to the occupation of the park by a mix of activists and members from the homeless community estimated to number between 300 and 350 in all and eventually became known as \"Camp Agnos\". Complaints from the protesters included the city's inaction to address the growing homelessness, lack of affordable housing options, and the ineffectiveness of existing shelters. One homeless protester said of the services provided, \"A shelter is like being in prison. There's no freedom of movement\" and complained of the inability of being able to use shelters with her husband, opting instead to sleep on the streets so they could be together.<ref>{{cite news |title=San Francisco's Mayor Ousts Homeless Camp |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 July 1990 |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/us/san-francisco-s-mayor-ousts-homeless-camp.html}}</ref> Under pressure from the Board of Supervisors and the negative publicity, Agnos reluctantly ordered police to ticket and arrest those who remained in Camp Agnos.<ref>{{cite news |title=San Francisco to Evict Last Homeless |work=UPI Archives |date=5 July 1990 |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/07/05/San-Francisco-to-evict-last-homeless/2178647150400/}}</ref>\n\n=== Jordan crackdown (1992-1996) ===\nFormer police chief [[Frank Jordan]] won the 1992 mayoral race on a platform of bringing public order back to the city and promised to return public space back to its residents from the homeless and youth activists. Jordan sought to crack down on the disorderly and troublesome activists who he thought were dealt with too leniently by the former administration. Jordan's four years saw 700 arrests and citations given to the Food Not Bombs activists,<ref name=\":6\" /> prompting [[Amnesty International]] to respond:<blockquote>\"Amnesty International is concerned that the Food Not Bombs activists may have been targeted on account of their beliefs and effectively prohibited from exercising their right to freedom of expression, assembly, and the right to impart information.

Jordan introduced the Matrix Program, which expanded the role police had in tackling homelessness by increasing the number of citations given to homeless people for city misdemeanors, with 6,000 citations issued in the first six months of the program's initiation.<ref name=\":4\" /> Matrix teams of city police usually accompanied with social service workers to systematically sweep the city block by block to engage members of the homeless community and dismantle homeless encampments. The initial reception from city residents was mostly positive with 75% of calls to the Mayor's office praising the crackdown as a needed step to clean the city up.<ref>Heather MacDonald, San Francisco's Matrix Program for the Homeless, 14 Crim. Just. Ethics 2 (1995)</ref>\n\nCritics of Matrix accused the program of using resources on punitive enforcement of quality of life laws that generally only affect the homeless community, like sleeping in public and loitering, instead of promoting services to aid the homeless. Mass citations to the homeless, critics argued, was counter-productive since those in extreme poverty lacked the funds to pay the fines. Judges would respond to unpaid fines by issuing arrest warrants, resulting in the incarceration of homeless people when the same resources used to jail the inmates could instead go towards expanding shelter services.<ref>McIntyre, Jennifer, and Alissa Rikker. ''FROM BEYOND SHELTER TO BEHIND BARS''. 1993 www.cjcj.org/uploads/cjcj/documents/from_beyond_shelter_to_behind_bars.pdf.</ref> Additional critiques lobbied at the program centered around the use of police as social service workers. Matrix police were authorized to give psychological field tests to determine if a homeless person was acting erratically and were the deciding force on whether or not to bring them to the hospital for mental services.<ref name=\":7\">Gowan, Teresa.

Upon assuming office, Brown suspended the Matrix Program and ordered a judge to revoke all citations and warrants stemming from the program.<ref name=\":8\">Maya Nordberg, Jails Not Homes: Quality of Life on the Street of San Francisco, 13 Hastings Women's L.J. 261 (2002)</ref> Despite this action to end Matrix, citations issued to the homeless community for quality of life violations, a highly criticized aspect of Matrix, increased.

Not all of Brown's positions were detrimental to the homeless community as he successfully mobilized support to secure a $100 million government bond to expand affordable housing and his support for universal healthcare was a central tenet to his platform, though its implementation was never manifested.<ref>Davis, John. ''Perspectives in Black Politics and Black Leadership''. University Press of America, 2007.</ref>\n\nRiding a robust economy and operating under a patronage system that benefited his allies and restricted political opponents, Brown was able to secure a second term despite policies that alienated his liberal base, including his harsher than expected treatment of the city's homeless.<ref>Mullin, Megan, et al. \u201cCity Caesars?\u201d ''Urban Affairs Review'', vol. 40, no. 1, 2004, pp. 19\u201343.''SAGE Journals'', doi:10.1177/1078087404265391.</ref>\n\n=== Gavin Newsom (2004-2010) ===\n[[Gavin Newsom]], a previous member of the city's board of supervisors, succeeded Brown after running as a Democratic centrist to become San Francisco's youngest mayor in the past century.<ref>\"About the Mayor\". The City and County of San Francisco. Archived from the original on 2007-11-23.</ref> Given the ineffective steps taken to address homelessness over the past two decades, Newsom sought to implement wholesale change on how the city interacted with its homeless community as he thought programs needed more resources and oversight.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}  With Newsom's support, the city passed two measures, propositions M and N, to change homeless policy. Proposition M expanded quality of life laws to include the prohibition of \"aggressive\" panhandling and panhandling near ATMs, parking lots, or buses.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though this was another quality of life law and included citations, priorities were made to funnel offenders to substance-abuse or mental health treatment as much as possible.\n\n==== Care Not Cash (Prop N) ====\nA cornerstone of Newsom's homeless legislation was actually passed with his support while he was still on the board of supervisors in 2002. Proposition N, better known as [[San Francisco Proposition N (2002)|Care Not Cash]], was passed by the city with 60% approval with the goal to overhaul the city's welfare system by cutting General Assistance payments to eligible adults from $395 a month (one of the highest rates in California) to $57 a month and to use the savings to expand care services for the city's homeless residents.<ref name=\":7\" /> Newsom claimed that using resources for services would prove to be more effective at supporting homeless residents instead of handouts, arguing that cash handouts encouraged homeless people to flock to the city from neighboring counties, along with increased usage of emergency medical services and crime rates on the weekends the cash was dispersed.<ref>Newsom, Gavin Christopher, and Lisa Dickey. ''Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government''. Penguin Books, 2014.</ref> His claim that handouts cause crime rates to spike and increased hospitalization has been disputed by some academic studies conducted in San Francisco, which have found an inverse relationship between recipients of monetary subsidies and risky behaviors such as substance usage.<ref>Riley, E.

Homeward Bound was a program to pay for bus tickets to send homeless people out of the city so long as they could prove they had a place to be received at their destination. This was met with resistance from critics like the [[Coalition on Homelessness, San Francisco|Coalition for Homelessness]] who accused the program of not solving anything and was just [[Homeless dumping|dumping]] the problem off to other counties.<ref>Gonzales, Richard. \u201cS.F.

Anti-displacement advocates received success in gaining representation on SF's Planning Department (SFPD) and in advancing new regulations (e.g., inclusionary zoning) to protect and create affordable housing, which led to a shift from citywide to district legislative elections to address neighborhood concerns at the city level.<ref>Arnold, Crowley, Bravve, Brundage, Biddlecombe, Althea, Sheila, Elina Bravve, Sarah,Christine (2014). \"OUT OF REACH 2014 Twenty-Five Years Later, The Affordable Housing Crisis Continues.</ref>\n\nOn January 18, 2016, [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]], in response to issues of [[gentrification]] the Black Seed Collective coordinated a [[Black Lives Matter]] movement protest blocking all westbound traffic on the Bay Bridge that connects Oakland and San Francisco.

In San Francisco, it also includes limitations on building height, density, shape, and banning the demolition of old buildings. Zoning was originally executed as a public health prevention policy to ensure industrial emissions are separated from residential areas, but has since been manipulated by homeowners to artificially drive up the price of housing. <ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/zoning-laws-and-the-rise-of-economic-inequality/417360/</ref>\n\nThe housing crisis is both a regional and local problem. Gentrification and exclusion are intimately related at a neighborhood level. If a high-demand, high-cost neighborhood won't build, developers and people looking for housing will be diverted to the nearest low-cost neighborhoods.<ref name=\":2\">John Mangin, The New Exclusionary Zoning, vol 25 Stanford Law & Policy Review 91 (2014).</ref> That increases demand and development and leads to gentrification. Since the residents of high-cost, high-demand neighborhoods tend to have mobility, money, and access to information and power, they are hugely successful in leveraging land-use policies to exclude newcomers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nExclusionary zoning policies in San Francisco in city planning have caused a divide in affordability and accessibility for housing. The anti-development orientation of certain cities is turning them into preserves for the wealthy as housing costs increase beyond what lower-income families can afford to pay, which displaces communities and residents of low-income areas, leading to rising rates of homelessness.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Redlining policies ===\nAdditionally, until 1968, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) enforced an explicit redlining policy of racial discrimination in mortgage lending. Under redlining, racial minority groups were refused loans for mortgages. The policy incentivized homeowners to restrict the sale of houses to white families only, creating all-white neighborhoods.<ref>Katherine C. Devers & J. G. West, ''Exclusionary Zoning and Its Effect on Housing Opportunities for the Homeless'', 4 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics & Pub. Pol'y 349 (2014).</ref> Although prohibited by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the practice of neighborhood delineation based on race and class had a lasting impact, depriving certain neighborhoods of essential resources such as housing, schools, clinics, and grocery stores. The zoning policies created divisions within SF districts, widening the income inequality gap and polarizing resource accessibility and socioeconomic demographics, seen especially in the Tenderloin District, which currently experiences the highest rates of homelessness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Minkler | first1 = M | year = 1985 | title = Building supportive ties and sense of community among the inner-city elderly: The Tenderloin senior outreach project | url = | journal = Health Education Quarterly | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 303\u2013314 | doi = 10.1177/109019818501200310 | pmid = 4077543 }}</ref>\n\n==Prevalence and visibility by city==\nIn what is commonly referred to as a variation on [[Greyhound therapy]] many cities in the United States, including the city of San Francisco, buy one-way free bus tickets for homeless relocation.

If housing were deregulated, homelessness would fall by 54 percent in San Francisco, by 50 percent in Honolulu, by 40 percent in Oxnard and Los Angeles, by 38 percent in San Diego, by 36 percent in Washington, D.C., and by between 19 and 26 percent in Boston, Denver, New York, Seattle and Baltimore. Still, these results suggest that the severe homelessness problems in a number of metropolitan areas are in large part a direct result of city-created regulations on housing. These findings are also broadly consistent with results from Raphael (2010), who uses a different methodology to assess how housing market regulation drives up homelessness rates. Using an index of housing market regulation by metropolitan area, he finds that deregulation could reduce overall United States homelessness by 7 to 22 percent. He does not show how homelessness reductions would vary across specific areas.}}  In San Francisco, a minimum wage worker would have to work approximately 4.7 full-time jobs to be able to rent a two-bedroom apartment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=Althea|last2=Crowley|first2=Sheila|last3=Bravve|first3=Elina|last4=Brundage|first4=Sarah|last5=Biddlecombe|first5=Christine|title=Out of Reach 2014: National Low Income Housing Coalition|url=http://nlihc.org/oor/2014|website=National Low Income Housing Coalition|access-date=22 February 2018|date=2014-03-24}}</ref>\n\nSan Francisco has several thousand homeless, despite extensive efforts by city government to address the issue.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.sfgate.com/homeless/|title = Shame of the City - Homeless in San Francisco|newspaper = SF Gate}}</ref> The dramatically larger prevalence of visible homelessness in the city (relative to other large US cities) is widely noted by visitors as well as residents, and as of 2018, is starting to impact the city's largest industry, tourism (a $9 billion industry), as one large doctors' group has decided to move their annual convention elsewhere after members' concerns about threatening behavior, mental illness, and assault on one of their board members.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Rough Guide to San Francisco & the Bay Area|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D2OitcAAMYkC|publisher = Penguin|date = 2009-01-01|isbn = 9781848360600|first = Nick|last = Edwards|first2 = Mark|last2 = Ellwood|page = 112}}</ref><ref name=SFC_doctors_conference_cancelled >{{cite news | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/SF-s-appalling-street-life-repels-residents-13038748.php | title=SF's appalling street life repels residents \u2014 now it's driven away a convention | last1=Matier | first1=Phil | last2=Ross | first2=Andy | newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=2018-07-02 | accessdate=2018-07-05 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704001529/https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/SF-s-appalling-street-life-repels-residents-13038748.php | archive-date=2018-07-04 | url-status=live | quote=<blockquote>The doctors group told the San Francisco delegation that while they loved the city, postconvention surveys showed their members were afraid to walk amid the open drug use, threatening behavior and mental illness that are common on the streets.</blockquote> }}</ref>\n\nThe number of the people in poverty in the San Francisco Bay Area grew from 573,333 (8.6%) in 2000 to 668,876 (9.7%) in 2006-2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bay Area Census -- San Francisco City and County|url=http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/counties/SanFranciscoCounty.htm|website=www.bayareacensus.ca.gov|access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref> While poverty rates vary greatly across the SF Bay area, in 2015, the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies published that the poverty rate was 11.3%, having a slight downward trend from 12%; however, it was still above the historical average rate of 9%.<ref>{{cite web|title=POVERTY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA|url=https://jointventure.org/images/stories/pdf/poverty-brief-2015-03.pdf|website=Joint Venture Silicon Valley|publisher=Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Historical background ==\n=== Emergence in the late 70's and early 80's ===\nThe prevalence of homelessness emerged both in San Francisco and the [[Homelessness in the United States|United States in general]] in the late 70's and early 80's. Jennifer Wolch identifies some of these factors to include the loss of jobs from deindustrialization, a rapid rise in housing prices, and the elimination of social welfare programs.<ref name=\":1\">Wolch, Jennifer R., and M. J. Dear. ''Malign Neglect: Homelessness in an American City''. Jossey-Bass, 1993.</ref> The economic shift from production oriented jobs in factories towards the service industry resulted in a loss of wages as factory jobs were more lucrative. This decrease in wages was compounded by the fact housing prices continued to rise, with average real estate value in the Bay Area increasing by 100% between 1984 and 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paragon-re.com/trend/3-recessions-2-bubbles-and-a-baby|title=30+ Years of Bay Area Real Estate Cycles}}</ref> As these economic changes were occurring, social events also impacted the city's homeless population. The [[Deinstitutionalization in the United States|deinstitutionalization movement]] of the 1970s had succeeded, and saw the mass transfer of mental health patients to community based clinics. This transfer was not smooth, as many previously institutionalized patients found themselves back in society with less support than they were accustomed to and few possessed the professional skills or resources needed to successfully transition.<ref>Dear, Michael J. ''Landscapes of Despair: from Deinstitutionalization to Homelessness''. Princeton Univ Press, 2016.</ref> The failure of deinstitutionalization is often attributed to the cuts to mental health services made at the same time, with mental health budgets decreasing by a third between 1978 and 1982.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, the homeless population has had a disproportionate rate of mental health needs ever since the 80's.\n\n=== Feinstein years (1978-1988) ===\n[[Dianne Feinstein]], was the first mayor of San Francisco that had to address the homeless issue. Her administration operated under the belief that the growing homeless problem was a temporary issue that was an effect of a recent [[Early 1980s recession|recession]]. The response to the problem was to open temporary shelters that provided a sandwich and a bed for a night with the hope that those served could find permanent housing soon.<ref name=\":4\">Green, Mathew. \u201cTIMELINE: The Frustrating Political History of Homelessness in San Francisco.\u201d ''KQED'', 23 Mar. 2018, www.kqed.org/lowdown/22644.</ref>  This program proved to be underfunded and unprepared for the demand and the homeless population continued to grow.\n\n=== Agnos administration (1988-1992) ===\nFeinstein's successor, [[Art Agnos]], took a more involved approach to address the homeless problem as part of a broader progressive mayoral campaign.

A group of young anarcho-activists, [[Food Not Bombs]], began to distribute free vegetarian meals to homeless people in parks around the [[Haight-Ashbury|Haight]], which was opposed by a group representing developers and business interests.<ref name=\":6\" /> Tensions between activists, who argued they were just providing aid to the residents the city didn't support, and the city eventually escalated in the city arresting activists and confiscating their supplies. Clashes between the city and activists continued off and on over the course of the following year, until confrontations over the usage of [[Civic Center Plaza]] escalated to the occupation of the park by a mix of activists and members from the homeless community estimated to number between 300 and 350 in all and eventually became known as \"Camp Agnos\". Complaints from the protesters included the city's inaction to address the growing homelessness, lack of affordable housing options, and the ineffectiveness of existing shelters. One homeless protester said of the services provided, \"A shelter is like being in prison. There's no freedom of movement\" and complained of the inability of being able to use shelters with her husband, opting instead to sleep on the streets so they could be together.<ref>{{cite news |title=San Francisco's Mayor Ousts Homeless Camp |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 July 1990 |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/us/san-francisco-s-mayor-ousts-homeless-camp.html}}</ref> Under pressure from the Board of Supervisors and the negative publicity, Agnos reluctantly ordered police to ticket and arrest those who remained in Camp Agnos.<ref>{{cite news |title=San Francisco to Evict Last Homeless |work=UPI Archives |date=5 July 1990 |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/07/05/San-Francisco-to-evict-last-homeless/2178647150400/}}</ref>\n\n=== Jordan crackdown (1992-1996) ===\nFormer police chief [[Frank Jordan]] won the 1992 mayoral race on a platform of bringing public order back to the city and promised to return public space back to its residents from the homeless and youth activists. Jordan sought to crack down on the disorderly and troublesome activists who he thought were dealt with too leniently by the former administration. Jordan's four years saw 700 arrests and citations given to the Food Not Bombs activists,<ref name=\":6\" /> prompting [[Amnesty International]] to respond:<blockquote>\"Amnesty International is concerned that the Food Not Bombs activists may have been targeted on account of their beliefs and effectively prohibited from exercising their right to freedom of expression, assembly, and the right to impart information.

Jordan introduced the Matrix Program, which expanded the role police had in tackling homelessness by increasing the number of citations given to homeless people for city misdemeanors, with 6,000 citations issued in the first six months of the program's initiation.<ref name=\":4\" /> Matrix teams of city police usually accompanied with social service workers to systematically sweep the city block by block to engage members of the homeless community and dismantle homeless encampments. The initial reception from city residents was mostly positive with 75% of calls to the Mayor's office praising the crackdown as a needed step to clean the city up.<ref>Heather MacDonald, San Francisco's Matrix Program for the Homeless, 14 Crim. Just. Ethics 2 (1995)</ref>\n\nCritics of Matrix accused the program of using resources on punitive enforcement of quality of life laws that generally only affect the homeless community, like sleeping in public and loitering, instead of promoting services to aid the homeless. Mass citations to the homeless, critics argued, was counter-productive since those in extreme poverty lacked the funds to pay the fines. Judges would respond to unpaid fines by issuing arrest warrants, resulting in the incarceration of homeless people when the same resources used to jail the inmates could instead go towards expanding shelter services.<ref>McIntyre, Jennifer, and Alissa Rikker. ''FROM BEYOND SHELTER TO BEHIND BARS''. 1993 www.cjcj.org/uploads/cjcj/documents/from_beyond_shelter_to_behind_bars.pdf.</ref> Additional critiques lobbied at the program centered around the use of police as social service workers. Matrix police were authorized to give psychological field tests to determine if a homeless person was acting erratically and were the deciding force on whether or not to bring them to the hospital for mental services.<ref name=\":7\">Gowan, Teresa.

Proposition M expanded quality of life laws to include the prohibition of \"aggressive\" panhandling and panhandling near ATMs, parking lots, or buses.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though this was another quality of life law and included citations, priorities were made to funnel offenders to substance-abuse or mental health treatment as much as possible.\n\n==== Care Not Cash (Prop N) ====\nA cornerstone of Newsom's homeless legislation was actually passed with his support while he was still on the board of supervisors in 2002. Proposition N, better known as [[San Francisco Proposition N (2002)|Care Not Cash]], was passed by the city with 60% approval with the goal to overhaul the city's welfare system by cutting General Assistance payments to eligible adults from $395 a month (one of the highest rates in California) to $57 a month and to use the savings to expand care services for the city's homeless residents.<ref name=\":7\" /> Newsom claimed that using resources for services would prove to be more effective at supporting homeless residents instead of handouts, arguing that cash handouts encouraged homeless people to flock to the city from neighboring counties, along with increased usage of emergency medical services and crime rates on the weekends the cash was dispersed.<ref>Newsom, Gavin Christopher, and Lisa Dickey. ''Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government''.

Homeward Bound was a program to pay for bus tickets to send homeless people out of the city so long as they could prove they had a place to be received at their destination. This was met with resistance from critics like the [[Coalition on Homelessness, San Francisco|Coalition for Homelessness]] who accused the program of not solving anything and was just [[Homeless dumping|dumping]] the problem off to other counties.<ref>Gonzales, Richard. \u201cS.F.

If housing were deregulated, homelessness would fall by 54 percent in San Francisco, by 50 percent in Honolulu, by 40 percent in Oxnard and Los Angeles, by 38 percent in San Diego, by 36 percent in Washington, D.C., and by between 19 and 26 percent in Boston, Denver, New York, Seattle and Baltimore. Still, these results suggest that the severe homelessness problems in a number of metropolitan areas are in large part a direct result of city-created regulations on housing. These findings are also broadly consistent with results from Raphael (2010), who uses a different methodology to assess how housing market regulation drives up homelessness rates. Using an index of housing market regulation by metropolitan area, he finds that deregulation could  reduce overall United States homelessness by 7 to 22 percent. He does not show how homelessness reductions would vary across specific areas.}}\n\nIn 2002, the San Francisco Police Department launched the Eastern Neighborhoods Community Planning Process to resolve recognized land use conflicts in several SF neighborhoods.

Anti-displacement advocates received success in gaining representation on SF's Planning Department (SFPD) and in advancing new regulations (e.g., inclusionary zoning) to protect and create affordable housing, which led to a shift from citywide to district legislative elections to address neighborhood concerns at the city level.<ref>Arnold, Crowley, Bravve, Brundage, Biddlecombe, Althea, Sheila, Elina Bravve, Sarah,Christine (2014). \"OUT OF REACH 2014 Twenty-Five Years Later, The Affordable Housing Crisis Continues.</ref>\n\nOn January 18, 2016, [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]], in response to issues of [[gentrification]] the Black Seed Collective coordinated a [[Black Lives Matter]] movement protest blocking all westbound traffic on the Bay Bridge that connects Oakland and San Francisco.

In San Francisco, it also includes limitations on building height, density, shape, and banning the demolition of old buildings. Zoning was originally executed as a public health prevention policy to ensure industrial emissions are separated from residential areas, but has since been manipulated by homeowners to artificially drive up the price of housing. <ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/zoning-laws-and-the-rise-of-economic-inequality/417360/</ref>\n\nThe housing crisis is both a regional and local problem. Gentrification and exclusion are intimately related at a neighborhood level. If a high-demand, high-cost neighborhood won't build, developers and people looking for housing will be diverted to the nearest low-cost neighborhoods.<ref name=\":2\">John Mangin, The New Exclusionary Zoning, vol 25 Stanford Law & Policy Review 91 (2014).</ref> That increases demand and development and leads to gentrification. Since the residents of high-cost, high-demand neighborhoods tend to have mobility, money, and access to information and power, they are hugely successful in leveraging land-use policies to exclude newcomers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nExclusionary zoning policies in San Francisco in city planning have caused a divide in affordability and accessibility for housing. The anti-development orientation of certain cities is turning them into preserves for the wealthy as housing costs increase beyond what lower-income families can afford to pay, which displaces communities and residents of low-income areas, leading to rising rates of homelessness.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Redlining policies ===\nAdditionally, until 1968, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) enforced an explicit redlining policy of racial discrimination in mortgage lending. Under redlining, racial minority groups were refused loans for mortgages. The policy incentivized homeowners to restrict the sale of houses to white families only, creating all-white neighborhoods.<ref>Katherine C. Devers & J. G. West, ''Exclusionary Zoning and Its Effect on Housing Opportunities for the Homeless'', 4 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics & Pub. Pol'y 349 (2014).</ref> Although prohibited by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the practice of neighborhood delineation based on race and class had a lasting impact, depriving certain neighborhoods of essential resources such as housing, schools, clinics, and grocery stores.

But at last, to my joy, the glorious son of Zeus and Alcmena came and closed with him in combat and delivered me.<ref>[[Sophocles]], ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1-48 9&ndash;21]; compare with the Chorus's description of the fight at [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg001.perseus-eng1:497-506 497&ndash;525].</ref>\n\nIn later accounts, Achelous does not get his horn back, as he did in Pindar's poem.

As Thucydides tells the story, the oracle of Apollo told Alcmaeon that he needed to find a land to live in that did not yet exist at the time of his mother's death. After long travels, Alcmaeon finally came to the springs of the Achelous River, where he was purified by the river-god, and received Achelous's daughter Callirrhoe as his wife, and at the mouth of the river he discovered a land newly made by deposits of river silt, where he could make his home free of his curse.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.7.5 3.7.5]; [[Thucydides]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng2:2.102 2.102.2&ndash;6].

Since DC distributed Marvel's output at the time, Theakston theorizes that, \"Goodman and Lee decided to keep their superhero line looking as much like their horror line as they possibly could,\" downplaying \"the fact that [Marvel] was now creating heroes\" with the effect that they ventured \"into deeper waters, where DC had never considered going\".

It was a book called ''The'' {{sic}} ''Justice League of America'' and it was composed of a team of superheroes. \u2026 ' If the Justice League is selling ', spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'\"|group=n}}\n\nIn 1961, writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] revolutionized [[superhero]] comics by introducing superheroes designed to appeal to older readers than the predominantly child audiences of the medium. Modern Marvel's first superhero team, the titular stars of ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1<!--first 14 issues had \"The\" in the title--> (Nov. 1961),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/series/1482/ |title=Fantastic Four |publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]] |access-date=2011-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315125926/http://www.comics.org/series/1482/ |archive-date=2011-03-15 |url-status=live }}</ref> broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Randy |first2=James S. |last2=Olson |title=American Experiences: Readings in American History: Since 1865 |edition=4 |publisher=[[Addison\u2013Wesley]] |year=1998 |page=317 |isbn=978-0-321-01031-5 |quote=Marvel Comics employed a realism in both characterization and setting in its superhero titles that was unequaled in the comic book industry.}}</ref> This applied to ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' title in particular, which turned out to be Marvel's most successful book. Its young hero suffered from self-doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager, something with which many readers could identify.\n\nStan Lee and freelance artist and eventual co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]]'s Fantastic Four originated in a [[Cold War]] culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Genter |first=Robert |title=With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility': Cold War Culture and the Birth of Marvel Comics |journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]] |volume=40 |issue=6 |date=2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2007.00480.x}}</ref> Eschewing such comic-book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first, having a monster as one of the heroes, and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a \"superheroes in the real world\" approach, the series represented a change that proved to be a great success.<ref>Comics historian Greg Theakston has suggested that the decision to include monsters and initially to distance the new breed of superheroes from costumes was a conscious one, and born of necessity. Since DC distributed Marvel's output at the time, Theakston theorizes that, \"Goodman and Lee decided to keep their superhero line looking as much like their horror line as they possibly could,\" downplaying \"the fact that [Marvel] was now creating heroes\" with the effect that they ventured \"into deeper waters, where DC had never considered going\". See Ro, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\nMarvel often presented flawed superheroes, freaks, and misfits\u2014unlike the perfect, handsome, athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books. Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as the Hulk and the Thing. This [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] approach even extended into topical politics.\n\nComics historian Mike Benton also noted:\n{{bquote|text=In the world of [rival [[DC Comics]]'] [[Superman]] comic books, communism did not exist. Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mike |last=Benton |title=Superhero Comics of the Silver Age: The Illustrated History |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas, Texas |isbn=978-0-87833-746-0 |year=1991 |page=35}}</ref> From 1962 to 1965, there were more communists [in Marvel Comics] than on the subscription list of ''[[Pravda]]''.

However, the industry's self-censorship board, the [[Comics Code Authority]], refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics, deeming the context of the story irrelevant. Lee, with Goodman's approval, published the story regardless in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96\u201398 (May\u2013July 1971), without the Comics Code seal.
