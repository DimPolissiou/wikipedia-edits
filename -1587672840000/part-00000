The land was originally used by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] for thousands of years before British Columbia was colonized by the British during the 1858 [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]. For many years after colonization, the future park with its abundant resources would also be home to non-Indigenous [[settler]]s. The land was later turned into Vancouver's first park when the city incorporated in 1886. It was named after [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby]], a British politician who had recently been appointed [[Governor General]]. It was originally known as Coal Peninsula and was set aside for military fortifications to guard the entrance to Vancouver harbour. In 1886 Vancouver city council successfully sought a lease of the park which was granted for $1 per year.  In September 1888 Lord Stanley opened the park in his name.<ref name = Akrigg>{{Citation | last =Akrigg | first =G.P.V. | last2 =Akrigg | first2 =Helen B. | title =British Columbia Place Names | place =Vancouver | publisher =UBC Press | year =1986 | edition =3rd, 1997 | isbn =0-7748-0636-2 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/britishcolumbiap0000akri_w1q9 }}</ref>{{rp|254}}\n\nUnlike other large [[urban park]]s, Stanley Park is not the creation of a [[landscape architect]], but rather the evolution of a forest and urban space over many years.<ref>{{cite book| last =Stephan| first =Bill|author2=Vancouver Natural History Society | title =Wilderness on the Doorstep: Discovering Nature in Stanley Park | publisher =Harbour Publishing| year =2006| location =Vancouver| pages =17| isbn = 1-55017-386-3}}</ref> Most of the manmade structures present in the park were built between 1911 and 1937 under the influence of then superintendent W.S.

The lake and a [[causeway]] into the park were designed by [[Thomas Hayton Mawson|Thomas Mawson]], who also designed a lighthouse for [[Brockton Point]] around the same time.

At the same time, two pedestrian subways were added under the Causeway at the entrance to the park from Georgia Street.\n\nBy the 1950s, visitors could take rented rowboats on Lost Lagoon, but boating and other activities were banned in 1973 as the lake became a bird sanctuary. By 1995, the old boathouse had been turned into the Lost Lagoon Nature House.

These \"draw and fill\" pools used sun-warmed water from the ocean. Once a week the pool gates were opened at low tide to release the water back into the ocean, before the next high tide of clean water.\n\nFor many years, children could take swimming lessons for free at Lumberman's Arch under the ''[[The Vancouver Sun|Vancouver Sun's]]'' Learn to Swim program. The pool was filled in after developing persistent problems and replaced with the current water spray park in 1987. The spray park, the largest of its kind in Vancouver, consists of a series of water geysers, showers, and cannons.\n\nIn 1995, after more than 60 years of operation, the Second Beach pool was shut down because it failed to meet new health standards.

In 1994, when plans were developed to upgrade the zoo, Vancouver voters instead decided to phase it out when the question was posed in a [[referendum]]. The zoo was shut down in 1996 and the animals were either moved to the petting zoo area, the Greater Vancouver Zoo in [[Aldergrove, British Columbia|Aldergrove]], or to other facilities.\n\nThe Stanley Park Zoo closed completely in December 1997 after the last remaining animal, a polar bear named Tuk, died at age 36. He had remained after the other animals had left because of his old age.

For many years after colonization, the future park with its abundant resources would also be home to non-Indigenous [[settler]]s. The land was later turned into Vancouver's first park when the city incorporated in 1886. It was named after [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby]], a British politician who had recently been appointed [[Governor General]]. It was originally known as Coal Peninsula and was set aside for military fortifications to guard the entrance to Vancouver harbour. In 1886 Vancouver city council successfully sought a lease of the park which was granted for $1 per year.

The lake was named Lost Lagoon due to its history of \u2018disappearing\u2019 at low tide. The lake and a [[causeway]] into the park were designed by [[Thomas Hayton Mawson|Thomas Mawson]], who also designed a lighthouse for [[Brockton Point]] around the same time. Before the Causeway, a wooden [[footbridge]] provided the only access route into the park from Coal Harbour. Construction of the causeway (and new roads within the park for emergency access) was completed by 1926.<ref name=MackieWonder/>\n\nIn 1923, the saltwater pipes entering the lake from Coal Harbour were shut off, turning it into a freshwater lake. A lit fountain was later erected to commemorate the city's [[golden jubilee]]. The fountain, installed in 1936, was purchased from [[Chicago]], a leftover from its [[world's fair]] in 1934.<ref name=Davis124years/>\n\nThe causeway was widened and extended through the center of the park in the 1930s with the construction of the [[Lions Gate Bridge]], which connects downtown to the [[North Shore (Vancouver)|North Shore]]. At the same time, two pedestrian subways were added under the Causeway at the entrance to the park from Georgia Street.\n\nBy the 1950s, visitors could take rented rowboats on Lost Lagoon, but boating and other activities were banned in 1973 as the lake became a bird sanctuary. By 1995, the old boathouse had been turned into the Lost Lagoon Nature House.

The pool was filled in after developing persistent problems and replaced with the current water spray park in 1987. The spray park, the largest of its kind in Vancouver, consists of a series of water geysers, showers, and cannons.\n\nIn 1995, after more than 60 years of operation, the Second Beach pool was shut down because it failed to meet new health standards.

The first was a combination of an October windstorm in 1934 and a subsequent snowstorm the following January that felled thousands of trees, primarily between Beaver Lake and Prospect Point.<ref>{{cite news| title = The Damage in the Park| publisher = Vancouver Daily Province| date = 9 February 1934}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kheraj|first=Sean|year=2007|title=Restoring Nature: Ecology, Memory, and the Storm History of Vancouver's Stanley Park|journal=Canadian Historical Review|volume=88| issue =  4|pages=577\u2013612|doi=10.3138/chr.88.4.577|pmid=}}</ref>\n\nAnother storm in October 1962, the remnants of [[1962 Pacific typhoon season|Typhoon Freda]], cleared a {{convert|6|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip}} virgin tract behind the children's zoo, which opened an area for a new miniature railway that replaced a smaller version built in the 1940s.

''Chicago'' centers on [[Roxie Hart]] (Zellweger) and [[Velma Kelly]] (Zeta-Jones) two murderesses who find themselves in jail together awaiting trial in 1920s [[Chicago]]. Roxie, a housewife, and Velma, a vaudevillian, fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows.

Wanting stardom for herself, she begins an affair with Fred Casely, who claims to know the manager. After the show, Velma is arrested for killing her husband Charlie and sister Veronica, after finding them in bed together.\n\nA month later, Casely admits to Roxie that he has no showbiz connections and just wanted to sleep with her. Enraged, she shoots him dead. She convinces her husband, Amos, to take the blame, telling him she killed a burglar in self-defense. As Amos confesses to the detective, Roxie fantasizes that she is singing a song devoted to her husband (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the detective brings up evidence that Roxie and Casely were having an affair, Amos recants; Roxie furiously admits what really happened and is arrested. Ambitious District Attorney Harrison announces he will seek the death penalty.\n\nAt [[Cook County Jail]], Roxie is sent to Murderess' Row, under the care of the corrupt Matron \"Mama\" Morton (\"When You're Good to Mama\"). Roxie meets her idol Velma, but her friendship is rudely rebuffed. She learns the backstories of the other women there, including Velma (\"[[Cell Block Tango]]\"). On Morton's advice, Roxie engages Velma's lawyer, the brilliant Billy Flynn (\"All I Care About\"). Flynn and Roxie manipulate the press, reinventing Roxie's identity as an originally virtuous woman turned bad by the fast life of the city; she claims she had the affair with Casely because Amos was always working, but repented and dumped him for Amos, and Casely jealously attacked her (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\"). The press believe the story; praised by the public as a tragic heroine, Roxie becomes an overnight sensation (\"Roxie\"). Velma, unhappy at losing the public's attention, tries to convince Roxie to join her act, replacing the sister that she murdered (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"), but Roxie, now the more popular of the two rivals, snubs her just as Velma originally snubbed Roxie.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitty \"Go-To-Hell Kitty\" Baxter,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stageagent.com/characters/2304/chicago/go-to-hell-kitty|title=Go-to-Hell Kitty from Chicago Summary & Breakdown - StageAgent|publisher=}}</ref> a wealthy heiress, is arrested for murdering her husband and his two lovers, and the press and Flynn pay more attention to her. To Velma's surprise, Roxie quickly steals back the fame by claiming to be pregnant. Amos is ignored by the press (\"Mister Cellophane\"), and Flynn, to create more sympathy for Roxie, convinces him that the child is Casely's, and that he should divorce Roxie in the middle of her predicament. Roxie over-confidently fires Flynn, believing she can now win on her own. However, when Katalin Helinszki, a Hungarian woman on Murderess' Row (who happens to be the only inmate to protest and insist on her own innocence), becomes the first woman in Cook County history to be executed by hanging, Roxie realizes the gravity of the situation and rehires Flynn.\n\nRoxie's trial begins, and Billy turns it into a media spectacle (\"Razzle Dazzle\") with the help of the sensationalist newspaper reporters and radio personality Mary Sunshine. Billy discredits witnesses, manipulates evidence, and even stages a public reconciliation between Amos and Roxie when she says the child is his. The trial seems to be going Roxie's way until Velma appears with Roxie's diary: she reads incriminating entries in exchange for amnesty in her own case. Billy discredits the diary, implying that Harrison was the one who planted the evidence (\"A Tap Dance\"). Roxie is acquitted, but her fame is eclipsed moments later when another woman, who had also shot her own husband, shoots her lawyer just outside the courthouse. Flynn tells her to accept it, and admits that he tampered with her diary himself, in order to incriminate the district attorney and also free two clients at once. Amos remains loyal and excited to be a father, but Roxie cruelly rejects him, revealing that she is not pregnant, and he finally leaves her.\n\nRoxie does become a vaudeville performer, but is very unsuccessful (\"Nowadays\"). Velma is just as unsuccessful, and again approaches Roxie to suggest performing together: a double act consisting of two murderers. Roxie initially refuses, but later accepts when Velma points out that they can perform together despite their resentment for each other. The two stage a spectacular performance that earns them the love of the audience and the press (\"Nowadays / Hot Honey Rag\"). The film concludes with Roxie and Velma receiving a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience (which includes Flynn, Morton, the jurors and other acquitted murderesses), and proclaiming that, \"We couldn't have done it without you\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as [[Roxie Hart]], a [[housewife]] who aspires to be a [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]], and is arrested for the murder of her deceitful lover.\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as [[Velma Kelly]], a [[showgirl]] who is arrested for the murders of her husband, Charlie, and her sister, Veronica.\n* [[Richard Gere]] as [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]], a duplicitous, greedy, smooth-talking lawyer who turns his clients into celebrities to gain public support for them.

Its runaway success sparked a greater appreciation of the 1975 original production and renewed stalled interest in a long-anticipated film adaptation, which incorporates the influences of both productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299658/reviews-1081|title=Chicago Reviews & Ratings|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nThe original production's musical numbers were staged as [[vaudeville]] acts; the film respects this but presents them as [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]] scenes in the mind of the Roxie character, while scenes in \"real life\" are filmed with a hard-edged grittiness.

''Chicago'' centers on [[Roxie Hart]] (Zellweger) and [[Velma Kelly]] (Zeta-Jones) two murderesses who find themselves in jail together awaiting trial in 1920s [[Chicago]]. Roxie, a housewife, and Velma, a vaudevillian, fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows. The film marks the theatrical directorial debut of [[Rob Marshall]], who also [[Choreography|choreographed]] the film, and was adapted by screenwriter [[Bill Condon]], with music by [[John Kander]] and lyrics by [[Fred Ebb]].

Wanting stardom for herself, she begins an affair with Fred Casely, who claims to know the manager. After the show, Velma is arrested for killing her husband Charlie and sister Veronica, after finding them in bed together.\n\nA month later, Casely admits to Roxie that he has no showbiz connections and just wanted to sleep with her. Enraged, she shoots him dead. She convinces her husband, Amos, to take the blame, telling him she killed a burglar in self-defense. As Amos confesses to the detective, Roxie fantasizes that she is singing a song devoted to her husband (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the detective brings up evidence that Roxie and Casely were having an affair, Amos recants; Roxie furiously admits what really happened and is arrested. Ambitious District Attorney Harrison announces he will seek the death penalty.\n\nAt [[Cook County Jail]], Roxie is sent to Murderess' Row, under the care of the corrupt Matron \"Mama\" Morton (\"When You're Good to Mama\"). Roxie meets her idol Velma, but her friendship is rudely rebuffed. She learns the backstories of the other women there, including Velma (\"[[Cell Block Tango]]\"). On Morton's advice, Roxie engages Velma's lawyer, the brilliant Billy Flynn (\"All I Care About\"). Flynn and Roxie manipulate the press, reinventing Roxie's identity as an originally virtuous woman turned bad by the fast life of the city; she claims she had the affair with Casely because Amos was always working, but repented and dumped him for Amos, and Casely jealously attacked her (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\"). The press believe the story; praised by the public as a tragic heroine, Roxie becomes an overnight sensation (\"Roxie\"). Velma, unhappy at losing the public's attention, tries to convince Roxie to join her act, replacing the sister that she murdered (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"), but Roxie, now the more popular of the two rivals, snubs her just as Velma originally snubbed Roxie.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitty \"Go-To-Hell Kitty\" Baxter,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stageagent.com/characters/2304/chicago/go-to-hell-kitty|title=Go-to-Hell Kitty from Chicago Summary & Breakdown - StageAgent|publisher=}}</ref> a wealthy heiress, is arrested for murdering her husband and his two lovers, and the press and Flynn pay more attention to her. To Velma's surprise, Roxie quickly steals back the fame by claiming to be pregnant. Amos is ignored by the press (\"Mister Cellophane\"), and Flynn, to create more sympathy for Roxie, convinces him that the child is Casely's, and that he should divorce Roxie in the middle of her predicament. Roxie over-confidently fires Flynn, believing she can now win on her own. However, when Katalin Helinszki, a Hungarian woman on Murderess' Row (who happens to be the only inmate to protest and insist on her own innocence), becomes the first woman in Cook County history to be executed by hanging, Roxie realizes the gravity of the situation and rehires Flynn.\n\nRoxie's trial begins, and Billy turns it into a media spectacle (\"Razzle Dazzle\") with the help of the sensationalist newspaper reporters and radio personality Mary Sunshine. Billy discredits witnesses, manipulates evidence, and even stages a public reconciliation between Amos and Roxie when she says the child is his. The trial seems to be going Roxie's way until Velma appears with Roxie's diary: she reads incriminating entries in exchange for amnesty in her own case. Billy discredits the diary, implying that Harrison was the one who planted the evidence (\"A Tap Dance\"). Roxie is acquitted, but her fame is eclipsed moments later when another woman, who had also shot her own husband, shoots her lawyer just outside the courthouse. Flynn tells her to accept it, and admits that he tampered with her diary himself, in order to incriminate the district attorney and also free two clients at once. Amos remains loyal and excited to be a father, but Roxie cruelly rejects him, revealing that she is not pregnant, and he finally leaves her.\n\nRoxie does become a vaudeville performer, but is very unsuccessful (\"Nowadays\"). Velma is just as unsuccessful, and again approaches Roxie to suggest performing together: a double act consisting of two murderers. Roxie initially refuses, but later accepts when Velma points out that they can perform together despite their resentment for each other. The two stage a spectacular performance that earns them the love of the audience and the press (\"Nowadays / Hot Honey Rag\"). The film concludes with Roxie and Velma receiving a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience (which includes Flynn, Morton, the jurors and other acquitted murderesses), and proclaiming that, \"We couldn't have done it without you\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as [[Roxie Hart]], a [[housewife]] who aspires to be a [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]], and is arrested for the murder of her deceitful lover.\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as [[Velma Kelly]], a [[showgirl]] who is arrested for the murders of her husband, Charlie, and her sister, Veronica.\n* [[Richard Gere]] as [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]], a duplicitous, greedy, smooth-talking lawyer who turns his clients into celebrities to gain public support for them.

Although he died before realizing his version, Fosse's distinctive jazz choreography style is evident throughout the 2002 film, and he is thanked in the credits. The minimalist 1996 revival of the musical proved far more successful, having played more than 9,562 performances (as of November 17, 2019), holding records for longest-running musical revival, longest-running American musical on Broadway, and second longest-running show in Broadway history.

Yanbian is bordered to the north by [[Heilongjiang]], on the west by [[Baishan]] and [[Jilin City]], on the south by [[North Korea]]'s [[North Hamgyong]] Province, and on the east by [[Primorsky Krai]] in [[Russia]]. Yanbian is designated as a Korean autonomous prefecture due to the large number of [[Koreans in China|ethnic Koreans]] living in the region. The prefectural capital is [[Yanji]], and the total area is {{convert|42,700|km2|sigfig=3}}.\n\nThe prefecture has an important [[Balhae]] archaeological site: the [[Ancient Tombs at Longtou Mountain]], which includes the [[Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo]].\n\n== History ==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn the [[Ming Dynasty]], Yanbian was governed by the Jianzhou Guard ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5efa\u5dde\u885b}}), and in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] the area was divided into the Yanji ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5ef6\u5409\u5ef3}}) and Hunchun ({{lang|zh-hant|\u743f\u6625\u5ef3}}) [[subprefecture]]s. From 1644 to the 1800s the [[Manchurian people|Manchurian]] administrators of the Qing state attempted to separate northeast China, politically and ethnographically, into a \"Manchuria\" to which they could retreat in case an ethnically [[Han Chinese]] dynasty regained control over China. However, this effort failed because of the trading and agricultural opportunities available to Han Chinese migrants in the northeast region which made it profitable to evade the rules, as well as later Qing relaxation of the same rules to discourage [[Empire of Russia|Russian]] encroachment.\n\nIn the 19th century, Korean immigrants migrated en masse from the [[Korean peninsula]] to China. After the foundation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], a second wave arrived. Of the 2 million ethnic Koreans in Manchuria at the time of the communist takeover, 1.2 million remained in the region after the end of [[World War II]]. Many participated in the [[Chinese Civil War]], most on the side of the Chinese communists. When the civil war was over, the new Chinese government gave these Koreans their own autonomous region ({{lang|zh-hans|\u533a}}) in 1952. Yanbian was upgraded to an ethnic autonomous prefecture in 1955.\n\nKorean (Joseon) migration into northeast China began in significant numbers in the last quarter of the 19th century and was mainly motivated by economic hardship on the Korean side of the border. After the Japanese annexed Korea in 1910, a small but significant number of migrants also came to Manchuria for political reasons.<ref>Pyong, Gap Min. \"A Comparison of the Korean Minorities in China and Japan.\" International Migration Review, Vol. 26, No. 1. (Spring, 1992), pp. 4-21.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the Korean migrants comprised some 60% of the local population, but by 2000 that was down to 32%. The Chinese authorities subsidize Korean language schools and publications, but also take measures to prevent an emergence of Korean [[irredentism]] in the area. From the late 1990s, the Koreans have assimilated into mainstream Chinese culture with increasing speed, often switching to daily use of Chinese and choosing to attend Chinese-language schools.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/IH16Ad01.html |title = The gentle decline of the 'Third Korea'   |publisher = [[Asia Times]] |date = 2007-08-16 |accessdate = 2007-08-17 |author = Andrei Lankov }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n*[[Geographic coordinate]]s: 41\u00b0 59' 47\" - 44\u00b0 30' 42\" N, 127\u00b0 27' 43\" - 131\u00b0 18' 33\" E\n* Total border length: {{convert|755.2|km}}\n** With North Korea: {{convert|522.5|km}}\n** With Russia: {{convert|232.7|km}}\n\nMountains that are in the prefecture are:\n\n*[[Changbai Mountains]] (central range)\n* Zhangguangcai Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5f20\u5e7f\u624d\u5cad}})\n* Harba Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u54c8\u5c14\u5df4\u5cad}})\n* Peony Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7261\u4e39\u9886}})\n* Old Master Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8001\u7237\u5cad}})\n* Nangang Mountain Range ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5357\u5c97\u5c71\u8109}})\n\nThere have been over 40 types of [[mineral]]s and 50 kinds of metals \u2013 including [[gold]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[silver]], [[manganese]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] \u2013 discovered near or in the mountains.\n\nThe average land height is 500 metres above [[sea level]].\n\nMain rivers include:\n\n*[[Songhua River]]\n*[[Mudan River]] (Peony River)\n*[[Tumen River]]\n**[[Gaya River]] (branch of the Tumen)\n**[[Hunchun River]]\n\nThe rivers sustain 28 running water processing facilities.

It contains over 10,000 exhibits, including 11 first-level artifacts.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The exhibits' labels and explanations are bilingual in Korean and Chinese, and tour guides are also available in both languages.\n\n==Tourism==\nThere are seven public parks in Yanbian's green space (18% of whole prefecture), including:\n*Yanji People's Park (\u5ef6\u5409\u4eba\u6c11\u516c\u56ed)\n*Youth Lake Park (\u9752\u5e74\u6e56\u516c\u56ed)\n\nAlso popular among locals during holidays and festivities.\n\n* [[Baekdusan]]\n\n==Nature and environment==\nOver 70% are originally forest in the prefecture, so there is a rich diversity of life.\n* 1,460 [[species]] of native [[animal]]s\n* 250 species of native [[plant]]s.\n\n== Sports ==\nYanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture is an important region for [[Chinese football]]. Over 50 years more than 40 footballers have been selected by the [[Chinese national football team]].\n\nIn 1955, Yanbian Football Club was founded, although it was a semi-professional one.\n\nThe first professional football team in this prefecture is [[Jilin Three Stars Football Club]]. From 1994 to 2000, this club had played each year in the top Chinese football league. In 2000, they were relegated from the top league. Because of poor economic conditions the club was sold to [[Lucheng Group]] in [[Zhejiang]] Province.\n\nIn 2001, [[Yanbian Football Club]] was founded. They are currently playing in the 32,000-seater [[Hailanjiang Stadium]] in the [[Chinese Super League]], the top tier of the Chinese football league system.\n\nIn 2016, [[Yanbian Football Club]] was sponsored by Shenzhen Funde Group when they got the permission of Chinese Super League, since they acquired the 1st place in the Chinese Second League in 2015.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China}}\n* [[Jiandao]]\n* [[Gando massacre]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal | title = Nationalism and Ethnic Identity in the Sino-Korean Border Region of Yanbian, 1945\u20131950 | given = Adam | surname = Cathcart | journal = Korean Studies | volume = 34 | year = 2010 | pages = 25\u201353 | jstor = 23720146 }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Yanbian}}\n* [http://www.yanbian.gov.cn/ Official government website] {{in lang|zh-cn}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720131853/http://tris.yanbian.gov.cn/ Official government Tourism website]\n* [http://www.ybkap.org/ Yanbian Office in Korea] {{in lang|ko}}\n* [http://english.jl.gov.cn/Travel/Attractions/YanBian/ Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]: by the Information Office of Jilin Provincial Government\n* [http://www.yanbian.gov.cn/skin_2/yanbianzhouqing/map_01.gif A map labeled in Chinese written in the list in the \"Administration\" section]\n\n{{Jilin topics}}\n{{Jilin}}\n{{Korean autonomy in the People's Republic of China}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture| 01]]\n[[Category:Prefecture-level divisions of Jilin]]\n[[Category:Autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China]]\n[[Category:Koreans in China]]\n[[Category:Korean-speaking countries and territories]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Yanbian|the county in Sichuan|Yanbian County|other uses}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name = {{raise|0.2em|Yanbian Prefecture}}\n|native_name = {{lower|0.1em|{{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u5ef6\u8fb9\u5dde}} \u00b7 {{lang|ko-Hang|\uc5f0\ubcc0\uc8fc}}}}}}\n|official_name = {{longitem |style = font-size: 105%; |Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture<br />{{nobold|{{lang|zh-cn|\u5ef6\u8fb9\u671d\u9c9c\u65cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u5dde}}}}}}{{nobold|{{lang|ko-Hang|\uc5f0\ubcc0 \uc870\uc120\uc871 \uc790\uce58\uc8fc}}}}\n|nickname               = \n|settlement_type        =[[Autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China|Autonomous prefecture]]\n|total_type             = <!-- to set a non-standard label for total area and population rows -->\n<!-- images and maps  ----------->\n|image_skyline          =\u51ef\u800c\u739b -

Yanbian is bordered to the north by [[Heilongjiang]], on the west by [[Baishan]] and [[Jilin City]], on the south by [[North Korea]]'s [[North Hamgyong]] Province, and on the east by [[Primorsky Krai]] in [[Russia]]. Yanbian is designated as a Korean autonomous prefecture due to the large number of [[Koreans in China|ethnic Koreans]] living in the region. The prefectural capital is [[Yanji]], and the total area is {{convert|42,700|km2|sigfig=3}}.\n\nThe prefecture has an important [[Balhae]] archaeological site: the [[Ancient Tombs at Longtou Mountain]], which includes the [[Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo]].\n\n== History ==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn the [[Ming Dynasty]], Yanbian was governed by the Jianzhou Guard ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5efa\u5dde\u885b}}), and in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] the area was divided into the Yanji ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5ef6\u5409\u5ef3}}) and Hunchun ({{lang|zh-hant|\u743f\u6625\u5ef3}}) [[subprefecture]]s. From 1644 to the 1800s the [[Manchurian people|Manchurian]] administrators of the Qing state attempted to separate northeast China, politically and ethnographically, into a \"Manchuria\" to which they could retreat in case an ethnically [[Han Chinese]] dynasty regained control over China. However, this effort failed because of the trading and agricultural opportunities available to Han Chinese migrants in the northeast region which made it profitable to evade the rules, as well as later Qing relaxation of the same rules to discourage [[Empire of Russia|Russian]] encroachment.\n\nIn the 19th century, Korean immigrants migrated en masse from the [[Korean peninsula]] to China. After the foundation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], a second wave arrived. Of the 2 million ethnic Koreans in Manchuria at the time of the communist takeover, 1.2 million remained in the region after the end of [[World War II]]. Many participated in the [[Chinese Civil War]], most on the side of the Chinese communists. When the civil war was over, the new Chinese government gave these Koreans their own autonomous region ({{lang|zh-hans|\u533a}}) in 1952. Yanbian was upgraded to an ethnic autonomous prefecture in 1955.\n\nKorean (Joseon) migration into northeast China began in significant numbers in the last quarter of the 19th century and was mainly motivated by economic hardship on the Korean side of the border. After the Japanese annexed Korea in 1910, a small but significant number of migrants also came to Manchuria for political reasons.<ref>Pyong, Gap Min. \"A Comparison of the Korean Minorities in China and Japan.\" International Migration Review, Vol. 26, No. 1. (Spring, 1992), pp. 4-21.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the Korean migrants comprised some 60% of the local population, but by 2000 that was down to 32%. The Chinese authorities subsidize Korean language schools and publications, but also take measures to prevent an emergence of Korean [[irredentism]] in the area. From the late 1990s, the Koreans have assimilated into mainstream Chinese culture with increasing speed, often switching to daily use of Chinese and choosing to attend Chinese-language schools.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/IH16Ad01.html |title = The gentle decline of the 'Third Korea'   |publisher = [[Asia Times]] |date = 2007-08-16 |accessdate = 2007-08-17 |author = Andrei Lankov }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n*[[Geographic coordinate]]s: 41\u00b0 59' 47\" - 44\u00b0 30' 42\" N, 127\u00b0 27' 43\" - 131\u00b0 18' 33\" E\n* Total border length: {{convert|755.2|km}}\n** With North Korea: {{convert|522.5|km}}\n** With Russia: {{convert|232.7|km}}\n\nMountains that are in the prefecture are:\n\n*[[Changbai Mountains]] (central range)\n* Zhangguangcai Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5f20\u5e7f\u624d\u5cad}})\n* Harba Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u54c8\u5c14\u5df4\u5cad}})\n* Peony Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7261\u4e39\u9886}})\n* Old Master Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8001\u7237\u5cad}})\n* Nangang Mountain Range ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5357\u5c97\u5c71\u8109}})\n\nThere have been over 40 types of [[mineral]]s and 50 kinds of metals \u2013 including [[gold]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[silver]], [[manganese]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] \u2013 discovered near or in the mountains.\n\nThe average land height is 500 metres above [[sea level]].\n\nMain rivers include:\n\n*[[Songhua River]]\n*[[Mudan River]] (Peony River)\n*[[Tumen River]]\n**[[Gaya River]] (branch of the Tumen)\n**[[Hunchun River]]\n\nThe rivers sustain 28 running water processing facilities.

The film is divided into three chapters and follows the story of a stick-figure man named Bill, who struggles with his failing memory and [[absurdism|absurdist]] visions, among other symptoms of an unknown neurological illness, implied to be brain cancer. The film employs both offbeat humor and serious philosophical musings. It received critical acclaim and won numerous awards.\n\n== Plot ==\nBill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by [[Don Hertzfeldt]]). The Narrator subtly explains that Bill is suffering from a problematic memory disorder, which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his unnamed ex-girlfriend, and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. On a visit to the clinic, Bill's doctor recommends that Bill have a new batch of medication, after his recent treatment didn't yield any positive results. It is unknown if Bill did take the new medication, as he undergoes a hallucinatory experience the next morning and then stays awake the following night. The next day Bill suffers more hallucinations, seeing monsters and ripping his own head open.\n\nBill is then shown lying down in an alleyway. To recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him, though he attacks her when she comes at him with a pair of scissors. Bill is then taken to hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill is not going to die, wherein his mother removes all the flowers from the hospital room and returning a casket meant for him. Bill then goes back to work.\n\nThe film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall. Randall was in the \"special\" class at school, having aluminium hook arms and \"a brain as misshapen as his legs\". On a school trip at the seaside, Randall chased a gull and disappeared into the sea. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home. The Narrator then explains the details of Bill's stepfather leaving the house for good and Bill's mother rocking on the spot in front of the door afterwards. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, with many of them suffering from various diseases, such as [[polio]] and [[yellow fever]]. Many of Bill's family members were apparently killed by trains, and one\u2014his great-great-uncle\u2014was outcast from town and \"died in the field one summer morning while dreaming of the moon.\"\n\nA few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died; she was hit by a train after skipping her medication and launching into a fit of senile hysterics. After the funeral, Bill goes through his mother's old belongings, finding a physician's note strongly recommending that she never have a child. \n\nBill sees his doctor once again, who unexpectedly finds nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses to the ground. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him, including an encounter with someone on a beach. Bill is again taken to hospital, where he is frequently visited by his ex-girlfriend. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life, such as his address or what month it is. He also cannot remember the name of his ex-girlfriend. Bill has surgery, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical.\n\nBill's doctor explains to his ex-girlfriend that Bill is having trouble understanding past-tense and present-tense, and it is implied that many of Bill's childhood memories and family history could have been [[confabulated]]. Bill is allowed to go home for family care, but when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. Bill starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live.\n\nBill's outlook on life starkly changes; he marvels at the night sky and notices details of insignificant objects that amaze him. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives into the night, blindly following his instincts without knowing where he will end up. Arriving at a house, the Narrator reveals that it is in fact Bill's childhood home. Bill's uncle, who may have followed him, gives him an address to where Bill can find his real father, who Bill has not seen since childhood.\n\nGoing to a nursing home, Bill finds his father chair bound; neither of them remember who the other is or why they are there. When Bill leaves, he tells his father that he is forgiven, causing Bill's father to cry. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the Narrator states, \"It's such a beautiful day.\" The screen cuts to black.\n\nThe Narrator, breaking character, realizes that Bill may die there and stubbornly refuses to believe that he will.

The film is divided into three chapters and follows the story of a stick-figure man named Bill, who struggles with his failing memory and [[absurdism|absurdist]] visions, among other symptoms of an unknown neurological illness, implied to be brain cancer. The film employs both offbeat humor and serious philosophical musings. It received critical acclaim and won numerous awards.\n\n== Plot ==\nBill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by [[Don Hertzfeldt]]). The Narrator subtly explains that Bill is suffering from a problematic memory disorder, which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his unnamed ex-girlfriend, and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. On a visit to the clinic, Bill's doctor recommends that Bill have a new batch of medication, after his recent treatment didn't yield any positive results. It is unknown if Bill did take the new medication, as he undergoes a hallucinatory experience the next morning and then stays awake the following night. The next day Bill suffers more hallucinations, seeing monsters and ripping his own head open.\n\nBill is then shown lying down in an alleyway. To recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him, though he attacks her when she comes at him with a pair of scissors. Bill is then taken to hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill is not going to die, wherein his mother removes all the flowers from the hospital room and returning a casket meant for him. Bill then goes back to work.\n\nThe film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall. Randall was in the \"special\" class at school, having aluminium hook arms and \"a brain as misshapen as his legs\". On a school trip at the seaside, Randall chased a gull and disappeared into the sea. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home. The Narrator then explains the details of Bill's stepfather leaving the house for good and Bill's mother rocking on the spot in front of the door afterwards. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, with many of them suffering from various diseases, such as [[polio]] and [[yellow fever]]. Many of Bill's family members were apparently killed by trains, and one\u2014his great-great-uncle\u2014was outcast from town and \"died in the field one summer morning while dreaming of the moon.\"\n\nA few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died; she was hit by a train after skipping her medication and launching into a fit of senile hysterics. After the funeral, Bill goes through his mother's old belongings, finding a physician's note strongly recommending that she never have a child. \n\nBill sees his doctor once again, who unexpectedly finds nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses to the ground. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him, including an encounter with someone on a beach. Bill is again taken to hospital, where he is frequently visited by his ex-girlfriend. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life, such as his address or what month it is. He also cannot remember the name of his ex-girlfriend. Bill has surgery, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical.\n\nBill's doctor explains to his ex-girlfriend that Bill is having trouble understanding past-tense and present-tense, and it is implied that many of Bill's childhood memories and family history could have been [[confabulated]]. Bill is allowed to go home for family care, but when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. Bill starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live.\n\nBill's outlook on life starkly changes; he marvels at the night sky and notices details of insignificant objects that amaze him. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives into the night, blindly following his instincts without knowing where he will end up. Arriving at a house, the Narrator reveals that it is in fact Bill's childhood home. Bill's uncle, who may have followed him, gives him an address to where Bill can find his real father, who Bill has not seen since childhood.\n\nGoing to a nursing home, Bill finds his father chair bound; neither of them remember who the other is or why they are there. When Bill leaves, he tells his father that he is forgiven, causing Bill's father to cry. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the Narrator states, \"It's such a beautiful day.\" The screen cuts to black.\n\nThe Narrator, breaking character, realizes that Bill may die there and stubbornly refuses to believe that he will. Bill is then shown walking away from the forest. The Narrator explains that Bill has become immortal and travels the world, learning everything there is to know, yet death remains a complete mystery to him. Bill outlives the human race, surpassing the next inhabitants of the Earth who revere him as a god. He continues living until the Earth is destroyed by the Sun, continuing even when that has gone as well. Floating in space, Bill observes the stars going out, until the screen cuts to black.\n\n==Release==\nIt had a limited theatrical run<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/12/10/don_hertzfeldt_s_it_s_such_a_beautiful_day_the_best_animated_movie_of_the.html|title=The Best Animated Film of the Year|last1=Wickman|first1=Forrest|date=December 10, 2012|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url-status=live|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> before becoming available on [[DVD]],<ref name=\"slate\" /> [[Vimeo]],<ref name=\"wp\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/going-out-guide/wp/2014/11/14/watch-online-the-girl-amor-cronico-and-its-such-a-beautiful-day/|title=Watch online: \u2018The Girl,\u2019 \u2018Amor Cronico\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u2019|last1=Hornaday|first1=Ann|date=November 14, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=August 19, 2015|url-status=live|last2=O'Sullivan|first2=Michael|last3=Merry|first3=Stephanie}}</ref> [[iTunes]],<ref name=\"wp\" /> and [[Netflix]].\n\nThe three chapters of the film were originally produced and released independently as animated short films, captured entirely on 35mm film with in-camera special effects.\n\nThe first installment, ''[[Everything Will Be OK]]'', was released in 2006 and won the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Prize for Short Film.

It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.  The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below {{convert|\u221218|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson96\" />\n\nThough the GSC concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide, the facility's owners disagreed. Their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=38}}</ref>  Later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of \"equilibrium\"; even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine's existence would have helped trigger a slide.<ref>{{harvnb|Benko|Stead|1998|p=311}}</ref> The mine was quickly re-opened, even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" /> Coal production at Frank peaked in 1910,<ref name=\"Kerr36\">{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=36}}</ref> but the mine was permanently closed in 1917 after it became unprofitable.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" />\n\nThe slide created two new peaks on the mountain; the south peak stands {{convert|2200|m|ft}} high and the north peak {{convert|2100|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\">{{citation |url=https://frankslide.ca/sites/frankslide/files/editor_files/Frank_Slide_Facts%20(1).pdf |title=Frank Slide facts |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=2019-04-29}}</ref> Geologists believe that another slide is inevitable, though not imminent.

Around {{convert|110|e6t|e6ST|abbr=none}} of [[limestone]] rock slid down [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]].<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\" /> Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement.]]\nAn unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.  The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below {{convert|\u221218|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson96\" />\n\nThough the GSC concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide, the facility's owners disagreed.
