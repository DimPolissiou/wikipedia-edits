Across his spell with the two clubs, Werner claimed the domestic records for being the youngest player to reach 50, 100, 150 and 200 appearances in the [[Bundesliga]], although the former two milestones were broken by [[Kai Havertz]], and is the youngest player to have scored two goals in a single top-flight match in Germany.\n\nWerner was a prolific goalscorer at youth international level where he scored 34 goals in 48 appearances across the various age group levels. He made his senior debut for [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in 2017 and in the same year helped his nation claim the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] where his return of three goals earned him the tournament's Golden Boot award.\n\n==Club career==\n===VfB Stuttgart===\nAn academy graduate of [[VfB Stuttgart]], Werner represented the club at various youth levels. During the 2012\u201313 season, he was promoted to the U-19 side despite only being sixteen-years old at the time.

His major works were:<ref name=\"oxforddnb_a\"/>\n* ''The Control and Eradication of Tuberculosis: A Series of International Studies by Many Authors'' (Contributing Editor) (1911)\n* ''Pulmonary Tuberculosis in General Practice'' (1916)\n* ''Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine against the Neo-Malthusians'' (1922)\n* ''The Arches of the Years'' (1932)\n* ''A Time to Keep'' (1934)\n* ''Laws of Life'' (1935)\n* ''In My Path'' (1936)\n* ''Tuberculin Handbook'' (1936)\n* ''Lapland Journey'' (1938)\n* ''Hebridean Journey'' (1939)\n* ''Southward Journey'' (1942)\n* ''Control of Life'' (1944)\n* ''Spanish Journey'' (1948)\n* ''Irish Journey'' (1956)\n\n''The Arches of the Years'' was Sutherland's most successful book. It was a best-seller for 1933,<ref>Michael Korda, ''Making the List: A Cultural History of the American Bestseller 1900\u20131999'', Barnes and Noble 2001. {{ISBN|0-7607-2559-4}}.</ref> ran to 35 editions in English, and was translated into eight languages.<ref name=\"BritishMedical\" /> [[G. K. Chesterton]] described Sutherland's writing as follows: \"Dr. Halliday Sutherland is a born writer, especially a born story-teller.  Dr. Sutherland, who is distinguished in medicine, is an amateur in the sense that he only writes when he has nothing better to do.  But when he does, it could hardly be done better.\"<ref>\"Documents of the Twentieth Century\" by G. K. Chesterton \"The Listener\" 12 December 1934.</ref>\n\n== Film ==\n\nIn 1911, Sutherland produced \"[[The Story of John M'Neil]]\", Britain's first public health education cinema film. The 22-minute film was produced for the then new and highly popular silent films shown in cinemas. It depicts various aspects of tuberculosis including the transmission of the disease between family members, the treatments of the various stages of the disease and Sir Robert Philip's \"Edinburgh System\" for the prevention, treatment and cure of tuberculosis.\n\n== Public opposition of eugenics, Malthusianism and disputes with Marie Stopes ==\n\nSutherland publicly opposed the doctrines of [[eugenics]] and [[Malthusianism]]. This brought him into a bitter and public dispute with Dr [[Marie Stopes]].\n\n=== Eugenics ===\nIn the main, eugenists agreed with the sentiments of Dr John Haycraft who, in an 1894 speech on \"Darwinism and Race Progress\" at the Royal College of Physicians, had said the \"preventative medicine is trying a unique experiment, and the effect is already discernible \u2013 race decay\".<ref>''Peoplequake'' by Fred Pearce, Transworld Publishers 2010. Version 1.0 Epub {{ISBN|9781409094227}}</ref> The argument was that providing medical attention to those who would have perished in previous eras ran in the face of \"the survival of the fittest\". Race decay would surely result as the unfit, given succour, would live long enough to propagate their genes. Haycraft believed that the bulwark against this race decay was disease: \u201cIf we stamp out the Infectious Diseases we perpetuate Poor Types. It is a hard saying, but none the less a true one, that the bacillus tuberculosis is a friend of the race, for it attacks no healthy man or woman, but only the feeble.\u201d<ref>Haycraft, J. B., 1895. Darwinism and Race Progress. London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co. Page 57.</ref>\n\nThese views persisted into the new century and were reflected in the views of the Professor of Eugenics at London University, [[Karl Pearson]] and by the President of the British Medical Association, [[Sir James Barr]].\n\nIn \"Tuberculosis, Heredity and Environment\", Pearson said that the \"importance of the discovery of Koch [of the tubercle bacillus] cannot be overrated,\" but he went on to say that this had led to a focus on infection as the cause of tuberculosis. His view was that there should have been a proper scientific inquiry as to the relative importance of the hereditary and environmental factors and of the liability to infection in the cause of the disease.<ref>Tuberculosis, Heredity and Environment being a lecture by Karl Pearson, F.R.S. at the Galton laboratory for National Eugenics on 12 March 1912. Page 1. See: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/77020#page/5/mode/1up</ref> Pearson had previously asserted that \"the influence of environment is not one-fifth of heredity, and quite possibly not one-tenth of it,\"<ref>\"Nature and Nurture: The Problem of the Future\". A Presidential Address delivered by Karl Pearson, F.R.S. at the Annual General Meeting of the Social and Political Education League 28 April 1910.</ref> so he felt that by focussing on infection, the significant cause, heredity, was being ignored. Towards the end of his lecture, Pearson outlined the political ramifications of his findings:\n\n{{Quotation|\"But Eugenists have something better to propose. No one can study the pedigrees of pathological states, insanity, mental defect, albinism, &c., collected by our laboratory, without being struck by the large proportion of tuberculous members \u2013 occasionally the tuberculous man is a brilliant member of our race \u2013 but the bulk of the tuberculous belong to stocks which we want ab initio to discourage. Everything which tends to check the multiplication of the unfit, to emphasize that the fertility of the physically and mentally healthy, will pro tanto aid Nature\u2019s method of reducing the phthisical death-rate. That is what the Eugenist proclaims as the \u201cbetter thing to do\u201d, and \u00a31,500,000 spent in encouraging healthy parentage would do more than the establishment of a sanatorium in every township.\"<ref>Tuberculosis, Heredity and Environment being a lecture by Karl Pearson, F.R.S. at the Galton laboratory for National Eugenics on 12 March 1912. Page 45. See: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/77020#page/5/mode/1up</ref>}}\n\nSir James Barr delivered the presidential address at the British Medical Association's 1912 conference. Recognising the progress that had been achieved in the field of medicine, he pointed out the dysgenic consequences: \u201cWe have successfully interfered with the selective death-rate which Nature employed in eliminating the unfit, but, on the other hand, we have made no serious attempt to establish a selective birth-rate so as to prevent the race being carried on by the least worthy citizens.\u201d\nDoctors had a major contribution to \u201craise up a vigorous, intelligent, enterprising, self-reliant and healthy race\u201d, which \u201cmust be renewed from the mentally and physically fit...moral and physical degenerates should not be allowed to take any part in adding to the race.\u201d<ref>Barr, S. J., 1912. President's Address, Delivered at the Eightieth Annual Meeting of the British Medical Association. British Medical Journal, 2(2691), pp. 157-163.</ref> He then turned his attention to tuberculosis:\n\n{{Quotation|\u201cIf we could only abolish the tubercle bacillus in these islands we would get rid of tuberculous disease, but we should at the same time raise up a race peculiarly susceptible to this infection\u2014a race of hothouse plants which would not flourish in any other environment. We would thus increase at an even greater rate than we are doing at present, nervous instability, the numbers of insane and feeble-minded. Nature, on the other hand, weeds out those who have not got the innate power of recovery from disease, and by means of the tubercle bacillus and other pathogenic organisms she frequently does this before the reproductive age, so that a check is put on the multiplication of idiots and the feeble-minded. Nature's methods are thus of advantage to the race rather than to the individual.\u201d}}\n\nThe first evidence of Sutherland's opposition to eugenics appeared in a November 1912 article in the [[British Medical Journal]]: \"The Seed or the Soil in Tuberculosis\".<ref>\"The Seed or the Soil in Tuberculosis\" by Halliday Sutherland British Medical Journal. 1912 Nov 23; 2(2708): 1434\u20131437</ref> In it, he rebutted the view that tuberculosis was primarily a hereditary affliction and he provided the statistics to support his assertions. He spoke out again in September 1917 when he addressed the National Council of the Y.M.C.A. in a speech: \"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure\". He said that while \"modern medicine [has]\u2026found the cause, sources and cure of this disease\", he identified that the barriers to its prevention were man-made. The obstacles were apathy, arrogance, ignorance, indifference, and eugenics.<ref name=\"Consumption 1917\">\"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure\" An Address by Dr Halliday Sutherland on 4 September 1917, published by the Red Triangle Press.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Sutherland |first1=Halliday |title=Consumption: Its Cause and Cure |url=https://hallidaysutherland.com/2017/09/04/against-tb-against-eugenics/ |website=hallidaysutherland.com |publisher=Red Triangle Press |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|\"But why should you set out to prevent this infection and to cure the disease?

They say the efficiency of the State is based upon what they call 'the survival of the fittest'.  This war has smashed their rhetorical phrase.  Who now talks about the survival of the fittest, or thinks himself fit because he survives?  I don't know what they mean.

At the time the issues of birth control and eugenics were closely related: one historian has written: \"in the interwar years birth control and eugenics were so intertwined as to be synonymous\".<ref name=\"JaneCarey\" /> Stopes stated the eugenic purpose of her clinic on the second day of the Stopes v. Sutherland libel trial in 1923. Under oath, she explained the purpose of the society that had been set up to run the clinic:\n\n{{Quotation|\u201cThe object of the Society is, if possible, to counteract the steady evil which has been growing for a good many years of the reduction of the birth rate just on the part of the thrifty, wise, well-contented, and the generally sound members of our community, and the reckless breeding from the C.3 end, and the semi-feebleminded, the careless, who are proportionately increasing in our community because of the slowing of the birth rate at the other end of the social scale. Statistics show that every year the birth rate from the worst end of our community is increasing in proportion to the birth rate at the better end, and it was in order to try to right that grave social danger that I embarked upon this work.\u201d<ref>Box, M. (Ed.). (1967). The Trial of Marie Stopes. London: Femina Books Ltd. Page 76.</ref>}}\n\nStopes outlined her eugenic vision in the final chapter of ''Radiant Motherhood: A Book for those Who Are Creating the Future'', published in 1920. She outlined her \"ardent dream\" of \"human stock represented only by well-formed, desired and well-endowed beautiful men and women\". An obstacle to its accomplishment was \"inborn incapacity\" which lay \"in the vast and ever increasing stock of degenerate, feeble-minded, and unbalanced who are now in our midst\", a class of people who were \"appallingly prolific\". The solution was \"a few very simple Acts of Parliament\" for the [[compulsory sterilisation]] of \"the miserable, the degenerate [and] the utterly wretched in mind and body\".<ref>Marie Carmichael Stopes ''Radiant Motherhood.

It began:<ref>Sutherland, H., 1922. Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine Against the Neo-Malthusians. London: Harding and More. Page 1.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\u201cBirth control, in the sense of the prevention of pregnancy by chemical, mechanical or other artificial means, is being widely advocated as a sure method of lessening poverty and of increasing the physical and mental health of the nation. It is therefore advisable to examine these claims and the grounds on which these are based\u201d.}}\n\nWhat followed concerned politics as much as it concerned birth control. Sutherland attacked what he described as \"the essential fallacies of Malthusian teaching\": \u201cMalthus did a greater and more evil thing. He forged a law of nature\u2026that the masses should find no room at her feast; and that therefore our system of industrial capitalism was in harmony with the Will of God. Most comforting dogma!\u201d<ref>Sutherland, H., 1922. Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine Against the Neo-Malthusians. London: Harding and More. Page 32.</ref>\n\nHe said there was \"no evidence whatever to prove that the population is pressing on the soil. On the contrary, we find ample physical resources sufficient to support the entire population, and we also find evidence of human injustice, incapacity, and corruption sufficient to account for the poverty and misery that exist in these countries\". Sutherland argued that \"organised poverty\" arose when in the sixteenth century \"the greater part of the land, including common land belonging to the poor, had been seized by the rich\" and the Parliamentary Acts for the [[Inclosure Acts|enclosure of common land]] between 1714 and 1820.<ref>Sutherland, H., 1922. Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine Against the Neo-Malthusians. London: Harding and More. Page 28.</ref>\n\nIn conclusion, Sutherland foreshadowed the impact of a declining birth-rate that afflicts many developed nations today:<ref name=\"Halliday Sutherland 1922\">Halliday Sutherland, Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine against the Neo-Malthusians New York, PJ Kennedy and Sons, 1922. Page 155.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\u201cOur declining birth-rate is a fact of the utmost gravity, and a more serious position has never confronted the British people. Here in the midst of a great nation, at the end of a victorious war, the law of decline is working, and by that law the greatest empires in the world have perished. In comparison with that single fact all other dangers, be they of war, of politics, or of disease, are of little moment. Attempts have already been made to avert the consequences by the partial endowment of motherhood and by a saving if infant life. Physiologists are now seeking among the endocrinous glands and the vitamines [sic] for a substance to assist procreation.  \u201c[[Where are my children?]]\u201d was the question shouted yesterday from the cinemas. \u201cLet us have children, children at any price,\u201d will be the cry of to-morrow.\"}}\n\n=== The ''Stopes v. Sutherland'' libel trial of 1923 ===\n\n''Birth Control'' is remembered today as the work that contained the passages that Stopes asserted were defamatory, which led to the Stopes v. Sutherland case.\n\nUnder the headings \"Specially Hurtful to the Poor\" and \"Exposing the Poor to Experiment\", Sutherland wrote:\n{{Quotation|\"In the midst of a London slum a woman, who is a doctor of German philosophy (Munich), has opened a Birth Control Clinic, where working women are instructed in a method of contraception described by Professor McIlroy as 'The most harmful method of which I have had experience'. When we remember that millions are being spent by the Ministry of Health and by Local Authorities \u2013 on pure milk for necessitous expectant and nursing mothers, on Maternity Clinics to guard the health of mothers before and after childbirth, for the provision of skilled midwives, and on Infant Welfare Centres \u2013 it is truly amazing that this monstrous campaign of birth control should be tolerated by the Home Secretary. Charles Bradlaugh was condemned to jail for a less serious crime.\"<ref name=\"Halliday Sutherland 1922\"/>}}\n\n[[Charles Bradlaugh]] (and [[Annie Besant]]) had been tried in 1877 for publishing 'obscene literature'. They had published an American Malthusian tract in Britain. The original document was ''The [[Fruits of Philosophy]]'' which \"advocated and gave explicit information about contraceptive methods\". For the British version, Bradlaugh and Besant had added a subtitle: ''An Essay on the Population Question'' and a preface \"we believe, with the Rev. Mr. Malthus, that population has a tendency to increase faster than the means of existence, and that some checks must therefore exercise control over population\".<ref name=\"JaneCarey\" />\n\nStopes sued Sutherland for libel and the case commenced in the High Court on 21 February 1923. The defendants (Sutherland and his publisher) won. Stopes appealed, won, and was awarded damages of one hundred pounds. Sutherland appealed to the House of Lords and the case was heard for the third time on 21 November 1924. Sutherland won. Stopes was ordered to repay the one hundred pounds arising from the previous hearing, and to pay the defendant's costs in relation to the appeals to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.<ref name=\"JuneRose\" />\n\nA second case arose when, in January 1929, Stopes publication ''Birth Control News'' attacked Sutherland and this time it was he who took legal action against her for libel. He lost in the Court of Appeal.<ref name=\"JuneRose\" />\n\n=== Visit to the Mother-and-Baby home at Tuam and to the Magdalene Laundry at Galway ===\n\nIn 1955, Sutherland again encountered controversy, when he travelled to Ireland to find material for a book. The result, ''Irish Journey'', includes an account of Dr Sutherland's visit to the [[Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home|Mother-and-Baby-Home at Tuam]] and the [[Magdalene laundries in Ireland|Magdalene Laundry]] in Galway in April 1955. To visit these institutions, Sutherland needed the permission of [[Michael Browne (Bishop of Galway)|Michael Browne]], the Bishop of Galway.<ref>Coogan, T.P. ''Ireland Since The Rising'', Pall Mall Press, 1966, p. 239.</ref> He asked Bishop Browne: \"Is there anything to hide?\", later adding: \"I want to find out how you treat unmarried mothers.\"<ref>Sutherland, H., 1956. Irish Journey. London: Geoffrey Bles Ltd.</ref>\n\nPermission was granted, on condition that Sutherland allowed his account to be [[Censorship|censored]] by the Mother Superior of the Sisters of Mercy, who ran the institution.<ref>Halliday Sutherland, ''Irish Journey'', G. Bles, 1956 {{ISBN|7470000100}}, 9787470000105</ref> Accordingly, the account of his visit to the Laundry in \"Irish Journey\" was censored. In 2013, the publishers draft of \"Irish Journey\" was discovered in a cellar and the uncensored version was published in \"The Suitcase in the Cellar\" on hallidaysutherland.com.<ref>http://www.hallidaysutherland.com [https://hallidaysutherland.com/2014/06/08/the-suitcase-in-the-cellar/ The Suitcase in the Cellar]</ref>\n\nIrish Journey caused ripples, which Sutherland described this way, in the preface to the 1958 American edition:<ref>Sutherland, H., 1956. Irish Journey.</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|In 1955 I wrote Irish Journey and this book has been damned by faint praise from every newspaper critic in Ireland. I was not surprised, because all the critics have ignored my main criticism, which concerns the Irish secular clergy. In my opinion they have too much political power. They hold themselves aloof from their people, and are too fond of money.\n\nIn the bad old days, when Ireland was subject to the foreign power of England, the parish priest was probably the only educated man in an Irish village. The foreign power has been driven out, the people are better educated, but the parish priest is loathe to relinquish his political power.\n\nDuring my Irish holiday, I was assaulted by a total stranger in a Tipperary hotel. The incident was reported in all the Dublin papers, and when I returned to my Dublin hotel, the receptionist said to me, \u201cWill you be writing about it?\u201d I told her I would, and she replied, \u201cThat won\u2019t be nice.\u201d She was obviously afraid that the record of this incident would spoil Ireland as a show place.\n\nIreland is certainly a wonderful show place, and heaven may reflect Killarney; but as a Scotsman I think Loch Lomond, twenty miles from Glasgow, is more beautiful.\n\nAnother day a well-known man called at the hotel to see me. I met him in the lounge, but he asked me out to his car, I asked him where we were going and he said, \u201d Nowhere, but there were too many people in the lounge who might overhear what I am going to ask you, and that is not to mention me in your book.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nI know that he meant the Irish hierarchy, It is strange how the shadow of the hierarchy falls on the most unexpected places in the public life of Ireland.\n\nIf Ireland goes communist within the next ten years, I think the secular clergy will be to blame.\n\nThe \u201cCatholic Medical Guardian\u201d of London gave my book an excellent review and said that my account of the assault on myself in a Tipperary hotel recalled the best chapters in \u201cHandy Andy\u201d. But a copy of my book was sent to a nun in Dublin who replied, \u201cThis book should be burnt by the public hangman.\u201d\n\nI only hope that what I have written will be more appreciated in the clearer air in the United States of America.}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://hallidaysutherland.com Halliday Sutherland website]\n* [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exterminating-Poverty-incredible-eugenic-Scottish-ebook/dp/B083HWQ1R3/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MNYGFT3Y3V1V&keywords=exterminating+poverty&qid=1582063028&sprefix=exterminating+p%2Caps%2C469&sr=8-1 ''Exterminating Poverty: The incredible true story of the eugenic plan to get rid of the poor, and the Scottish doctor who fought against it.'' by Mark H.

It was a best-seller for 1933,<ref>Michael Korda, ''Making the List: A Cultural History of the American Bestseller 1900\u20131999'', Barnes and Noble 2001. {{ISBN|0-7607-2559-4}}.</ref> ran to 35 editions in English, and was translated into eight languages.<ref name=\"BritishMedical\" /> [[G. K. Chesterton]] described Sutherland's writing as follows: \"Dr. Halliday Sutherland is a born writer, especially a born story-teller.  Dr. Sutherland, who is distinguished in medicine, is an amateur in the sense that he only writes when he has nothing better to do.  But when he does, it could hardly be done better.\"<ref>\"Documents of the Twentieth Century\" by G. K. Chesterton \"The Listener\" 12 December 1934.</ref>\n\n== Film ==\n\nIn 1911, Sutherland produced \"[[The Story of John M'Neil]]\", Britain's first public health education cinema film. The 22-minute film was produced for the then new and highly popular silent films shown in cinemas. It depicts various aspects of tuberculosis including the transmission of the disease between family members, the treatments of the various stages of the disease and Sir Robert Philip's \"Edinburgh System\" for the prevention, treatment and cure of tuberculosis.\n\n== Public opposition of eugenics, Malthusianism and disputes with Marie Stopes ==\n\nSutherland publicly opposed the doctrines of [[eugenics]] and [[Malthusianism]]. This brought him into a bitter and public dispute with Dr [[Marie Stopes]].\n\n=== Eugenics ===\nIn the main, eugenists agreed with the sentiments of Dr John Haycraft who, in an 1894 speech on \"Darwinism and Race Progress\" at the Royal College of Physicians, had said the \"preventative medicine is trying a unique experiment, and the effect is already discernible \u2013 race decay\".<ref>''Peoplequake'' by Fred Pearce, Transworld Publishers 2010. Version 1.0 Epub {{ISBN|9781409094227}}</ref> The argument was that providing medical attention to those who would have perished in previous eras ran in the face of \"the survival of the fittest\". Race decay would surely result as the unfit, given succour, would live long enough to propagate their genes. Haycraft believed that the bulwark against this race decay was disease: \u201cIf we stamp out the Infectious Diseases we perpetuate Poor Types. It is a hard saying, but none the less a true one, that the bacillus tuberculosis is a friend of the race, for it attacks no healthy man or woman, but only the feeble.\u201d<ref>Haycraft, J. B., 1895. Darwinism and Race Progress. London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co. Page 57.</ref>\n\nThese views persisted into the new century and were reflected in the views of the Professor of Eugenics at London University, [[Karl Pearson]] and by the President of the British Medical Association, [[Sir James Barr]].\n\nIn \"Tuberculosis, Heredity and Environment\", Pearson said that the \"importance of the discovery of Koch [of the tubercle bacillus] cannot be overrated,\" but he went on to say that this had led to a focus on infection as the cause of tuberculosis. His view was that there should have been a proper scientific inquiry as to the relative importance of the hereditary and environmental factors and of the liability to infection in the cause of the disease.<ref>Tuberculosis, Heredity and Environment being a lecture by Karl Pearson, F.R.S. at the Galton laboratory for National Eugenics on 12 March 1912. Page 1. See: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/77020#page/5/mode/1up</ref> Pearson had previously asserted that \"the influence of environment is not one-fifth of heredity, and quite possibly not one-tenth of it,\"<ref>\"Nature and Nurture: The Problem of the Future\". A Presidential Address delivered by Karl Pearson, F.R.S. at the Annual General Meeting of the Social and Political Education League 28 April 1910.</ref> so he felt that by focussing on infection, the significant cause, heredity, was being ignored. Towards the end of his lecture, Pearson outlined the political ramifications of his findings:\n\n{{Quotation|\"But Eugenists have something better to propose. No one can study the pedigrees of pathological states, insanity, mental defect, albinism, &c., collected by our laboratory, without being struck by the large proportion of tuberculous members \u2013 occasionally the tuberculous man is a brilliant member of our race \u2013 but the bulk of the tuberculous belong to stocks which we want ab initio to discourage. Everything which tends to check the multiplication of the unfit, to emphasize that the fertility of the physically and mentally healthy, will pro tanto aid Nature\u2019s method of reducing the phthisical death-rate. That is what the Eugenist proclaims as the \u201cbetter thing to do\u201d, and \u00a31,500,000 spent in encouraging healthy parentage would do more than the establishment of a sanatorium in every township.\"<ref>Tuberculosis, Heredity and Environment being a lecture by Karl Pearson, F.R.S. at the Galton laboratory for National Eugenics on 12 March 1912. Page 45. See: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/77020#page/5/mode/1up</ref>}}\n\nSir James Barr delivered the presidential address at the British Medical Association's 1912 conference. Recognising the progress that had been achieved in the field of medicine, he pointed out the dysgenic consequences: \u201cWe have successfully interfered with the selective death-rate which Nature employed in eliminating the unfit, but, on the other hand, we have made no serious attempt to establish a selective birth-rate so as to prevent the race being carried on by the least worthy citizens.\u201d\nDoctors had a major contribution to \u201craise up a vigorous, intelligent, enterprising, self-reliant and healthy race\u201d, which \u201cmust be renewed from the mentally and physically fit...moral and physical degenerates should not be allowed to take any part in adding to the race.\u201d<ref>Barr, S. J., 1912. President's Address, Delivered at the Eightieth Annual Meeting of the British Medical Association. British Medical Journal, 2(2691), pp. 157-163.</ref> He then turned his attention to tuberculosis:\n\n{{Quotation|\u201cIf we could only abolish the tubercle bacillus in these islands we would get rid of tuberculous disease, but we should at the same time raise up a race peculiarly susceptible to this infection\u2014a race of hothouse plants which would not flourish in any other environment. We would thus increase at an even greater rate than we are doing at present, nervous instability, the numbers of insane and feeble-minded. Nature, on the other hand, weeds out those who have not got the innate power of recovery from disease, and by means of the tubercle bacillus and other pathogenic organisms she frequently does this before the reproductive age, so that a check is put on the multiplication of idiots and the feeble-minded. Nature's methods are thus of advantage to the race rather than to the individual.\u201d}}\n\nThe first evidence of Sutherland's opposition to eugenics appeared in a November 1912 article in the [[British Medical Journal]]: \"The Seed or the Soil in Tuberculosis\".<ref>\"The Seed or the Soil in Tuberculosis\" by Halliday Sutherland British Medical Journal. 1912 Nov 23; 2(2708): 1434\u20131437</ref> In it, he rebutted the view that tuberculosis was primarily a hereditary affliction and he provided the statistics to support his assertions. He spoke out again in September 1917 when he addressed the National Council of the Y.M.C.A. in a speech: \"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure\". He said that while \"modern medicine [has]\u2026found the cause, sources and cure of this disease\", he identified that the barriers to its prevention were man-made. The obstacles were apathy, arrogance, ignorance, indifference, and eugenics.<ref name=\"Consumption 1917\">\"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure\" An Address by Dr Halliday Sutherland on 4 September 1917, published by the Red Triangle Press.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Sutherland |first1=Halliday |title=Consumption: Its Cause and Cure |url=https://hallidaysutherland.com/2017/09/04/against-tb-against-eugenics/ |website=hallidaysutherland.com |publisher=Red Triangle Press |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|\"But why should you set out to prevent this infection and to cure the disease?

They say the efficiency of the State is based upon what they call 'the survival of the fittest'.  This war has smashed their rhetorical phrase.  Who now talks about the survival of the fittest, or thinks himself fit because he survives?  I don't know what they mean.

At the time the issues of birth control and eugenics were closely related: one historian has written: \"in the interwar years birth control and eugenics were so intertwined as to be synonymous\".<ref name=\"JaneCarey\" /> Stopes stated the eugenic purpose of her clinic on the second day of the Stopes v. Sutherland libel trial in 1923. Under oath, she explained the purpose of the society that had been set up to run the clinic:\n\n{{Quotation|\u201cThe object of the Society is, if possible, to counteract the steady evil which has been growing for a good many years of the reduction of the birth rate just on the part of the thrifty, wise, well-contented, and the generally sound members of our community, and the reckless breeding from the C.3 end, and the semi-feebleminded, the careless, who are proportionately increasing in our community because of the slowing of the birth rate at the other end of the social scale. Statistics show that every year the birth rate from the worst end of our community is increasing in proportion to the birth rate at the better end, and it was in order to try to right that grave social danger that I embarked upon this work.\u201d<ref>Box, M. (Ed.). (1967). The Trial of Marie Stopes. London: Femina Books Ltd. Page 76.</ref>}}\n\nStopes outlined her eugenic vision in the final chapter of ''Radiant Motherhood: A Book for those Who Are Creating the Future'', published in 1920. She outlined her \"ardent dream\" of \"human stock represented only by well-formed, desired and well-endowed beautiful men and women\". An obstacle to its accomplishment was \"inborn incapacity\" which lay \"in the vast and ever increasing stock of degenerate, feeble-minded, and unbalanced who are now in our midst\", a class of people who were \"appallingly prolific\". The solution was \"a few very simple Acts of Parliament\" for the [[compulsory sterilisation]] of \"the miserable, the degenerate [and] the utterly wretched in mind and body\".<ref>Marie Carmichael Stopes ''Radiant Motherhood.

It began:<ref>Sutherland, H., 1922. Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine Against the Neo-Malthusians. London: Harding and More. Page 1.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\u201cBirth control, in the sense of the prevention of pregnancy by chemical, mechanical or other artificial means, is being widely advocated as a sure method of lessening poverty and of increasing the physical and mental health of the nation. It is therefore advisable to examine these claims and the grounds on which these are based\u201d.}}\n\nWhat followed concerned politics as much as it concerned birth control. Sutherland attacked what he described as \"the essential fallacies of Malthusian teaching\": \u201cMalthus did a greater and more evil thing. He forged a law of nature\u2026that the masses should find no room at her feast; and that therefore our system of industrial capitalism was in harmony with the Will of God. Most comforting dogma!\u201d<ref>Sutherland, H., 1922. Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine Against the Neo-Malthusians. London: Harding and More. Page 32.</ref>\n\nHe said there was \"no evidence whatever to prove that the population is pressing on the soil. On the contrary, we find ample physical resources sufficient to support the entire population, and we also find evidence of human injustice, incapacity, and corruption sufficient to account for the poverty and misery that exist in these countries\". Sutherland argued that \"organised poverty\" arose when in the sixteenth century \"the greater part of the land, including common land belonging to the poor, had been seized by the rich\" and the Parliamentary Acts for the [[Inclosure Acts|enclosure of common land]] between 1714 and 1820.<ref>Sutherland, H., 1922. Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine Against the Neo-Malthusians. London: Harding and More. Page 28.</ref>\n\nIn conclusion, Sutherland foreshadowed the impact of a declining birth-rate that afflicts many developed nations today:<ref name=\"Halliday Sutherland 1922\">Halliday Sutherland, Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine against the Neo-Malthusians New York, PJ Kennedy and Sons, 1922. Page 155.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\u201cOur declining birth-rate is a fact of the utmost gravity, and a more serious position has never confronted the British people. Here in the midst of a great nation, at the end of a victorious war, the law of decline is working, and by that law the greatest empires in the world have perished. In comparison with that single fact all other dangers, be they of war, of politics, or of disease, are of little moment. Attempts have already been made to avert the consequences by the partial endowment of motherhood and by a saving if infant life. Physiologists are now seeking among the endocrinous glands and the vitamines [sic] for a substance to assist procreation.  \u201c[[Where are my children?]]\u201d was the question shouted yesterday from the cinemas. \u201cLet us have children, children at any price,\u201d will be the cry of to-morrow.\"}}\n\n=== The ''Stopes v. Sutherland'' libel trial of 1923 ===\n\n''Birth Control'' is remembered today as the work that contained the passages that Stopes asserted were defamatory, which led to the Stopes v. Sutherland case.\n\nUnder the headings \"Specially Hurtful to the Poor\" and \"Exposing the Poor to Experiment\", Sutherland wrote:\n{{Quotation|\"In the midst of a London slum a woman, who is a doctor of German philosophy (Munich), has opened a Birth Control Clinic, where working women are instructed in a method of contraception described by Professor McIlroy as 'The most harmful method of which I have had experience'. When we remember that millions are being spent by the Ministry of Health and by Local Authorities \u2013 on pure milk for necessitous expectant and nursing mothers, on Maternity Clinics to guard the health of mothers before and after childbirth, for the provision of skilled midwives, and on Infant Welfare Centres \u2013 it is truly amazing that this monstrous campaign of birth control should be tolerated by the Home Secretary. Charles Bradlaugh was condemned to jail for a less serious crime.\"<ref name=\"Halliday Sutherland 1922\"/>}}\n\n[[Charles Bradlaugh]] (and [[Annie Besant]]) had been tried in 1877 for publishing 'obscene literature'. They had published an American Malthusian tract in Britain. The original document was ''The [[Fruits of Philosophy]]'' which \"advocated and gave explicit information about contraceptive methods\". For the British version, Bradlaugh and Besant had added a subtitle: ''An Essay on the Population Question'' and a preface \"we believe, with the Rev. Mr. Malthus, that population has a tendency to increase faster than the means of existence, and that some checks must therefore exercise control over population\".<ref name=\"JaneCarey\" />\n\nStopes sued Sutherland for libel and the case commenced in the High Court on 21 February 1923. The defendants (Sutherland and his publisher) won. Stopes appealed, won, and was awarded damages of one hundred pounds. Sutherland appealed to the House of Lords and the case was heard for the third time on 21 November 1924. Sutherland won. Stopes was ordered to repay the one hundred pounds arising from the previous hearing, and to pay the defendant's costs in relation to the appeals to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.<ref name=\"JuneRose\" />\n\nA second case arose when, in January 1929, Stopes publication ''Birth Control News'' attacked Sutherland and this time it was he who took legal action against her for libel. He lost in the Court of Appeal.<ref name=\"JuneRose\" />\n\n=== Visit to the Mother-and-Baby home at Tuam and to the Magdalene Laundry at Galway ===\n\nIn 1955, Sutherland again encountered controversy, when he travelled to Ireland to find material for a book. The result, ''Irish Journey'', includes an account of Dr Sutherland's visit to the [[Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home|Mother-and-Baby-Home at Tuam]] and the [[Magdalene laundries in Ireland|Magdalene Laundry]] in Galway in April 1955. To visit these institutions, Sutherland needed the permission of [[Michael Browne (Bishop of Galway)|Michael Browne]], the Bishop of Galway.<ref>Coogan, T.P. ''Ireland Since The Rising'', Pall Mall Press, 1966, p. 239.</ref> He asked Bishop Browne: \"Is there anything to hide?\", later adding: \"I want to find out how you treat unmarried mothers.\"<ref>Sutherland, H., 1956. Irish Journey. London: Geoffrey Bles Ltd.</ref>\n\nPermission was granted, on condition that Sutherland allowed his account to be [[Censorship|censored]] by the Mother Superior of the Sisters of Mercy, who ran the institution.<ref>Halliday Sutherland, ''Irish Journey'', G. Bles, 1956 {{ISBN|7470000100}}, 9787470000105</ref> Accordingly, the account of his visit to the Laundry in \"Irish Journey\" was censored. In 2013, the publishers draft of \"Irish Journey\" was discovered in a cellar and the uncensored version was published in \"The Suitcase in the Cellar\" on hallidaysutherland.com.<ref>http://www.hallidaysutherland.com [https://hallidaysutherland.com/2014/06/08/the-suitcase-in-the-cellar/ The Suitcase in the Cellar]</ref>\n\nIrish Journey caused ripples, which Sutherland described this way, in the preface to the 1958 American edition:<ref>Sutherland, H., 1956. Irish Journey.</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|In 1955 I wrote Irish Journey and this book has been damned by faint praise from every newspaper critic in Ireland.

I met him in the lounge, but he asked me out to his car, I asked him where we were going and he said, \u201d Nowhere, but there were too many people in the lounge who might overhear what I am going to ask you, and that is not to mention me in your book.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nI know that he meant the Irish hierarchy, It is strange how the shadow of the hierarchy falls on the most unexpected places in the public life of Ireland.\n\nIf Ireland goes communist within the next ten years, I think the secular clergy will be to blame.\n\nThe \u201cCatholic Medical Guardian\u201d of London gave my book an excellent review and said that my account of the assault on myself in a Tipperary hotel recalled the best chapters in \u201cHandy Andy\u201d. But a copy of my book was sent to a nun in Dublin who replied, \u201cThis book should be burnt by the public hangman.\u201d\n\nI only hope that what I have written will be more appreciated in the clearer air in the United States of America.}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://hallidaysutherland.com Halliday Sutherland website]\n* [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exterminating-Poverty-incredible-eugenic-Scottish-ebook/dp/B083HWQ1R3/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MNYGFT3Y3V1V&keywords=exterminating+poverty&qid=1582063028&sprefix=exterminating+p%2Caps%2C469&sr=8-1 ''Exterminating Poverty: The incredible true story of the eugenic plan to get rid of the poor, and the Scottish doctor who fought against it.'' by Mark H.

The series was officially announced a month later, with many characters in the series set to be voiced by the actors who portray them in the films. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, which is designed to reflect the films.\n\n''What If...?''{{'}}s first season is expected to be released in mid-2021, and will consist of 10 episodes. A second 10-episode season has been announced.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series explores what would happen if major moments from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] occurred differently.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Uatu|Uatu / The Watcher]]:<br />A member of the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher race]], who observes the multiverse and occasionally intervenes with events therein.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> Head writer A.C. Bradley said the Watcher is \"above everything else\" and compared the character to a viewer watching the [[Rats in New York City#Notable incidents|\"pizza rat\" video]], stating that he is \"a guy watching a rat drag a slice of pizza across the platform. He has no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things. He just goes, 'Man, this is remarkable. Look at the little guy go'! That is The Watcher's relationship with humanity\". Bradley said Wright was cast in the role because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \"warm personality\".<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\"/>\n\n=== Guest ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter|Captain Peggy Carter]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /><ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> / [[Star-Lord]]<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Samuel L.

The anthology series, which would be produced by Feige, would explore how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] wielded [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The hope was to have the actors who portray the characters in the MCU voice them in the series as well.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> A month later, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> In December 2019, Feige revealed that the first season would consist of 10 episodes, and that work had already begun on a second 10-episode season.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n\n===Writing===\nFeige explained with the announcement of the series that the events that would be depicted as changed would be \"pivotal moments\" from throughout the MCU. He revealed that, for example, the first episode features [[Peggy Carter]] taking the super soldier serum instead of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]].<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> A.C. Bradley serves as head writer of the series,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> with Matthew Chauncey serving as story editor.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Episodes were conceived and written by Bradley, Chauncey, series director [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]], executive producer Brad Winderbaum, junior executive Simona Paparelli, and script coordinator Ryan Little, with the ''What If...?'' comics providing inspiration for potential story points. After creating 30 potential episode concepts, Feige chose his favorites, which were then narrowed down further to get the first season of episodes.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Bradley originally pitched an episode which would have explored a possible reality in which [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] became Thor. However, since the upcoming MCU film ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2021) is set to feature Foster as Thor, the idea was scrapped. After a rumor incorrectly stated that each episode would focus on one film from the Infinity Saga, Bradley clarified that multiple films and characters would be represented in each episode, with the intention of featuring most of the characters from all the films throughout the season.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n\n===Casting===\nMarvel's plan for the series was to have actors who portray characters in the MCU films reprise their roles in the series.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July 2019, Feige revealed a cast list of these actors that included [[Michael B. Jordan]] as [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes]], [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Loki, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]], [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Hayley Atwell]] as Peggy Carter, [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]], [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]], [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]], [[Neal McDonough]] as [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]], [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin, [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], [[Taika Waititi]] as [[Korg (comics)|Korg]], [[Toby Jones]] as [[Arnim Zola]], [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath]], [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], and [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu]]. Feige also announced that [[Jeffrey Wright]] had been cast as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> A month later, Atwell revealed that voice recording for the series had already begun.<ref name=\"Atwell\" /> Goldblum indicated in November 2019 that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would be reprising his role as [[Iron Man (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] in the series.<ref name=\"Downey\" />\n\n===Animation===\nThe series, directed by Andrews,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> will feature a [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, with character likenesses based on the actors from the films.<ref name=\"EWD23\" /> Ryan Meinerding, the head of visual development at Marvel Studios, worked with Andrews to find the animation style for the series, which Bradley described as more of a \"cinematic style\". Bradley added that Marvel was \"trying to use the color palette, the lighting, [and] the character design to tell as much story as you can\" similarly as in live-action film.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Animation studio Squeeze will work on five of ten episodes in the series' first season.<ref name=\"Squeeze\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nFootage from the series' first episode was shown during the [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] 2019,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\"/> with footage from the series also included in ''Expanding the Universe'', a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.<ref name=\"ExpandingTheUniverseFootage\" />\n\n==Release==\n''What If...?'' is expected to debut in mid-2021,<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> and will consist of 10 episodes.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" /> Episodes will be released weekly rather than all at once.<ref name=\"EpisodeRelease\" /> A second season has been announced.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\">{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/loki-scarlet-witch-tv-series-marvel-disney-streaming-service-1202947551/ |title=Loki, Scarlet Witch, Other Marvel Heroes to Get Own TV Series on Disney Streaming Service (Exclusive) |last=Kroll |first=Justin |date=September 18, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/72XWaEZfB?url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/loki-scarlet-witch-tv-series-marvel-disney-streaming-service-1202947551/ |archive-date=September 19, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/falcon-winter-soldier-tv-series-disney-streaming-service-marvel-1202492782/ |title=Marvel Duo Falcon & Winter Soldier Teaming For Disney Streaming Series |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |last2=Hipes |first2=Patrick |date=October 30, 2018 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/73ZWes7yO?url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/falcon-winter-soldier-tv-series-disney-streaming-service-marvel-1202492782/# |archive-date=October 31, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=October 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/what-if-tv-series-coming-to-disney-plus/ |title=Exclusive: Marvel Studios Producing 'What If' TV Series For Disney+ |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |date=March 12, 2019 |website=[[/Film]] |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/7719lgKiY |archive-date=March 20, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/all-marvel-disney-plus-news-coming-out-of-investor-day |title=All of the Marvel Disney+ News Coming Out of The Walt Disney Company's Investor Day |last=Dinh |first=Christine |date=April 12, 2019 |website=[[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412080938/http://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/all-marvel-disney-plus-news-coming-out-of-investor-day |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SDCCCast\">{{Cite web |url=http://collider.com/marvels-what-if-announces-massive-voice-cast-of-mcu-stars-jeffrey-wright-as-the-watcher/ |title=Marvel's 'What If?'

Bradley, based on the [[Marvel Comics]] series [[What If (comics)|of the same name]]. It explores what would happen if major moments from [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of]] the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) occurred differently. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], their first animated series since becoming their own production company, with animation by Squeeze. Bradley serves as [[head writer]] of the series, with [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]] directing.\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] stars as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of series for Disney+, and one based on the ''What If...?'' comic was first reported in March 2019. The series was officially announced a month later, with many characters in the series set to be voiced by the actors who portray them in the films. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, which is designed to reflect the films.\n\n''What If...?''{{'}}s first season is expected to be released in mid-2021, and will consist of 10 episodes. A second 10-episode season has been announced.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series explores what would happen if major moments from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] occurred differently.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Uatu|Uatu / The Watcher]]:<br />A member of the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher race]], who observes the multiverse and occasionally intervenes with events therein.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> Head writer A.C. Bradley said the Watcher is \"above everything else\" and compared the character to a viewer watching the [[Rats in New York City#Notable incidents|\"pizza rat\" video]], stating that he is \"a guy watching a rat drag a slice of pizza across the platform. He has no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things. He just goes, 'Man, this is remarkable. Look at the little guy go'! That is The Watcher's relationship with humanity\". Bradley said Wright was cast in the role because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \"warm personality\".<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\"/>\n\n=== Guest ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter|Captain Peggy Carter]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /><ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> / [[Star-Lord]]<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Samuel L.

The anthology series, which would be produced by Feige, would explore how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] wielded [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The hope was to have the actors who portray the characters in the MCU voice them in the series as well.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> A month later, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> In December 2019, Feige revealed that the first season would consist of 10 episodes, and that work had already begun on a second 10-episode season.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n\n===Writing===\nFeige explained with the announcement of the series that the events that would be depicted as changed would be \"pivotal moments\" from throughout the MCU. He revealed that, for example, the first episode features [[Peggy Carter]] taking the super soldier serum instead of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]].<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> A.C.

After creating 30 potential episode concepts, Feige chose his favorites, which were then narrowed down further to get the first season of episodes.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Bradley originally pitched an episode which would have explored a possible reality in which [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] became Thor. However, since the upcoming MCU film ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2021) is set to feature Foster as Thor, the idea was scrapped. After a rumor incorrectly stated that each episode would focus on one film from the Infinity Saga, Bradley clarified that multiple films and characters would be represented in each episode, with the intention of featuring most of the characters from all the films throughout the season.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n\n===Casting===\nMarvel's plan for the series was to have actors who portray characters in the MCU films reprise their roles in the series.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July 2019, Feige revealed a cast list of these actors that included [[Michael B. Jordan]] as [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes]], [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Loki, [[Samuel L.
