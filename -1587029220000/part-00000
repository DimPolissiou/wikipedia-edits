The film originally premiered on [[CBS]] as a presentation of ''CBS Sunday Afternoon Showcase'' on October 23, 1994.\n\n==Plot==\nFaith Crowell (Meg Tilly) is a struggling bohemian artist who is commissioned to paint a mural for wealthy, reclusive socialite widow Frances Griffin (Ellen Burstyn). Frances wants Faith to paint murals all over the ornate walls of the abandoned ballroom of her ostentatious 211-acre estate.

The producers derived the title from lines of the song [[Mera Joota hai Japani|Mera joota hai Japani]] from the 1955 Raj Kapoor film [[Shree 420]] (originally written by [[Shailendra (lyricist)|Shailendra]] and composed by [[Shankar Jaikishan|Shankar-Jaikishan]]). [[Aziz Mirza]] directed stars [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] and [[Juhi Chawla]], focusing on the TV media war. Ajay Bakshi and Ria Banerjee are two television reporters for rival news channels who try to save the life of a man who has been fixed by politicians for the death of his brother, from a death sentence. The film marked the first attempted by Khan, Chawla, and Mirza under their new production company [[Dreamz Unlimited]], now Red Chillies Entertainment. This film won the IIFA Award for Best Special Effects. The film had a few plot points derived from the 1988 movie ''[[Switching Channels]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAjay Bakshi ([[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]]) is a successful loudmouthed reporter, working for a reputed news channel. The rival news channel ropes in Ria Banerjee ([[Juhi Chawla]]) to bring him down. Ria is the antithesis of Ajay and uses her intelligence, charm and wits to get her work done.\n\nPappu Junior alias Choti ([[Johnny Lever]]) is a don who is to be ousted from his own gang, owing to his inability to make it big in the crime world. Ajay approaches Choti with an offer: arrange a fake attack on minister Ramakant Dua's ([[Shakti Kapoor]]) brother-in-law Madanlal Gupta ([[Mahavir Shah]]), on national TV. Choti will earn respect & Ajay's channel will gain ratings. Little does Ajay know that the plan is going to turn too real.\n\nRamakant Dua's brother-in-law is gunned down by an assailant named Mohan Joshi ([[Paresh Rawal]]). Minister Ramakant takes advantage of his brother-in-law's death to gain votes and sympathy; he also instigates a [[pogrom]] to ensure his position in the government. Ajay and Ria start getting along as they work together to cover the city riots. Mohan is arrested and to avoid public unrest, the Police Commissioner declares that Mohan is a foreign terrorist. Mohan escapes jail and hides in Ajay and Ria's car.\n\nWhen Mohan accosts them, Ajay accuses him of being a terrorist. Mohan yells that he is not and tells the two his story: Mohan had a happy family with a wife ([[Neena Kulkarni]]) and daughter. One day, his daughter went for an interview and Ramakant's brother-in-law raped and beat her. She died from the trauma and as no lawyer was willing to fight the case due to the perpetrator's political power, Mohan was left helpless, running from door to door for justice. Hence hopeless, he took the law into his own hands and killed the rapist.\n\nAjay and Ria decide to help Mohan, who sees them as his own kids and helps them realize their love for each other. Ajay hands over the videotape of Mohan's confession to his boss and uncle Kaka ([[Satish Shah]]). Unfortunately, the minister has joined hands with rival minister Mushran ([[Govind Namdeo]]) as he fears that their secrets might come out if Mohan's truth is revealed. Ajay's boss forms an alliance with Ria's boss Chinoy ([[Dalip Tahil]]). The ministers and channel heads come together and trick Ajay and Ria into giving them the tape.\n\nWhen Mohan is arrested and sentenced to be publicly hanged, Ajay and Ria realize they were tricked. They work together with Choti to get the tape back. Ajay succeeds in broadcasting Mohan's confession just an hour before Mohan's execution and tearfully requests the nation to stop this injustice.\n\nThe ministers and policemen try to prevent the protesters from entering the prison ground but the ACP joins Ajay and Ria, thus neutralizing the police barricades. In a blatant mockery and critique of media's selfish obsession with ratings and views, Mohan is made to wear a shirt sporting logos of sponsors and companies. Seconds before the execution, Ajay saves Mohan and the protesters beat up the politicians and chase them out, ensuring their careers are over.\n\nMohan's execution is called off and the film ends happily as Ria proposes to Ajay, who accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] as Ajay Bakshi\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as Ria Banerjee\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] as Mohan Joshi\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Choti/Pappu Junior\n* [[Atul Parchure]] as Shahid\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as Bomb Defuser\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as Pappu's boss\n* [[Aanjjan Srivastav]] as Police Commissioner\n* [[Neena Kulkarni]] as Mohan's wife\n* [[Dalip Tahil]] as Chinoy\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Kaka\n* [[Govind Namdeo]] as Chief Minister Mushran\n* [[Shakti Kapoor]] as Minister Ramakant Dua\n* [[Mahavir Shah]] as Ramakant's brother-in-law Madanlal Gupta\n* [[Bharti Achrekar]] as Ria's mother\n* [[Smita Jaykar]] as Ajay's mother\n* [[Vishwajeet Pradhan]] as Head Police inspector\n* [[Dilip Joshi]] as Sapney (Choti's aide)\n* [[Mona Ambegaonkar]] as Shalini (Cameo)\n* [[Haidar Ali (actor)|Hyder Ali]] as Ajay's father\n* [[Pappu Polyester]]\n* Dimple Inamdar\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani\n| type       = Album\n| artist     = [[Jatin Lalit]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 26 November 1999<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/in/album/phir-bhi-dil-hai-hindustani-original-motion-picture/302381521 |title=Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) |publisher=[[iTunes]]}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length     = 33:26\n| label      = [[Sony Music]]\n| producer   = [[Jatin-Lalit]]\n| prev_title = [[Mohabbatein]]\n| prev_year  = 2000\n| next_title = [[Raja Ko Rani Se Pyar Ho Gaya]]\n| next_year  = 2000\n| misc       = {{External media\n| audio1 = {{YouTube|gH-oK9xM3qU|Audio Jukebox}}}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Planet Bollywood\n| rev1score = {{Rating|8.5|10}}<ref name=\"pb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbollywood.com/music/pbdhh.html |title= PBDHH: Music Review by Manish Dhamija  |publisher=Planet Bollywood |date= |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe music was composed by Jatin Lalit who also composed the background score assisted by brother in law Aadesh Shrivastava.

Prime Minister [[Georgios Papandreou]] and others on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] after the liberation from the Nazis\n}}\nThe '''occupation of [[Greece]] by the [[Axis Powers]]''' ({{lang-el|\u0397 \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae}}, ''I Katochi'', meaning \"The Occupation\") began in April 1941 after [[Nazi Germany]] [[Battle of Greece|invaded Greece]] to assist its ally, [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which had been [[Greco-Italian War|at war]] with [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Greece since October 1940. Following the [[Battle of Crete|conquest of Crete]], all of Greece was occupied by June 1941. The occupation in the mainland lasted until Germany and its ally [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] were forced to withdraw under Allied pressure in early October 1944. However, German garrisons remained in control of [[Crete]] and some other [[Aegean islands]] until after the end of [[World War II]] in Europe, surrendering these islands in May and June 1945.\n\nFascist Italy had initially declared war and invaded Greece in October 1940, but the [[Hellenic Army]] initially managed to push back the invading forces into neighboring [[Albania]], then an [[Albania under Italy|Italian protectorate]]. Nazi Germany intervened on its ally's behalf in southern Europe. While most of the Hellenic Army was dislocated on the Albanian front to fend off the relentless Italian counter-attacks, a rapid German ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' [[Battle of Greece|campaign]] commenced in April 1941, and by June (with the [[Battle of Crete|conquest of Crete]]) Greece was defeated and occupied. The Greek government [[Greek government in exile|went into exile]], and an [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Axis collaborationist]] [[Hellenic State (1941\u201344)|puppet government]] was established in the country. Furthermore, Greece's territory was divided into occupation zones run by the Axis powers, with the Germans proceeding to administer the most important regions of the country themselves, including [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]] and the strategic [[Aegean Islands]]. Other regions of the country were given to Germany's partners, Italy and Bulgaria.\n\nThe occupation ruined the Greek economy and brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population.<ref>Martin Seckendorf; G\u00fcnter Keber; u.a.; Bundesarchiv (Hrsg.): ''Die Okkupationspolitik des deutschen Faschismus in Jugoslawien, Griechenland, Albanien, Italien und Ungarn (1941\u20131945)'' H\u00fcthig, Berlin 1992; Decker/ M\u00fcller, Heidelberg 2000.

The Italians did not deport Jews living in territory they controlled, but when the Germans took over, Jews living there were also deported.\n\nAt the same time the [[Greek Resistance]] was formed. These resistance groups launched [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla attacks]] against the occupying powers, fought against the collaborationist [[Security Battalions]], and set up large espionage networks. By late 1943 the resistance groups began to fight amongst themselves. When liberation of the mainland came in October 1944, Greece was in a state of extreme political polarization, which soon led to the outbreak of the [[Greek Civil War]]. The subsequent civil war gave the opportunity to many prominent Nazi collaborators not only to escape punishment (because of their [[anti-communism]]), but to eventually become the ruling class of postwar Greece, after the [[Communism|communist]] defeat.<ref>Giannis Katris, The Birth of Neofascism in Greece, 1971</ref><ref>Andreas Papandreou, Democracy at Gunpoint (\u0397 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1)</ref>\n\nThe [[Greek Resistance]] killed 21,087 Axis soldiers (17,536 Germans, 2,739 Italians, 1,532 Bulgarians) and captured 6,463 (2,102 Germans, 2,109 Italians, 2,252 Bulgarians), for the death of 20,650 Greek partisans and an unknown number captured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.distomo-griechenland.de/pdf-dateien/mavri_vivlos_katochis.pdf |title=Council for Reparations from Germany, ''Black Book of the Occupation'' (in Greek and German), Athens 2006, p. 125-126 |accessdate=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331132014/http://www.distomo-griechenland.de/pdf-dateien/mavri_vivlos_katochis.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Fall of Greece ==\n{{See also|Greco-Italian War|Battle of Greece|Battle of Crete|Military history of Greece during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-163-0319-07A, Griechenland, Artilleriestellung auf freiem Feld.jpg|thumb|German artillery shelling the [[Metaxas Line]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-164-0357-29A, Athen, Einmarsch deutscher Truppen.jpg|thumb|German soldiers in [[Athens]], 1941]]\nIn the early morning hours of 28 October 1940, Italian Ambassador Emmanuel Grazzi awoke Greek Premier [[Ioannis Metaxas]] and presented him an [[ultimatum]]. Metaxas rejected the ultimatum and Italian forces [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greek territory]] from Italian-occupied [[Albania]] less than three hours later. (The anniversary of Greece's refusal is now a [[Ohi Day|public holiday]] in Greece.) Italian Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]] launched the invasion partly to prove that Italians could match the military successes of the German Army and partly because Mussolini regarded southeastern Europe as lying within Italy's sphere of influence.\n\nThe Hellenic Army proved to be a formidable opponent, and successfully exploited the mountainous terrain of Epirus. The Hellenic forces counterattacked and forced the Italians to retreat. By mid-December, the Greeks had occupied nearly one-quarter of Albania, before Italian reinforcements and the harsh winter stemmed the Greek advance. In March 1941, a [[Italian Spring Offensive|major Italian counterattack]] failed. The initial Greek defeat of the Italian invasion is considered the first Allied land victory of the Second World War, although due to German intervention, it eventually resulted in a victory for the Axis. Fifteen of the 21 Greek divisions were deployed against the Italians, so only six divisions were facing the attack from German troops in the ''Metaxas Line'' (near the border between Greece and Yugoslavia/Bulgaria) during the first days of April. Greece received help from [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] troops, moved from [[Libya]] on the orders of [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nOn 6 April 1941, Germany came to the aid of Italy and [[Battle of Greece|invaded Greece]] through [[Bulgaria]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. Greek and British Commonwealth troops fought back but were overwhelmed. On 20 April, after Greek resistance in the north had ceased, the [[Bulgarian Army]] entered Greek [[Thrace]], without having fired a shot,<ref>K.Svolopoulos, Greek Foreign Policy 1945\u20131981</ref> with the goal of regaining its [[Aegean Sea]] outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the [[Strymon River]] and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the [[Evros River]]. The Greek capital [[Athens]] fell on 27 April, and by 1 June, after the [[Battle of Crete|capture of Crete]], all of Greece was under Axis occupation.\nAfter the invasion King [[George II of Greece|George II]] fled, first to Crete and then to Cairo. A nominally Greek right-wing government ruled from Athens, but it was a [[puppet government|puppet]] of the occupiers.<ref>Bamberry, Chris, The Second World War: A Marxist History, 2014, Pluto Press (pg. 182)</ref>\n\n== The Triple Occupation ==\nThe occupation of Greece was divided among Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. German forces occupied the most strategically important areas, namely Athens, [[Thessaloniki]] with [[Central Macedonia]] and several [[Aegean Islands]], including most of Crete. Initially, the German zone was ruled by the ambassador [[G\u00fcnther Altenburg]] of the German Foreign Office and Field Marshal [[Wilhelm List]]. From 1942 onwards, the German occupation zone was ruled by the duumvirate of the plenipotentiary for South-Eastern Europe, [[Hermann Neubacher]], and Field Marshal [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]].<ref>Mazower, Mark ''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941\u201344'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001 page 222.</ref> In September\u2013October 1943, [[J\u00fcrgen Stroop]], the newly appointed Higher SS Police Leader, tried to challenge the Neubacher-L\u00f6hr duumvirate and was swiftly fired after less than a month on the job.

The remaining two-thirds of Greece was occupied by Italy, with the [[Ionian Islands]] directly administered as Italian territories. Count [[Pellegrino Ghigi]] represented Italian interests with the Greek government while General [[Carlo Geloso]] commanded the 11th Army occupying Greece.<ref>Mazower, Mark ''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941\u201344'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001 pages 22 & 145.</ref> Relations between the Germans and Italians were not good and frequently there were clashes between German and Italian soldiers.<ref>Mazower, Mark ''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941\u201344'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001 pages 145-146.</ref> It was German policy to strongly discourage relationships between German servicemen and Greek women as the German leaders feared miscegenation between Germans and the (in the Nazi view) racially \"inferior\" Greeks.<ref name=\"Mazower, Mark page 146\">Mazower, Mark ''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941\u201344'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001 page 146.</ref> By contrast, the Italians had no such inhibitions, which created problems among Wehrmacht and SS officers.<ref name=\"Mazower, Mark page 146\"/> German officers often complained that the Italians were more interested in making love than in making war, and that the Italians lacked the \"hardness\" to wage a campaign against the Greek guerrillas because many Italian soldiers had Greek girlfriends.<ref name=\"Mazower, Mark page 146\"/> After the [[Armistice with Italy|Italian capitulation]] in September 1943, the Italian zone was taken over by the Germans, who often attacked the Italian garrisons. There was a failed attempt by the British to take advantage of the Italian surrender to reenter the Aegean, resulting in the [[Dodecanese Campaign]].\n\n{{Infobox country\n| demonym                = \n| area_km2                = \n| area_rank                = \n| GDP_PPP                = \n| GDP_PPP_year                = \n| HDI                = \n| HDI_year                = \n| today                = \n| conventional_long_name                = German Military Administration in Greece\n| common_name                = Occupied Greece\n| native_name                = \n| image_flag                = Flag of Germany (1935\u20131945).svg\n| image_coat                = Coat of arms of Hellenic Republic.svg\n| government_type                = \n| currency                = [[Greek Drachma]]\n| life_span                = 1941-1944\n| p1                = 4th of August Regime\n| s1                = Kingdom of Greece\n}}\n=== The German occupation zone ===\n==== Economic exploitation and the Great Famine ====\n{{Main|Great Famine (Greece)|DEGRIGES|l1=Great Famine}}\n[[File:1944-12-14 Strife Torn Greece Gets Food Relief.ogv|thumb|right|[[Universal Newsreel]] about distribution of food to the Greek people in 1944]]\n[[File:200 Million Drachma (3542795683).jpg|thumb|right|German economic exploitation led to rampant inflation: 200,000,000-drachma banknote, issued in September 1944]]\nGreece suffered greatly during the occupation.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521829328&ss=exc Famine and Death in Occupied Greece 1941\u20131944, ''Cambridge University Press'']</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777595,00.html \"Greece: Hungriest Country\", ''Time'', Feb. 09 1942]</ref> The country's economy had already been devastated from the 6-month long war, and to it was added the relentless economic exploitation by the Nazis.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gU4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA28&ots=ULy7iZxxBp&dq=%22Famine%20and%20death%22&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q=&f=false \"Secret Not for Publication: Famine and Death Ride into Greece at the Heels of the Nazi Conquest\"], ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', 3 August 1942, pp. 28-29.</ref> Raw materials and food were requisitioned, and the collaborationist government was forced to pay the cost of the occupation, giving rise to inflation. Because the outflows of raw materials and products from Greece towards Germany weren't offset by German payments, substantial imbalances accrued in the settlement accounts at the Greek National Bank. In October 1942 the trading company [[DEGRIGES]] was founded, two months later, the Greek collaboration government was forced to agree to treat the balance as a loan without interest that was to be repaid once the war was over. At the end of the war, this forced loan amounted to 476 million Reichsmark (equivalent to {{Inflation|DE|0.476|1945}} billion {{Inflation-year|DE}} euros).<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |title=Drucksache 17/709, Entsch\u00e4digungs-, Schadensersatz- und Reparationsforderungen wegen NS-Unrechts in Griechenland, Italien und anderen ehemals von Deutschland besetzten Staaten |url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/007/1700709.pdf }}</ref>\n\nHitler's policy toward the economy of occupied Greece was termed ''Vergeltungsmassnahme'', or, roughly, \"retaliation measures\", the \"retaliation\" being for Greece having chosen the wrong side; it was additionally motivated by a desire to \"pluck out the best fruit\" to plunder before the Italians could get it. Groups of economic advisers, businessmen, engineers and factory managers came from Germany with the task of seizing anything they deemed of economic value, with both the Economic Ministry and the Foreign Office involved in the operation; these men were not only in competition with the Italians to plunder the country, but also with each other. The primary occupation, however, was finding as much food as possible to sustain the German army.<ref>Glenny, Misha. ''The Balkans''. Pages 478-480</ref> The occupying powers' requisitions and outright plunder, the drop in agricultural production from wartime disruption, the breakdown of the country's distribution networks due to a combination damage to infrastructure, the collapse of the central government and the fragmentation of the country at the hands of the Axis, coupled with hoarding by farmers, led to a severe shortage of food in the major urban centres in the winter of 1941\u201342. Given that even in peacetime, Greece was dependent on imports of wheat to cover about a third of its annual needs, the Allied blockade of German-dominated Europe further exacerbated the situation, creating the conditions for the \"Great Famine\" (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2): in the greater [[Athens]]\u2013[[Piraeus]] area alone, some 40,000 people died of starvation, and by the end of the Occupation \"it was estimated that the total population of Greece [...] was 300,000 less than it should have been because of famine or malnutrition\" (P.

The great suffering and the pressure of the exiled Greek government eventually forced the British to partially lift the blockade, and from the summer of 1942 Canadian wheat began to be distributed under the auspices of the [[International Red Cross]]. Of the country's 7.3&nbsp;million inhabitants in 1941, it is estimated that fully 2.5&nbsp;million were recipients of this aid, of whom half lived in Athens, i.e. practically the total number of the capital's population.<ref>Mazower (1995), pp. 44-48</ref><ref>Voglis (2006), p. 24</ref> Although this aid alleviated the threat of starvation in the cities, little of it reached the countryside, which experienced its own period of famine in 1943\u201344. The rise of the armed Resistance resulted in major anti-partisan campaigns across the countryside by the Axis, which led to the wholesale burning of villages, destruction of fields, or mass executions as reprisals for guerrilla attacks.

Although several proposals for territorial annexation had been put forward in [[Rome]], none were actually carried out during the war. This was due to pressure from the King of Italy, [[Victor Emmanuel III]], and from the Germans, who were concerned of further alienating the Greek population, which was already strongly opposing the Bulgarian annexations. Moreover, much of this proposed \"new Roman empire\" in Greece consisted of poor rural areas. Such goals made little strategic or political sense.<ref name=Mazower22/> Nevertheless, in the Ionian Islands, long a target of Italian expansionism, and in the [[Cyclades]], the Greek civil authorities were replaced by Italians in preparation for a post-war annexation.

Italian occupation forces were welcomed in some Vlach villages as liberators, and Vlachs offered their services as guides or interpreters in exchange for favors. Under [[Alcibiades Diamandi]], the pro-Italian [[Principality of the Pindus]] was declared, and 2000 locals joined Diamantis' ''Roman Legion'', while [[Nicolaos Matussis]] had his own band of Vlach followers which carried out raids at the service of Italian service departments. Most local Vlachs were not converted to Diamantis' vision of a Vlach state in the Pindus and most remained loyal to the Greek nation, but some collaborated nevertheless because of latent pro-Romanian feelings, or anger toward the Greek government or its military authorities. The Legion collapsed in 1942 with the departure of the Italians, and most of its leaders fled into Romania or Greek cities. Most active members were convicted as war criminals in absentia, but in the course of the Greek Civil War in many cases their actions were forgotten, and many actively fought for the government against the communist guerrillas.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ioannis Kolioupoulos|chapter= XIV.

Furthermore, unlike the Germans, and aside from some local commanders, the Italian military protected the Jews in their zone. The Germans were purportedly perturbed as the Italians not only protected Jews on their territory, but in parts of occupied France, Greece, the Balkans, and elsewhere, where they protected local Jewish populations also. On 13 December 1942, Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, wrote in his diary, ''\"The Italians are extremely lax in the treatment of the Jews. They protect the Italian Jews both in [[Tunis]] and in occupied France and will not permit their being drafted for work or compelled to wear the Star of David. This shows once again that Fascism does not really dare to get down to fundamentals but is very superficial regarding problems of vital importance.\"''<ref>Brownfeld (2003)</ref>\n\nSignificant mass reprisals did sometimes occur, such as the [[Domenikon massacre]] in which 150 Greek civilians were killed. As they controlled most of the countryside, the Italians were the first to face the rising resistance movement in 1942\u201343. By mid-1943, the Resistance had managed to expel a few Italian garrisons from some mountainous areas, including several towns, creating liberated zones (\"Free Greece\"). After the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian armistice]] in September 1943, the Italian zone was taken over by the Germans. As a result, German anti-partisan and anti-Semitic policies were extended to it.\n\n=== The Bulgarian occupation zone ===\n[[File:Bulgarians 1941.jpg|thumb|250px|Bulgarian troops entering a village in northern Greece in April 1941]]\n[[File:Drama-uprising-monument.jpg|thumb|Monument to the victims of the [[Drama Uprising|Drama atrocities]]]]\n\nThe Bulgarian Army entered Greece on 20 April 1941 on the heels of the Wehrmacht without having fired a shot.

Bulgaria withdraw from the central parts of Greek Macedonia after the pro-Soviet coup in the country [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|on 9 September 1944]]. At that time it declared war on Germany, but the Bulgarian army remained in [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]], where there were several limited attacks from withdrawing German troops in the middle of September. Bulgaria hoped to keep these territories after the war. The Soviet Union initially also believed it was possible to include at least Western Thrace in the post-war borders of Bulgaria and thereby to secure a strategic outlet to the Aegean Sea.

There their propaganda was not as effective, as the ancient [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] Jewish communities were well-integrated into the Orthodox Greek society and could not easily be singled out from the Christians, who in turn were more ready to resist the German authorities' demands. The Archbishop of Athens [[Archbishop Damaskinos|Damaskinos]] ordered his priests to ask their congregations to help the Jews and sent a strong-worded letter of protest to the collaborationist authorities and the Germans. Many [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] Christians risked their lives hiding Jews in their apartments and homes, despite the threat of imprisonment. Even the Greek [[police]] ignored instructions to turn over Jews to the Germans. When Jewish community leaders appealed to Prime Minister [[Ioannis Rallis]], he tried to alleviate their fears by saying that the Jews of Thessaloniki had been guilty of subversive activities and that this was the reason they were deported.\n\nAt the same time, Elias Barzilai, the Grand Rabbi of Athens, was summoned to the Department of Jewish Affairs and told to submit a list of names and addresses of members of the Jewish community. Instead, he destroyed the community records, thus saving the lives of thousands of Athenian Jews. He advised the Jews of Athens to flee or go into hiding. A few days later, the Rabbi himself was spirited out of the city by EAM-ELAS fighters and joined the resistance. EAM-ELAS helped hundreds of Jews escape and survive (especially officer [[Stefanos Sarafis]]), many of whom stayed with the resistance as fighters and/or [[Language interpretation|interpreters]].\n\n=== In the Bulgarian zone ===\n{{expand section|date=August 2018}}\nIn March 1943 the vast majority of the Jewish population, 4,058 of the 4,273 was rounded up and sent to local warehouses by the Bulgarian occupation authorities.

The first British troops under General Scobie arrived in Athens on 14 October 1944. Four days later, the Greek government-in-exile returned to the Greek capital.<ref name=Shrader37B>Shrader, 1999, p. 37</ref> Conflict between the monarchist Right and the republican and communist Left soon erupted, despite the initiatives of Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou.<ref name=\"Shrader, 1999, p. 38\"/> On 1 December, the government decreed that all guerrilla groups were to be disarmed. On 2 December, the six EAM ministers in the Government of National Unity resigned in protest, and on 4 December Papandreou himself resigned too. A new government was formed by [[Themistoklis Sofoulis]]. The immediate cause of the fighting was an EAM demonstration in Athens\u2019 Syntagma Square on Sunday, 3 December 1944, which turned violent when Greek police and British soldiers fired on the unarmed demonstrators. Meanwhile, General Scobie promptly ordered all ELAS units to leave Athens within seventy-two hours, and on the following day he declared martial law.<ref>Shrader, 1999, p. 39</ref> The clashes ended on the night of 5 January, and ELAS began a general withdrawal from the Greek capital.<ref>Shrader, 1999, p. 42</ref>\n[[File:The British Army in Greece 1944 NA20863.jpg|thumb|A soldier from the [[5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion]] takes cover in Athens during the [[Dekemvriana]] events, 18 December 1944]]\nNegotiations between the newly established Greek government and EAM concluded at 12 February 1945, with the [[Treaty of Varkiza]].<ref>Shrader, 1999, p. 43</ref> This provided a temporary respite from open warfare but Greece was in ruins.

After a few months, he was hunted down by government units and executed.<ref>Mazower, 1993,p. 373</ref> Official policy towards Axis collaborators was milder and more hesitant than perhaps anywhere else in Europe. Alexandros Lambou, a Pangalos follower and head of the special security police during the war period, was sentenced to death, but most of his co-defendants received short prison terms. During 1945, more than 80,000 people were prosecuted.

Sanitation conditions were deplorable, and the health of those who had survived was imperilled by a resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, the lack of medicines and medical materials, inadequate diet, and the breakdown of preventive measures. One-fourth of the villages had been burned, and over 100,000 buildings destroyed or heavily damaged. Nearly 700,000 of the total Greek population were refugees and lacked the basic necessities of life.<ref>Shrader, 1999, p. 47</ref> Famine was narrowly averted in 1945 only by massive aid provided by the Allies and the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA). In the second half of 1945 UNRRA delivered to Greece some $171&nbsp;million in goods. In the first year after the liberation, over 1.7&nbsp;million tons of food were provided by UNRRA and the Allies. Nevertheless, a minimum daily ration of 2,000 calories proved impossible.<ref>Shrader, 1999, p. 48</ref>\n\n== Influence in post-war culture ==\nThe Axis occupation of Greece, specifically the Greek islands, has a significant presence in English-language books and films. Real special forces raids, e.g., ''[[Ill Met by Moonlight]]'' or fictional special forces raids ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'', ''[[Escape to Athena]]'' and ''They Who Dare''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046421/ |title=They Who Dare (1954) |author=Gloede_The_Saint |date=3 May 1954 |website=IMDb}}</ref> (1954), and the fictional occupation narrative ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'' are examples.

Following the [[Battle of Crete|conquest of Crete]], all of Greece was occupied by June 1941. The occupation in the mainland lasted until Germany and its ally [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] were forced to withdraw under Allied pressure in early October 1944. However, German garrisons remained in control of [[Crete]] and some other [[Aegean islands]] until after the end of [[World War II]] in Europe, surrendering these islands in May and June 1945.\n\nFascist Italy had initially declared war and invaded Greece in October 1940, but the [[Hellenic Army]] initially managed to push back the invading forces into neighboring [[Albania]], then an [[Albania under Italy|Italian protectorate]]. Nazi Germany intervened on its ally's behalf in southern Europe. While most of the Hellenic Army was dislocated on the Albanian front to fend off the relentless Italian counter-attacks, a rapid German ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' [[Battle of Greece|campaign]] commenced in April 1941, and by June (with the [[Battle of Crete|conquest of Crete]]) Greece was defeated and occupied. The Greek government [[Greek government in exile|went into exile]], and an [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Axis collaborationist]] [[Hellenic State (1941\u201344)|puppet government]] was established in the country. Furthermore, Greece's territory was divided into occupation zones run by the Axis powers, with the Germans proceeding to administer the most important regions of the country themselves, including [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]] and the strategic [[Aegean Islands]]. Other regions of the country were given to Germany's partners, Italy and Bulgaria.\n\nThe occupation ruined the Greek economy and brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population.<ref>Martin Seckendorf; G\u00fcnter Keber; u.a.; Bundesarchiv (Hrsg.): ''Die Okkupationspolitik des deutschen Faschismus in Jugoslawien, Griechenland, Albanien, Italien und Ungarn (1941\u20131945)'' H\u00fcthig, Berlin 1992; Decker/ M\u00fcller, Heidelberg 2000.

The Italians did not deport Jews living in territory they controlled, but when the Germans took over, Jews living there were also deported.\n\nAt the same time the [[Greek Resistance]] was formed. These resistance groups launched [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla attacks]] against the occupying powers, fought against the collaborationist [[Security Battalions]], and set up large espionage networks. By late 1943 the resistance groups began to fight amongst themselves. When liberation of the mainland came in October 1944, Greece was in a state of extreme political polarization, which soon led to the outbreak of the [[Greek Civil War]]. The subsequent civil war gave the opportunity to many prominent Nazi collaborators not only to escape punishment (because of their [[anti-communism]]), but to eventually become the ruling class of postwar Greece, after the [[Communism|communist]] defeat.<ref>Giannis Katris, The Birth of Neofascism in Greece, 1971</ref><ref>Andreas Papandreou, Democracy at Gunpoint (\u0397 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1)</ref>\n\nThe [[Greek Resistance]] killed 21,087 Axis soldiers (17,536 Germans, 2,739 Italians, 1,532 Bulgarians) and captured 6,463 (2,102 Germans, 2,109 Italians, 2,252 Bulgarians), for the death of 20,650 Greek partisans and an unknown number captured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.distomo-griechenland.de/pdf-dateien/mavri_vivlos_katochis.pdf |title=Council for Reparations from Germany, ''Black Book of the Occupation'' (in Greek and German), Athens 2006, p. 125-126 |accessdate=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331132014/http://www.distomo-griechenland.de/pdf-dateien/mavri_vivlos_katochis.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Fall of Greece ==\n{{See also|Greco-Italian War|Battle of Greece|Battle of Crete|Military history of Greece during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-163-0319-07A, Griechenland, Artilleriestellung auf freiem Feld.jpg|thumb|German artillery shelling the [[Metaxas Line]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-164-0357-29A, Athen, Einmarsch deutscher Truppen.jpg|thumb|German soldiers in [[Athens]], 1941]]\nIn the early morning hours of 28 October 1940, Italian Ambassador Emmanuel Grazzi awoke Greek Premier [[Ioannis Metaxas]] and presented him an [[ultimatum]]. Metaxas rejected the ultimatum and Italian forces [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greek territory]] from Italian-occupied [[Albania]] less than three hours later. (The anniversary of Greece's refusal is now a [[Ohi Day|public holiday]] in Greece.) Italian Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]] launched the invasion partly to prove that Italians could match the military successes of the German Army and partly because Mussolini regarded southeastern Europe as lying within Italy's sphere of influence.\n\nThe Hellenic Army proved to be a formidable opponent, and successfully exploited the mountainous terrain of Epirus. The Hellenic forces counterattacked and forced the Italians to retreat. By mid-December, the Greeks had occupied nearly one-quarter of Albania, before Italian reinforcements and the harsh winter stemmed the Greek advance. In March 1941, a [[Italian Spring Offensive|major Italian counterattack]] failed. The initial Greek defeat of the Italian invasion is considered the first Allied land victory of the Second World War, although due to German intervention, it eventually resulted in a victory for the Axis. Fifteen of the 21 Greek divisions were deployed against the Italians, so only six divisions were facing the attack from German troops in the ''Metaxas Line'' (near the border between Greece and Yugoslavia/Bulgaria) during the first days of April. Greece received help from [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] troops, moved from [[Libya]] on the orders of [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nOn 6 April 1941, Germany came to the aid of Italy and [[Battle of Greece|invaded Greece]] through [[Bulgaria]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. Greek and British Commonwealth troops fought back but were overwhelmed. On 20 April, after Greek resistance in the north had ceased, the [[Bulgarian Army]] entered Greek [[Thrace]], without having fired a shot,<ref>K.Svolopoulos, Greek Foreign Policy 1945\u20131981</ref> with the goal of regaining its [[Aegean Sea]] outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the [[Strymon River]] and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the [[Evros River]]. The Greek capital [[Athens]] fell on 27 April, and by 1 June, after the [[Battle of Crete|capture of Crete]], all of Greece was under Axis occupation.\nAfter the invasion King [[George II of Greece|George II]] fled, first to Crete and then to Cairo. A nominally Greek right-wing government ruled from Athens, but it was a [[puppet government|puppet]] of the occupiers.<ref>Bamberry, Chris, The Second World War: A Marxist History, 2014, Pluto Press (pg. 182)</ref>\n\n== The Triple Occupation ==\nThe occupation of Greece was divided among Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. German forces occupied the most strategically important areas, namely Athens, [[Thessaloniki]] with [[Central Macedonia]] and several [[Aegean Islands]], including most of Crete. Initially, the German zone was ruled by the ambassador [[G\u00fcnther Altenburg]] of the German Foreign Office and Field Marshal [[Wilhelm List]]. From 1942 onwards, the German occupation zone was ruled by the duumvirate of the plenipotentiary for South-Eastern Europe, [[Hermann Neubacher]], and Field Marshal [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]].<ref>Mazower, Mark ''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941\u201344'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001 page 222.</ref> In September\u2013October 1943, [[J\u00fcrgen Stroop]], the newly appointed Higher SS Police Leader, tried to challenge the Neubacher-L\u00f6hr duumvirate and was swiftly fired after less than a month on the job.

The remaining two-thirds of Greece was occupied by Italy, with the [[Ionian Islands]] directly administered as Italian territories.

Because the outflows of raw materials and products from Greece towards Germany weren't offset by German payments, substantial imbalances accrued in the settlement accounts at the Greek National Bank. In October 1942 the trading company [[DEGRIGES]] was founded, two months later, the Greek collaboration government was forced to agree to treat the balance as a loan without interest that was to be repaid once the war was over. At the end of the war, this forced loan amounted to 476 million Reichsmark (equivalent to {{Inflation|DE|0.476|1945}} billion {{Inflation-year|DE}} euros).<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |title=Drucksache 17/709, Entsch\u00e4digungs-, Schadensersatz- und Reparationsforderungen wegen NS-Unrechts in Griechenland, Italien und anderen ehemals von Deutschland besetzten Staaten |url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/007/1700709.pdf }}</ref>\n\nHitler's policy toward the economy of occupied Greece was termed ''Vergeltungsmassnahme'', or, roughly, \"retaliation measures\", the \"retaliation\" being for Greece having chosen the wrong side; it was additionally motivated by a desire to \"pluck out the best fruit\" to plunder before the Italians could get it. Groups of economic advisers, businessmen, engineers and factory managers came from Germany with the task of seizing anything they deemed of economic value, with both the Economic Ministry and the Foreign Office involved in the operation; these men were not only in competition with the Italians to plunder the country, but also with each other. The primary occupation, however, was finding as much food as possible to sustain the German army.<ref>Glenny, Misha. ''The Balkans''. Pages 478-480</ref> The occupying powers' requisitions and outright plunder, the drop in agricultural production from wartime disruption, the breakdown of the country's distribution networks due to a combination damage to infrastructure, the collapse of the central government and the fragmentation of the country at the hands of the Axis, coupled with hoarding by farmers, led to a severe shortage of food in the major urban centres in the winter of 1941\u201342. Given that even in peacetime, Greece was dependent on imports of wheat to cover about a third of its annual needs, the Allied blockade of German-dominated Europe further exacerbated the situation, creating the conditions for the \"Great Famine\" (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2): in the greater [[Athens]]\u2013[[Piraeus]] area alone, some 40,000 people died of starvation, and by the end of the Occupation \"it was estimated that the total population of Greece [...] was 300,000 less than it should have been because of famine or malnutrition\" (P. Voglis).<ref>Voglis (2006), pp. 22\u201324, 30ff.</ref>\n\nAid came at first from neutral countries like [[Sweden]] and [[Turkey]] (see [[SS Kurtulu\u015f|SS ''Kurtulu\u015f'']]), but the overwhelming majority of food ended up in the hands of the government officials and black market traders who used their connection to the Axis authorities to \"buy\" the aid from them and then sell it on to the desperate population at enormously inflated prices. The great suffering and the pressure of the exiled Greek government eventually forced the British to partially lift the blockade, and from the summer of 1942 Canadian wheat began to be distributed under the auspices of the [[International Red Cross]]. Of the country's 7.3&nbsp;million inhabitants in 1941, it is estimated that fully 2.5&nbsp;million were recipients of this aid, of whom half lived in Athens, i.e. practically the total number of the capital's population.<ref>Mazower (1995), pp. 44-48</ref><ref>Voglis (2006), p. 24</ref> Although this aid alleviated the threat of starvation in the cities, little of it reached the countryside, which experienced its own period of famine in 1943\u201344. The rise of the armed Resistance resulted in major anti-partisan campaigns across the countryside by the Axis, which led to the wholesale burning of villages, destruction of fields, or mass executions as reprisals for guerrilla attacks. As P. Voglis writes, the German sweeps \"[turned] producing areas into burned fields and pillaged villages, and the wealthy provincial towns into refugee settlements\".<ref>Voglis (2006), pp. 35\u201338</ref>\n\n=== The Italian occupation zone ===\n[[File:DOMENIKO-1943.jpg|thumb|Dead civilians after the [[Domenikon massacre]]]]\n\nThe Italians occupied the bulk of the Greek mainland and most of the islands. Although several proposals for territorial annexation had been put forward in [[Rome]], none were actually carried out during the war. This was due to pressure from the King of Italy, [[Victor Emmanuel III]], and from the Germans, who were concerned of further alienating the Greek population, which was already strongly opposing the Bulgarian annexations. Moreover, much of this proposed \"new Roman empire\" in Greece consisted of poor rural areas. Such goals made little strategic or political sense.<ref name=Mazower22/> Nevertheless, in the Ionian Islands, long a target of Italian expansionism, and in the [[Cyclades]], the Greek civil authorities were replaced by Italians in preparation for a post-war annexation. However, no formal announcement of annexation was ever made, and these islands remained in communication with Athens.<ref name=Mazower22>Mazower, 1993, p. 22</ref>\n\n[[File:Isole-jonie.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Italian stamp in [[Heptanese]], overprinted with ''{{lang|it|Isole Jonie}}'']]\n\nItalian policy promised that the region of [[Chameria]] ([[Thesprotia]] and [[Preveza]]) in northwestern Greece, would be [[Greater Albania#World War II|awarded to Albania]] after the end of the war.<ref>[[#Meyer|Meyer 2008]]: 151, 464</ref> As such a local administration ([[K\u00ebshilla]]) was installed and armed groups were formed among members of the local [[Cham Albanian]] community.<ref>Kretsi p. 177</ref> In the beginning, at least, collaboration was not a one-shot choice; Muslim communities followed different politics as per circumstances, alternating between collaboration, neutrality and, less frequently, resistance.

Their History and Crimes]</ref> However, the war crimes remained unpunished since the criminals had already fled abroad.\n\nA part of the Vlach population in the Pindus mountains and Western Macedonia also collaborated for a variety of reasons. Italian occupation forces were welcomed in some Vlach villages as liberators, and Vlachs offered their services as guides or interpreters in exchange for favors. Under [[Alcibiades Diamandi]], the pro-Italian [[Principality of the Pindus]] was declared, and 2000 locals joined Diamantis' ''Roman Legion'', while [[Nicolaos Matussis]] had his own band of Vlach followers which carried out raids at the service of Italian service departments. Most local Vlachs were not converted to Diamantis' vision of a Vlach state in the Pindus and most remained loyal to the Greek nation, but some collaborated nevertheless because of latent pro-Romanian feelings, or anger toward the Greek government or its military authorities. The Legion collapsed in 1942 with the departure of the Italians, and most of its leaders fled into Romania or Greek cities. Most active members were convicted as war criminals in absentia, but in the course of the Greek Civil War in many cases their actions were forgotten, and many actively fought for the government against the communist guerrillas.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ioannis Kolioupoulos|chapter= XIV.

Furthermore, unlike the Germans, and aside from some local commanders, the Italian military protected the Jews in their zone. The Germans were purportedly perturbed as the Italians not only protected Jews on their territory, but in parts of occupied France, Greece, the Balkans, and elsewhere, where they protected local Jewish populations also. On 13 December 1942, Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, wrote in his diary, ''\"The Italians are extremely lax in the treatment of the Jews. They protect the Italian Jews both in [[Tunis]] and in occupied France and will not permit their being drafted for work or compelled to wear the Star of David. This shows once again that Fascism does not really dare to get down to fundamentals but is very superficial regarding problems of vital importance.\"''<ref>Brownfeld (2003)</ref>\n\nSignificant mass reprisals did sometimes occur, such as the [[Domenikon massacre]] in which 150 Greek civilians were killed. As they controlled most of the countryside, the Italians were the first to face the rising resistance movement in 1942\u201343. By mid-1943, the Resistance had managed to expel a few Italian garrisons from some mountainous areas, including several towns, creating liberated zones (\"Free Greece\"). After the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian armistice]] in September 1943, the Italian zone was taken over by the Germans. As a result, German anti-partisan and anti-Semitic policies were extended to it.\n\n=== The Bulgarian occupation zone ===\n[[File:Bulgarians 1941.jpg|thumb|250px|Bulgarian troops entering a village in northern Greece in April 1941]]\n[[File:Drama-uprising-monument.jpg|thumb|Monument to the victims of the [[Drama Uprising|Drama atrocities]]]]\n\nThe Bulgarian Army entered Greece on 20 April 1941 on the heels of the Wehrmacht without having fired a shot. The Bulgarian occupation zone included the northeastern corner of the Greek mainland and the islands of [[Thasos]] and [[Samothrace]] i.e. the present-day region of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]], except for the [[Evros prefecture]], (at the Greek-Turkish border) which, because of its strategic value, was retained by the Germans, despite Bulgarian protests.<ref>Shrader, ,1999, p. 33-34</ref> Unlike Germany and Italy, Bulgaria officially annexed the occupied territories, which had long been a target of Bulgarian nationalism.<ref name=MazowerB276A>Mazower (2000), p. 276</ref> East Macedonia and Thrace was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1913, when it became part of Bulgaria, following the Balkan Wars.

Forced labour was introduced, and the authorities confiscated the estates of Greek landowners and gave their land to Bulgarian peasants (many of them brought from Bulgaria as settlers).<ref name=\"Miller127\" />\n\nThese policies led to an attempt to expel the Bulgarians with a spontaneous and badly organized uprising [[Drama Uprising|around Drama]] in late September 1941 (primarily guided by the [[Communist Party of Greece]]) which, however, was suppressed by the Bulgarian Army, and massive reprisals against Greek civilians followed.<ref name=\"MazowerB276A\"/> By late 1941, more than 100,000 Greeks had fled from the Bulgarian occupation zone.<ref>Mazower (1995), p. 20</ref><ref>Shrader, 1999, p. 19;</ref> Bulgarian colonists were encouraged to settle in East Macedonia and Thrace by government credits and incentives, including houses and land confiscated from the natives.\n\nThe Bulgarian government's attempts to win the loyalty of the local Slavic-speaking population and recruit collaborators among them did see some success, with the Bulgarians being greeted as liberators,<ref>Loring M.

However, during the [[interwar years]], the ethnic composition of the region's population had been dramatically changed, as Greek refugees from Anatolia settled in Macedonia and Thrace following the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].

The German High Command approved the foundation of a Bulgarian military club in [[Thessaloniki]], and Bulgarian officers organized supplying of food and provisions for the Slavic-speaking population in these regions, aiming to recruit collaborators and gather intelligence on what was happening in the German- and Italian-occupied zones. In 1942, the Bulgarian club asked assistance from the High Command in organizing armed units among those populations, but the Germans were initially very suspicious.

Bulgaria withdraw from the central parts of Greek Macedonia after the pro-Soviet coup in the country [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|on 9 September 1944]]. At that time it declared war on Germany, but the Bulgarian army remained in [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]], where there were several limited attacks from withdrawing German troops in the middle of September. Bulgaria hoped to keep these territories after the war. The Soviet Union initially also believed it was possible to include at least Western Thrace in the post-war borders of Bulgaria and thereby to secure a strategic outlet to the Aegean Sea. But the United Kingdom, whose troops advanced towards Greece at the same time, stated that the withdrawal of Bulgarian troops from all occupied territories was a precondition for a ceasefire agreement with Bulgaria. As result on 10 October, the Bulgarian army and administration began evacuating and after two weeks withdrew from the area.

Active Greek resistance started immediately as many Greeks fled to the hills, where a partisan movement was born. One of the most touching episodes of the early resistance is said to have taken place just after the Wehrmacht reached the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] on 27 April. The Germans ordered the flag guard, [[Evzones|Evzone]] [[Konstandinos Koukidis]], to retire the Greek flag. The Greek soldier obeyed, but when he was done, he wrapped himself in the flag and threw himself off the plateau where he died. Some days later, when the [[Reichskriegsflagge]] was waving on the Acropolis' uppermost spot, two Athenian youngsters, [[Manolis Glezos]] and [[Apostolos Santas]], climbed by night on the Acropolis and tore down the flag.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10622146353071804867804581081962782924634 |title=How Greece Got to 'No' |author=Christopher Bakken |date=6 July 2015 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\nThe first signs of armed resistance activity manifested themselves in northern Greece, where resentment at the Bulgarian annexations ran high, in early autumn 1941. The Germans responded swiftly, torching several villages and executing 488 civilians. The brutality of these reprisals led to a collapse of the early guerrilla movement. It was revived in 1942 at a much greater scale.<ref>Knopp (2009), p. 192</ref> The first event that signaled the beginning of organized, armed opposition to the occupation forces occurred in September 1942 when the Greek Fascist Party (EEE) Club in downtown Athens was blown up by the [[Panhellenic Union of Fighting Youths]] (PEAN), a right-wing Greek resistance organization.<ref>Mazower, 1995, p. 22</ref> Attacks on Axis personnel became more frequent from that month.<ref name=Mazower135 />\n\nIn 25 November, the resistance together with the British mission managed an [[Operation Harling|enormous explosion]] in the [[Gorgopotamos]] viaduct, Central Greece, thus disrupting the flow of Axis supplies to the [[North African Campaign|North African front]].<ref name=Mazower135>Mazower, 1995, p. 135</ref> By March\u2013April the [[andartes]] were launching direct attacks on Italian guard-posts and barracks, while on 16 April, an Italian report noted that \"control through out the north-east, centre and south-west of Greece remains very precarious, not to say nonexistent\".<ref name=Mazower135 />\n\n=== Major resistance groups ===\n[[image:\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u0391\u039c-\u0395\u039b\u0391\u03a3.jpg|thumb|ELAS fighters in mountainous Greece]]\nOn 27 September 1941, the [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM) was established. It was nominally a \"[[popular front]]\" organization composed of a coalition of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) and five other left-wing parties. EAM was virtually controlled by the KKE, although initially, the secretive and generally unpopular Communist party was successful in concealing this fact.<ref name=Mazower23 /> By September 1943, the reorganization of ELAS bands along conventional lines had been completed, and ELAS strength was about 15,000 fighters with additionally 20,000 reserves.<ref name=\"Shrader35B\"/> The military wing of EAM was the [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS). Its first guerrilla band had been formed in Central Greece, under the leadership of [[Aris Velouchiotis]], an announced Communist.<ref>Mazower, 1995, p. 23</ref> EAM increased in size and its central committee sought a more experienced military figure to take command.

EDES was formed on 9 September 1941 and was at the beginning thoroughly republican and anti-monarchist, but also attracted a few monarchists and other right-wing supporters. The British were instrumental in the development of EDES hoping it would become a counterweight to ELAS.<ref>Shrader, 1999, p. 30</ref> Throughout the occupation period Zervas did not attempt to change his doctrine and EDES remained clearly a guerrilla force.<ref name=Shrader31 /> Its main theatre of operation was Epirus. Due to the fact that it was a particularly poor district most of the logistical support was provided by the British. When EDES was finally disbanded at the fall of 1944, it had about 12,000 fighters, in addition to 5,000 reserves.<ref name=Shrader31>Shrader, 1999, p. 31</ref> Another armed resistance group was the [[National and Social Liberation]] (EKKA), led by Colonel [[Dimitrios Psarros]].

There their propaganda was not as effective, as the ancient [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] Jewish communities were well-integrated into the Orthodox Greek society and could not easily be singled out from the Christians, who in turn were more ready to resist the German authorities' demands. The Archbishop of Athens [[Archbishop Damaskinos|Damaskinos]] ordered his priests to ask their congregations to help the Jews and sent a strong-worded letter of protest to the collaborationist authorities and the Germans. Many [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] Christians risked their lives hiding Jews in their apartments and homes, despite the threat of imprisonment. Even the Greek [[police]] ignored instructions to turn over Jews to the Germans. When Jewish community leaders appealed to Prime Minister [[Ioannis Rallis]], he tried to alleviate their fears by saying that the Jews of Thessaloniki had been guilty of subversive activities and that this was the reason they were deported.\n\nAt the same time, Elias Barzilai, the Grand Rabbi of Athens, was summoned to the Department of Jewish Affairs and told to submit a list of names and addresses of members of the Jewish community. Instead, he destroyed the community records, thus saving the lives of thousands of Athenian Jews. He advised the Jews of Athens to flee or go into hiding. A few days later, the Rabbi himself was spirited out of the city by EAM-ELAS fighters and joined the resistance. EAM-ELAS helped hundreds of Jews escape and survive (especially officer [[Stefanos Sarafis]]), many of whom stayed with the resistance as fighters and/or [[Language interpretation|interpreters]].\n\n=== In the Bulgarian zone ===\n{{expand section|date=August 2018}}\nIn March 1943 the vast majority of the Jewish population, 4,058 of the 4,273 was rounded up and sent to local warehouses by the Bulgarian occupation authorities.

[[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131204 AD) observed: \"The basic symptoms that occur in pneumonia and that are never lacking are as follows: acute fever, sticking [[pleuritic]] pain in the side, short rapid breaths, serrated [[pulse]] and cough.\"<ref name=maimo>Maimonides, ''Fusul Musa'' (\"''Pirkei Moshe''\").</ref> This clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks, and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the [[Middle Ages]] into the 19th century.\n\n[[Edwin Klebs]] was the first to observe bacteria in the airways of persons having died of pneumonia in 1875.<ref name=klebs>{{cite journal |author=Klebs E |title=''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss der pathogenen Schistomyceten''.

The method provides an easy way to determine the real option value of a project simply by using the average of positive outcomes for the project. The method can be understood as an extension of the [[net present value]] (NPV) multi-scenario [[Monte Carlo model]] with an adjustment for [[risk aversion]] and economic decision-making. The method uses information that arises naturally in a standard [[discounted cash flow]] (DCF), or [[Net present value|NPV]], project financial valuation.  It was created in 2000 by Vinay Datar, professor at [[Seattle University]]; and Scott H. Mathews, [[Boeing Technical Fellowship|Technical Fellow]] at [[The Boeing Company]].\n\n== Method ==\n[[File:Datar_Mathews_Real_Option_Method_Wikipedia_Fig_1_Typical_Project_Cash_Flow_with_Uncertainty.jpg|right|thumb|Fig. 1 Typical project cash flow with uncertainty]]\nThe mathematical equation for the DM Method is shown below. The method captures the real option value by discounting the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of [[Operating profit|operating profits]] at ''R'', the market risk rate, and discounting the distribution of the discretionary investment at ''r'', risk-free rate, ''before'' the expected payoff is calculated.  The option value is then the expected value of the maximum of the difference between the two discounted distributions or zero. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nugroho |first1=Lukito Adi |last2=McMillan |first2=David |title=Real options valuation of franchise territorial exclusivity |journal=Cogent Business & Management |date=28 April 2017 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=4\u20135 |doi=10.1080/23311975.2016.1262490}}</ref><ref> {{cite conference |url=http://realoptions.org/papers2010/106.pdf |title=Reconciling Real Option Models: An Approach to Incorporate Market and Private Uncertainties |last1= Barton|first1=Kelsey |author-link1= |last2=Lawryshyn |first2=Yuri |author-link2= |date=2010-06-17 |pages= |location=Rome, Italy |conference=Real Options: Theory Meets Practice - 14th Annual International Conference}} </ref>Fig. 1.\n\n: <math>C_0 = \\mathbf {E_0}\\left[\\max\\left(\\tilde S_Te^{-Rt}-\\tilde X_Te^{-rt},0\\right)\\right]</math>\n\n* <math>\\tilde S_T</math> is a [[random variable]] representing the future benefits, or operating profits at time ''T''.

If  ''R'' < ''r'', then the option will be risk-seeking. If ''R'' = ''r'', then this is termed a [[risk-neutral]] option, and has parallels with NPV-type analyses with decision-making, such as [[Decision tree|decision trees]].  The DM Method gives the same results as the [[Black\u2013Scholes]] and the [[Binomial options pricing model|binomial lattice]] option models, provided the same inputs and the discount methods are used. This non-traded real option value therefore is dependent on the risk perception of the evaluator toward a market asset relative to a privately held investment asset.\n\nThe DM Method is advantageous for use in real option applications because unlike some other option models it does not require a value for ''sigma'' (a measure of uncertainty) or for ''S<sub>0</sub>'' (the value of the project today), both of which are difficult to derive for new product development projects; see [[Real options valuation#Technical considerations|further]] under [[real options valuation]].

A lognormal distribution is a close approximation to the distribution of traded financial asset returns. In contrast, real option valuation is based on a projection of a project\u2019s future values at time ''T<sub>T</sub>'', which may or may not be lognormally distributed.

However, several simplifications can ease that burden and provide clarity without sacrificing the soundness of the option calculation. One simplification is the employment of the [[standard normal distribution]], also known as the Z-distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is common practice to convert a normal distribution to a standard normal and then use the [[standard normal table]] to find the value of probabilities.\n\nDefine as the standard normal variable: <math>Z=\\tfrac{\\left(\\ln X_0-\\mu\\right)}{\\sigma}.</math>\n\nThe conditional expectation of the discounted value outcome is:  \n:<math>S_0\\left[\\tfrac{ N\\left(\\sigma-Z\\right)}{ N\\left(-Z\\right)}\\right].</math>\n\nThen probability of the project being in the money and launched (\u201cexercised\u201d) is: <math> N\\left(-Z\\right).</math>\n\nThe option value simplifies to:\n:<math>C_0=\\left \\{S_0\\left[\\tfrac{ N\\left(\\sigma-Z\\right)}{ N\\left(-Z\\right)}\\right]-X_0\\right\\} N\\left(-Z\\right)=S_0 N\\left(\\sigma-Z\\right)-X_0 N\\left(-Z\\right).</math>\n\nBusinesses that collect historical data may be able to leverage the similarity of assumptions across related projects facilitating the calculation of option values. One resulting simplification is the ''Uncertainty Ratio'', <math>\\textstyle UR=(SD/S)</math>, which can often be modeled as a constant for similar projects. ''UR'' is the degree of certainty by which the projected future cash flows can be estimated. ''UR'' is invariant of time <math>\\textstyle\\left(\\tfrac{SD_T}{S_T}=\\tfrac{SD_0}{S_0}\\right)</math> with values typically between 0.35 and 1.0 for many multi-year business projects.\n\n[[File:Option_value_v_S0-X0_-_UR_constant.png|thumb|'''Fig. 6 Option value (C<sub>0</sub>) vs S<sub>0</sub>/X<sub>0</sub> - UR constant'''|alt=|300x300px]]\n\nApplying this observation as a constant, ''K'', to the above formulas results in a simpler formulation:\n:<math>\\text {Define }K=\\sigma =\\sqrt \\left [\\ln (1+UR^2) \\right ]\\text {, and }\\mu = \\ln S_0-0.5\\mu ^2=\\ln S_0-0.5K^2.</math>\n\n:<math>Z=\\frac {(\\ln X_0-\\mu)}{\\sigma}=\\tfrac {\\ln \\left (\\tfrac {X_0}{S_0}\\right )}{K}+0.5K\\text {, and } -Z=\\tfrac {\\ln \\left (\\tfrac {S_0}{X_0}\\right )}{K}-0.5K.</math>\n\nThe resulting real option value can be derived simply on a hand-held calculator once K is determined:\n:<math>C_0=S_0 N\\left (\\sigma-Z\\right )-X_0 N\\left (-Z\\right )= S_0 N\\left (K-Z\\right )-X_0 N\\left (-Z\\right ).</math>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

Corporate sales analytics estimated with 95% certainty (double-sided 1-in-10 chance) the revenues could be as low as $4M or as high as $34M. (Fig. 8) Because of the large potential upside, the manager believes a small initial investment might resolve the project's downside uncertainties and reveal its potential value.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sadowsky |first1=Jeffery R. |title=The Value of Learning in the Product Development Stage: A Real Options Approach |journal=SSRN |date=May 10, 2005 |page=9 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.721597 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b8b38b0c2b2151387d003a020c4d59214cbc95f7 }}</ref> [[File:Range Option showing triangular distribution V2.png|alt=|thumb|250x250px|'''Fig. 8 DM Range Option with triangular distribution.

Furthermore, there is a probability of one-in-four {25% \u2248 ($34M - $20M)<sup>2</sup> /[ ($34M - $4M)($34M-$8.5M)]} that the project revenues will be greater than $20M. With these calculations, the manager estimates the innovation project option value is $1.25M [= ($25M-$20M) * 25%]. Using this value, the manager justifies this initial investment (about 6% of the capital cost) into the project, sufficient to resolve some of the key uncertainties. The project can always be abandoned should the intermediate development results not measure up, but the investment losses will be minimized. (Later using corporate historical data patterns, an analyst converted the values from a three-point estimate to a DM Option calculation, and demonstrated that the result would differ by less than 10%.)\n|}\n\nFor a triangular distribution, sometimes referred to as [[three-point_estimation]], the mode value corresponds to the \u201cmost-likely\u201d scenario, and the other two other scenarios, \u201cpessimistic\u201d and \u201coptimistic\u201d, represent plausible deviations from the most-likely scenario (often modeled as approximating a two-sided 1-out-of-10 likelihood or 95% confidence).<ref>{{Cite book |chapter=Valuing High-Risk High-Return technology Projects Using Real Options |title=The Handbook of Technology Management: Core Concepts, Financial Tools and Techniques, Operations and Innovation Management |last=Mathews |first=Scott |publisher=Wiley |year=2010 |isbn=978-0470249475 |editor-last=Bidgoli |editor-first=Hossein |volume=1 |location=Hoboken, NJ |pages=581\u2013600}}</ref> <ref>{{cite thesis|last=Onkham|first=Wilawan|date=2013|title=A Real Option Dynamic Decision Framework for Operational Innovations|type=PhD|page=44|publisher=University of Central Florida|docket=|oclc=|url=https://stars.library.ucf.edu/etd/2873|access-date=|degree=Doctoral}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Naedele |first1=Martin |last2=Chen |first2=Hong-Mei |last3=Kazman |first3=Rick |last4=Cai |first4=Yuanfang |last5=Xiao |first5=Lu |last6=Silva |first6=Carlos V.A. |title=Manufacturing execution systems: A vision for managing software development |journal=Journal of Systems and Software |date=March 2015 |volume=101 |pages=59\u201368 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2014.11.015}}</ref> <ref>{{cite thesis |last=Patregnani |first=Giulia |date=2014-10-13 |title=The Value of Synergies through the Real Options Lenses |type=Graduate Theses, MS in Finance and Strategic Management |pages=63\u201365 |publisher=Copenhagen School of Business  |hdl=10417/4840 }}  </ref>This range of estimates results in the eponymous name for the option, the DM Range Option. <ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=43240438 |title=Valuing Risky Projects with Real Options |volume=52 |issue=5 |date=September\u2013October 2009 |journal=Research Technology Management |last=Mathews |first=Scott |pages=32\u201341 |language=en|doi=10.1080/08956308.2009.11657587 }}</ref>The DM Range Option method is similar to the [[Fuzzy pay-off method for real option valuation|fuzzy method for real options]].

Rather, the future value outcome, ''S'', (as well as the strike price, ''X'', and the standard deviation, ''SD''), is more than likely a three-point estimation based on engineering and marketing parameters.

A lognormal distribution is a close approximation to the distribution of traded financial asset returns.

However, several simplifications can ease that burden and provide clarity without sacrificing the soundness of the option calculation. One simplification is the employment of the [[standard normal distribution]], also known as the Z-distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is common practice to convert a normal distribution to a standard normal and then use the [[standard normal table]] to find the value of probabilities.\n\nDefine as the standard normal variable: <math>Z=\\tfrac{\\left(\\ln X_0-\\mu\\right)}{\\sigma}.</math>\n\nThe conditional expectation of the discounted value outcome is:  \n:<math>S_0\\left[\\tfrac{ N\\left(\\sigma-Z\\right)}{ N\\left(-Z\\right)}\\right].</math>\n\nThen probability of the project being in the money and launched (\u201cexercised\u201d) is: <math> N\\left(-Z\\right).</math>\n\nThe option value simplifies to:\n:<math>C_0=\\left \\{S_0\\left[\\tfrac{ N\\left(\\sigma-Z\\right)}{ N\\left(-Z\\right)}\\right]-X_0\\right\\} N\\left(-Z\\right)=S_0 N\\left(\\sigma-Z\\right)-X_0 N\\left(-Z\\right).</math>\n\nBusinesses that collect historical data may be able to leverage the similarity of assumptions across related projects facilitating the calculation of option values. One resulting simplification is the ''Uncertainty Ratio'', <math>\\textstyle UR=(SD/S)</math>, which can often be modeled as a constant for similar projects. ''UR'' is the degree of certainty by which the projected future cash flows can be estimated. ''UR'' is invariant of time <math>\\textstyle\\left(\\tfrac{SD_T}{S_T}=\\tfrac{SD_0}{S_0}\\right)</math> with values typically between 0.35 and 1.0 for many multi-year business projects.\n\n[[File:Option_value_v_S0-X0_-_UR_constant.png|thumb|'''Fig. 6 Option value (C<sub>0</sub>) vs S<sub>0</sub>/X<sub>0</sub> - UR constant'''|alt=|300x300px]]\n\nApplying this observation as a constant, ''K'', to the above formulas results in a simpler formulation:\n:<math>\\text {Define }K=\\sigma =\\sqrt \\left [\\ln (1+UR^2) \\right ]\\text {, and }\\mu = \\ln S_0-0.5\\mu ^2=\\ln S_0-0.5K^2.</math>\n\n:<math>Z=\\frac {(\\ln X_0-\\mu)}{\\sigma}=\\tfrac {\\ln \\left (\\tfrac {X_0}{S_0}\\right )}{K}+0.5K\\text {, and } -Z=\\tfrac {\\ln \\left (\\tfrac {S_0}{X_0}\\right )}{K}-0.5K.</math>\n\nThe resulting real option value can be derived simply on a hand-held calculator once K is determined:\n:<math>C_0=S_0 N\\left (\\sigma-Z\\right )-X_0 N\\left (-Z\\right )= S_0 N\\left (K-Z\\right )-X_0 N\\left (-Z\\right ).</math>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

Corporate sales analytics estimated with 95% certainty (double-sided 1-in-10 chance) the revenues could be as low as $4M or as high as $34M. (Fig. 8) Because of the large potential upside, the manager believes a small initial investment might resolve the project's downside uncertainties and reveal its potential value.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sadowsky |first1=Jeffery R. |title=The Value of Learning in the Product Development Stage: A Real Options Approach |journal=SSRN |date=May 10, 2005 |page=9 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.721597 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b8b38b0c2b2151387d003a020c4d59214cbc95f7 }}</ref> [[File:Range Option showing triangular distribution V2.png|alt=|thumb|250x250px|'''Fig. 8 DM Range Option with triangular distribution.

Furthermore, there is a probability of one-in-four {25% \u2248 ($34M - $20M)<sup>2</sup> /[ ($34M - $4M)($34M-$8.5M)]} that the project revenues will be greater than $20M. With these calculations, the manager estimates the innovation project option value is $1.25M [= ($25M-$20M) * 25%]. Using this value, the manager justifies this initial investment (about 6% of the capital cost) into the project, sufficient to resolve some of the key uncertainties. The project can always be abandoned should the intermediate development results not measure up, but the investment losses will be minimized.

This partial expectation is computed by the [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) given the probability distribution will be found at a value greater than or equal to ''X'':\n\n:<math>P(X_0|X_0\\ge x)=\\frac{\\left ( b-X_0 \\right)^2}{\\left [ \\left ( b-a \\right)\\left(b-m\\right ) \\right ]}.</math>\n\nThe DM Range Option value, or project investment, is:\n\n:<math> C_0 = \\left (MT - X_0 \\right )\\cdot P\\left (X_0 \\vert X_0 \\ge x \\right) =\\left ( MT - X_0 \\right )\\cdot \\left \\{ \\frac{\\left ( b-X_0 \\right)^2}{\\left [ \\left ( b-a \\right)\\left(b-m\\right ) \\right ]} \\right \\}. </math>\n\nThe values of the triangular distribution can be estimated to those of the logarithmic distribution by using a range within <math> \\mp 2 </math> standard deviations of its mean (\u224895% confidence) as follows:\n:<math>a = e^{\\mu-2\\sigma}\\text {, } b = e^{\\mu+2\\sigma}\\text {, and } m = e^{\\mu-\\sigma^2}.</math>\n:<math>\\text {Note (using geometric mean): }\\mu =0.5*\\ln (a+b)\\text {, }\\sigma=0.25*\\ln (b/a)\\text {, and } UR= \\sqrt {e^ {\\sigma^2} -1}.</math>\n\nUse of a DM Range Option facilitates the application of real option valuation to future project investments. The DM Range Option provides an estimate of valuation that differs marginally with that of the DM Option algebraic lognormal distribution form. However, the projected future value outcome, ''S'', of a project is rarely based on a lognormal distribution derived from historical asset returns, as is a financial option. Rather, the future value outcome, ''S'', (as well as the strike price, ''X'', and the standard deviation, ''SD''), is more than likely a three-point estimation based on engineering and marketing parameters. Therefore, the ease of application of the DM Range Option is often justified by its [[Monte Carlo methods in finance#Level of complexity|expediency]] and is sufficient to estimate the conditional value of a future project.\n\n<br />\n\n== Comparison to other methods ==\nIn a 2016 article in the ''[[Advances in Decision Sciences]]'' journal, researchers from the [[Lappeenranta University of Technology]] School of Business and Management compared the DM Method to the [[fuzzy pay-off method for real option valuation]] created in 2009, and noted that while the valuation results were similar , the fuzzy pay-off one was more robust in some conditions.<ref>https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ads/2016/7836784/</ref> In some comparative cases, Datar-Mathews Method has a significant advantage in that it is easier to operate and connects NPV valuation and scenario analysis with Monte Carlo simulation technique thus greatly improving intuition in the usage of real options methods in managerial decision and explain to third parties. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loukianova |first1=Anna |last2=Nikulin |first2=Egor |last3=Vedernikov |first3=Andrey |title=Valuing synergies in strategic mergers and acquisitions using the real options approach |journal=Investment Management and Financial Innovations |date=12 May 2017 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=236\u2013247 |doi=10.21511/imfi.14(1-1).2017.10}}</ref> Through its simulation interface, the Datar-Mathews Method easily accommodates multiple and sometimes correlated cash flow scenarios, including dynamic programming, typical of complex projects, such as aerospace, that are difficult to model using fuzzy sets. <ref>{{cite thesis |last=Schachter |first=Jonathan A.

Continuing northeast, the tornado rolled a mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. One fatality and one serious injury occurred in the county. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted.

Continuing northeast, the tornado rolled a mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. One fatality and one serious injury occurred in the county. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted.

After an EF2 tornado lifted far south-west of Bassfield, another intensified, as it approached the town and a tornado emergency was issued, the first of many across the area. Here major damage was reported as an intense velocity couplet developed on radar and debris was shown to be lofted {{convert|20,000|ft|km|abbr=on}} high, with a photo being carried 121 miles downstream into [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]. The tornado continued into [[Seminary, Mississippi|Seminary]], [[Soso, Mississippi|Soso]], and [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]] where tornado emergencies were issued as well, and major damage was reported and homes were levelled, including one that had its plumbing fixtures ripped out, indicative of very intense winds. The [[SPC]] issued a mesoscale discussion stating that a tornado with winds of 170-205 mph was likely ongoing, and that it was an 'exceptionally rare event'. This tornado had a maximum width of at least 2 miles,a path length of 68 miles and received a preliminary rating of EF4 with winds of 170mph from a small section of its track.\n===Salem - Bassfield=== \nThe second supercell then developed another violent tornado, this time developing in [[Walthall County]]. The tornado quickly strengthened to an EF2, where it snapped numerous trees and grew in width. The tornado then reached EF4 strength as it approached James Ratcliffe rd. where 2 frame homes where leveled, one reduced to a slab, and a large tree was uprooted and tossed several metres. Here debris was also lofted {{convert|20,000|ft|km|abbr=on}} high.

{"title_page": "Fire safe councils", "text_new": "'''Fire safe councils''' are [[grassroots]] community-based organizations which share the objective of making [[California's]] communities less vulnerable to catastrophic [[wildfire]].  Fire safe councils accomplish this objective through education programs and projects such as shaded fuel breaks or [[firebreak]]s to protect area residents against an oncoming wildfire and to provide fire fighters with a place to fight the oncoming fire.  The first fire safe councils started in the early 1990s, and there are now over 100 around the state.)[[Image:Idealized County-Wide Local Fire Safe Council.jpg|right|600px|An idealized county-wide fire safe council]]\n\n(An exception to the grassroots formation is the [[California Fire Safe Council]], Inc. (CFSCI).  Since its incorporation in mid-2002, the primary role of the CFSCI has been to operate the [[Fire Safe California Grants Clearinghouse]] (now called simply the \"Grants Clearinghouse\"). Thus, in the rest of this article the true grassroots fire safe councils are referred to as \"local fire safe councils\" (FSCs) in order to distinguish them from the CFSCI.)\n\nLocal fire safe councils usually include representatives from:\n*Fire agencies, including the [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]] (CDF or CAL FIRE), the [[US Forest Service]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]], and/or local fire protection districts as appropriate\n*Local governments, such as city and/or county\n*Businesses, especially insurance\n*Other agencies, such as [http://www.carcd.org/ Resource Conservation Districts]\n*The public\n\nThe fire agency and local government representatives may be members of the FSC, or may serve in an advisory capacity, depending on local needs.\n\nAll local fire safe councils are independent entities.  Some are organized as [[non-profit]] 501(c)(3) corporations; others operate under a [[memorandum of understanding]] with a county, city, and/or local fire protection district; some have no formal structure at all.\n\nFire safe councils vary in focus.  Some are county-wide, while others comprise only the [[Homeowner's Association]] in a subdivision, to all sizes in between.  There are also several regional associations of fire safe councils.\n\nWhile some fire safe councils have paid staff, such as an Executive Director, and may have grant funding for fuel reduction projects, all FSCs rely heavily on volunteers for much of their work.\n\nThe community-based approach to reducing wildfire risk is being implemented in other locations in the [[United States]]. An example is [http://www.firesafemt.org FireSafe Montana].  [https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Wildfire/Firewise-USA Firewise USA] Communities are also community-based organizations focused on wildfire mitigation throughout the US, including California.\n\n==Evolution ==\n\n===The \u201cFire Safe\u201d concept===\n\nThe ''Operation Fire Safe'' wildfire prevention program was begun in 1968<ref>''Operation Fire Safe!,'' State of California Resources Agency, Department of Conservation, Division of Forestry, 1968</ref> by the State of California Resources Agency, Department of Conservation, Division of Forestry, (CDF or CAL FIRE) in response to changing wildfire conditions resulting from more and more homes being built in rural areas that were formerly wildland.  (The term \u201cWildland Urban Interface\u201d,<ref>[http://cdfdata.fire.ca.gov/fire_er/fpp_terminology?filter=W \u201cWildland Urban Interface\u201d]</ref> or WUI, is used to describe this area.)\n\nNext, the ''Fire Safe! Inside and Out'' wildfire prevention campaign was developed in 1989 by Loren Poore, Chief of Fire Prevention with CDF.<ref>''Two Longtime CDFers Retire from Fire Prevention'', CDF Communiqu\u00e9, January/February 1994</ref>   This program created materials, including a video, a brochure, and other items, to educate homeowners about implementing fire safe practices inside and outside the home.  [[Defensible space (fire control)|Defensible space]] began to become the catchword for protecting homes and wildlands in the WUI.  At this time, most wildfire safety education was conducted by members of the CDF Volunteers in Prevention (VIP) program.<ref name=\"Wilson\">[http://www.fire-lookouts.org/cali/miami_mtn/flamstat.htm ''California--The Flammable State''], Richard A. Wilson, Director of CDF, CDF Comment, July 1994, retrieved on March 18, 2008</ref>\n\nThe [[Oakland Firestorm of 1991]] provided a new incentive to increase wildfire prevention education and activities, and CDF formed the Fire Safe Advisory Council, AKA the Fire Safe Council, which included insurance industry representatives, wildland firefighting agencies (such as the [[U.S. Forest Service]] (USFS) and the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM)), private industry, and the public.\n\n===The first fire safe councils===\nIn the early 1990s, three organizations were formed that were precursors of what eventually became known as local, community-based Fire Safe Councils:\n*The Oakhurst Fire Safe Program, located in the central Sierra foothills, was formed as a joint effort by CDF and the [[US Forest Service]], [[National Park Service]], local agencies, community groups, and businesses seeking to formalize a cooperative fire prevention relationship.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> This program has evolved into the present-day [http://www.mariposafiresafe.org/ Mariposa County Fire Safe Council].\n*The Fire Safe Committee of San Mateo County (now [https://www.firesafesanmateo.org/ Fire Safe San Mateo County]) was formed by the local community.<ref>[http://www.canonbal.org/chronoset.html ''200 Years of History Uninterrupted By Progress''], Steve Kennedy, The Cannonball Express, retrieved on March 18, 2008</ref>\n*[http://www.firesafemarin.org/ Fire Safe Marin] in [[Marin County]] was formed by the local community in 1992 and remains active today. <ref>[https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/management/upload/firemanagement_fireeducation_mij_peopleparksfire_021005_p03.pdf ''FIRESafe MARIN, 1992-2002, Celebrating the Past, Preparing For the Future'', retrieved on March 18, 2008]</ref>\n\nThe 1993 Firestorm in Southern California was another major wildfire event.  Residents of the Laguna Beach area formed three committees to deal with the losses as well as to prevent, or at least reduce, future losses.<ref>[http://www.csulb.edu/~dhorne/b_C_resume.htm Personal Profile, David Horne, PhD.], retrieved on March 18, 2008</ref>  These groups evolved into the present-day [http://www.lagunacoastfiresafecouncil.org/ Greater Laguna Coast Fire Safe Council].\n\n===CDF support for fire safe councils===\nIn support of the community-based efforts, CDF began including these local groups in its Fire Safe Council.  The coalition was headed by the CDF Public Education Officer.<ref>\"California\u2019s I-Zone: Urban Wildland Fire Prevention and Mitigation\", CDF Office of the State Fire Marshal, 1996</ref>  Sometime after 1996, as more and more communities started local Fire Safe Councils throughout the state, the Fire Safe Council became known as the [[California Fire Safe Council]] (CFSC). The CFSC was a precursor of the current California Fire Safe Council, Inc. (CFSCI).\n\nThrough the CFSC, CDF provided assistance to local fire safe councils via monthly meetings where local fire safe councils, and other organizations sharing the fire safe mission, could network; marketing literature such as a brochure; development of videos and Public Service Announcements; a handbook on how to form a Fire Safe Council; and other materials.  Marketing support was provided under a contract with the public relations firm Manning Selvage & Lee, which had an office on K Street in Sacramento at the time.\n\nThis overall support from CDF ceased when the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. was formed as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation in mid-2002.  However, most individual CDF/CAL FIRE Units continue to work closely with their local area fire safe councils, often providing \"in-kind\" matching funds for grants as well as advice on fire safe projects.\n\n===The number of fire safe councils expands===\nWith active support from CDF and its California Fire Safe Council coalition, more and more communities began forming local Fire Safe Councils.  Expansion of the program accelerated after the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County (FSC/NC) received a [http://www.westernforesters.org/wui-grants Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) grant] in 1998.  One of the conditions of the WUI grant was that the Executive Director of the FSC/NC take an active role in assisting other communities to form Fire Safe Councils, and aid in their success.\n\nNow, over 100 local Fire Safe Councils are active in California alone, with more forming all the time.\n\n==Networking for fire safe councils==\nPrior to the incorporation of the CFSCI, the California Fire Safe Council was the primary means of networking for local FSCs. After incorporation, the CFSCI continued to host the monthly meetings for local FSCs until November 2006, when budget constraints would no longer allow for the expense.\n\n===Local Fire Safe Council Network Yahoo Group===\nIn order to provide a way to keep in touch, in 2006 an electronic group was set up on [[Yahoo!]] called the [https://groups.yahoo.com/group/FireSafeCouncilNetwork/ Local Fire Safe Council Network]. This group continues to provide a valuable link among local FSCs and other organizations and agencies committed to making California's communities fire safe. Membership in the group can be requested by going to the group's web site and clicking on \"Join this Group!\". Prospective members should provide an indication of their affiliation with a local FSC or other organization/agency in their request to join.\n\n==Funding==\n\n===Federal funding===\nIn California Federal funding is administered by the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. (CFSCI) which operates the [[Fire Safe California Grants Clearinghouse]] AKA Grants Clearinghouse.  Funding is provided to the Grants Clearinghouse by the [[US Forest Service]] (USFS), the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), the [[National Park Service]], and the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]]. (Note that these agencies, notably the USFS, may have other grant funding streams that do not go through the Clearinghouse.)\n\nBeginning in 2001, Title II and Title III funds from the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000 (AKA \"HR 2389\") were another source of funds for FSCs in Counties that qualify for HR 2389 payments, especially for staff, operations, and education projects, as funds from the Grants Clearinghouse are generally not available for these functions.  These funds are paid to Counties, and it was up to the Counties to decide how they are used.  In the past, many Counties used at least a portion of the funds for fire safe activities.\n\n===State funding===\nState funding varies from year to year as programs come and go. Check with your CAL FIRE Unit or County Resource Conservation District or current information.\n\nAll of the State and Federal funding sources described in this section require matching funds, either in the form of cash or \"in kind\", such as labor, materials, vehicles, etc.  While not a formal program, most CAL FIRE units provide financial assistance to their local fire safe councils in the form of \"in kind\" matching funds for grants.\n\n===Other funding sources===\nOther sources of funds for fire safe councils are donations from the community, membership dues, grants from sources other than listed here, and funding from their County and/or City government.  In addition, a percentage for administration is usually a component of any grants received, although these funds are restricted in that they can only be used an activities associated with the particular grant and must be accounted for to the funding agency.\n\n==Examples of fire safe council accomplishments==\nThis section is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give a few examples of what has been accomplished by fire safe councils over the years.  Most of these projects were funded by grants.\n\n===Special needs assistance===\nMany fire safe councils operate a program that assists people with special needs, such as seniors, low-income, and disabled persons, to create and maintain the [[defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] around their home.  Some examples are:\n*[http://www.edcfiresafe.org/programs-grants-2/free-vegetation-removal-for-seniors-or-disabled-citizens/ El Dorado County Fire Safe Council Senior Assistance]\n*[https://www.plumasfiresafe.org/senior-disabled-assistance.html Plumas County Fire Safe Council Senior & Disabled Assistance Program]\n*[http://www.areyoufiresafe.com/get-fire-help/special-needs-assistance/ Fire Safe Council of Nevada County Special Needs Assistance Program]\n\n===Free chipper program===\nOne difficulty homeowners have with creating and maintaining defensible space is what to do with the vegetation once it is removed.  To help with this, many fire safe councils provide free access to a chipper.  An example is the [http://www.krvfiresafecouncil.org/ChipperDays.htm Kern River Valley Fire Safe Council Chipper Days].\n\n===Defensible space inspection/education program===\nThe purpose of these programs is to educate homeowners as to what they need to do to create adequate defensible space and sometimes also give suggestions about modifications to make to the home itself to make it more resistant to wildfire.  These are also called \"dooryard visits\" by some fire safe councils.  These volunteers are trained by their local CAL FIRE Unit or their local Fire Protection District. For example, the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County has a [http://www.areyoufiresafe.com/get-fire-help/defensible-space-advisory-visit/ Defensible Space Advisory Visit] service.\n\n===Fuel breaks===\nWhile defensible space protects homes from wildfire, [[firebreak]]s, also called fuel breaks, protect communities.  These may also be referred to as \"shaded fuel breaks\".  Fuel breaks are usually linear.  The US Forest Service also uses the Strategically Placed Area Treatment (SPLAT) concept.  SPLATs may be any shape. Many fuel breaks have been created by fire safe councils, using grant funding.  One example is the [http://www.maderafsc.org/html/past_projects/crooks_mountain.htm Eastern Madera County Fire Safe Council Crooks Mountain Fuel Break].\n\n===Community wildfire protection plans===\nThe Federal funding sources described in the section on Funding either require that projects be part of an approved Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP), or give preference to such projects.  In response, many FSCs have taken a proactive role in getting these plans developed and approved, even though this responsibility really resides with local government.\n\n===A sampling of other projects===\n*The Greater Laguna Coast Fire Safe Council [http://www.lagunacoastfiresafecouncil.org/red_flag_program.html Red Flag Program] is designed to complement the official steps taken by the fire fighting professionals with the goal of providing a highly visible reminder to all citizens in the region to be extra careful and vigilant on the days when the Santa Ana winds blow.\n*The Fire Safe Council of Nevada County has published the [http://www.areyoufiresafe.com/files/9413/0083/2949/firewise_plant_booklet_2011_110106.pdf Fire Wise Plants for Western Nevada County], which is distributed by a local nursery, among other places.

This bill became law on August 4, 2008.\n\n==Recognition of fire safe councils==\nMany fire safe councils, as well as individual contributors, have received recognition for their efforts to improve the ability for California\u2019s communities to survive wildfire.  Since it is impossible to list all of these, the following examples are offered in honor of all who have contributed to this important effort.\n\n===National recognition===\n*In 2001, the Bronze Smokey Award was presented to the [http://www.areyoufiresafe.com/ Fire Safe Council of Nevada County] by the US Forest Service for providing outstanding public service in wildfire prevention.[https://www.fs.fed.us/sites/default/files/legacy_files/fire-management-today/62-2.pdf] The Bronze Smokey is the highest National honor given for community-based fire prevention work.\n*In 2002, the [http://www.co.yuba.ca.us/firesafe/ Yuba Watershed Protection and Fire Safe Council] received a Bronze Smokey from the USFS\n*In 2003, [[Idyllwild]]'s [http://mcfsc.org/ Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council] received a national award from the USFS in recognition of its contributions to the community over the past year.\n*In 2004, Plumas County Fire Safe Council was recognized by the US Forest Service Chief with the Rural Community Assistance National Leadership Award for, \u201cOutstanding accomplishments through their exceptional leadership, vision, and perseverance in working collaboratively to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire in Plumas County\u201d.\n*In 2005, Luana Dowling, Fire Chief for Iowa Hill and Chair of the [http://www.firesafeforesthill.org/ Foresthill/Iowa Hill Fire Safe Council], received recognition from the US Forest Service for her success in obtaining funding for, and then implementing, various fuel reduction projects on USFS and BLM land near [[Foresthill]] and [[Iowa Hill]].\n\nNumerous national recognition has been awarded since 2005.\n\n===State recognition===\n*In 2000, Laura Dyberg, President of the [http://www.mountainrimfiresafecouncil.org/ Mountain Rim Fire Safe Council] in Southern California, was named Woman of the Year for the 31st Senate District of California by Senator Jim Brulte\n*in 2007, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] included fire safe councils in his Executive Order S-07-07 as one of the resources available to CAL FIRE \u201cto support a heightened level of fire prevention public awareness and education\u201d\n*In 2008, the [[California Legislature]] enacted a joint resolution, SCR 80 (Cogdill) recognizing that \u201clocal Fire Safe Councils work to educate communities, provide wildfire safety planning, fire prevention, and educational programs throughout the state and remain a critical component of statewide fire protection efforts.\u201d [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=scr_80&sess=CUR&house=B&author=cogdill]\n\n===Local recognition===\n* In 2003, [http://www.firesafemarin.org/ Fire Safe Marin] received the Regional Excellence Award from the [[Board of Supervisors]] for its work to support fire agencies across [[Marin County]] in protecting life, property and the environment for the citizens of Marin.\n*On October 19, 2004, Robin Yonash, Founder of the Greater Colfax Area Fire Safe Council, received a commendation from the Placer County Board of Supervisors (Resolution 2004-163) for promoting fire safety throughout Placer County.[https://www.placer.ca.gov/~/media/bos/cob/documents/sumarchv/bssa_stor/bsaa_2004%20pdf.pdf?la=en]\n*In 2006, the Fallbrook Fire Safe Council was honored as the Fire Safe Council of the Year for [[San Diego County]] for \u201cits extraordinary efforts to improve fire safety in the community\u201d by the North County Fire Protection District (NCFPD).\n*In 2006, Blair Ceniceros received a plaque from [[Riverside County]] commemorating his tenure as President of the [http://mcfsc.org/ Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council].

(CFSCI) in mid-2002, the old inclusive CFSC disappeared and was replaced by a non-membership 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation.  The CFSCI Board of Directors and its staff comprise the CFSCI.  Local fire safe councils are no longer members and have minimal impact on, or knowledge of, decisions made by the CFSCI.  The CFSCI is simply one more entity among the over 100 independent organizations that focus on wildfire safety throughout the state of California.  It has a somewhat different function from local FSCs in that its primary role is to administer the Grants Clearinghouse.\n\nThe California Fire Safe Council, Inc. bylaws do not allow for direct participation by local fire safe councils. Thus, the primary of information about the activities and decisions of the CFSCI is to attend the public portion of its quarterly Board of Directors meetings.  In general, this is not feasible for local FSCs due to the travel involved, so they must depend on the meeting minutes.  As of May 2018, the CFSCI does not make it easy to find out about [http://www.cafiresafecouncil.org/board-meeting-schedule/ upcoming Board meetings] or [http://www.cafiresafecouncil.org/board-minutes/ minutes for past meetings] as there are no direct links on the CFSCI web site. A Google search had to be done to find the links given here.\n\n==Firewise USA==\nLike fire safe councils, the [https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Wildfire/Firewise-USA Firewise USA] program is designed to reach beyond the fire service by involving homeowners, community leaders, planners, developers, and others in the effort to protect people, property, and natural resources from the risk of wildland fire - before a fire starts. Fire safe councils and Firewise USA both emphasize community responsibility for planning in the design of a safe community as well as effective emergency response, and individual responsibility for safer home construction and design, landscaping, and maintenance.\n\nThe Firewise USA program is intended to serve as a resource for agencies, tribes, organizations, fire departments, and communities across the U.S. who are working toward a common goal: reduce loss of lives, property, and resources to wildland fire by building and maintaining communities in a way that is compatible with our natural surroundings.  It differs from fire safe councils in that the Firewise program is nationwide while fire safe councils are mainly in California.\n\nThe two approaches to motivating community members to take responsibility for preparing their communities to be better able to survive a wildfire are very compatible. The major difference between the two methods is that in order to be certified by Firewise USA, the entire community must be involved, including financially, whereas fire safe councils, especially those that are 501(c)(3) organizations, can operate with a much smaller level of individual participation.  Also, fire safe councils often implement projects which go beyond a single community, such as shaded fuel breaks.\n\nThe Firewise USA communities in California are often chapters of a county-wide fire safe council, but they also function independently if that best serves the community.\n\nFirewise USA offers a wide range of resources including printed materials as well as courses.\n\n==How to Start a Fire Safe Council==\nLocal fire safe councils (FSCs) are spread throughout [[California]]\n\n===Background===\n'''Fire safe councils''' are [[grassroots]] community-based organizations which share the objective of making [[California's]] communities less vulnerable to catastrophic [[wildfire.]]  Fire safe councils accomplish this objective through education programs and projects such as shaded fuel breaks or [[firebreak]]s to protect area residents against an oncoming wildfire and to provide fire fighters with a place to fight the oncoming fire.  The first fire safe councils started in the early 1990s, and there are now over 100 around the state.\n\nLocal fire safe councils usually include representatives from:\n*Fire agencies, including the [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]] (CDF or CAL FIRE), the [[US Forest Service]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]], and/or local fire protection districts as appropriate;\n*Local governments, such as [[city]] and/or [[county]];\n*Businesses, especially insurance;\n*Other agencies, such as [http://www.carcd.org/ Resource Conservation Districts]; and\n*The public\n\nThe fire agency and local government representatives may be members of the FSC, or may serve in an advisory capacity, depending on local needs.\n\nAll fire safe councils are independent entities.  Some are organized as [[non-profit]] 501(c)(3) [[corporations]]; others operate under a [[memorandum of understanding]] with a [[County]], [[City]], and/or local fire protection district; some have no formal structure at all.\n\nFire safe councils vary in focus.  Some are county-wide, while others comprise only the [[Homeowner's Association]] in a subdivision, to all sizes in between.  There are also several regional associations of fire safe councils.\n\nWhile some fire safe councils have paid staff, such as an Executive Director, and may have grant funding for fuel reduction projects, all FSCs rely heavily on volunteers for much of their work.\n\n===Alternatives to a fire safe council===\nA local fire safe council may or may not be the best approach to meet your community's needs.  Here are two alternatives to consider.\n\n====Form a Firewise USA Community====\nIf you are working with a small community, or something like a Homeowners Association, [https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Wildfire/Firewise-USA Becoming a Firewise USA Community] might be a better fit than a fire safe council.\n\n====Create a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT)====\nThe [https://www.ready.gov/community-emergency-response-team Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) Program] is operated by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA. While CERT is primarily focused on disaster response, many CERT groups also participate in pre-disaster mitigation projects.\n\nCERT \"educates people about disaster preparedness for hazards that may impact their area and trains them in basic disaster response skills, such as fire safety, light search and rescue, team organization, and disaster medical operations. Using the training learned in the classroom and during exercises, CERT members can assist others in their neighborhood or workplace following an event when professional responders are not immediately available to help. CERT members also are encouraged to support emergency response agencies by taking a more active role in emergency preparedness projects in their community.\"\n\nTo find out if your area has a CERT, or to start a CERT, check with your city or county Office of Emergency Services.\n\n===Before you start===\n\n====Get yourself educated====\nThe first step is to get yourself knowledgeable about wildfire and how to prepare your home and community to survive one.  There are many resources available on this topic. Some are listed in the Resources section below.\n\n====Find out if a fire safe organization already exists====\nMost counties in California have at least one fire safe council, and many have a county-wide FSC. To find out what exists in your county, contact your local fire agency or county office of emergency services. You can also check the list of fire safe councils on the California Fire Safe Council web site.\n\nIf you find that there is already a fire safe council in your county, contact them before proceeding so that you don't duplicate their efforts and so that they can provide you with support.\n\n====Connect with your local fire agency====\nIt is very important to coordinate your activities with your local fire agency. Is your area covered by a formal Fire Protection District or a city Fire Department?  If so, arrange to meet with the Chief and/or the Fire Marshal to let him/her know what you are planning. If not, find out what fire agency is responsible for your area.  It may be a county agency, or CAL FIRE, or perhaps a Federal agency such as the US Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management.  Once you have determined that, arrange to meet with the Fire Chief or Battalion Chief about your plans.\n\n====Connect with the Office of Emergency Services for your city/county====\nIn addition, find out who is the head of your city or county's Office of Emergency Services, and meet with him/her as well.  Find out if your county has a Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) and if so, how your fire safe council can assist with implementation.  Also find out about your city or county [https://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-planning Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan] and how you can participate in carrying out the plan.\n\n====Additional resources====\nThe California Fire Safe Council has [http://www.cafiresafecouncil.org/fire-safe-councils/organizational-forms/ organization resources], including the fire safe council logo, as seen in this article (no permission is needed to use it).\n\n===Publicity===\nGetting the word out about your Fire Safe Council meetings and projects doesn't have to be expensive. Here are some ideas:\n*Post flyers on community bulletin boards\n*Write Letters to the Editor for your local paper\n*Contact your local cable company to find out how to get items on the community channel\n*Submit a press release to your local paper or radio station (see [https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Press-Release How to Write a Press Release] for tips on effective media contact)\n*Most newspapers have a free calendar section\u2014find out how to get items included\n*Contact your local radio station about community announcements\n*Local schools might be willing to send a flyer home with their students, say for a neighborhood chipper day\n*Create a [[Facebook]] and/or [[Twitter]] account\n*Create a web page (see below)\n\n===Web site development===\nSetting up a web site doesn't can be done for very little money, or even for free.  There are many resources available to assist with this. For example, see [http://blog.triphp.com/reviews/websites/10-of-the-best-places-to-create-a-website-for-free-online.html 10 Of The Best Places to Create A Website For Free Online] or [https://clickfire.com/modern-free-website-builders/ Modern Free Website Builders]\n\n===Funding===\nThere are various sources of funding, although it doesn't necessarily take a lot of money to make a big difference in how well prepared your community is for wildfire. Many worthwhile projects can be implemented with little or no cost, as listed below. You local fire agency or city or county may have some funds for copying, or you may be able to get donations from service clubs, insurance agencies, or the community. For larger projects, grant funding may be necessary.\n\n====Inexpensive projects====\nEducation is a major element in wildfire preparation. Here are some ideas:\n*Write articles and/or Letters to the Editor for your local newspaper\n*Speak at meetings, such as service clubs (include a representative from your local fire agency)\n*Do [http://www.ncfirewise.org/pdf/home_assessment.pdf homeowner assessments] in neighborhoods\n*Work with a local garden club to plant a Firewise demonstration garden (see the Resources section below for lists of plants)\n*Organize Coffee Klatches about preparation for wildfire at people's homes\n*Organize chipper days in neighborhoods, if your county has a free chipper program\n*Work with a local building supply business to sponsor an event where people can learn about upgrades to make their homes more fire safe\n*Work with local veterinarians and pet stores to offer handouts on pet and livestock evacuation preparation\n\n====Grants====\nVarious Federal and State grants are available. See the \"Funding\" section above for details.\n\n====Other funding sources====\nOther sources of funds for fire safe councils are donations from the community, membership dues, grants from sources other than listed here, and funding from their County and/or City government. In addition, a percentage for administration is usually a component of any grants received, although these funds are restricted in that they can only be used an activities associated with the particular grant and must be accounted for to the funding agency.\n\n===Should you form a 501(c)(3) non-profit?===\nMost funding sources require that the recipients be organized as some sort of non-profit organization.  There are many types of non-profit, but the one most available to local FSCs is the 501(C)(3) [[Non-profit]] corporation.  There are many pros and cons to forming your own non-profit.

The first fire safe councils started in the early 1990s, and there are now over 100 around the state.)[[Image:Idealized County-Wide Local Fire Safe Council.jpg|right|600px|An idealized county-wide fire safe council]]\n\n(An exception to the grassroots formation is the [[California Fire Safe Council]], Inc. (CFSCI).  Since its incorporation in mid-2002, the primary role of the CFSCI has been to operate the [[Fire Safe California Grants Clearinghouse]] (now called simply the \"Grants Clearinghouse\"). Thus, in the rest of this article the true grassroots fire safe councils are referred to as \"local fire safe councils\" (FSCs) in order to distinguish them from the CFSCI.)\n\nLocal fire safe councils usually include representatives from:\n*Fire agencies, including the [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]] (CDF or CAL FIRE), the [[US Forest Service]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]], and/or local fire protection districts as appropriate\n*Local governments, such as city and/or county\n*Businesses, especially insurance\n*Other agencies, such as [http://www.carcd.org/ Resource Conservation Districts]\n*The public\n\nThe fire agency and local government representatives may be members of the FSC, or may serve in an advisory capacity, depending on local needs.\n\nAll local fire safe councils are independent entities.

Some are county-wide, while others comprise only the [[Homeowner's Association]] in a subdivision, to all sizes in between.  There are also several regional associations of fire safe councils.\n\nWhile some fire safe councils have paid staff, such as an Executive Director, and may have grant funding for fuel reduction projects, all FSCs rely heavily on volunteers for much of their work.\n\nThe community-based approach to reducing wildfire risk is being implemented in other locations in the [[United States]]. An example is [http://www.firesafemt.org FireSafe Montana].  [https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Wildfire/Firewise-USA Firewise USA] Communities are also community-based organizations focused on wildfire mitigation throughout the US, including California.\n\n==Evolution ==\n\n===The \u201cFire Safe\u201d concept===\n\nThe ''Operation Fire Safe'' wildfire prevention program was begun in 1968<ref>''Operation Fire Safe!,'' State of California Resources Agency, Department of Conservation, Division of Forestry, 1968</ref> by the State of California Resources Agency, Department of Conservation, Division of Forestry, (CDF or CAL FIRE) in response to changing wildfire conditions resulting from more and more homes being built in rural areas that were formerly wildland.  (The term \u201cWildland Urban Interface\u201d,<ref>[http://cdfdata.fire.ca.gov/fire_er/fpp_terminology?filter=W \u201cWildland Urban Interface\u201d]</ref> or WUI, is used to describe this area.)\n\nNext, the ''Fire Safe! Inside and Out'' wildfire prevention campaign was developed in 1989 by Loren Poore, Chief of Fire Prevention with CDF.<ref>''Two Longtime CDFers Retire from Fire Prevention'', CDF Communiqu\u00e9, January/February 1994</ref>   This program created materials, including a video, a brochure, and other items, to educate homeowners about implementing fire safe practices inside and outside the home.  [[Defensible space (fire control)|Defensible space]] began to become the catchword for protecting homes and wildlands in the WUI.  At this time, most wildfire safety education was conducted by members of the CDF Volunteers in Prevention (VIP) program.<ref name=\"Wilson\">[http://www.fire-lookouts.org/cali/miami_mtn/flamstat.htm ''California--The Flammable State''], Richard A. Wilson, Director of CDF, CDF Comment, July 1994, retrieved on March 18, 2008</ref>\n\nThe [[Oakland Firestorm of 1991]] provided a new incentive to increase wildfire prevention education and activities, and CDF formed the Fire Safe Advisory Council, AKA the Fire Safe Council, which included insurance industry representatives, wildland firefighting agencies (such as the [[U.S. Forest Service]] (USFS) and the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM)), private industry, and the public.\n\n===The first fire safe councils===\nIn the early 1990s, three organizations were formed that were precursors of what eventually became known as local, community-based Fire Safe Councils:\n*The Oakhurst Fire Safe Program, located in the central Sierra foothills, was formed as a joint effort by CDF and the [[US Forest Service]], [[National Park Service]], local agencies, community groups, and businesses seeking to formalize a cooperative fire prevention relationship.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> This program has evolved into the present-day [http://www.mariposafiresafe.org/ Mariposa County Fire Safe Council].\n*The Fire Safe Committee of San Mateo County (now [https://www.firesafesanmateo.org/ Fire Safe San Mateo County]) was formed by the local community.<ref>[http://www.canonbal.org/chronoset.html ''200 Years of History Uninterrupted By Progress''], Steve Kennedy, The Cannonball Express, retrieved on March 18, 2008</ref>\n*[http://www.firesafemarin.org/ Fire Safe Marin] in [[Marin County]] was formed by the local community in 1992 and remains active today. <ref>[https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/management/upload/firemanagement_fireeducation_mij_peopleparksfire_021005_p03.pdf ''FIRESafe MARIN, 1992-2002, Celebrating the Past, Preparing For the Future'', retrieved on March 18, 2008]</ref>\n\nThe 1993 Firestorm in Southern California was another major wildfire event.  Residents of the Laguna Beach area formed three committees to deal with the losses as well as to prevent, or at least reduce, future losses.<ref>[http://www.csulb.edu/~dhorne/b_C_resume.htm Personal Profile, David Horne, PhD.], retrieved on March 18, 2008</ref>  These groups evolved into the present-day [http://www.lagunacoastfiresafecouncil.org/ Greater Laguna Coast Fire Safe Council].\n\n===CDF support for fire safe councils===\nIn support of the community-based efforts, CDF began including these local groups in its Fire Safe Council.  The coalition was headed by the CDF Public Education Officer.<ref>\"California\u2019s I-Zone: Urban Wildland Fire Prevention and Mitigation\", CDF Office of the State Fire Marshal, 1996</ref>  Sometime after 1996, as more and more communities started local Fire Safe Councils throughout the state, the Fire Safe Council became known as the [[California Fire Safe Council]] (CFSC). The CFSC was a precursor of the current California Fire Safe Council, Inc. (CFSCI).\n\nThrough the CFSC, CDF provided assistance to local fire safe councils via monthly meetings where local fire safe councils, and other organizations sharing the fire safe mission, could network; marketing literature such as a brochure; development of videos and Public Service Announcements; a handbook on how to form a Fire Safe Council; and other materials.  Marketing support was provided under a contract with the public relations firm Manning Selvage & Lee, which had an office on K Street in Sacramento at the time.\n\nThis overall support from CDF ceased when the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. was formed as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation in mid-2002.  However, most individual CDF/CAL FIRE Units continue to work closely with their local area fire safe councils, often providing \"in-kind\" matching funds for grants as well as advice on fire safe projects.\n\n===The number of fire safe councils expands===\nWith active support from CDF and its California Fire Safe Council coalition, more and more communities began forming local Fire Safe Councils.  Expansion of the program accelerated after the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County (FSC/NC) received a [http://www.westernforesters.org/wui-grants Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) grant] in 1998.  One of the conditions of the WUI grant was that the Executive Director of the FSC/NC take an active role in assisting other communities to form Fire Safe Councils, and aid in their success.\n\nNow, over 100 local Fire Safe Councils are active in California alone, with more forming all the time.\n\n==Networking for fire safe councils==\nPrior to the incorporation of the CFSCI, the California Fire Safe Council was the primary means of networking for local FSCs. After incorporation, the CFSCI continued to host the monthly meetings for local FSCs until November 2006, when budget constraints would no longer allow for the expense.\n\n===Local Fire Safe Council Network Yahoo Group===\nIn order to provide a way to keep in touch, in 2006 an electronic group was set up on [[Yahoo!]] called the [https://groups.yahoo.com/group/FireSafeCouncilNetwork/ Local Fire Safe Council Network]. This group continues to provide a valuable link among local FSCs and other organizations and agencies committed to making California's communities fire safe. Membership in the group can be requested by going to the group's web site and clicking on \"Join this Group!\". Prospective members should provide an indication of their affiliation with a local FSC or other organization/agency in their request to join.\n\n==Funding==\n\n===Federal funding===\nIn California Federal funding is administered by the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. (CFSCI) which operates the [[Fire Safe California Grants Clearinghouse]] AKA Grants Clearinghouse.  Funding is provided to the Grants Clearinghouse by the [[US Forest Service]] (USFS), the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), the [[National Park Service]], and the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]]. (Note that these agencies, notably the USFS, may have other grant funding streams that do not go through the Clearinghouse.)\n\nBeginning in 2001, Title II and Title III funds from the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000 (AKA \"HR 2389\") were another source of funds for FSCs in Counties that qualify for HR 2389 payments, especially for staff, operations, and education projects, as funds from the Grants Clearinghouse are generally not available for these functions.  These funds are paid to Counties, and it was up to the Counties to decide how they are used.  In the past, many Counties used at least a portion of the funds for fire safe activities.\n\n===State funding===\nState funding varies from year to year as programs come and go. Check with your CAL FIRE Unit or County Resource Conservation District or current information.\n\nAll of the State and Federal funding sources described in this section require matching funds, either in the form of cash or \"in kind\", such as labor, materials, vehicles, etc.  While not a formal program, most CAL FIRE units provide financial assistance to their local fire safe councils in the form of \"in kind\" matching funds for grants.\n\n===Other funding sources===\nOther sources of funds for fire safe councils are donations from the community, membership dues, grants from sources other than listed here, and funding from their County and/or City government.  In addition, a percentage for administration is usually a component of any grants received, although these funds are restricted in that they can only be used an activities associated with the particular grant and must be accounted for to the funding agency.\n\n==Examples of fire safe council accomplishments==\nThis section is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give a few examples of what has been accomplished by fire safe councils over the years.  Most of these projects were funded by grants.\n\n===Special needs assistance===\nMany fire safe councils operate a program that assists people with special needs, such as seniors, low-income, and disabled persons, to create and maintain the [[defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] around their home.  Some examples are:\n*[http://www.edcfiresafe.org/programs-grants-2/free-vegetation-removal-for-seniors-or-disabled-citizens/ El Dorado County Fire Safe Council Senior Assistance]\n*[https://www.plumasfiresafe.org/senior-disabled-assistance.html Plumas County Fire Safe Council Senior & Disabled Assistance Program]\n*[http://www.areyoufiresafe.com/get-fire-help/special-needs-assistance/ Fire Safe Council of Nevada County Special Needs Assistance Program]\n\n===Free chipper program===\nOne difficulty homeowners have with creating and maintaining defensible space is what to do with the vegetation once it is removed.  To help with this, many fire safe councils provide free access to a chipper.  An example is the [http://www.krvfiresafecouncil.org/ChipperDays.htm Kern River Valley Fire Safe Council Chipper Days].\n\n===Defensible space inspection/education program===\nThe purpose of these programs is to educate homeowners as to what they need to do to create adequate defensible space and sometimes also give suggestions about modifications to make to the home itself to make it more resistant to wildfire.  These are also called \"dooryard visits\" by some fire safe councils.  These volunteers are trained by their local CAL FIRE Unit or their local Fire Protection District. For example, the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County has a [http://www.areyoufiresafe.com/get-fire-help/defensible-space-advisory-visit/ Defensible Space Advisory Visit] service.\n\n===Fuel breaks===\nWhile defensible space protects homes from wildfire, [[firebreak]]s, also called fuel breaks, protect communities.  These may also be referred to as \"shaded fuel breaks\".  Fuel breaks are usually linear.  The US Forest Service also uses the Strategically Placed Area Treatment (SPLAT) concept.  SPLATs may be any shape. Many fuel breaks have been created by fire safe councils, using grant funding.  One example is the [http://www.maderafsc.org/html/past_projects/crooks_mountain.htm Eastern Madera County Fire Safe Council Crooks Mountain Fuel Break].\n\n===Community wildfire protection plans===\nThe Federal funding sources described in the section on Funding either require that projects be part of an approved Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP), or give preference to such projects.  In response, many FSCs have taken a proactive role in getting these plans developed and approved, even though this responsibility really resides with local government.\n\n===A sampling of other projects===\n*The Greater Laguna Coast Fire Safe Council [http://www.lagunacoastfiresafecouncil.org/red_flag_program.html Red Flag Program] is designed to complement the official steps taken by the fire fighting professionals with the goal of providing a highly visible reminder to all citizens in the region to be extra careful and vigilant on the days when the Santa Ana winds blow.\n*The Fire Safe Council of Nevada County has published the [http://www.areyoufiresafe.com/files/9413/0083/2949/firewise_plant_booklet_2011_110106.pdf Fire Wise Plants for Western Nevada County], which is distributed by a local nursery, among other places.

This bill became law on August 4, 2008.\n\n==Recognition of fire safe councils==\nMany fire safe councils, as well as individual contributors, have received recognition for their efforts to improve the ability for California\u2019s communities to survive wildfire.  Since it is impossible to list all of these, the following examples are offered in honor of all who have contributed to this important effort.\n\n===National recognition===\n*In 2001, the Bronze Smokey Award was presented to the [http://www.areyoufiresafe.com/ Fire Safe Council of Nevada County] by the US Forest Service for providing outstanding public service in wildfire prevention.[https://www.fs.fed.us/sites/default/files/legacy_files/fire-management-today/62-2.pdf] The Bronze Smokey is the highest National honor given for community-based fire prevention work.\n*In 2002, the [http://www.co.yuba.ca.us/firesafe/ Yuba Watershed Protection and Fire Safe Council] received a Bronze Smokey from the USFS\n*In 2003, [[Idyllwild]]'s [http://mcfsc.org/ Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council] received a national award from the USFS in recognition of its contributions to the community over the past year.\n*In 2004, Plumas County Fire Safe Council was recognized by the US Forest Service Chief with the Rural Community Assistance National Leadership Award for, \u201cOutstanding accomplishments through their exceptional leadership, vision, and perseverance in working collaboratively to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire in Plumas County\u201d.\n*In 2005, Luana Dowling, Fire Chief for Iowa Hill and Chair of the [http://www.firesafeforesthill.org/ Foresthill/Iowa Hill Fire Safe Council], received recognition from the US Forest Service for her success in obtaining funding for, and then implementing, various fuel reduction projects on USFS and BLM land near [[Foresthill]] and [[Iowa Hill]].\n\nNumerous national recognition has been awarded since 2005.\n\n===State recognition===\n*In 2000, Laura Dyberg, President of the [http://www.mountainrimfiresafecouncil.org/ Mountain Rim Fire Safe Council] in Southern California, was named Woman of the Year for the 31st Senate District of California by Senator Jim Brulte\n*in 2007, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] included fire safe councils in his Executive Order S-07-07 as one of the resources available to CAL FIRE \u201cto support a heightened level of fire prevention public awareness and education\u201d\n*In 2008, the [[California Legislature]] enacted a joint resolution, SCR 80 (Cogdill) recognizing that \u201clocal Fire Safe Councils work to educate communities, provide wildfire safety planning, fire prevention, and educational programs throughout the state and remain a critical component of statewide fire protection efforts.\u201d [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=scr_80&sess=CUR&house=B&author=cogdill]\n\n===Local recognition===\n* In 2003, [http://www.firesafemarin.org/ Fire Safe Marin] received the Regional Excellence Award from the [[Board of Supervisors]] for its work to support fire agencies across [[Marin County]] in protecting life, property and the environment for the citizens of Marin.\n*On October 19, 2004, Robin Yonash, Founder of the Greater Colfax Area Fire Safe Council, received a commendation from the Placer County Board of Supervisors (Resolution 2004-163) for promoting fire safety throughout Placer County.[https://www.placer.ca.gov/~/media/bos/cob/documents/sumarchv/bssa_stor/bsaa_2004%20pdf.pdf?la=en]\n*In 2006, the Fallbrook Fire Safe Council was honored as the Fire Safe Council of the Year for [[San Diego County]] for \u201cits extraordinary efforts to improve fire safety in the community\u201d by the North County Fire Protection District (NCFPD).\n*In 2006, Blair Ceniceros received a plaque from [[Riverside County]] commemorating his tenure as President of the [http://mcfsc.org/ Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council].

(CFSCI) in mid-2002, the old inclusive CFSC disappeared and was replaced by a non-membership 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation.  The CFSCI Board of Directors and its staff comprise the CFSCI.  Local fire safe councils are no longer members and have minimal impact on, or knowledge of, decisions made by the CFSCI.  The CFSCI is simply one more entity among the over 100 independent organizations that focus on wildfire safety throughout the state of California.  It has a somewhat different function from local FSCs in that its primary role is to administer the Grants Clearinghouse.\n\nThe California Fire Safe Council, Inc. bylaws do not allow for direct participation by local fire safe councils. Thus, the primary of information about the activities and decisions of the CFSCI is to attend the public portion of its quarterly Board of Directors meetings.  In general, this is not feasible for local FSCs due to the travel involved, so they must depend on the meeting minutes.  As of May 2018, the CFSCI does not make it easy to find out about [http://www.cafiresafecouncil.org/board-meeting-schedule/ upcoming Board meetings] or [http://www.cafiresafecouncil.org/board-minutes/ minutes for past meetings] as there are no direct links on the CFSCI web site. A Google search had to be done to find the links given here.\n\n==Firewise USA==\nLike fire safe councils, the [https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Wildfire/Firewise-USA Firewise USA] program is designed to reach beyond the fire service by involving homeowners, community leaders, planners, developers, and others in the effort to protect people, property, and natural resources from the risk of wildland fire - before a fire starts. Fire safe councils and Firewise USA both emphasize community responsibility for planning in the design of a safe community as well as effective emergency response, and individual responsibility for safer home construction and design, landscaping, and maintenance.\n\nThe Firewise USA program is intended to serve as a resource for agencies, tribes, organizations, fire departments, and communities across the U.S. who are working toward a common goal: reduce loss of lives, property, and resources to wildland fire by building and maintaining communities in a way that is compatible with our natural surroundings.  It differs from fire safe councils in that the Firewise program is nationwide while fire safe councils are mainly in California.\n\nThe two approaches to motivating community members to take responsibility for preparing their communities to be better able to survive a wildfire are very compatible. The major difference between the two methods is that in order to be certified by Firewise USA, the entire community must be involved, including financially, whereas fire safe councils, especially those that are 501(c)(3) organizations, can operate with a much smaller level of individual participation.  Also, fire safe councils often implement projects which go beyond a single community, such as shaded fuel breaks.\n\nThe Firewise USA communities in California are often chapters of a county-wide fire safe council, but they also function independently if that best serves the community.\n\nFirewise USA offers a wide range of resources including printed materials as well as courses.\n\n==How to Start a Fire Safe Council==\nLocal fire safe councils (FSCs) are spread throughout [[California]]\n\n===Background===\n'''Fire safe councils''' are [[grassroots]] community-based organizations which share the objective of making [[California's]] communities less vulnerable to catastrophic [[wildfire.]]  Fire safe councils accomplish this objective through education programs and projects such as shaded fuel breaks or [[firebreak]]s to protect area residents against an oncoming wildfire and to provide fire fighters with a place to fight the oncoming fire.  The first fire safe councils started in the early 1990s, and there are now over 100 around the state.\n\nLocal fire safe councils usually include representatives from:\n*Fire agencies, including the [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]] (CDF or CAL FIRE), the [[US Forest Service]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]], and/or local fire protection districts as appropriate;\n*Local governments, such as [[city]] and/or [[county]];\n*Businesses, especially insurance;\n*Other agencies, such as [http://www.carcd.org/ Resource Conservation Districts]; and\n*The public\n\nThe fire agency and local government representatives may be members of the FSC, or may serve in an advisory capacity, depending on local needs.\n\nAll fire safe councils are independent entities.  Some are organized as [[non-profit]] 501(c)(3) [[corporations]]; others operate under a [[memorandum of understanding]] with a [[County]], [[City]], and/or local fire protection district; some have no formal structure at all.\n\nFire safe councils vary in focus.  Some are county-wide, while others comprise only the [[Homeowner's Association]] in a subdivision, to all sizes in between.  There are also several regional associations of fire safe councils.\n\nWhile some fire safe councils have paid staff, such as an Executive Director, and may have grant funding for fuel reduction projects, all FSCs rely heavily on volunteers for much of their work.\n\n===Alternatives to a fire safe council===\nA local fire safe council may or may not be the best approach to meet your community's needs.  Here are two alternatives to consider.\n\n====Form a Firewise USA Community====\nIf you are working with a small community, or something like a Homeowners Association, [https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Wildfire/Firewise-USA Becoming a Firewise USA Community] might be a better fit than a fire safe council.\n\n====Create a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT)====\nThe [https://www.ready.gov/community-emergency-response-team Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) Program] is operated by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA. While CERT is primarily focused on disaster response, many CERT groups also participate in pre-disaster mitigation projects.\n\nCERT \"educates people about disaster preparedness for hazards that may impact their area and trains them in basic disaster response skills, such as fire safety, light search and rescue, team organization, and disaster medical operations. Using the training learned in the classroom and during exercises, CERT members can assist others in their neighborhood or workplace following an event when professional responders are not immediately available to help. CERT members also are encouraged to support emergency response agencies by taking a more active role in emergency preparedness projects in their community.\"\n\nTo find out if your area has a CERT, or to start a CERT, check with your city or county Office of Emergency Services.\n\n===Before you start===\n\n====Get yourself educated====\nThe first step is to get yourself knowledgeable about wildfire and how to prepare your home and community to survive one.  There are many resources available on this topic. Some are listed in the Resources section below.\n\n====Find out if a fire safe organization already exists====\nMost counties in California have at least one fire safe council, and many have a county-wide FSC. To find out what exists in your county, contact your local fire agency or county office of emergency services. You can also check the list of fire safe councils on the California Fire Safe Council web site.\n\nIf you find that there is already a fire safe council in your county, contact them before proceeding so that you don't duplicate their efforts and so that they can provide you with support.\n\n====Connect with your local fire agency====\nIt is very important to coordinate your activities with your local fire agency. Is your area covered by a formal Fire Protection District or a city Fire Department?  If so, arrange to meet with the Chief and/or the Fire Marshal to let him/her know what you are planning. If not, find out what fire agency is responsible for your area.  It may be a county agency, or CAL FIRE, or perhaps a Federal agency such as the US Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management.  Once you have determined that, arrange to meet with the Fire Chief or Battalion Chief about your plans.\n\n====Connect with the Office of Emergency Services for your city/county====\nIn addition, find out who is the head of your city or county's Office of Emergency Services, and meet with him/her as well.  Find out if your county has a Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) and if so, how your fire safe council can assist with implementation.  Also find out about your city or county [https://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-planning Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan] and how you can participate in carrying out the plan.\n\n====Additional resources====\nThe California Fire Safe Council has [http://www.cafiresafecouncil.org/fire-safe-councils/organizational-forms/ organization resources], including the fire safe council logo, as seen in this article (no permission is needed to use it).\n\n===Publicity===\nGetting the word out about your Fire Safe Council meetings and projects doesn't have to be expensive.
