His mother, Bertha Westbrook (1868\u20131939), was an actress, and his father, [[Hal Reid (actor)|James Halleck \"Hal\" Reid]] (1862\u20131920), worked successfully in a variety of theatrical jobs, mainly as playwright and actor, traveling the country. As a boy Wallace Reid was performing on stage at an early age, but acting was put on hold while he obtained an education at Freehold Military School in [[Freehold Township, New Jersey]]. He later graduated from [[Perkiomen School|Perkiomen Seminary]] in [[Pennsburg, Pennsylvania]], in 1909. A gifted all-around athlete, Reid participated in a number of sports while also following an interest in music, learning to play the [[piano]], [[banjo]], [[Drum kit|drums]], and [[violin]]. As a teenager, he spent time in [[Wyoming]], where he learned to be an outdoorsman.\n\n==Career==\nReid was drawn to the burgeoning motion picture industry by his father, who shifted from the theatre to writing films, directing them, and acting in them. In 1910, Reid appeared in his first film, ''The Phoenix'', an adaptation of a Milton Nobles play, filmed at [[Selig Polyscope|Selig Polyscope Studios]] in Chicago. Reid used the script from a play his father had written and approached the very successful [[Vitagraph Studios]], hoping to be given the opportunity to direct. Instead, Vitagraph executives capitalized on his sex appeal, and in addition to having him direct, cast him in a major role. Although Reid's good looks and powerful physique made him the perfect \"[[matin\u00e9e idol]]\", he was equally happy with roles behind the scenes and often worked as a writer, cameraman, and director.\n\nWallace Reid appeared in several films with his father, and as his career in film flourished, he was soon acting and directing with and for early film mogul [[Allan Dwan]]. In 1913, while at [[Universal Pictures]], Reid met and married actress [[Dorothy Davenport]] (1895\u20131977). He was featured as Phil Stoneman in ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) and The Rhapsode in ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), both directed by [[D. W. Griffith]], and starred opposite leading ladies such as [[Florence Turner]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Elsie Ferguson]], and [[Geraldine Farrar]] ''en route'' to becoming one of [[Hollywood]]'s major heartthrobs.\n\nAlready involved with the creation of more than 100 motion picture shorts, Reid was signed by producer [[Jesse L. Lasky]] and starred in over 60 films for Lasky's [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players]] film company, which later became [[Paramount Pictures]]. Frequently paired with actress [[Ann Little]], his action-hero role as the dashing race-car driver drew young girls and older women alike to theaters to see his daredevil auto thrillers such as ''The Roaring Road'' (1919), ''Double Speed'' (1920), ''Excuse My Dust'' (1920), and ''Too Much Speed'' (1921). One of his [[Auto racing|auto-racing]] films, ''[[Across the Continent]]'' (1922), was chosen as the opening night film for San Francisco's [[Castro Theatre]], which opened on 22 June 1922.\n\nReid loved racing so much that he even made an (unsuccessful) attempt to qualify for the [[1922 Indianapolis 500]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/driver/Wallace_Reid |title=Wallace Reid}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Wallace Reid Urn.JPG|thumb|The [[urn]] of Wallace Reid, in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)#Great Mausoleum|Great Mausoleum]], Forest Lawn, Glendale]]\n\nWhile en route to a location in [[Oregon]] during filming of ''[[The Valley of the Giants (1919 film)|The Valley of the Giants]]'' (1919), Reid was injured in a [[train wreck]] near [[Arcata, California]] and needed six stitches to close a three-inch scalp wound.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reid Company in Wreck|journal=Moving Picture World |volume=39 |number=9 |date=1 March 1919 |page=1474 |url=https://archive.org/stream/movwor39chal#page/1474/mode/2up |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> To keep on filming, he was prescribed [[morphine]] for relief of his pain. Reid soon became [[drug addiction|addicted]], but kept on working at a frantic pace in films that were growing more physically demanding and changing from 15\u201320 minutes in duration to as much as an hour. Reid's morphine addiction worsened at a time when [[drug rehabilitation]] programs were nonexistent, and he died in a sanitarium while attempting recovery.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga35r1F1JdcC&pg=PA108&dq=%22Wallace+Reid%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&lr=&cd=4#v=onepage&q=%22Wallace%20Reid%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&f=false Troping the body: gender, etiquette, and performance] By Gwendolyn Audrey Foster.

She and Reid had two children: a son, [[Wallace Reid Jr.]], born in 1917; and a daughter, Betty Mummert, whom they adopted in 1922 as a three-year-old; allegedly Reid had fathered her during an affair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://artfuljesus.0catch.com/artists/reid.html |title=Wallace Reid}}</ref> Reid's widow never remarried.\n\nWallace Reid's contribution to the [[motion picture industry]] has been recognized with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Popular culture==\nReid's name is mentioned by [[William Holden]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', a film in which [[Gloria Swanson]], one of Reid's original co-stars, appears as a forgotten silent film star. In [[Ken Russell]]'s 1977 film ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'', Reid is portrayed briefly and inaccurately as a bicycle-riding childish movie star and is made up to look like a cross between the character he played in ''[[Clarence (1922 film)|Clarence]]'', [[Harold Lloyd]], and the comic actors [[Jimmie Adams]] and Churchill Ross. In the 1980 documentary ''[[Hollywood (documentary)|Hollywood]]'' episode \"Single Beds and Double Standards\", Reid's story is recalled by those [[silent film]] survivors who worked with him: Gloria Swanson, [[Karl Brown (cinematographer)|Karl Brown]], [[Henry Hathaway]], and stuntman Bob Rose.\n\nIn 2007, a biography ''Wallace Reid: Life and Death of a Hollywood Idol'' by author E. J. Fleming appeared, the first since his mother's personal recollections after Reid's death.\n\nIn 2018, a biography of Reid was the subject of [[Karina Longworth]]'s Podcast \"You Must Remember This\".

The station is owned by [[Quincy Media]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[The CW Plus|CW]] affiliate [[WISE-TV]] (channel 33). The two stations share studios and transmitter facilities on Butler Road in [[List of neighborhoods in Fort Wayne, Indiana|Northwest Fort Wayne]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on September 28, 1957. It was founded by [[Sarkes Tarzian]], an [[Indianapolis]] engineer whose company owned [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]'s [[WTTV]] and several other stations in Indiana. The WPTA call letters come from the long tradition of other Tarzian stations, including once former sister station [[WAJI|WPTH]], that base the call letters upon the initials of family members of company management. Upon its launch, channel 21 took all ABC programming from NBC affiliate WKJG-TV (channel 33, now [[WISE-TV]]) and [[CBS]] affiliate [[WANE-TV]] (channel 15).\n\nUnder [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules at that time, the [[media market|market]] was deemed too small to support three full-power stations, so Tarzian's application listed WPTA's city of license as the small town of [[Roanoke, Indiana]], located just across the [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen]]/[[Huntington County, Indiana|Huntington]] county line approximately {{convert|14|mi|km}} to the southwest of its studios and transmitter in Fort Wayne. This was possible because the FCC had by this time allowed a station to have its main studio in a different location from its city of license. WPTA identified itself as \"Roanoke/Fort Wayne\" on-air until the license was officially transferred to Fort Wayne sometime in the 1970s.\n\nIn addition to ABC programming, it also originally aired seven-and-a-half hours of live local programming each week. In 1957, the station aired a spin-off of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' called ''Teen Dance'' and the afternoon kids show ''Popeye and the Rascals''. In 1964, a {{convert|2226|sqft|m2|adj=on}} addition to its studios was added to accommodate an expanding sales staff. On April 4, 1973, Tarzian sold the station to Combined Communications for $3.6 million. Under new management, WPTA purchased new cameras and a more modern switcher. On June 7, 1979, Combined merged with the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]].\n\nOn May 12, 1983, Gannett sold WPTA (along with [[WLKY]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]) to [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer]] Publishing for an undisclosed amount after it purchased [[WLVI-TV]] in [[Boston]] from [[Field Communications]] and WTCN-TV (now [[KARE]]) in [[Minneapolis]] from [[Metromedia]]. This was because the WLVI-TV and WTCN purchases put Gannett with two stations over the Federal Communications Commission's seven-station ownership limit for television stations that was in effect at the time. The station was sold again to [[Granite Broadcasting]] on September 25, 1989, for $22.15 million. In late-1998 alongside the launch of [[The WB 100+ Station Group|The WB 100+]] and its cable-only affiliates, WPTA began managing and providing promotional services for WBFW, which used that callsign in a fictional manner since it was a cable-exclusive service.\n\nWhen [[WSJV]] in [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] (which signed on three years before WPTA) switched to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1995, WPTA became the longest-tenured ABC affiliate in Indiana. At one time (according to Granite Broadcasting's website),<ref name=\"strongestABC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.granitetv.com/|publisher=[[Granite Broadcasting]]|date=January 19, 1997|title=Granite Broadcasting Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970119044634/http://www.granitetv.com/|archivedate=January 19, 1997|accessdate=April 7, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> WPTA was among the ten strongest ABC affiliates in the country, ranking with [[WISN-TV]] in Milwaukee, [[KMBC-TV]] Kansas City, and [[KOCO-TV]] in Oklahoma City.\n\nOn March 9, 2005, after Granite bought NBC affiliate WISE-TV, it sold WPTA to the [[Malara Broadcast Group]] for $45.3 million. A [[local marketing agreement]] (LMA) was established whereby Granite would provide operational services to WPTA and Malara's other new station [[KDLH]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. Although WISE-TV is nominally the senior partner in this LMA, the stations' combined operation is based at WPTA's studios and the bulk of the news staff came from WPTA (see below). Malara jointly files its [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) reports with Granite which led to allegations that the company uses Malara as a [[shell corporation]] for Granite. If the allegations are proven to be true, Granite would be guilty of evading FCC duopoly rules. The FCC does not allow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. Additionally, Fort Wayne has only six full-power stations (only four of which are licensed as commercial outlets)\u2014too few to legally allow duopolies in any case. After emerging from bankruptcy in the summer of 2007, Granite stock was taken over by the privately owned [[hedge fund]] Silver Point Capital of Greenwich, Connecticut. Silver Point Capital now controls Granite according to a Buffalo, New York, news article printed September 16, 2007. According to the same article, Granite planned to sell its properties to other parties and many of its stations laid off employees or cut salaries up to 20 percent.\n\nIn March 2006, [[The CW]] (a new network being formed as a merger of [[The WB]] and [[UPN]]) announced that cable-only [[The WB 100+ Station Group|WB 100+ Station Group]] affiliate \"WBFW\" would become the network's Fort Wayne affiliate as part of [[The CW Plus]] (a similar small-market master feed to The WB 100+). WPTA decided to create a new second digital subchannel to simulcast \"WBFW\" and offer access to CW programming for over-the-air viewers. On September 18, The CW launched on WPTA-DT2. This move\u2014along with [[WISE-DT2]]'s switch to [[MyNetworkTV]] on September 5\u2014resulted in the deactivation of WANE-TV's second digital subchannel. It had been affiliated with UPN prior to the network's shutdown (that subchannel remained [[Dark (broadcasting)|dark]] until 2010, when it affiliated with [[TheCoolTV]]).\n\nOn September 28, 2007, WPTA unveiled a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] version of its \"21 Alive\" logo to commemorate the station's 50th anniversary, in conjunction with ABC's new image campaign but did not fully switch to it until August 4, 2008. On January 10, 2009, WPTA brought a new digital master control center online which services the station, WISE-TV and Granite's other stations in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n\nOn February 11, 2014, [[Quincy Media]] agreed to purchase WPTA from the Malara Broadcast Group as part of a deal to purchase Granite Broadcasting's stations in four markets (the other stations were [[KBJR-TV]] in [[Superior, Wisconsin]] and its satellite KRII in [[Chisholm, Minnesota]], [[WEEK-TV]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]] and [[WBNG-TV]] in [[Binghamton, New York]]). Quincy opted to purchase WPTA's license instead of WISE's license because WPTA has been the higher-rated of the two stations in the local viewership ratings. In addition to acquiring WPTA outright (which would make it the senior partner in the Fort Wayne duopoly), Quincy Newspapers would operate WISE-TV (whose license would be acquired by [[SagamoreHill Broadcasting]]) through a shared services agreement.<ref name=tvnc-saletoquincy>{{cite news|title=Quincy Buying Stations From Granite, Malara|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/74018/quincy-buying-stations-from-granite-malara|accessdate=February 11, 2014|newspaper=TVNewsCheck|date=February 11, 2014}}</ref> In November 2014, the deal was reworked to remove SagamoreHill from the transaction, with Quincy acquiring WISE, and WPTA remaining with Malara.<ref name=fcc-wisenosagamorehill>{{cite web|title=Applicenication For Consent To Assignment Of Broadcast Station Construction Permit Or License (WISE-TV)|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1654085&Service=DT&Form_id=314&Facility_id=13960|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, the deal was reworked yet again; it reverted to its previous structure, with Quincy and SagamoreHill acquiring WPTA and WISE respectively.

Since it was cable-exclusive and therefore not licensed by the FCC, the channel's call letters were used in a fictional manner. It was managed and promoted by WPTA, which at the time was owned outright by Granite Broadcasting. When that station's license was transferred to Granite partner company, the Malara Broadcast Group in 2005, '''\"WBFW\"''' became managed by the company. Prior to the sign-on of '''\"WBFW\"''', Fort Wayne viewers received their WB programs via Chicago-based [[WGN America|superstation WGN]], and for a few months in 1998, WTTV when that station dropped UPN in January of that year and picked up The WB in April of that year.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] and [[CBS Corporation]] announced the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/ 'Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September], [[CNNMoney.com]], January 24, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 2006.</ref> One month later on February 22, [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] announced the launch of a new \"sixth\" network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by [[Fox Television Stations]] and its syndication division [[Twentieth Television]]. MyNetworkTV was created to compete against The CW as well as to give UPN and WB stations that would not become CW affiliates, another option besides converting to independent stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=News Corp. to launch new mini-network for UPN stations|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-02-22-fox-my-network_x.htm|accessdate=January 21, 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/102922-News_Corp_Unveils_My_Network_TV.php News Corp.

WPTA decided to create a new second digital subchannel to simulcast '''\"WBFW\"''' and offer access to CW programming for over-the-air viewers. Meanwhile, on September 5, WISE-TV moved [[NBC Weather Plus]] from its second digital subchannel in order for it to become the area's affiliate of MyNetworkTV. Weather Plus then began airing on WISE-DT3. On September 18, The CW debuted on \"WBFW\" which officially began using the '''WPTA-DT2''' calls. The move resulted in the deactivation of CBS affiliate WANE-TV (channel 15)'s second digital subchannel, which had been affiliated with UPN prior to the network's shutdown (and remained dark until it affiliated with TheCoolTV in 2011).\n\n===WPTA-DT3 (MyTV Fort Wayne)===\n'''WPTA-DT3''' is the MyNetworkTV-affiliated third digital subchannel of WPTA, broadcasting a [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] signal on UHF channel 24.3 (or virtual channel 21.3 via PSIP).\n\n====History====\n[[File:WISE-TV Fox Logo.png|200px|thumb|left|Previous logo used from 2011 until March 1, 2013.]]\nOriginally established in 2005, WISE-DT2 was part of NBC Weather Plus and known on-air as \"Indiana's NewsCenter Weather Plus\".

On September 5, 2006, WISE-TV moved NBC Weather Plus programming to its third digital subchannel in order for WISE-DT2 to become the area's MyNetworkTV affiliate. The move\u2014along with \"WBFW\" affiliating with The CW (with the channel being carried on WPTA's second digital subchannel) on September 18\u2014resulted in the deactivation of WANE's second digital subchannel, which remained dark until it affiliated with TheCoolTV in 2010.\n\nIn June 2011, it was announced that WISE-DT2 would join Fox beginning August 1, 2011, taking the affiliation from then-current outlet [[WFFT-TV]] (owned by the [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]]). The switch was the result of a dispute over [[retransmission consent]] fees between Nexstar and Fox. Upon the switch, the station shifted MyNetworkTV to secondary status on WISE-DT2 and began airing the two-hour weeknight programming block from 10:30&nbsp;p.m. until 12:30&nbsp;a.m. The first Fox program to air on WISE-DT2 was ''[[Hell's Kitchen (American TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]''. With the addition of high definition capabilities to this station, WISE-DT3 (which featured 24-hour national [[NBC Plus]] [successor to NBC Weather Plus] and local \"The [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] Channel\" weather programming) moved to WPTA's third digital subchannel (currently home to ''Indiana's NewsCenter Now''). It is unknown if the two services will be merged in any way or if one will be dropped. The station was upgraded to a 720p high definition signal on June 27.<ref name=tvnc-wisedt2fox>{{cite news|title=Fox Moves Afills In Springfield, Ft.

While WPTA has a [[Doppler weather radar|weather radar]] dating back to the late 1990s on its premises, it has used [[NEXRAD]] data exclusively since 2007, first with Baron Systems' [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] processing under the name ''Pinpoint VIPIR HD'', then from 2016 onwards with [[The Weather Company|The Weather Company's]] Max Radar as a result of the station's acquisition by Quincy.\n\n[[File:WPTA_2013_Logo.png|150px|thumb|right|WPTA's \"21 Alive\" logo until November 7, 2016.]]\nUnder Combined Communications ownership, WPTA significantly invested in its news department. During that time, Wes Sims and Harry Gallagher served as co-anchors with meteorologist Bill Eisenhood and sports anchor Tom Campbell. In July 1978, WPTA replaced the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format for its newscasts with the \"Alive\" (as \"21 Alive\") format, originating from a studio doubling as the station's newsroom; [[WXIA-TV]] in Atlanta is another former Combined station that currently uses the \"Alive\" brand, though it abandoned the open newsroom concept in the early 1980s. In the summer of 1984, the station received its first live truck to assist in news production.\n\nAfter being taken over by Granite, WISE-TV's news department was promptly folded and combined with WPTA. The company fired most of WISE-TV's news staff, with the exception of lead anchor Linda Jackson, who became part of the WPTA operation and would eventually become morning co-anchor on WPTA. That station began airing a weeknight newscast at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. which was the first and only one in the state of Indiana at the time. On September 11, 2006, this was replaced due to low ratings with an additional episode of ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]''. In November 2005, after several months of using the \"Alive\" news brand on both stations, WPTA debuted a new set in its second studio formerly used to tape public-affairs programs such as ''Impact''. With it came a new branding for the newscasts, \"Indiana's NewsCenter\".\n\nWhen WPTA took over news production for WISE-TV, there was a significant decrease in ratings initially. WANE-TV became the market's news leader for several years after that, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]], since it was the only other local news operation in the area at the time. This was most easily attributed to continued viewer resentment towards WPTA and Granite for the elimination of WISE-TV's news department and arguably its identity and history. However, WPTA management said the changes were part of a longer-term plan that would need up to five years to take hold with viewers. Part of the plan to win back viewers included new technology such as text messaging, an improved website with more online video, and upgrading weather equipment to a VIPIR system.\n\nEventually, the changes started to take hold and ratings began to improve. In the November 2007 sweeps period, WPTA and WANE-TV were nearly neck-and-neck in the Fort Wayne television news ratings race with WANE-TV continuing to show a slight lead. On July 24, 2006, WISE-TV began airing a weeknight prime time newscast at 10&nbsp;p.m. for a half-hour on its NBC Weather Plus subchannel. With the September 2006 change to MyNetworkTV on WISE-DT2 and the addition of The CW on WPTA's second digital subchannel, the show (known as ''Indiana's NewsCenter Prime News'') became part of those channel's schedules through a simulcast. On May 18, 2009, WPTA and WISE-TV became the first two stations in Fort Wayne to air local newscasts in [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].\n\nIn September 2009, Granite began producing a pre-recorded weeknight prime time newscast at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on sister MyNetworkTV affiliate [[WMYD]] in Detroit, replacing a similar production by the [[Independent News Network]] The broadcast featured news anchor Melissa Long, chief meteorologist Curtis Smith, sports director Dean Pantazi, and a group of Detroit-based reporters. The co-production was established after the Butler Road facilities became a master control hub for Granite's Midwestern stations.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.fwbusiness.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5952:Good-evening,-Detroit&catid=51:latest&Itemid=6| title = Good evening, Detroit| publisher = KPC Media Group, Inc. }}</ref> The newscast was discontinued and taken in-house following the sale of WMYD to the owners of local ABC affiliate [[WXYZ-TV|WXYZ]].<ref name=\"Action News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wxyz.com/tv-20-detroit/tv-20-detroit-promotions/introducing-7-action-news-at-10-on-tv20-detroit|title=Introducing 7 Action News at 10 on TV20 Detroit|date=June 13, 2014|publisher=WXYZ website for WMYD|accessdate=June 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714131912/http://www.wxyz.com/tv-20-detroit/tv-20-detroit-promotions/introducing-7-action-news-at-10-on-tv20-detroit|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Indiana's NewsCenter'' era, WPTA co-produced newscasts with WISE-TV that were essentially the same in terms of coverage and format. Shows simulcast on both stations included weekday morning (except for the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour on WPTA), weeknight 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and weekend newscasts. WPTA aired separate weekday noon and weeknight 5:00&nbsp; p.m., 5:30&nbsp; p.m. and 11:00&nbsp; p.m. newscasts. WISE-TV did not (and continues not to) air newscasts on weeknights at 5 and 5:30&nbsp;p.m. unlike most NBC affiliates in the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. For a time, WISE-DT2 offered rebroadcasts of the entire weekday morning (at 7:00&nbsp;a.m.), noon (at 1:00&nbsp;p.m.) and weeknight 6:00&nbsp;p.m. (at 6:30&nbsp;p.m.) newscasts.\n\nOn October 14, 2012, at 11:00&nbsp;p.m., WPTA began broadcasting its newscasts in high definition. With this, newscasts on the station returned to the ''21 Alive News'' brand. WPTA and WISE-TV continued to simulcast newscasts under respective titles until March 4, 2013, when the latter station began airing its own newscasts with a separate news team. News resources such as video footage continue to be shared between the two stations. Parts of the \"Indiana's NewsCenter\" brand remained in use over the next two years, including the station's website, INCnow.tv; in October 2014, WPTA changed its web address to 21alive.com, with the website now prominently displaying the two stations' logos.\n\nIn a presentation submitted to the FCC in August 2014, Quincy said that its plans for WPTA and WISE-TV include the construction of a new studio facility at the WPTA site, after which both stations would produce competing live newscasts and maintain separate websites.<ref>[https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101648128&qnum=5120&copynum=1&exhcnum=2] (Referenced p. 43)</ref> This plan was effectively maintained after the decision to transfer WISE-TV's NBC affiliation to WPTA-DT2, for which Quincy will produce a separate news product from that of the main channel. Construction on an addition to the WPTA studios commenced in the spring of 2016, and Quincy subsequently posted job listings for news personnel. Quincy said in a statement that WPTA would become the largest news operation in its stable.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/wsjv-gm-starts-at-quincys-fort-wayne-station/171493 | title = WSJV GM Starts at Quincy\u2019s Fort Wayne Station | publisher = AdWeek Network}}</ref>\n\nThe addition would become known on-air as \"Television Park.\" This includes two studio spaces with matching control rooms at opposing ends of a larger newsroom shared by the WPTA-ABC and WPTA-NBC news teams. Built by the FX Group, WPTA's new set was rolled out to Quincy stations [[WREX]], KBJR-TV, [[KWWL (TV)|KWWL]], WEEK-TV and [[WKOW]] later in the year. The former \"Indiana's NewsCenter\" studio was set to be converted to a work space for the station's production department.\n\nIn the months following Quincy's acquisition of WPTA, several popular on-air personalities left the station. Evening anchor Melissa Long retired after 23 years at the end of 2015; within months, chief meteorologist Curtis Smith and sports director Tommy Schoegler took positions at [[Parkview Health]] after 21 and 13 years respectively, breaking up what had mostly been a static anchor team about for a decade. In July 2016, WISE-TV weather specialist Katie Law also left for Parkview. Weekend meteorologist Matt Leach, who filled Law's place in the meantime, left at the end of the month to work at a mental health non-profit. Late that month, two anchors from South Bend sister station WSJV were transferred to WPTA for its impending newscasts on the NBC subchannel. This came as WSJV's news operation wound down due to Quincy trading its Fox affiliation for [[Sinclair Broadcast Group|Sinclair's]] ABC and CW affiliations in Peoria. In September, amid further changes to WPTA's anchor teams, former WSJV reporter Alexis Gray began as evening co-anchor and Leach returned to the station as chief meteorologist.\n\nWPTA relaunched its newscasts as ''ABC21 News'' on November 7, 2016, from its new facilities, marking the end of the 21 Alive brand after 38 years.  It soon brought on board a fourth meteorologist, a first for the station, which now uses the slogan \"Your Weather Authority\". ABC21 became the first station in northeastern Indiana to begin morning news at 4:30&nbsp;a.m. and added four hours of weekend morning news to its programming slate. With the relaunch of a full slate of newscasts on \"Fort Wayne's NBC\" on November 21, 2016, a total of 50\u00bd hours per week of news content aired on WPTA channels 21.1 and 21.2. The ''Indiana's NewsCenter'' brand was abandoned with the relaunch of newscasts on 21.1 and 21.2.\n\nOn November 3, 2017, WPTA's ABC21 was named Station of the Year in market 2 (stations outside of Indianapolis) at the Indiana Broadcasters Association Spectrum Awards banquet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indianabroadcasters.org/iba-news/broadcast-excellence-celebrated-at-30th-annual-spectrum-awards/|title=Broadcast Excellence Celebrated at 30th Annual Spectrum Awards}}</ref> In 2018, channel honors included two Regional Edward R.

The simulcast of the half-hour 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast was dropped in September 2011, replaced by syndicated programming supplied by the national CW Plus feed.\n\nWhen WPTA-DT2 assumed the program stream formerly aired by WISE-TV, it initially continued WISE's preexisting 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts under the \"NBC33 News\" name, although on-air personnel took to using the new \"Fort Wayne's NBC\" name. On November 21, 2016, Quincy relaunched its newscasts for the Fort Wayne operation, having transferred two anchors from its shuttered [[WSJV]] operation as well as Linda Jackson and meteorologist Chris Daniels from sister channel WPTA/ABC21's morning newscasts to make up the evening anchor team on WPTA-DT2. Additional hires were made, and the channel began broadcasting a slate of live newscasts seven days a week.\n\nIn 2019, \"Fort Wayne's NBC\" received the Lower Great Lakes region Emmy Award for Overall Excellence -- one of two Emmy wins and four nominations in total.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nataslgl.org/pdfs/50th_Lower_Great_Lake_Nominations.pdf|title=50th Lower Great Lakes Emmy Nominations}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortwaynesnbc.com/news/top-stories/2019/06/16/fort-waynes-nbc-accepts-emmy-award-for-overall-excellence/|title=Fort Wayne's NBC accepts Emmy Award for Overall Excellence|date=June 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nataslgl.org/awards/2019-emmy-winners/|title=2019 Emmy Winners \u00bb NATAS Lower Great Lakes Chapter|website=NATAS Lower Great Lakes Chapter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> The channel also received its first Regional Edward R.

Known on-air as ''Indiana's NewsCenter Prime News'', the 30-minute weeknight program pre-empted regular NBC Weather Plus programming normally seen in the timeslot. It began to be simulcast on WPTA-DT2 when that subchannel launched as a CW affiliate that September. As a MyNetworkTV outlet, WISE-DT2 began to air repeats of its parent station's weekday morning newscast at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., WPTA's midday newscast (at 1:00&nbsp;p.m.), and the weeknight 6 o'clock broadcast at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. Although WISE-TV and WPTA became the only stations in Fort Wayne to upgrade their local newscasts to 16:9 [[widescreen]] [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced definition]] on May 18, 2009, all newscasts seen on WISE-DT2 remained in pillarboxed [[4:3]] standard definition.\n\nAfter WISE-DT2 joined Fox, ''Indiana's NewsCenter Prime News'' was upgraded to widescreen SD. WPTA-DT2's simulcast of that program as well as the repeats of local newscasts from WISE and WPTA on WISE-DT2's schedule were dropped at some point in the fall of 2011. Corresponding with WISE-TV and WPTA further upgrading to full HD newscasts, the prime time newscast on the subchannel was relaunched as ''MyFox Fort Wayne News at 10'' on October 14, 2012, and began originating from a new secondary set. The program also introduced an updated graphics package and news music package that is separate from the on-air presentation of the main WISE-TV channel's local news programs. The broadcast continued to air only weeknights for a half-hour. On February 5, 2013, following the announcement that Fox programming would move back to WFFT on March 1, the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast was cancelled.  On March 4, 2013, WISE-TV began newscasts at 4:00&nbsp;p.m., 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. that effectively revived the format used on the WISE-DT2 newscast.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n*[[Keith Edwards (news anchor)|Keith Edwards]] \u2013 news anchor (1983\u20132007; now retired)\n*[[Janette Luu]] \u2013 weekend news anchor/reporter (until 2005; later at [[CKXT-DT|CKXT-TV]] in [[Toronto]])\n*[[Marti Wright]] \u2013 news anchor/reporter (1981\u20132000; resigned after [[DWI]] in [[Auburn, Indiana]])\n\n==See also==\n*[[Channel 21 virtual TV stations in the United States]]\n*[[Channel 24 digital TV stations in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.wpta21.com/}}\n*[https://www.fortwaynesnbc.com/ Fort Wayne's NBC official website]\n*[https://www.wpta21.com/link/776859/my-tv MyTV Fort Wayne official website]\n*{{TVQ|WPTA}}\n\n{{Indiana's NewsCenter}}\n{{Fort Wayne TV}}\n{{ABC Indiana}}\n{{NBC Indiana}}\n{{MNTV Indiana}}\n{{QNI}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wpta}}\n[[Category:ABC network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Quincy Media]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Fort Wayne, Indiana|PTA]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1957]]\n[[Category:1957 establishments in Indiana]]\n[[Category:Indianapolis Colts broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Mid-American Conference broadcasters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|ABC/NBC/MyNetworkTV affiliate in Fort Wayne, Indiana}}\n{{distinguish|WAPT|WPAT-FM}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox broadcast\n\n| call_letters             = WPTA\n| city                     = \n| station_logo             = [[File:WPTA 2016 Logo.png|150px]]\n----\n[[File:Fort Wayne's NBC logo.png|200px]]\n----\n[[File:Wise dt2 2009.png|175px]]\n| station_branding         = {{ubl|ABC 21 ''(general)''|''ABC 21 News'' ''(newscasts)''|Fort Wayne's NBC ''(general, on DT2)''|''Fort Wayne's NBC News'' ''(newscasts, on DT2)''|MyTV Fort Wayne ''(on DT3)''}}\n| station_slogan           = ''Your Weather Authority.''<br>''Focused on the Fort'' ''(on DT2)''\n| digital                  = 24 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n| virtual                  = 21 ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]])\n| subchannels              = \n| other_chs                = \n| affiliations             = {{ubl|'''21.1:''' [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|'''21.2:''' [[NBC]]|'''21.3:''' [[MyNetworkTV]]}}\n| owner                    = [[Quincy Media]]\n| licensee                 = WPTA License, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]\n| location                 = [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]\n| country                  = United States\n| airdate                  = {{start date and age|1957|9|28|p=y}}\n| enddate                  = \n| callsign_meaning         = '''W''' '''P'''atricia & '''T'''homas '''TA'''rzian (children of Sarkes Tarzian)\n| sister_stations          = [[WISE-TV]]\n| former_callsigns         = \n| former_channel_numbers   = '''Analog:'''<br>21 (UHF, 1957\u20132009)\n| former_affiliations      = '''DT2:'''<br>[[The WB]] (1998\u20132006)<br />[[The CW]] (2006\u20132016)\n| effective_radiated_power = 335 [[kilowatt|kW]]\n| HAAT                     = {{convert|224.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}\n| facility_id              = 73905\n| coordinates              = {{Coord|41|6|7.9|N|85|11|4.9|W|type:landmark_scale:2000}}\n| licensing_authority      = [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]\n| homepage                 = {{URL|https://www.wpta21.com/}}<br>{{URL|https://www.fortwaynesnbc.com/}}<br>{{URL|https://www.wpta21.com/link/776859/my-tv}}\n}}\n\n'''WPTA''', [[virtual channel]] 21 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 24), is a dual [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[NBC]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], United States. The station is owned by [[Quincy Media]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[The CW Plus|CW]] affiliate [[WISE-TV]] (channel 33). The two stations share studios and transmitter facilities on Butler Road in [[List of neighborhoods in Fort Wayne, Indiana|Northwest Fort Wayne]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on September 28, 1957. It was founded by [[Sarkes Tarzian]], an [[Indianapolis]] engineer whose company owned [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]'s [[WTTV]] and several other stations in Indiana. The WPTA call letters come from the long tradition of other Tarzian stations, including once former sister station [[WAJI|WPTH]], that base the call letters upon the initials of family members of company management. Upon its launch, channel 21 took all ABC programming from NBC affiliate WKJG-TV (channel 33, now [[WISE-TV]]) and [[CBS]] affiliate [[WANE-TV]] (channel 15).\n\nUnder [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules at that time, the [[media market|market]] was deemed too small to support three full-power stations, so Tarzian's application listed WPTA's city of license as the small town of [[Roanoke, Indiana]], located just across the [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen]]/[[Huntington County, Indiana|Huntington]] county line approximately {{convert|14|mi|km}} to the southwest of its studios and transmitter in Fort Wayne. This was possible because the FCC had by this time allowed a station to have its main studio in a different location from its city of license. WPTA identified itself as \"Roanoke/Fort Wayne\" on-air until the license was officially transferred to Fort Wayne sometime in the 1970s.\n\nIn addition to ABC programming, it also originally aired seven-and-a-half hours of live local programming each week. In 1957, the station aired a spin-off of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' called ''Teen Dance'' and the afternoon kids show ''Popeye and the Rascals''. In 1964, a {{convert|2226|sqft|m2|adj=on}} addition to its studios was added to accommodate an expanding sales staff. On April 4, 1973, Tarzian sold the station to Combined Communications for $3.6 million. Under new management, WPTA purchased new cameras and a more modern switcher. On June 7, 1979, Combined merged with the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]].\n\nOn May 12, 1983, Gannett sold WPTA (along with [[WLKY]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]) to [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer]] Publishing for an undisclosed amount after it purchased [[WLVI-TV]] in [[Boston]] from [[Field Communications]] and WTCN-TV (now [[KARE]]) in [[Minneapolis]] from [[Metromedia]]. This was because the WLVI-TV and WTCN purchases put Gannett with two stations over the Federal Communications Commission's seven-station ownership limit for television stations that was in effect at the time. The station was sold again to [[Granite Broadcasting]] on September 25, 1989, for $22.15 million. In late-1998 alongside the launch of [[The WB 100+ Station Group|The WB 100+]] and its cable-only affiliates, WPTA began managing and providing promotional services for WBFW, which used that callsign in a fictional manner since it was a cable-exclusive service.\n\nWhen [[WSJV]] in [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] (which signed on three years before WPTA) switched to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1995, WPTA became the longest-tenured ABC affiliate in Indiana. At one time (according to Granite Broadcasting's website),<ref name=\"strongestABC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.granitetv.com/|publisher=[[Granite Broadcasting]]|date=January 19, 1997|title=Granite Broadcasting Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970119044634/http://www.granitetv.com/|archivedate=January 19, 1997|accessdate=April 7, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> WPTA was among the ten strongest ABC affiliates in the country, ranking with [[WISN-TV]] in Milwaukee, [[KMBC-TV]] Kansas City, and [[KOCO-TV]] in Oklahoma City.\n\nOn March 9, 2005, after Granite bought NBC affiliate WISE-TV, it sold WPTA to the [[Malara Broadcast Group]] for $45.3 million. A [[local marketing agreement]] (LMA) was established whereby Granite would provide operational services to WPTA and Malara's other new station [[KDLH]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. Although WISE-TV is nominally the senior partner in this LMA, the stations' combined operation is based at WPTA's studios and the bulk of the news staff came from WPTA (see below). Malara jointly files its [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) reports with Granite which led to allegations that the company uses Malara as a [[shell corporation]] for Granite. If the allegations are proven to be true, Granite would be guilty of evading FCC duopoly rules. The FCC does not allow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. Additionally, Fort Wayne has only six full-power stations (only four of which are licensed as commercial outlets)\u2014too few to legally allow duopolies in any case. After emerging from bankruptcy in the summer of 2007, Granite stock was taken over by the privately owned [[hedge fund]] Silver Point Capital of Greenwich, Connecticut. Silver Point Capital now controls Granite according to a Buffalo, New York, news article printed September 16, 2007. According to the same article, Granite planned to sell its properties to other parties and many of its stations laid off employees or cut salaries up to 20 percent.\n\nIn March 2006, [[The CW]] (a new network being formed as a merger of [[The WB]] and [[UPN]]) announced that cable-only [[The WB 100+ Station Group|WB 100+ Station Group]] affiliate \"WBFW\" would become the network's Fort Wayne affiliate as part of [[The CW Plus]] (a similar small-market master feed to The WB 100+). WPTA decided to create a new second digital subchannel to simulcast \"WBFW\" and offer access to CW programming for over-the-air viewers. On September 18, The CW launched on WPTA-DT2. This move\u2014along with [[WISE-DT2]]'s switch to [[MyNetworkTV]] on September 5\u2014resulted in the deactivation of WANE-TV's second digital subchannel. It had been affiliated with UPN prior to the network's shutdown (that subchannel remained [[Dark (broadcasting)|dark]] until 2010, when it affiliated with [[TheCoolTV]]).\n\nOn September 28, 2007, WPTA unveiled a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] version of its \"21 Alive\" logo to commemorate the station's 50th anniversary, in conjunction with ABC's new image campaign but did not fully switch to it until August 4, 2008. On January 10, 2009, WPTA brought a new digital master control center online which services the station, WISE-TV and Granite's other stations in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n\nOn February 11, 2014, [[Quincy Media]] agreed to purchase WPTA from the Malara Broadcast Group as part of a deal to purchase Granite Broadcasting's stations in four markets (the other stations were [[KBJR-TV]] in [[Superior, Wisconsin]] and its satellite KRII in [[Chisholm, Minnesota]], [[WEEK-TV]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]] and [[WBNG-TV]] in [[Binghamton, New York]]). Quincy opted to purchase WPTA's license instead of WISE's license because WPTA has been the higher-rated of the two stations in the local viewership ratings.

Since it was cable-exclusive and therefore not licensed by the FCC, the channel's call letters were used in a fictional manner. It was managed and promoted by WPTA, which at the time was owned outright by Granite Broadcasting. When that station's license was transferred to Granite partner company, the Malara Broadcast Group in 2005, '''\"WBFW\"''' became managed by the company. Prior to the sign-on of '''\"WBFW\"''', Fort Wayne viewers received their WB programs via Chicago-based [[WGN America|superstation WGN]], and for a few months in 1998, WTTV when that station dropped UPN in January of that year and picked up The WB in April of that year.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] and [[CBS Corporation]] announced the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/ 'Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September], [[CNNMoney.com]], January 24, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 2006.</ref> One month later on February 22, [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] announced the launch of a new \"sixth\" network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by [[Fox Television Stations]] and its syndication division [[Twentieth Television]]. MyNetworkTV was created to compete against The CW as well as to give UPN and WB stations that would not become CW affiliates, another option besides converting to independent stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=News Corp. to launch new mini-network for UPN stations|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-02-22-fox-my-network_x.htm|accessdate=January 21, 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/102922-News_Corp_Unveils_My_Network_TV.php News Corp.

WPTA decided to create a new second digital subchannel to simulcast '''\"WBFW\"''' and offer access to CW programming for over-the-air viewers. Meanwhile, on September 5, WISE-TV moved [[NBC Weather Plus]] from its second digital subchannel in order for it to become the area's affiliate of MyNetworkTV. Weather Plus then began airing on WISE-DT3. On September 18, The CW debuted on \"WBFW\" which officially began using the '''WPTA-DT2''' calls. The move resulted in the deactivation of CBS affiliate WANE-TV (channel 15)'s second digital subchannel, which had been affiliated with UPN prior to the network's shutdown (and remained dark until it affiliated with TheCoolTV in 2011).\n\n===WPTA-DT3 (MyTV Fort Wayne)===\n'''WPTA-DT3''' is the MyNetworkTV-affiliated third digital subchannel of WPTA, broadcasting a [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] signal on UHF channel 24.3 (or virtual channel 21.3 via PSIP).\n\n====History====\n[[File:WISE-TV Fox Logo.png|200px|thumb|left|Previous logo used from 2011 until March 1, 2013.]]\nOriginally established in 2005, WISE-DT2 was part of NBC Weather Plus and known on-air as \"Indiana's NewsCenter Weather Plus\". The 24-hour weather channel provided local and national weather forecasts.

On September 5, 2006, WISE-TV moved NBC Weather Plus programming to its third digital subchannel in order for WISE-DT2 to become the area's MyNetworkTV affiliate. The move\u2014along with \"WBFW\" affiliating with The CW (with the channel being carried on WPTA's second digital subchannel) on September 18\u2014resulted in the deactivation of WANE's second digital subchannel, which remained dark until it affiliated with TheCoolTV in 2010.\n\nIn June 2011, it was announced that WISE-DT2 would join Fox beginning August 1, 2011, taking the affiliation from then-current outlet [[WFFT-TV]] (owned by the [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]]). The switch was the result of a dispute over [[retransmission consent]] fees between Nexstar and Fox. Upon the switch, the station shifted MyNetworkTV to secondary status on WISE-DT2 and began airing the two-hour weeknight programming block from 10:30&nbsp;p.m. until 12:30&nbsp;a.m. The first Fox program to air on WISE-DT2 was ''[[Hell's Kitchen (American TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]''. With the addition of high definition capabilities to this station, WISE-DT3 (which featured 24-hour national [[NBC Plus]] [successor to NBC Weather Plus] and local \"The [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] Channel\" weather programming) moved to WPTA's third digital subchannel (currently home to ''Indiana's NewsCenter Now''). It is unknown if the two services will be merged in any way or if one will be dropped. The station was upgraded to a 720p high definition signal on June 27.<ref name=tvnc-wisedt2fox>{{cite news|title=Fox Moves Afills In Springfield, Ft.

While WPTA has a [[Doppler weather radar|weather radar]] dating back to the late 1990s on its premises, it has used [[NEXRAD]] data exclusively since 2007, first with Baron Systems' [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] processing under the name ''Pinpoint VIPIR HD'', then from 2016 onwards with [[The Weather Company|The Weather Company's]] Max Radar as a result of the station's acquisition by Quincy.\n\n[[File:WPTA_2013_Logo.png|150px|thumb|right|WPTA's \"21 Alive\" logo until November 7, 2016.]]\nUnder Combined Communications ownership, WPTA significantly invested in its news department. During that time, Wes Sims and Harry Gallagher served as co-anchors with meteorologist Bill Eisenhood and sports anchor Tom Campbell. In July 1978, WPTA replaced the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format for its newscasts with the \"Alive\" (as \"21 Alive\") format, originating from a studio doubling as the station's newsroom; [[WXIA-TV]] in Atlanta is another former Combined station that currently uses the \"Alive\" brand, though it abandoned the open newsroom concept in the early 1980s. In the summer of 1984, the station received its first live truck to assist in news production.\n\nAfter being taken over by Granite, WISE-TV's news department was promptly folded and combined with WPTA. The company fired most of WISE-TV's news staff, with the exception of lead anchor Linda Jackson, who became part of the WPTA operation and would eventually become morning co-anchor on WPTA. That station began airing a weeknight newscast at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. which was the first and only one in the state of Indiana at the time. On September 11, 2006, this was replaced due to low ratings with an additional episode of ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]''. In November 2005, after several months of using the \"Alive\" news brand on both stations, WPTA debuted a new set in its second studio formerly used to tape public-affairs programs such as ''Impact''. With it came a new branding for the newscasts, \"Indiana's NewsCenter\".\n\nWhen WPTA took over news production for WISE-TV, there was a significant decrease in ratings initially. WANE-TV became the market's news leader for several years after that, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]], since it was the only other local news operation in the area at the time. This was most easily attributed to continued viewer resentment towards WPTA and Granite for the elimination of WISE-TV's news department and arguably its identity and history. However, WPTA management said the changes were part of a longer-term plan that would need up to five years to take hold with viewers. Part of the plan to win back viewers included new technology such as text messaging, an improved website with more online video, and upgrading weather equipment to a VIPIR system.\n\nEventually, the changes started to take hold and ratings began to improve. In the November 2007 sweeps period, WPTA and WANE-TV were nearly neck-and-neck in the Fort Wayne television news ratings race with WANE-TV continuing to show a slight lead. On July 24, 2006, WISE-TV began airing a weeknight prime time newscast at 10&nbsp;p.m. for a half-hour on its NBC Weather Plus subchannel. With the September 2006 change to MyNetworkTV on WISE-DT2 and the addition of The CW on WPTA's second digital subchannel, the show (known as ''Indiana's NewsCenter Prime News'') became part of those channel's schedules through a simulcast. On May 18, 2009, WPTA and WISE-TV became the first two stations in Fort Wayne to air local newscasts in [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].\n\nIn September 2009, Granite began producing a pre-recorded weeknight prime time newscast at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on sister MyNetworkTV affiliate [[WMYD]] in Detroit, replacing a similar production by the [[Independent News Network]] The broadcast featured news anchor Melissa Long, chief meteorologist Curtis Smith, sports director Dean Pantazi, and a group of Detroit-based reporters. The co-production was established after the Butler Road facilities became a master control hub for Granite's Midwestern stations.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.fwbusiness.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5952:Good-evening,-Detroit&catid=51:latest&Itemid=6| title = Good evening, Detroit| publisher = KPC Media Group, Inc. }}</ref> The newscast was discontinued and taken in-house following the sale of WMYD to the owners of local ABC affiliate [[WXYZ-TV|WXYZ]].<ref name=\"Action News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wxyz.com/tv-20-detroit/tv-20-detroit-promotions/introducing-7-action-news-at-10-on-tv20-detroit|title=Introducing 7 Action News at 10 on TV20 Detroit|date=June 13, 2014|publisher=WXYZ website for WMYD|accessdate=June 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714131912/http://www.wxyz.com/tv-20-detroit/tv-20-detroit-promotions/introducing-7-action-news-at-10-on-tv20-detroit|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Indiana's NewsCenter'' era, WPTA co-produced newscasts with WISE-TV that were essentially the same in terms of coverage and format. Shows simulcast on both stations included weekday morning (except for the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour on WPTA), weeknight 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and weekend newscasts. WPTA aired separate weekday noon and weeknight 5:00&nbsp; p.m., 5:30&nbsp; p.m. and 11:00&nbsp; p.m. newscasts. WISE-TV did not (and continues not to) air newscasts on weeknights at 5 and 5:30&nbsp;p.m. unlike most NBC affiliates in the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. For a time, WISE-DT2 offered rebroadcasts of the entire weekday morning (at 7:00&nbsp;a.m.), noon (at 1:00&nbsp;p.m.) and weeknight 6:00&nbsp;p.m. (at 6:30&nbsp;p.m.) newscasts.\n\nOn October 14, 2012, at 11:00&nbsp;p.m., WPTA began broadcasting its newscasts in high definition. With this, newscasts on the station returned to the ''21 Alive News'' brand. WPTA and WISE-TV continued to simulcast newscasts under respective titles until March 4, 2013, when the latter station began airing its own newscasts with a separate news team. News resources such as video footage continue to be shared between the two stations. Parts of the \"Indiana's NewsCenter\" brand remained in use over the next two years, including the station's website, INCnow.tv; in October 2014, WPTA changed its web address to 21alive.com, with the website now prominently displaying the two stations' logos.\n\nIn a presentation submitted to the FCC in August 2014, Quincy said that its plans for WPTA and WISE-TV include the construction of a new studio facility at the WPTA site, after which both stations would produce competing live newscasts and maintain separate websites.<ref>[https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101648128&qnum=5120&copynum=1&exhcnum=2] (Referenced p. 43)</ref> This plan was effectively maintained after the decision to transfer WISE-TV's NBC affiliation to WPTA-DT2, for which Quincy will produce a separate news product from that of the main channel. Construction on an addition to the WPTA studios commenced in the spring of 2016, and Quincy subsequently posted job listings for news personnel. Quincy said in a statement that WPTA would become the largest news operation in its stable.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/wsjv-gm-starts-at-quincys-fort-wayne-station/171493 | title = WSJV GM Starts at Quincy\u2019s Fort Wayne Station | publisher = AdWeek Network}}</ref>\n\nThe addition would become known on-air as \"Television Park.\" This includes two studio spaces with matching control rooms at opposing ends of a larger newsroom shared by the WPTA-ABC and WPTA-NBC news teams. Built by the FX Group, WPTA's new set was rolled out to Quincy stations [[WREX]], KBJR-TV, [[KWWL (TV)|KWWL]], WEEK-TV and [[WKOW]] later in the year. The former \"Indiana's NewsCenter\" studio was set to be converted to a work space for the station's production department.\n\nIn the months following Quincy's acquisition of WPTA, several popular on-air personalities left the station. Evening anchor Melissa Long retired after 23 years at the end of 2015; within months, chief meteorologist Curtis Smith and sports director Tommy Schoegler took positions at [[Parkview Health]] after 21 and 13 years respectively, breaking up what had mostly been a static anchor team about for a decade. In July 2016, WISE-TV weather specialist Katie Law also left for Parkview. Weekend meteorologist Matt Leach, who filled Law's place in the meantime, left at the end of the month to work at a mental health non-profit. Late that month, two anchors from South Bend sister station WSJV were transferred to WPTA for its impending newscasts on the NBC subchannel. This came as WSJV's news operation wound down due to Quincy trading its Fox affiliation for [[Sinclair Broadcast Group|Sinclair's]] ABC and CW affiliations in Peoria. In September, amid further changes to WPTA's anchor teams, former WSJV reporter Alexis Gray began as evening co-anchor and Leach returned to the station as chief meteorologist.\n\nWPTA relaunched its newscasts as ''ABC21 News'' on November 7, 2016, from its new facilities, marking the end of the 21 Alive brand after 38 years.  It soon brought on board a fourth meteorologist, a first for the station, which now uses the slogan \"Your Weather Authority\". ABC21 became the first station in northeastern Indiana to begin morning news at 4:30&nbsp;a.m. and added four hours of weekend morning news to its programming slate. With the relaunch of a full slate of newscasts on \"Fort Wayne's NBC\" on November 21, 2016, a total of 50\u00bd hours per week of news content aired on WPTA channels 21.1 and 21.2. The ''Indiana's NewsCenter'' brand was abandoned with the relaunch of newscasts on 21.1 and 21.2.\n\nOn November 3, 2017, WPTA's ABC21 was named Station of the Year in market 2 (stations outside of Indianapolis) at the Indiana Broadcasters Association Spectrum Awards banquet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indianabroadcasters.org/iba-news/broadcast-excellence-celebrated-at-30th-annual-spectrum-awards/|title=Broadcast Excellence Celebrated at 30th Annual Spectrum Awards}}</ref> In 2018, channel honors included two Regional Edward R.

The simulcast of the half-hour 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast was dropped in September 2011, replaced by syndicated programming supplied by the national CW Plus feed.\n\nWhen WPTA-DT2 assumed the program stream formerly aired by WISE-TV, it initially continued WISE's preexisting 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts under the \"NBC33 News\" name, although on-air personnel took to using the new \"Fort Wayne's NBC\" name. On November 21, 2016, Quincy relaunched its newscasts for the Fort Wayne operation, having transferred two anchors from its shuttered [[WSJV]] operation as well as Linda Jackson and meteorologist Chris Daniels from sister channel WPTA/ABC21's morning newscasts to make up the evening anchor team on WPTA-DT2. Additional hires were made, and the channel began broadcasting a slate of live newscasts seven days a week.\n\nIn 2019, \"Fort Wayne's NBC\" received the Lower Great Lakes region Emmy Award for Overall Excellence -- one of two Emmy wins and four nominations in total.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nataslgl.org/pdfs/50th_Lower_Great_Lake_Nominations.pdf|title=50th Lower Great Lakes Emmy Nominations}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortwaynesnbc.com/news/top-stories/2019/06/16/fort-waynes-nbc-accepts-emmy-award-for-overall-excellence/|title=Fort Wayne's NBC accepts Emmy Award for Overall Excellence|date=June 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nataslgl.org/awards/2019-emmy-winners/|title=2019 Emmy Winners \u00bb NATAS Lower Great Lakes Chapter|website=NATAS Lower Great Lakes Chapter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> The channel also received its first Regional Edward R.

Known on-air as ''Indiana's NewsCenter Prime News'', the 30-minute weeknight program pre-empted regular NBC Weather Plus programming normally seen in the timeslot. It began to be simulcast on WPTA-DT2 when that subchannel launched as a CW affiliate that September. As a MyNetworkTV outlet, WISE-DT2 began to air repeats of its parent station's weekday morning newscast at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., WPTA's midday newscast (at 1:00&nbsp;p.m.), and the weeknight 6 o'clock broadcast at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. Although WISE-TV and WPTA became the only stations in Fort Wayne to upgrade their local newscasts to 16:9 [[widescreen]] [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced definition]] on May 18, 2009, all newscasts seen on WISE-DT2 remained in pillarboxed [[4:3]] standard definition.\n\nAfter WISE-DT2 joined Fox, ''Indiana's NewsCenter Prime News'' was upgraded to widescreen SD. WPTA-DT2's simulcast of that program as well as the repeats of local newscasts from WISE and WPTA on WISE-DT2's schedule were dropped at some point in the fall of 2011. Corresponding with WISE-TV and WPTA further upgrading to full HD newscasts, the prime time newscast on the subchannel was relaunched as ''MyFox Fort Wayne News at 10'' on October 14, 2012, and began originating from a new secondary set. The program also introduced an updated graphics package and news music package that is separate from the on-air presentation of the main WISE-TV channel's local news programs. The broadcast continued to air only weeknights for a half-hour. On February 5, 2013, following the announcement that Fox programming would move back to WFFT on March 1, the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast was cancelled.  On March 4, 2013, WISE-TV began newscasts at 4:00&nbsp;p.m., 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. that effectively revived the format used on the WISE-DT2 newscast.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n*[[Keith Edwards (news anchor)|Keith Edwards]] \u2013 news anchor (1983\u20132007; now retired)\n*[[Janette Luu]] \u2013 weekend news anchor/reporter (until 2005; later at [[CKXT-DT|CKXT-TV]] in [[Toronto]])\n*[[Marti Wright]] \u2013 news anchor/reporter (1981\u20132000; resigned after [[DWI]] in [[Auburn, Indiana]])\n\n==See also==\n*[[Channel 21 virtual TV stations in the United States]]\n*[[Channel 24 digital TV stations in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.wpta21.com/}}\n*[https://www.fortwaynesnbc.com/ Fort Wayne's NBC official website]\n*[https://www.wpta21.com/link/776859/my-tv MyTV Fort Wayne official website]\n*{{TVQ|WPTA}}\n\n{{Indiana's NewsCenter}}\n{{Fort Wayne TV}}\n{{ABC Indiana}}\n{{NBC Indiana}}\n{{MNTV Indiana}}\n{{QNI}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wpta}}\n[[Category:ABC network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Quincy Media]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Fort Wayne, Indiana|PTA]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1957]]\n[[Category:1957 establishments in Indiana]]\n[[Category:Indianapolis Colts broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Mid-American Conference broadcasters]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPTA"}

The station is owned by [[Pamal Broadcasting]] and broadcasts at 6 kilowatts [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] from a location near the boundary of [[Colonie (town), New York|Colonie]] and [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] adjacent to the station's former studios (which are now vacant as of November 2010).\n\n==History==\nThe 100.9 frequency signed on in 1972 as '''WWOM''' (Wonderful World of Music), an [[easy listening]] station going against up WROW-FM and [[WGY-FM|WHRL]]. With two somewhat established rivals, the station quickly left the format and went through a variation of formats, including several variants of [[adult contemporary]] (mid-1970s and again starting in 1980), [[soft rock]] (1977\u201378), and then [[album-oriented rock]], briefly in late 1978/early 1979, identifying itself as \"WWOM-Albany NY's Best Rock\" in its legal ID, putting it into direct competition with [[WPBZ-FM|WQBK-FM]]. The station then abruptly flipped to [[disco]] early in the spring of 1979, and then to [[Soft AC]] in the summer of 1980. During this period, the station struggled in both ratings and revenue.\n\nIn 1984, local businessman William Sellwood bought WWOM as a companion to [[WAMC (AM)|WABY]] (then on 1400 AM). Two years later, Sellwood relaunched the station as \"K-Lite 101\" with the '''WKLI''' calls coming into use. With no FM competition for adult contemporary music, the station quickly became a success and spent several years in the Top 5 stations (12+) in the market with many books as the No. 1 in some demographics and time periods, a rarity for a lower powered signal in the Albany market. In 1990, Paul Bendat purchased the station. After WROW-FM flipped to [[WYJB]] in early 1994, WKLI's ratings underwent a decline as listeners flocked to the far stronger signal of WYJB.\n\nOn January 12, 1996, [[WKBE]] joined WKLI in a simulcast of \"K-Lite\" (without the '101' brand); however, the format ended just over two months later when WKLI and [[WKBE]] in [[Warrensburg, New York]] joined together and flipped to a [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40/CHR]] genre as \"K-100\" at 3 p.m. on March 18th.<ref>http://formatchange.com/1009-wkli1003-wkbe-become-k100/</ref> With the flip, the station became one of the charter affiliates of the syndication attempt of the ''Scott and Todd'' show from [[WPLJ]] in New York City which the station played as a homecoming of sorts for [[Todd Pettengill]] (an alum of rival [[WFLY]]). Though ''K-100'' stayed competitive with WFLY and [[WRVE]], changes in the format and the end of syndication of Scott & Todd in October 1998 marked a quick decline for the station which, by the end of 1998, was seeing ratings not seen in 3 decades.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-10-02.pdf</ref>\n\nIn February 1999, Paul Bendat sold his stations to Tele-Media, Inc., which relaunched the \"K-100\" format three months later as [[modern adult contemporary]] \"The Point\" gaining the new calls of '''WCPT'''; the WKLI calls and the old \"K-Lite\" name moved down to 94.5 FM (now [[WYKV]]). The station struggled to find an audience over the next two years amid staff and management changes as well as corporate problems on Tele-Media's end. Tele-Media sold WCPT and WKBE to Pamal Broadcasting in August 2001 with the sale closing in late October. While WKBE kept a modified version of the \"Point\" format which remains to this day, WCPT became [[adult standards]]/[[soft adult contemporary]] under the \"Magic\" name with the WKLI calls returning soon thereafter. Under this format, the station was always one of the top rated stations in the Albany market. As ''Magic'', the station would play Christmas music from mid-November to Christmas Day each year (starting in 2005 and until 2009, the last Christmas season under the format).\n\nPamal announced on February 8, 2010 that \"Magic\" would move to sister station [[WROW]], with WKLI-FM adopting a new format after a brief simulcast period.<ref name=\"wrgb-wklionwrow\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbs6albany.com/news/albany-1270918-magic-wrow.html|title=Albany Broadcasting to ditch WROW news talk program|last=Kim|first=Michelle|date=February 8, 2010|work=[[WRGB|WRGB CBS 6 Albany]]|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"atu-wklionwrow\">{{cite news|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/business/wrow-to-abandons-talk-radio-programming/17730/|title=WROW abandons talk radio programming|last=Churchill|first=Chris|date=February 8, 2010|work=[[Albany Times Union]]|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> After two weeks of simulcasting WROW, and a brief stunt with [[Christmas music]] and [[country music|country]], the station flipped to a [[variety hits]] format as ''100.9 The Bridge'' on February 24, 2010, with \"[[Under the Bridge]]\" by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] being the first (and final) song of the format.<ref name=\"tbr-wklifmbridge\">{{cite news|url=http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2010/02/22/daily27.html|title=Albany Broadcast to offer adult hits format|date=February 24, 2010|work=The Business Review|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref> However, the variety hits format failed to compete with dominant [[WRVE]] and would also take ratings away from sister WYJB, and the station saw its lowest ratings in over a decade.

Owned by [[TriMet]] and operated by [[Portland and Western Railroad]] (P&W), it serves five stations in the cities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]], [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]], and [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]]. The line spans {{convert|14.7|mi|km|1}}, traveling north\u2013south along the west side of [[Oregon Route 217|Oregon Highway 217]] and [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]]. It runs on a 30-minute headway on weekdays during the morning and evening [[rush hour]]s, connecting suburban commuters to [[MAX Light Rail]] at [[Beaverton Transit Center]]. In May 2018, WES carried an average 1,590 riders.\n\nLocal officials began exploring the possibility of an intercity commuter rail service in 1996 and the '''Washington County commuter rail project''' acquired approval from affected jurisdictions in 2002. Construction commenced in 2006 and the commuter rail line opened on February 2, 2009. From the start of the first serious discussions of the idea,<ref name=\"oreg96jul\">Hamilton, Don (July 18, 1996). \"Cities take another look at passenger trains\".  ''[[The Oregonian]]''.</ref> it took thirteen years and $166 million to get WES operational.<ref name=\"djc200907\">{{cite news |url=http://djcoregon.com/news/2009/07/07/state-studying-wes-possibilities|title=State studying WES possibilities |author=Justin Carinci |work=[[Daily Journal of Commerce]]|date=July 7, 2009 | accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe route of WES consists of two historically separate railroads.\n\nThe route between Greton (near [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]]) and [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] was originally built by the [[Oregon Electric Railway]] in 1908; at Greton the line continued northeasterly to Portland, a route that was abandoned in the mid-1930s.  The Oregon Electric stopped running passenger trains in the late 1930s and soon after switched to diesel locomotives, continuing to run freight trains to Beaverton and Portland to the north, and to Salem, Albany and Eugene to the south.\n\nThe route from Greton to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] was built by an affiliate of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] beginning in 1906, and opened to traffic in 1910.<ref>The Southern Pacific in Oregon, Ed Austin & Tom Dill</ref>  This route connected with Southern Pacific's existing west-east line in Beaverton that provided service to Portland and Hillsboro, and a second route south of Tigard to Cook, which was a junction with an existing route between Lake Oswego and McMinnville.  In 1914, the Southern Pacific electrified these lines as part of its [[Red Electric]] service in competition with the Oregon Electric Railway; by 1929 the Southern Pacific ended electric service, and passenger service was switched first to steam trains and [[Doodlebug (rail car)|doodlebugs]], and later buses.\n\nBoth the Southern Pacific and the Oregon Electric (and its successor [[Burlington Northern]]) continued to provide freight service on the line until the 1990s when both railroads leased its low-density branches to shortline operators.  In this case, the Southern Pacific leased its lines to newly formed [[Portland and Western Railroad]] in August 1995; followed by the Burlington Northern leasing its lines to the Portland & Western in October 1995.<ref>[http://www.brian894x4.com/PortlandandWesternRR.html PortlandandWesternRR]</ref> This put the operations of two competing railroads in the same hands for the first time in history.\n\nLed by [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]], planning for WES began in 1996, when county officials started working with the cities of Beaverton, [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]], [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]], Wilsonville and [[Sherwood, Oregon|Sherwood]], as well as government transportation agencies to study the idea of establishing passenger rail service between Beaverton and Wilsonville on the existing [[Portland and Western Railroad|P&W]] line.<ref name=\"oreg96jul\"/> [[TriMet]] took over as the project's lead planning agency in 2002.<ref>Gunderson, Laura (September 26, 2002). \"TriMet takes over lead on commuter rail\".

Owned by [[TriMet]] and operated by [[Portland and Western Railroad]] (P&W), it serves five stations in the cities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]], [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]], and [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]]. The line spans {{convert|14.7|mi|km|1}}, traveling north\u2013south along the west side of [[Oregon Route 217|Oregon Highway 217]] and [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]]. It runs on a 30-minute headway on weekdays during the morning and evening [[rush hour]]s, connecting suburban commuters to [[MAX Light Rail]] at [[Beaverton Transit Center]]. In May 2018, WES carried an average 1,590 riders.\n\nLocal officials began exploring the possibility of an intercity commuter rail service in 1996 and the '''Washington County commuter rail project''' acquired approval from affected jurisdictions in 2002. Construction commenced in 2006 and the commuter rail line opened on February 2, 2009. From the start of the first serious discussions of the idea,<ref name=\"oreg96jul\">Hamilton, Don (July 18, 1996). \"Cities take another look at passenger trains\".  ''[[The Oregonian]]''.</ref> it took thirteen years and $166 million to get WES operational.<ref name=\"djc200907\">{{cite news |url=http://djcoregon.com/news/2009/07/07/state-studying-wes-possibilities|title=State studying WES possibilities |author=Justin Carinci |work=[[Daily Journal of Commerce]]|date=July 7, 2009 | accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe route of WES consists of two historically separate railroads.\n\nThe route between Greton (near [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]]) and [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] was originally built by the [[Oregon Electric Railway]] in 1908; at Greton the line continued northeasterly to Portland, a route that was abandoned in the mid-1930s.  The Oregon Electric stopped running passenger trains in the late 1930s and soon after switched to diesel locomotives, continuing to run freight trains to Beaverton and Portland to the north, and to Salem, Albany and Eugene to the south.\n\nThe route from Greton to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] was built by an affiliate of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] beginning in 1906, and opened to traffic in 1910.<ref>The Southern Pacific in Oregon, Ed Austin & Tom Dill</ref>  This route connected with Southern Pacific's existing west-east line in Beaverton that provided service to Portland and Hillsboro, and a second route south of Tigard to Cook, which was a junction with an existing route between Lake Oswego and McMinnville.  In 1914, the Southern Pacific electrified these lines as part of its [[Red Electric]] service in competition with the Oregon Electric Railway; by 1929 the Southern Pacific ended electric service, and passenger service was switched first to steam trains and [[Doodlebug (rail car)|doodlebugs]], and later buses.\n\nBoth the Southern Pacific and the Oregon Electric (and its successor [[Burlington Northern]]) continued to provide freight service on the line until the 1990s when both railroads leased its low-density branches to shortline operators.  In this case, the Southern Pacific leased its lines to newly formed [[Portland and Western Railroad]] in August 1995; followed by the Burlington Northern leasing its lines to the Portland & Western in October 1995.<ref>[http://www.brian894x4.com/PortlandandWesternRR.html PortlandandWesternRR]</ref> This put the operations of two competing railroads in the same hands for the first time in history.\n\nLed by [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]], planning for WES began in 1996, when county officials started working with the cities of Beaverton, [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]], [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]], Wilsonville and [[Sherwood, Oregon|Sherwood]], as well as government transportation agencies to study the idea of establishing passenger rail service between Beaverton and Wilsonville on the existing [[Portland and Western Railroad|P&W]] line.<ref name=\"oreg96jul\"/> [[TriMet]] took over as the project's lead planning agency in 2002.<ref>Gunderson, Laura (September 26, 2002). \"TriMet takes over lead on commuter rail\".

Wills''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[tobacco]] importer and manufacturer formed in [[Bristol]], [[England]]. It was the first UK company to mass-produce [[cigarette]]s. It was one of the founding companies of [[Imperial Brands|Imperial Tobacco]] along with [[John Player & Sons]].\n\nThe company was founded in 1786 and went by various names before 1830 when it became W.D. & H.O. Wills. Tobacco was processed and sold under several brand names, some of which were still used by Imperial Tobacco until the second half of the 20th century. The company pioneered the use of [[cigarette cards]] within their packaging. Many of the buildings in Bristol and other cities around the United Kingdom still exist with several being converted to residential use.\n\n== History ==\n[[Henry Overton Wills I]] arrived in Bristol in 1786 from [[Salisbury]], and opened a tobacco shop on Castle Street with his partner Samuel Watkins. They named their firm Wills, Watkins & Co.<ref name=\"Tills\">Till, R, Wills of Bristol, 1786-1901, Wills, 1950</ref>. When Watkins retired in 1789, the firm became ''Wills & Co.'' Next, the company was known from 1791 to 1793 as ''Lilly, Wills & Co'', when it merged with the firm of Peter Lilly, who owned a snuff mill on the [[Land Yeo]] at [[Barrow Gurney]]. The company then was known from 1793 up until Lilly's' retirement in 1803 as ''Lilly and Wills''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bodman|first=Martin|title=Mills on the Land Yeo|url=http://somersetrivers.org/PDF/MillsOnTheLandYeo.pdf|publisher=Nailsea and District Local History Society|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1826 H.O. Wills's sons [[ William Day Wills ]] and [[ Henry Overton Wills II ]] took over the company, which in 1830 became W.D. & H.O. Wills. William Day Wills' middle name is from his mother Anne Day of Bristol. Both W.D. and H.O. Wills were non-smokers.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> When William Day Wills was killed in 1865 in a carriage accident, 2000 people attended his funeral at [[Arnos Vale Cemetery]].<ref name=\"Tills\" />\n[[File:Wills of Wallsend - geograph.org.uk - 1237457.jpg|thumb|The [[Wills Building]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], a former W.D. & H.O. Wills factory]] \n\nDuring the 1860s a new factory was built to replace the original Redcliffe Street premises, but they quickly outgrew this. The East Street factory of W.D. & H.O. Wills in [[Bedminster, Bristol|Bedminster]] opened in 1886 with a high tea for the 900 employees in the Cigar Room.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> The new factory was expected to meet their needs for the remainder of the century, but within a decade it was doubled in size and early in the 1900s a further Bristol factory was created in Raleigh Road, Southville. \n\nThis growth was largely due to the success of cigarettes. Their first brand was \"''Bristol''\", made at the [[London]] factory from 1871 to 1974. ''Three Castles'' and ''Gold Flake'' followed in 1878 but the greatest success was the machine-made ''Woodbine'' ten years later. ''Embassy'' was introduced in 1914 and relaunched in 1962 with [[coupon]]s. Other popular brands included ''[[Capstan (cigarette)|Capstan]]'' and ''Passing Clouds''. The company also made cigar brands such as ''Castella'' and ''Whiffs'', several pipe tobacco brands and ''Golden Virginia'' hand-rolling tobacco.\n\nUp until 1920 only women and girls were employed as cigar-makers.  One clause in the women's contract stipulated:\n<blockquote>She shall not contract Matrimony within the said Term, nor play at Card or Dice Tables, or any other unlawful Games.<ref name=\"Tills\" /></blockquote>\n[[File:WD and HO Wills Building.jpg|thumb|The former W.D. & H.O. warehouse building in [[Perth]], Western Australia]]\nIn 1898 [[Henry Herbert Wills]] visited Australia which led to the establishment of ''W.D. & H.O. Wills (Australia) Ltd.'' in 1900.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> When [[Queen Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] visited on 3 March 1950 she was given cigarette cards as a gift for [[Prince Charles]].<ref name=\"Tills\" />\n\nIn 1901 thirteen British tobacco companies discussed the [[American Tobacco Company]] building a factory in the UK to bypass taxes. The [[Imperial Tobacco Company]] was incorporated on 10 December 1901 with seven of the directors being members of the Wills family.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> Imperial remains one of the world's largest tobacco companies.\n\n[[File:Wills Woodbine cigarette machine.JPG|thumb|right|170px|A Woodbine vending machine, now in the [[Staffordshire County Museum]] at [[Shugborough Hall]], England]]\nThe last member of the Wills family to serve the company was Christopher, the great great grandson of H.O. Wills I. He retired as sales research manager in 1969.\n\nThe company had factories and offices not only in Bristol, but also in [[Swindon]], [[Dublin]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Glasgow]]. The largest cigarette factory in [[Europe]] was opened at [[Hartcliffe]] Bristol, and was designed by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] in 1974, but closed in 1990. It proved impossible to find a new use for it and it was demolished in 1999; its site is now the Imperial Park retail complex, but the associated offices became [[Lakeshore, Bristol|Lakeshore]], residential apartments created by [[Urban Splash]].\n\nThe facade of the large factory in Bedminster and bonded warehouses at Cumberland Basin remain prominent buildings in Bristol, although much of the existing land and buildings have been converted to other uses, such as The [[Tobacco Factory Theatre]].\n\nThe Newcastle factory closed in 1986 and stood derelict for over a decade, before the front of the [[Art Deco]] building&nbsp;\u2013 which was preserved by being [[Listed building|Grade II listed]]&nbsp;\u2013 reopened as a block of luxury apartments in 1998. (See main article: [[Wills Building]]) The factory in Glasgow has similarly been converted into offices.\n\nIn 1988 Imperial Tobacco withdrew the Wills brand in the United Kingdom (except for the popular [[Woodbine (cigarette)|Woodbine]] and [[Capstan (cigarette)|Capstan]] Full Strength brands, which still carry the name).\n\n===Benevolence===\nThe company pioneered canteens for the workers, free medical care, sports facilities and paid holidays. Wills commissioned portraits of long-serving employees, several of which are held by [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery|Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]] and some of which can be seen on display at the [[M Shed]] museum. In 1893 the W.D. & H.O. Wills Ltd Association Football Team was established and the company also held singing classes for the younger workers and women that year.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> In 1899 wives of Wills employees serving in the [[Boer War]] were granted 10 shillings per week by the factory.<ref name=\"Tills\" />\n\n==Archives==\n[[Bristol Archives]] holds extensive records of W.D. & H.O. Wills and [[Imperial Tobacco]] (Ref. 38169) ([http://archives.bristol.gov.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=38169&pos=1 online catalogue]).

In Chinese it was commonly referred to as 'lao dao pai', meaning 'Old Knife Brand' in reference to the sword the pirate was carrying on the brands key visual. The brand had a short revival in China under different ownership in 1994 but was eventually discontinued in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofba.org/2019/11/20/of-pirates-and-plagiarism-the-story-of-pirate-cigarettes/|title=Little Museum Of Foreign Brand Advertising In The R.O.C|website=www.mofba.org|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> \n\nIn 1959 the company launched the short-lived [[Strand (cigarette)|Strand]] brand.

Wills''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[tobacco]] importer and manufacturer formed in [[Bristol]], [[England]]. It was the first UK company to mass-produce [[cigarette]]s. It was one of the founding companies of [[Imperial Brands|Imperial Tobacco]] along with [[John Player & Sons]].\n\nThe company was founded in 1786 and went by various names before 1830 when it became W.D. & H.O. Wills. Tobacco was processed and sold under several brand names, some of which were still used by Imperial Tobacco until the second half of the 20th century. The company pioneered the use of [[cigarette cards]] within their packaging. Many of the buildings in Bristol and other cities around the United Kingdom still exist with several being converted to residential use.\n\n== History ==\n[[Henry Overton Wills I]] arrived in Bristol in 1786 from [[Salisbury]], and opened a tobacco shop on Castle Street with his partner Samuel Watkins. They named their firm Wills, Watkins & Co.<ref name=\"Tills\">Till, R, Wills of Bristol, 1786-1901, Wills, 1950</ref>. When Watkins retired in 1789, the firm became ''Wills & Co.'' Next, the company was known from 1791 to 1793 as ''Lilly, Wills & Co'', when it merged with the firm of Peter Lilly, who owned a snuff mill on the [[Land Yeo]] at [[Barrow Gurney]]. The company then was known from 1793 up until Lilly's' retirement in 1803 as ''Lilly and Wills''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bodman|first=Martin|title=Mills on the Land Yeo|url=http://somersetrivers.org/PDF/MillsOnTheLandYeo.pdf|publisher=Nailsea and District Local History Society|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1826 H.O. Wills's sons [[ William Day Wills ]] and [[ Henry Overton Wills II ]] took over the company, which in 1830 became W.D. & H.O. Wills. William Day Wills' middle name is from his mother Anne Day of Bristol. Both W.D. and H.O. Wills were non-smokers.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> When William Day Wills was killed in 1865 in a carriage accident, 2000 people attended his funeral at [[Arnos Vale Cemetery]].<ref name=\"Tills\" />\n[[File:Wills of Wallsend - geograph.org.uk - 1237457.jpg|thumb|The [[Wills Building]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], a former W.D. & H.O. Wills factory]] \n\nDuring the 1860s a new factory was built to replace the original Redcliffe Street premises, but they quickly outgrew this. The East Street factory of W.D. & H.O. Wills in [[Bedminster, Bristol|Bedminster]] opened in 1886 with a high tea for the 900 employees in the Cigar Room.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> The new factory was expected to meet their needs for the remainder of the century, but within a decade it was doubled in size and early in the 1900s a further Bristol factory was created in Raleigh Road, Southville. \n\nThis growth was largely due to the success of cigarettes. Their first brand was \"''Bristol''\", made at the [[London]] factory from 1871 to 1974. ''Three Castles'' and ''Gold Flake'' followed in 1878 but the greatest success was the machine-made ''Woodbine'' ten years later. ''Embassy'' was introduced in 1914 and relaunched in 1962 with [[coupon]]s. Other popular brands included ''[[Capstan (cigarette)|Capstan]]'' and ''Passing Clouds''. The company also made cigar brands such as ''Castella'' and ''Whiffs'', several pipe tobacco brands and ''Golden Virginia'' hand-rolling tobacco.\n\nUp until 1920 only women and girls were employed as cigar-makers.  One clause in the women's contract stipulated:\n<blockquote>She shall not contract Matrimony within the said Term, nor play at Card or Dice Tables, or any other unlawful Games.<ref name=\"Tills\" /></blockquote>\n[[File:WD and HO Wills Building.jpg|thumb|The former W.D. & H.O. warehouse building in [[Perth]], Western Australia]]\nIn 1898 [[Henry Herbert Wills]] visited Australia which led to the establishment of ''W.D. & H.O. Wills (Australia) Ltd.'' in 1900.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> When [[Queen Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] visited on 3 March 1950 she was given cigarette cards as a gift for [[Prince Charles]].<ref name=\"Tills\" />\n\nIn 1901 thirteen British tobacco companies discussed the [[American Tobacco Company]] building a factory in the UK to bypass taxes. The [[Imperial Tobacco Company]] was incorporated on 10 December 1901 with seven of the directors being members of the Wills family.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> Imperial remains one of the world's largest tobacco companies.\n\n[[File:Wills Woodbine cigarette machine.JPG|thumb|right|170px|A Woodbine vending machine, now in the [[Staffordshire County Museum]] at [[Shugborough Hall]], England]]\nThe last member of the Wills family to serve the company was Christopher, the great great grandson of H.O. Wills I. He retired as sales research manager in 1969.\n\nThe company had factories and offices not only in Bristol, but also in [[Swindon]], [[Dublin]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Glasgow]]. The largest cigarette factory in [[Europe]] was opened at [[Hartcliffe]] Bristol, and was designed by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] in 1974, but closed in 1990. It proved impossible to find a new use for it and it was demolished in 1999; its site is now the Imperial Park retail complex, but the associated offices became [[Lakeshore, Bristol|Lakeshore]], residential apartments created by [[Urban Splash]].\n\nThe facade of the large factory in Bedminster and bonded warehouses at Cumberland Basin remain prominent buildings in Bristol, although much of the existing land and buildings have been converted to other uses, such as The [[Tobacco Factory Theatre]].\n\nThe Newcastle factory closed in 1986 and stood derelict for over a decade, before the front of the [[Art Deco]] building&nbsp;\u2013 which was preserved by being [[Listed building|Grade II listed]]&nbsp;\u2013 reopened as a block of luxury apartments in 1998. (See main article: [[Wills Building]]) The factory in Glasgow has similarly been converted into offices.\n\nIn 1988 Imperial Tobacco withdrew the Wills brand in the United Kingdom (except for the popular [[Woodbine (cigarette)|Woodbine]] and [[Capstan (cigarette)|Capstan]] Full Strength brands, which still carry the name).\n\n===Benevolence===\nThe company pioneered canteens for the workers, free medical care, sports facilities and paid holidays. Wills commissioned portraits of long-serving employees, several of which are held by [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery|Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]] and some of which can be seen on display at the [[M Shed]] museum. In 1893 the W.D. & H.O. Wills Ltd Association Football Team was established and the company also held singing classes for the younger workers and women that year.<ref name=\"Tills\" /> In 1899 wives of Wills employees serving in the [[Boer War]] were granted 10 shillings per week by the factory.<ref name=\"Tills\" />\n\n==Archives==\n[[Bristol Archives]] holds extensive records of W.D. & H.O. Wills and [[Imperial Tobacco]] (Ref. 38169) ([http://archives.bristol.gov.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=38169&pos=1 online catalogue]).

In Chinese it was commonly referred to as 'lao dao pai', meaning 'Old Knife Brand' in reference to the sword the pirate was carrying on the brands key visual. The brand had a short revival in China under different ownership in 1994 but was eventually discontinued in 1997<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofba.org/2019/11/20/of-pirates-and-plagiarism-the-story-of-pirate-cigarettes/|title=Little Museum Of Foreign Brand Advertising In The R.O.C|website=www.mofba.org|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>. \n\nIn 1959 the company launched the short-lived [[Strand (cigarette)|Strand]] brand.
