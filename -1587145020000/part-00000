(abbreviated '''''WWTBAM''''' and informally known as simply '''''Millionaire''''') is an international television [[game show]] franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and [[Steven Knight]]. In its format, currently owned and licensed by [[Sony Pictures Television]], contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions \u2013 only one contestant plays at a time, similar to radio quizzes; contestants are given the question before attempting an answer, and have no time limit to answer questions; and the amount offered increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult. The maximum cash prize offered in most versions of the format is one million of the local currency.\n\nThe [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (British game show)|original British version]] debuted on 4 September 1998 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network and was aired until its final episode on 11 February 2014. A revived series of seven episodes to commemorate its 20th anniversary aired from 5 to 11 May 2018. The revival received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans, as well as high viewing figures, leading ITV to renew the show for another series. Since its debut, international variants of the game show have been aired in around 160 countries worldwide.\n\n==History==\nThe format of the show was created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had earlier created a number of the promotional games for Tarrant's [[Breakfast television|morning show]] on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] radio, such as the [[bong game]]. Tentatively known as ''Cash Mountain'',<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> the show took its finalised title from a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|song]] written by [[Cole Porter]] for the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', starring by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Celeste Holm]]. Since the original version launched, several individuals have claimed that they originated the format and that Celador had breached their [[copyright]]. While many pursued litigation, none were successful, and each claim was later settled out-of-court on an agreement/settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |title=Millionaire 2nd Edition.qxd |last=Leonard |first=John J. |year=2005 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801163453/http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The show that should have made me a million|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/29/1048653901387.html|author=Daniel Dasey|publisher=The Sydney Sun-Herald|date=30 March 2003}}</ref><ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/news/tm_objectid=15908484&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=who-wants-to-sue-a-millionaire-name_page.html Birmingham Sunday Mercury], 28 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, original producer [[Celador]] announced that it was seeking to sell the worldwide rights to ''Millionaire'', together with the rest of its British programme library, as the first phase of a sell-off of the company's format and production divisions. \nBritish television producer Paul Smith first had the idea to franchise the UK programme internationally. He developed a series of standards for international variants that ensured they mirrored the British original closely. For example, all hosts were required to appear on-screen wearing [[Armani]] suits, as Tarrant did in the UK; producers were forbidden from hiring local composers to create original music, instead using the same music cues used by the British version; and the lighting system and set design were to adhere faithfully to the way they were presented on the British version.<ref name=\"Walmsley\">{{cite web|title=Millionaire|url=http://www.andywalmsley.com/millionaire.php|publisher=Andy Walmsley, Production Designer|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> Some of Smith's rules have been slightly relaxed over the years as the franchise's history has progressed.\n\nDutch company [[2waytraffic]] ultimately acquired ''Millionaire'' and all of Celador's other programmes. Two years later, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] purchased 2waytraffic for \u00a3137.5 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/13/television.mediabusiness | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Sony to buy Millionaire firm for \u00a3137.5m | first=Chris | last=Tryhorn | date=13 March 2008}}</ref> [[Sony Pictures Television]] currently owns and licenses the show's format. [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television]], [[the Walt Disney Company]]'s in-home sales and content distribution firm controls the U.S. version independent of Sony.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Rules===\nA group of contestants on each episode play a preliminary round called \"Fastest Finger First\". All are given a question by the host and four answers which must be placed within a particular order; in the first season of the original version (1998) and the first four seasons of the Australian version (1999\u20132002), contestants have to simply answer a multiple-choice question. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music for this round begins. The contestant who not only answers correctly, but in the fastest time, goes on to play the main game. In the event that no one gets the question right, another question is given; if two or more contestants answer correctly but with the same time, they are given a tie-breaker amongst them to determine who will move on. This round is only used when a new contestant is being chosen to play the main round, and can be played more than once in an episode amongst those remaining within the group seeking to play the main game. In celebrity editions, the round is not used; celebrities automatically take part in the main game.\n\nOnce a contestant enters the main game, they are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Each features four possible answers, in which the contestant must give the correct answer. Doing so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling much tougher questions increasing their prize fund. During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a question, as well as two \"safety nets\" \u2013 if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize. While the first few questions are generally easy, subsequent ones after them will prompt the host to ask if the answer they gave is their \"final answer\" \u2013 if it is, then it is locked in and cannot be changed. If a contestant feels unsure about an answer, and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won, to which the host will ask them to confirm this as their final decision; in such cases, the host will usually ask them to state what answer they would have gone for, and reveal if it would have been correct or incorrect.\n\n====Original format====\nDuring the British original, between 1998 and 2007, the show's format required contestants to answer fifteen questions. The payout structure was as follows (questions as guaranteed levels are highlighted with a '''bolded''' text):<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/fewer-and-harder-questions-on-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-6605687.html|title=Fewer \u2013 and Harder \u2013 Questions on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''|author=[[Show business|Showbiz]]|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=13 August 2007|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center;\n!Question number\n!Question value\n|-\n|1\n|\u00a3100\n|-\n|2\n|\u00a3200\n|-\n|3\n|\u00a3300\n|-\n|4\n|\u00a3500\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''5'''\n|'''\u00a31,000'''\n|-\n|6\n|\u00a32,000\n|-\n|7\n|\u00a34,000\n|-\n|8\n|\u00a38,000\n|-\n|9\n|\u00a316,000\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''10'''\n|'''\u00a332,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|\u00a364,000\n|-\n|12\n|\u00a3125,000\n|-\n|13\n|\u00a3250,000\n|-\n|14\n|\u00a3500,000\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''15'''\n|'''<big>\u00a31,000,000</big>'''\n|}\n{{anchor|12-question format}}\nAfter 2007, the format was changed, reducing the number of questions to twelve; the overall change in format was later incorporated into a number of international versions over a period of four years, including the Arab, Bulgarian, Dutch, French, Polish, Spanish, and Turkish versions. The payout structure, as a whole, was subsequently changed as a result, with the second safety net relocated to \u00a350,000 at question 7 (questions as guaranteed levels are highlighted with a '''bolded''' text):<ref>{{cite web|first=Neil|last=Wilkes|date=13 August 2007 |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a71325/new-prize-levels-for-millionaire.html#~oP1HgrOEjOnZxt |title=New prize levels for ''Millionaire'' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]] |accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center;\n!Question number\n!Question value\n|-\n|1\n|\u00a3500\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''2'''\n|'''\u00a31,000'''\n|-\n|3\n|\u00a32,000\n|-\n|4\n|\u00a35,000\n|-\n|5\n|\u00a310,000\n|-\n|6\n|\u00a320,000\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''7'''\n|'''\u00a350,000'''\n|-\n|8\n|\u00a375,000\n|-\n|9\n|\u00a3150,000\n|-\n|10\n|\u00a3250,000\n|-\n|11\n|\u00a3500,000\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''12'''\n|'''<big>\u00a31,000,000</big>'''\n|}\nWhen the game show was revived for British television in 2018, the format was changed a second time, reverting to the original arrangement used before 2007, but with one notable difference, in that the second safety net was made adjustable \u2013 once a contestant reached \u00a31,000, the host would ask them, before giving the next question, if they wish to set the next cash prize amount as the second safety net, with this allowing them to set up as high as \u00a3500,000 in their game as a result.\n\n====U.S. format====\nAn American syndication of the game show was conceived after the British original proved successful, debuting in 2002. The only difference between it and the British version was that episodes were halved in length \u2013 30 minutes, as opposed to the 60-minute length of the original version. The change meant that the preliminary round of the show was eliminated, and contestants had to pass a more conventional game show qualification test. Exceptions to this arrangement, in which it was used under the name \"Fastest Finger\" included: primetime special editions of the programme; the 2004 series that was dubbed ''Super Millionaire'', in which the final prize was increased to $10,000,000;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/02/17/super-millionaire-is-looking-for-few-fast-fingers.html|title=''Super Millionaire'' Is Looking for a Few ''Fast Fingers''|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=17 February 2004|accessdate=18 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130105534/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/02/17/super-millionaire-is-looking-for-few-fast-fingers.html|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and for the 10th anniversary special of the US edition, run during August 2009 for eleven episodes. The decision to remove this round would later occur in other international versions, including the British original.\n\n=====Clock format=====\nIn 2008, the U.S. version changed its format so that contestants were required to answer questions within a set time limit. The limit varied depending on the difficulty of the question:<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080818abc04|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Kicks Off Seventh Season by Introducing New Changes to the Game, Creating New Levels of Excitement, Emotional Drama and Heart-Pounding Tension for Both Viewers and Contestants|website=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=text-align:center;\n|-\n!

If a contestant exceeded the time limit, they were forced to walk away with any prize money they had won up to that point; however, if the Double Dip lifeline is in use, then the contestant's winnings drops to the last safe haven attained. This format change was later adopted into other international versions \u2013 the British original, for example, adopted this change for episodes on 3 August 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a231867/format-changes-ahead-for-millionaire.html#~oP2IB7a62U1Vky |title=Format changes ahead for 'Millionaire' |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=23 June 2010 |work=Digital Spy |publisher=Hearst Magazines UK |accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=====Shuffle format=====\nOn 13 September 2010, the U.S. version adopted a second and more significant change in its format. In this change, the game featured two rounds. The first round consisted of ten questions, in which the cash prize associated to each value, along with the category and difficulty for each question is randomised per game. As such, the difficulty of the question in this round, is ''not'' tied to the value associated to it, and a contestant does not know what amount they won unless they provide a correct answer, or choose to walk away. As part of this format, the amount of money a contestant won in this round was banked, but if they walk away before completing the round, they left with half the amount that had been banked; if they gave an incorrect answer during this round, they left with just $1,000.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/notes/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire/the-new-season-of-millionaire-is-a-real-game-changer-click-here-to-learn-all-of-/412488051663|title=The New Season of \"Millionaire\" is a Real Game-Changer|publisher= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|date=16 August 2010|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> If they answered all ten questions correctly, they then moved onto the second round, which stuck to the standard format of the game show \u2013 the remaining questions are set to general knowledge and feature cash prizes of high, non-cumulative values. The contestant can, at this point, walk away with the total amount banked from the first round; otherwise, an incorrect answer meant they left with $25,000. The format was later modified for the fourteenth season of the US version, but retained the same arrangement for the last four questions.\n\nIn 2015, the so-called \"shuffle format\" was scrapped and the show returned to a version that closely resembled the original format.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://tv.avclub.com/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-to-feature-new-host-new-1798283830\n| title      = Who Wants To Be A Millionaire to feature new host, new/old format\n| work       = [[The A.V.

During the main game, contestants were given the option of choosing this feature, in which if they chose to use it, they gained the used of a fourth lifeline that allowed them to discuss a question with a member of the audience, in exchange for having no second safety net \u2013 if they got any question between the sixth and final cash prize amount wrong, they would leave with the guaranteed amount given for correctly answering five questions. This modified format was subsequently adopted for use in a variety of international versions abroad, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Venezuela.\n\n=====Hot Seat format=====\n{{see also|Millionaire Hot Seat}}\nIn November 2008, the Norwegian version modified the show format under the title of \"Hot Seat\". In this variation of the game, six contestants took part, with each taking it in turns to answer questions and build up their prize fund. Utilising the time limit format introduced in the US version, this variation on the format granted a contestant the right to pass the question on to another player, who cannot pass it on themselves, while eliminating both the option of walking away from a question, and the use of lifelines. If a contestant cannot pass on or correctly answer a question, they are eliminated, and the highest cash value they made is removed. The game ends when all contestants are eliminated or the question for the highest cash value is answered \u2013 if a contestant who answers the final question gives a correct answer, they win that prize; otherwise, the last contestant to be eliminated receives a small prize if they reach the fifth question safety net. This format was later introduced to various markets over the course of a four year-period from 2009 to 2012, including Italy, Hungary, Spain, Vietnam,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vtv.vn/Article/Get/Ai-la-trieu-phu-phien-ban-moi-se-ra-mat-vao-ngay-79--8b63ee3e16.html |title=Ai l\u00e0 tri\u1ec7u ph\u00fa phi\u00ean b\u1ea3n m\u1edbi s\u1ebd ra m\u1eaft v\u00e0o ng\u00e0y 7/9 |work=VTV.vn |date=12 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815043700/http://vtv.vn/Article/Get/Ai-la-trieu-phu-phien-ban-moi-se-ra-mat-vao-ngay-79--8b63ee3e16.html |archivedate=15 August 2010 |language=vi |url-status=dead }}</ref> Indonesia, [[Millionaire Hot Seat|Australia]], and Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://programas.13.cl/millonarioaltatension/|title=Canal13.cl|access-date=25 January 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716125336/http://programas.13.cl/millonarioaltatension/|archive-date=16 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Australia's version was modified to use the Norwegian's Hot Seat format. In 2017, as part of new modification to the format, the game incorporated the use of the Fastest Finger First round, with the winner able to select a lifeline, out of three that the show provided. or to keep a check for a AU$1,000.\n\n===Lifelines===\nDuring a standard play of the game, a contestant is given a series of lifelines to aid them with difficult questions. In the standard format, a contestant has access to three lifelines \u2013 the contents can use each only once per game, but can use more than one on a single question. The standard lifelines used in the original format of the game show include:\n\n* '''Ask the Audience''': the audience takes voting pads attached to their seats and votes for the answer that they believe is correct. The computer tallies the results and displays them as percentages to the contestant.\n* '''50:50''': the game's computer eliminates two wrong answers from the current question, leaving behind the correct answer and one incorrect answer. From 2000, the selection of two incorrect answers were random.\n* '''Phone a Friend''': the contestant is connected with a friend over a phone line and is given 30 seconds to read the question and answers and solicit assistance. The time begins as soon as the contestant starts reading the question.\n\nIn the US, \"Ask the Audience\" and \"Phone a Friend\" had corporate sponsorship at different periods. [[AT&T Corporation|The original AT&T]] sponsored \"Phone-a-Friend\" during the original ABC primetime show and the syndicated version's first season; [[AT&T|the current AT&T]] sponsored the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, [[AOL]] sponsored \"Ask the Audience\" and allowed users of [[AOL Instant Messenger|Instant Messenger]] to participate in the lifeline by adding the [[Screen name (computing)|screen name]] ''MillionaireIM'' to their [[contact list]]. When a contestant used the lifeline during the show, users would receive an [[instant message]] with the question and the four possible answers and would vote for the correct answer. The computer would tally these results alongside the results from the studio audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_August_23/ai_n6165047/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708211841/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_August_23/ai_n6165047/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=America Online and Buena Vista Television Break New Ground by Expanding 'Ask the Audience' Lifeline beyond the 'Millionaire' Studio via Instant Messaging |date=23 August 2004 |publisher=Business Wire |accessdate=18 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nContestants pre-select multiple friends for \"Phone a Friend,\" and as soon as the contestant begins to play, producers alert the friends and ask them to keep their phone lines free and await three rings before answering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/25/news/cl-55078 |title=Sweating Bullets on the Hot Seat as a Know-It-All Phone-a-Friend |publisher=latimes.com |date=25 April 2001 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> On 11 January 2010, the US version eliminated the use of \"Phone a Friend\" in response to an increasing trend of contestants' friends using [[web search engine]]s and other Internet resources to assist them during the calls. Producers came to feel that the lifeline was giving contestants who had friends with Internet access an unfair advantage, and they also believed it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline, by which friends provided assistance based on what they already knew.<ref>{{cite episode|season=8|number=66|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ''(U.S. version)''|network =Syndicated|date=11 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring tapings of the current British version, security personnel from the production office stay with contestants' friends at their homes to ensure integrity. During The People Play specials in 2012 and 2013, friends traveled to the studio and stayed backstage. When a contestant used the lifeline, the friend they called appeared on a monitor in the studio, and both the friend and contestant were able to see and communicate with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdA5l9xgTQ|title=The day I was phone-a-friend on Who Wants to be a Millionaire|last=The Telegraph|date=20 December 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixrqWIgCVP8|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The computer replaced the current question with another of the same difficulty. The contestant could not reinstate any lifelines used on the original question.<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\"/> A variation of this lifeline for the US version, called \"Cut the Question\", was brought into use in 2014 for a week-long run of special episodes that featured child contestants, in which it could only be used within the first ten questions.\n* '''Double Dip''' \u2013 One of two lifelines created for the ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off of the US version. When used, this lifeline allowed contestants to make two guesses at a question, but forbade them from using any other lifelines they had left or from walking away with their current winnings. If the contestant first used 50:50 and then used Double Dip on the same question, it would guarantee them the correct answer. When the standard US format incorporated a time limit on questions, the show retired 50:50 and replaced it with Double Dip.<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\"/> This lifeline was also used in the Russian version (without a clock format) but did not replace 50:50.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXXBqZjnTdA&t=1199s|title=\u041a\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c?

When chosen, a sequestered panel of three experts (chosen by the producers) appears via face-to-face audio and video feed to provide assistance. Like \"Phone a Friend,\" this lifeline incorporated a 30-second time limit for its use. This lifeline was also used in the Russian version between 2006 and 2008 but did not feature experts.\n* '''Ask the Expert''' \u2013 Inspired by \"Three Wise Men\", this lifeline provided the contestant with one person, an expert selected for them, to help them with the question. Unlike its predecessor, this lifeline had no time limit on its use, but was only available after the fifth question;<ref name=Expert>{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/millionaire_asktheexpert.htm|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Ask the Expert Lifeline|publisher=about.com|last=Grosvenor|first=Carrie|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> after \"Phone a Friend\" was removed in 2010, it was made readily available at any time in the game. In the US version, the lifeline was sponsored by [[Skype]] for its live audio and video feeds.<ref name=Expert/> In the Hong Kong edition, it replaced the \"Phone a Friend\" lifeline for one-off special in 2001 and for two celebrity specials in 2018, though with the celebrity contestants able to ask a panel of experts for help, present in the audience, all of whom had the question and possible answers visible to them.\n* '''Ask One of the Audience''' \u2013 Used in the German version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its \"Risk Mode\" format. When used, the contestant selects someone from the audience, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves correct, the audience member is given a small cash prize in return. This lifeline was implemented as part of the Costa Rican version, but made available after passing the first safety net.\n* '''Ask Three of the Audiences''' \u2013 Currently used in the Vietnamese version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its Original format. When used, the contestant selects three from the audiences, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves to be correct, the audience members are given a small cash prize in return (600000 \u20ab divided to members that answered correctly in the 3 audiences). This lifeline was implemented as part of the Vietnamese version, but made available after passing the first safety net. In the Philippine version, the lifeline is called ''People Speak'', which can be used at any point in the game.\n* '''Jump the Question''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show, as part of the \"Shuffle Format\", from the start of the ninth season to the end of thirteenth season. When used, prior to giving a final answer, a contestant would skip the current question and move on to the next one, but would earn no money from the question they skipped; the lifeline could not be used if they have reached the final question. Unlike other lifelines, it could be used twice during a game, except for the thirteenth season \u2013 the introduction of \"Plus One\" led to the lifeline being modified as a result. The lifeline was removed following the 2014\u201315 season.\n* '''Crystal Ball''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show, as part of specially designated weeks that used the \"Shuffle Format\". When used during the first round, the contestant is allowed to see the cash amount that is designated to the question they are currently on.<ref name=CrystalBall>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/24/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-celebrates-halloween-with-an-added-crystal-ball-lifeline-a-spooky-set-makeover-and-a-contestant-in-drag/154574/ |title='Who Wants to be a Millionaire' Celebrates Halloween With an Added \"Crystal Ball\" Lifeline, A Spooky Set Makeover and a Contestant in Drag |last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |work=TV By the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029173644/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/24/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-celebrates-halloween-with-an-added-crystal-ball-lifeline-a-spooky-set-makeover-and-a-contestant-in-drag/154574/ |archivedate=29 October 2012 }}</ref>\n* '''+1''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show from 2015 to 2019. Based on \"Ask One of the Audience\", the lifeline allows a contestant to invite on a friend from the audience to come and help them answer the question. There is no time limit, but after that question has been answered the friend has to return to the audience.\n* '''Ask the Host''' \u2013 Used in the 20th anniversary of the British original, the French and Italian revivals, as well as [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|the 21st season of the American version]]. When used by the contestant, the host uses their knowledge of a question's subject, gives their thoughts about the question, and tries to assist them with finding the correct answer out of the choices given. The lifeline features no time limit, and the host reassures all they have no connection to the outside world and receive the question and possible answers for it at the same time as the contestant, and thus have no knowledge of what the correct answer is.\n\n===Top prize winners===\nOut of all contestants that have played the game, few have been able to win the top prize on any international version of the show. The first was [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]], who won the top prize on the U.S. version on 19 November 1999. Carpenter did not use a lifeline until the final question, using his Phone-a-Friend not for help but to call his father to tell him he was about to win the million.<ref>{{cite news|first=Arlene|last=Vigoda|title=Million-dollar winner untaxed by celebrity|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=22 November 1999}}</ref>\n\nOther notable top prize winners include [[Judith Keppel]], the first winner of the UK version;<ref name=\"wilson\">{{cite news |title=Wilson: Millionaire win 'planned' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1035069.stm |work=BBC News |date=22 November 2000 |accessdate=28 January 2007}}</ref> Kevin Olmstead from the U.S. version, who won a progressive jackpot of $2.18&nbsp;million;<ref name=\"Jackpot\">{{cite news|title=Double jackpot winner on US Millionaire|work=BBC News|date=11 April 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1271553.stm|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> [[Martin Flood]] from the Australian version, who was investigated by producers after suspicions that he had cheated, much like [[Charles Ingram]], but was later cleared;<ref>{{cite news|title=Second Aussie 'Millionaire' winner emerges|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/11/14/1131951103121.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> [[Mana Ashida]] from the Japanese version; and Sushil Kumar from the Indian version, who is often referred to in Western media as the \"real-life ''Slumdog Millionaire''\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Burke|first=Jason|title='Real Slumdog Millionaire' is first to win $1m on Indian gameshow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/27/real-slumdog-millionaire-indian-gameshow?newsfeed=true|accessdate=6 September 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Stanglin|first=Douglas|title=Real-life 'Slumdog Millionaire' wins $1M in India|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/11/real-life-slumdog-millionaire-wins-1m-in-india/1?csp=34news|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Indian man becomes real life Slumdog Millionaire as he wins game show|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/8866558/Indian-man-becomes-real-life-Slumdog-Millionaire-as-he-wins-game-show.html|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Magnier|first=Mark|title=Indian from modest background becomes TV game show millionaire|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/28/world/la-fg-india-slumdog-20111029|accessdate=6 September 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Beard|first=Lanford|title='Slumdog Millionaire' comes to life for Sushil Kumar|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/27/slumdog-millionaire-sushil-kumar|accessdate=7 March 2015|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly PopWatch|date=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Original version==\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The Strachans' score provides drama and tension, and unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] takes inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and their cues from the 6th/3rd to 10th/7th question, and then from the 11th/8th question onwards, take the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan |last=Smurthwaite |first=Nick |newspaper=[[The Stage]] |date=21 March 2005 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991 |archivedate=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On [[Game Show Network]] (GSN)'s ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\">{{Cite episode|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|series=Gameshow Hall of Fame|publisher=GSN|date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Strachans' ''Millionaire'' soundtrack was honoured by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] with numerous awards, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the U.S. version's clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favour of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=21 August 2014|access-date=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821203218/http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|archive-date=21 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\n[[File:Milonario El Salvador.jpg|thumb|TV studio of ''[[\u00bfQui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario? (Salvadoran game show)|\u00bfQui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario?]]'', the [[Salvadorian]] version of the show.]]\nThe basic set design used in the ''Millionaire'' franchise was conceived by British [[production designer]] [[Andy Walmsley]], and is the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> Unlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the programme feels more like a [[Thriller film|movie thriller]] than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The main game typically has the contestant and host sit in \"Hot Seats\",<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> which are slightly-modified, {{convert|3|foot|m}}-high Pietranera Arco All chairs situated in the centre of the stage; an [[LG Electronics|LG]] computer monitor directly facing each seat displays questions and other pertinent information.\n\nThe lighting system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses further into the game. There are also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporised, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside a prison while an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the U.S. ''Millionaire'' introduced its shuffle format, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able to walk around the stage. According to Vieira, the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|date=15 September 2010|network=Syndicated}}</ref> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colours and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=10 September 2012|accessdate=12 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Catchphrase===\n''Millionaire'' has made [[catchphrase]]s out of several lines used on the show. The most well-known of these catchphrases is the host's question \"Is that your final answer?\", asked whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified.<ref name=\"Commentary\">Commentary provided by Tarrant on the DVD ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?: Magic Moments and More''.</ref> The question is asked because the rules require that the contestants must clearly indicate their choices before they are made official, the nature of the game allowing them to ponder the options before committing to an answer. Regularly on tier-three questions, a dramatic pause occurs between the contestant's statement of their answer and the host's acknowledgement of whether or not it is correct.\n\nMany parodies of ''Millionaire'' have capitalised on the \"final answer\" catchphrase. In the United States, the phrase was popularised by Philbin during his tenure as the host of that country's version,<ref name=\"TV Series Finale\"/> to the extent that [[TV Land]] listed it in its special ''100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases'', which aired in 2006.<ref>The Star Ledger. 11 December 2006</ref>\n\nOn the Australian versions, McGuire replaces the phrase with \"Lock it in?\"; likewise, the Indian version's hosts have used varying \"lock\" catchphrases. There are also a number of other non-English versions of ''Millionaire'' where the host does not ask \"[Is that your] final answer?\" or a literal translation thereof.<ref>Certain non-English ''Millionaire'' shows' hosts, in their \"final answer\" phrases, translate these words as \"definitive answer\", \"final decision\", etc.</ref> Besides the \"final answer\" question, other catchphrases used on the show include the contestants' requests to use lifelines, such as \"I'd like to phone a friend\"; and a line that Tarrant spoke whenever a contestant was struggling with a particular question, \"Some questions are only easy if you know the answer.\"<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' has been credited with single-handedly reviving interest in, and breaking new ground for, the television game show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> It revolutionised the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the most popular game shows in television history, and is credited by some with paving the way for the phenomenon of reality programming.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Awards, accolades and honours===\nIn 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] honoured the UK version of ''Millionaire'' by ranking it number 23 on its \"BFI TV 100\" list, which compiled what British television industry professionals believed were the greatest programmes to have ever originated from that country.<ref>{{cite web|title=The BFI TV 100 at the BFI website |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/index.html |publisher=British Film Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524092249/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/index.html |archivedate=24 May 2009 }}</ref> The UK ''Millionaire'' also won the 1999 [[British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Award]] for Best Entertainment Programme, and four [[National Television Awards]] for Most Popular Quiz Programme from 2002 to 2005.\n\nThe original primetime version of the U.S. ''Millionaire'' won two [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show|Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show]] in 2000 and 2001.

In September 2001, Ingram took part in the game show for two days, joined by his wife Diana and college lecturer [[Tecwen Whittock]]. After his first day, he devised a plan to help him win the \u00a31 million cash prize the following day \u2013 for each question he faced, Ingram would read out the answers for a question, whereupon Whittock, who sat amongst the contestants who would play Fastest Finger First, would cough whenever the correct answer was spoken out. As Ingram drew close to the top prize, production staff backstage became suspicious over the amount of back noise Whittock was creating with his coughing. In addition, they also became concerned that Ingram showed no sign of having specialist knowledge on any subject he faced in his questions, in contrast to previous contestants. After the episode had been filmed, an investigation was ordered. Ingram was informed that he was suspected of cheating, and thus was not allowed to take his winnings; his reaction to this news further justified suspicions he had cheated. When the footage was reviewed, staff began to notice the pattern between Whittock's coughing and Ingram's behaviour when he chose an answer. After suspending the broadcast of both episodes Ingram featured in, police were called in to investigate the matter further.\n\nIn April 2003, Ingram, Diana, and Whittock were taken to court on the charge of using fraudulent means to win the top prize on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''. During the trial, the defence claimed that Whittock had simply suffered from allergies during recording of the second episode, but the prosecution refuted this by revealing footage that showed his coughing stopped, upon Ingram leaving the set and Whittock subsequently taking his turn on the main game. The trial concluded with all three being found guilty and receiving suspended sentences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2910119.stm|title=Millionaire trio escape jail|work=BBC News|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref> After the trial, ITV aired a documentary about the scandal, along with Ingram's entire game, complete with Whittock's coughing sounds.

This game featured an altered version of the shuffle format, condensing the number of questions to twelve\u2014eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.<ref>The rules of the Facebook game are sourced from the following page: {{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/playmillionaire/app_423340984404330|publisher=Ludia|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Scrapped animated spin-off===\nIn September 2001, [[Celador]] signed a deal with [[DIC Entertainment]] to produce a cartoon based on the show titled ''The Adventures of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? \u2013 The Animated Series''.<ref>https://www.c21media.net/celador-dic-to-make-animated-millionaire/</ref><ref>https://www.awn.com/news/dic-asks-celedor-your-final-answer</ref> The series was to follow fictional winners of the show, who would have used their prize money to take trips to various exotic locations, while the fictional host would keep in touch with them through the Millionaire Command Center.\n\nThe series was planned to be shown off at [[MIPCOM]] that year, however nothing else was confirmed for the series, and was silently scrapped without a formal announcement.\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!}}\n[[File:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Play It! Sound Stage after 2004 closure.jpg|thumb|right|The building housing the California version after its 2004 closure]]\nA theme park attraction based on the show, known as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!]]'', appeared at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (when it was known as ''Disney-MGM Studios'') at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] and at [[Disney California Adventure Park]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a \"Fastest Finger\" question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theatre who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a ''Millionaire'' CD game, to a 3-night [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney Cruise]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Winner?

(abbreviated '''''WWTBAM''''' and informally known as simply '''''Millionaire''''') is an international television [[game show]] franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and [[Steven Knight]]. In its format, currently owned and licensed by [[Sony Pictures Television]], contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions \u2013 only one contestant plays at a time, similar to radio quizzes; contestants are given the question before attempting an answer, and have no time limit to answer questions; and the amount offered increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult. The maximum cash prize offered in most versions of the format is one million of the local currency.\n\nThe [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (British game show)|original British version]] debuted on 4 September 1998 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network and was aired until its final episode on 11 February 2014. A revived series of seven episodes to commemorate its 20th anniversary aired from 5 to 11 May 2018. The revival received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans, as well as high viewing figures, leading ITV to renew the show for another series. Since its debut, international variants of the game show have been aired in around 160 countries worldwide.\n\n==History==\nThe format of the show was created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had earlier created a number of the promotional games for Tarrant's [[Breakfast television|morning show]] on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] radio, such as the [[bong game]]. Tentatively known as ''Cash Mountain'',<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> the show took its finalised title from a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|song]] written by [[Cole Porter]] for the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', starring by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Celeste Holm]]. Since the original version launched, several individuals have claimed that they originated the format and that Celador had breached their [[copyright]]. While many pursued litigation, none were successful, and each claim was later settled out-of-court on an agreement/settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |title=Millionaire 2nd Edition.qxd |last=Leonard |first=John J. |year=2005 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801163453/http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The show that should have made me a million|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/29/1048653901387.html|author=Daniel Dasey|publisher=The Sydney Sun-Herald|date=30 March 2003}}</ref><ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/news/tm_objectid=15908484&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=who-wants-to-sue-a-millionaire-name_page.html Birmingham Sunday Mercury], 28 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, original producer [[Celador]] announced that it was seeking to sell the worldwide rights to ''Millionaire'', together with the rest of its British programme library, as the first phase of a sell-off of the company's format and production divisions. \nBritish television producer Paul Smith first had the idea to franchise the UK programme internationally. He developed a series of standards for international variants that ensured they mirrored the British original closely. For example, all hosts were required to appear on-screen wearing [[Armani]] suits, as Tarrant did in the UK; producers were forbidden from hiring local composers to create original music, instead using the same music cues used by the British version; and the lighting system and set design were to adhere faithfully to the way they were presented on the British version.<ref name=\"Walmsley\">{{cite web|title=Millionaire|url=http://www.andywalmsley.com/millionaire.php|publisher=Andy Walmsley, Production Designer|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> Some of Smith's rules have been slightly relaxed over the years as the franchise's history has progressed.\n\nDutch company [[2waytraffic]] ultimately acquired ''Millionaire'' and all of Celador's other programmes. Two years later, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] purchased 2waytraffic for \u00a3137.5 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/13/television.mediabusiness | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Sony to buy Millionaire firm for \u00a3137.5m | first=Chris | last=Tryhorn | date=13 March 2008}}</ref> [[Sony Pictures Television]] currently owns and licenses the show's format. [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television]], [[the Walt Disney Company]]'s in-home sales and content distribution firm controls the U.S. version independent of Sony.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Rules===\nA group of contestants on each episode play a preliminary round called \"Fastest Finger First\". All are given a question by the host and four answers which must be placed within a particular order; in the first season of the original version (1998) and the first four seasons of the Australian version (1999\u20132002), contestants have to simply answer a multiple-choice question. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music for this round begins. The contestant who not only answers correctly, but in the fastest time, goes on to play the main game. In the event that no one gets the question right, another question is given; if two or more contestants answer correctly but with the same time, they are given a tie-breaker amongst them to determine who will move on. This round is only used when a new contestant is being chosen to play the main round, and can be played more than once in an episode amongst those remaining within the group seeking to play the main game. In celebrity editions, the round is not used; celebrities automatically take part in the main game.\n\nOnce a contestant enters the main game, they are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Each features four possible answers, in which the contestant must give the correct answer. Doing so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling much tougher questions increasing their prize fund. During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a question, as well as two \"safety nets\" \u2013 if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize. While the first few questions are generally easy, subsequent ones after them will prompt the host to ask if the answer they gave is their \"final answer\" \u2013 if it is, then it is locked in and cannot be changed. If a contestant feels unsure about an answer, and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won, to which the host will ask them to confirm this as their final decision; in such cases, the host will usually ask them to state what answer they would have gone for, and reveal if it would have been correct or incorrect.\n\n====Original format====\nDuring the British original, between 1998 and 2007, the show's format required contestants to answer fifteen questions. The payout structure was as follows (questions as guaranteed levels are highlighted with a '''bolded''' text):<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/fewer-and-harder-questions-on-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-6605687.html|title=Fewer \u2013 and Harder \u2013 Questions on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''|author=[[Show business|Showbiz]]|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=13 August 2007|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center;\n!Question number\n!Question value\n|-\n|1\n|\u00a3100\n|-\n|2\n|\u00a3200\n|-\n|3\n|\u00a3300\n|-\n|4\n|\u00a3500\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''5'''\n|'''\u00a31,000'''\n|-\n|6\n|\u00a32,000\n|-\n|7\n|\u00a34,000\n|-\n|8\n|\u00a38,000\n|-\n|9\n|\u00a316,000\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''10'''\n|'''\u00a332,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|\u00a364,000\n|-\n|12\n|\u00a3125,000\n|-\n|13\n|\u00a3250,000\n|-\n|14\n|\u00a3500,000\n|-bgcolor=navajowhite\n|'''15'''\n|'''<big>\u00a31,000,000</big>'''\n|}\n{{anchor|12-question format}}\nAfter 2007, the format was changed, reducing the number of questions to twelve; the overall change in format was later incorporated into a number of international versions over a period of four years, including the Arab, Bulgarian, Dutch, French, Polish, Spanish, and Turkish versions.

The only difference between it and the British version was that episodes were halved in length \u2013 30 minutes, as opposed to the 60-minute length of the original version. The change meant that the preliminary round of the show was eliminated, and contestants had to pass a more conventional game show qualification test. Exceptions to this arrangement, in which it was used under the name \"Fastest Finger\" included: primetime special editions of the programme; the 2004 series that was dubbed ''Super Millionaire'', in which the final prize was increased to $10,000,000;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/02/17/super-millionaire-is-looking-for-few-fast-fingers.html|title=''Super Millionaire'' Is Looking for a Few ''Fast Fingers''|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=17 February 2004|accessdate=18 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130105534/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/02/17/super-millionaire-is-looking-for-few-fast-fingers.html|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and for the 10th anniversary special of the US edition, run during August 2009 for eleven episodes. The decision to remove this round would later occur in other international versions, including the British original.\n\n=====Clock format=====\nIn 2008, the U.S. version changed its format so that contestants were required to answer questions within a set time limit. The limit varied depending on the difficulty of the question:<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080818abc04|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Kicks Off Seventh Season by Introducing New Changes to the Game, Creating New Levels of Excitement, Emotional Drama and Heart-Pounding Tension for Both Viewers and Contestants|website=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n* 15 seconds for questions 1\u20135\n* 30 seconds for questions 6\u201310\n* 45 seconds for questions 11\u201314\n* 45 seconds, plus any remaining time from the previous 14 questions for question 15\n\nTime for each question began counting down immediately after a question was given and its answers were revealed (but before reading all the answers) but was temporarily paused when a lifeline was used. If a contestant exceeded the time limit, they were forced to walk away with any prize money they had won up to that point; however, if the Double Dip lifeline is in use, then the contestant's winnings drops to the last safe haven attained. This format change was later adopted into other international versions \u2013 the British original, for example, adopted this change for episodes on 3 August 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a231867/format-changes-ahead-for-millionaire.html#~oP2IB7a62U1Vky |title=Format changes ahead for 'Millionaire' |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=23 June 2010 |work=Digital Spy |publisher=Hearst Magazines UK |accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=====Shuffle format=====\nOn 13 September 2010, the U.S. version adopted a second and more significant change in its format. In this change, the game featured two rounds. The first round consisted of ten questions, in which the cash prize associated to each value, along with the category and difficulty for each question is randomised per game. As such, the difficulty of the question in this round, is ''not'' tied to the value associated to it, and a contestant does not know what amount they won unless they provide a correct answer, or choose to walk away. As part of this format, the amount of money a contestant won in this round was banked, but if they walk away before completing the round, they left with half the amount that had been banked; if they gave an incorrect answer during this round, they left with just $1,000.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/notes/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire/the-new-season-of-millionaire-is-a-real-game-changer-click-here-to-learn-all-of-/412488051663|title=The New Season of \"Millionaire\" is a Real Game-Changer|publisher= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|date=16 August 2010|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> If they answered all ten questions correctly, they then moved onto the second round, which stuck to the standard format of the game show \u2013 the remaining questions are set to general knowledge and feature cash prizes of high, non-cumulative values. The contestant can, at this point, walk away with the total amount banked from the first round; otherwise, an incorrect answer meant they left with $25,000. The format was later modified for the fourteenth season of the US version, but retained the same arrangement for the last four questions.\n\nIn 2015, the so-called \"shuffle format\" was scrapped and the show returned to a version that closely resembled the original format.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://tv.avclub.com/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-to-feature-new-host-new-1798283830\n| title      = Who Wants To Be A Millionaire to feature new host, new/old format\n| work       = [[The A.V.

During the main game, contestants were given the option of choosing this feature, in which if they chose to use it, they gained the used of a fourth lifeline that allowed them to discuss a question with a member of the audience, in exchange for having no second safety net \u2013 if they got any question between the sixth and final cash prize amount wrong, they would leave with the guaranteed amount given for correctly answering five questions. This modified format was subsequently adopted for use in a variety of international versions abroad, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Venezuela.\n\n=====Hot Seat format=====\n{{see also|Millionaire Hot Seat}}\nIn November 2008, the Norwegian version modified the show format under the title of \"Hot Seat\". In this variation of the game, six contestants took part, with each taking it in turns to answer questions and build up their prize fund. Utilising the time limit format introduced in the US version, this variation on the format granted a contestant the right to pass the question on to another player, who cannot pass it on themselves, while eliminating both the option of walking away from a question, and the use of lifelines. If a contestant cannot pass on or correctly answer a question, they are eliminated, and the highest cash value they made is removed. The game ends when all contestants are eliminated or the question for the highest cash value is answered \u2013 if a contestant who answers the final question gives a correct answer, they win that prize; otherwise, the last contestant to be eliminated receives a small prize if they reach the fifth question safety net. This format was later introduced to various markets over the course of a four year-period from 2009 to 2012, including Italy, Hungary, Spain, Vietnam,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vtv.vn/Article/Get/Ai-la-trieu-phu-phien-ban-moi-se-ra-mat-vao-ngay-79--8b63ee3e16.html |title=Ai l\u00e0 tri\u1ec7u ph\u00fa phi\u00ean b\u1ea3n m\u1edbi s\u1ebd ra m\u1eaft v\u00e0o ng\u00e0y 7/9 |work=VTV.vn |date=12 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815043700/http://vtv.vn/Article/Get/Ai-la-trieu-phu-phien-ban-moi-se-ra-mat-vao-ngay-79--8b63ee3e16.html |archivedate=15 August 2010 |language=vi |url-status=dead }}</ref> Indonesia, [[Millionaire Hot Seat|Australia]], and Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://programas.13.cl/millonarioaltatension/|title=Canal13.cl|access-date=25 January 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716125336/http://programas.13.cl/millonarioaltatension/|archive-date=16 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Australia's version was modified to use the Norwegian's Hot Seat format. In 2017, as part of new modification to the format, the game incorporated the use of the Fastest Finger First round, with the winner able to select a lifeline, out of three that the show provided. or to keep a check for a AU$1,000.\n\n===Lifelines===\nDuring a standard play of the game, a contestant is given a series of lifelines to aid them with difficult questions. In the standard format, a contestant has access to three lifelines \u2013 the contents can use each only once per game, but can use more than one on a single question. The standard lifelines used in the original format of the game show include:\n\n* '''Ask the Audience''': the audience takes voting pads attached to their seats and votes for the answer that they believe is correct. The computer tallies the results and displays them as percentages to the contestant.\n* '''50:50''': the game's computer eliminates two wrong answers from the current question, leaving behind the correct answer and one incorrect answer. From 2000, the selection of two incorrect answers were random.\n* '''Phone a Friend''': the contestant is connected with a friend over a phone line and is given 30 seconds to read the question and answers and solicit assistance. The time begins as soon as the contestant starts reading the question.\n\nIn the US, \"Ask the Audience\" and \"Phone a Friend\" had corporate sponsorship at different periods. [[AT&T Corporation|The original AT&T]] sponsored \"Phone-a-Friend\" during the original ABC primetime show and the syndicated version's first season; [[AT&T|the current AT&T]] sponsored the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, [[AOL]] sponsored \"Ask the Audience\" and allowed users of [[AOL Instant Messenger|Instant Messenger]] to participate in the lifeline by adding the [[Screen name (computing)|screen name]] ''MillionaireIM'' to their [[contact list]]. When a contestant used the lifeline during the show, users would receive an [[instant message]] with the question and the four possible answers and would vote for the correct answer. The computer would tally these results alongside the results from the studio audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_August_23/ai_n6165047/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708211841/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_August_23/ai_n6165047/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=America Online and Buena Vista Television Break New Ground by Expanding 'Ask the Audience' Lifeline beyond the 'Millionaire' Studio via Instant Messaging |date=23 August 2004 |publisher=Business Wire |accessdate=18 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nContestants pre-select multiple friends for \"Phone a Friend,\" and as soon as the contestant begins to play, producers alert the friends and ask them to keep their phone lines free and await three rings before answering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/25/news/cl-55078 |title=Sweating Bullets on the Hot Seat as a Know-It-All Phone-a-Friend |publisher=latimes.com |date=25 April 2001 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> On 11 January 2010, the US version eliminated the use of \"Phone a Friend\" in response to an increasing trend of contestants' friends using [[web search engine]]s and other Internet resources to assist them during the calls. Producers came to feel that the lifeline was giving contestants who had friends with Internet access an unfair advantage, and they also believed it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline, by which friends provided assistance based on what they already knew.<ref>{{cite episode|season=8|number=66|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ''(U.S. version)''|network =Syndicated|date=11 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring tapings of the current British version, security personnel from the production office stay with contestants' friends at their homes to ensure integrity. During The People Play specials in 2012 and 2013, friends traveled to the studio and stayed backstage. When a contestant used the lifeline, the friend they called appeared on a monitor in the studio, and both the friend and contestant were able to see and communicate with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdA5l9xgTQ|title=The day I was phone-a-friend on Who Wants to be a Millionaire|last=The Telegraph|date=20 December 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixrqWIgCVP8|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The computer replaced the current question with another of the same difficulty. The contestant could not reinstate any lifelines used on the original question.<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\"/> A variation of this lifeline for the US version, called \"Cut the Question\", was brought into use in 2014 for a week-long run of special episodes that featured child contestants, in which it could only be used within the first ten questions.\n* '''Double Dip''' \u2013 One of two lifelines created for the ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off of the US version. When used, this lifeline allowed contestants to make two guesses at a question, but forbade them from using any other lifelines they had left or from walking away with their current winnings. If the contestant first used 50:50 and then used Double Dip on the same question, it would guarantee them the correct answer. When the standard US format incorporated a time limit on questions, the show retired 50:50 and replaced it with Double Dip.<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\"/> This lifeline was also used in the Russian version (without a clock format) but did not replace 50:50.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXXBqZjnTdA&t=1199s|title=\u041a\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c?

When chosen, a sequestered panel of three experts (chosen by the producers) appears via face-to-face audio and video feed to provide assistance. Like \"Phone a Friend,\" this lifeline incorporated a 30-second time limit for its use. This lifeline was also used in the Russian version between 2006 and 2008 but did not feature experts.\n* '''Ask the Expert''' \u2013 Inspired by \"Three Wise Men\", this lifeline provided the contestant with one person, an expert selected for them, to help them with the question. Unlike its predecessor, this lifeline had no time limit on its use, but was only available after the fifth question;<ref name=Expert>{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/millionaire_asktheexpert.htm|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Ask the Expert Lifeline|publisher=about.com|last=Grosvenor|first=Carrie|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> after \"Phone a Friend\" was removed in 2010, it was made readily available at any time in the game. In the US version, the lifeline was sponsored by [[Skype]] for its live audio and video feeds.<ref name=Expert/> In the Hong Kong edition, it replaced the \"Phone a Friend\" lifeline for one-off special in 2001 and for two celebrity specials in 2018, though with the celebrity contestants able to ask a panel of experts for help, present in the audience, all of whom had the question and possible answers visible to them.\n* '''Ask One of the Audience''' \u2013 Used in the German version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its \"Risk Mode\" format. When used, the contestant selects someone from the audience, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves correct, the audience member is given a small cash prize in return. This lifeline was implemented as part of the Costa Rican version, but made available after passing the first safety net.\n* '''Ask Three of the Audiences''' \u2013 Currently used in the Vietnamese version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its Original format. When used, the contestant selects three from the audiences, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves to be correct, the audience members are given a small cash prize in return (600000 \u20ab divided to members that answered correctly in the 3 audiences). This lifeline was implemented as part of the Vietnamese version, but made available after passing the first safety net. In the Philippine version, the lifeline is called ''People Speak'', which can be used at any point in the game.\n* '''Jump the Question''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show, as part of the \"Shuffle Format\", from the start of the ninth season to the end of thirteenth season. When used, prior to giving a final answer, a contestant would skip the current question and move on to the next one, but would earn no money from the question they skipped; the lifeline could not be used if they have reached the final question. Unlike other lifelines, it could be used twice during a game, except for the thirteenth season \u2013 the introduction of \"Plus One\" led to the lifeline being modified as a result. The lifeline was removed following the 2014\u201315 season.\n* '''Crystal Ball''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show, as part of specially designated weeks that used the \"Shuffle Format\". When used during the first round, the contestant is allowed to see the cash amount that is designated to the question they are currently on.<ref name=CrystalBall>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/24/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-celebrates-halloween-with-an-added-crystal-ball-lifeline-a-spooky-set-makeover-and-a-contestant-in-drag/154574/ |title='Who Wants to be a Millionaire' Celebrates Halloween With an Added \"Crystal Ball\" Lifeline, A Spooky Set Makeover and a Contestant in Drag |last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |work=TV By the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029173644/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/24/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-celebrates-halloween-with-an-added-crystal-ball-lifeline-a-spooky-set-makeover-and-a-contestant-in-drag/154574/ |archivedate=29 October 2012 }}</ref>\n* '''+1''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show from 2015 to 2019. Based on \"Ask One of the Audience\", the lifeline allows a contestant to invite on a friend from the audience to come and help them answer the question. There is no time limit, but after that question has been answered the friend has to return to the audience.\n* '''Ask the Host''' \u2013 Used in the 20th anniversary of the British original, the French and Italian revivals, as well as [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|the 21st season of the American version]]. When used by the contestant, the host uses their knowledge of a question's subject, gives their thoughts about the question, and tries to assist them with finding the correct answer out of the choices given. The lifeline features no time limit, and the host reassures all they have no connection to the outside world and receive the question and possible answers for it at the same time as the contestant, and thus have no knowledge of what the correct answer is.\n\n===Top prize winners===\nOut of all contestants that have played the game, few have been able to win the top prize on any international version of the show. The first was [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]], who won the top prize on the U.S. version on 19 November 1999. Carpenter did not use a lifeline until the final question, using his Phone-a-Friend not for help but to call his father to tell him he was about to win the million.<ref>{{cite news|first=Arlene|last=Vigoda|title=Million-dollar winner untaxed by celebrity|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=22 November 1999}}</ref>\n\nOther notable top prize winners include [[Judith Keppel]], the first winner of the UK version;<ref name=\"wilson\">{{cite news |title=Wilson: Millionaire win 'planned' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1035069.stm |work=BBC News |date=22 November 2000 |accessdate=28 January 2007}}</ref> Kevin Olmstead from the U.S. version, who won a progressive jackpot of $2.18&nbsp;million;<ref name=\"Jackpot\">{{cite news|title=Double jackpot winner on US Millionaire|work=BBC News|date=11 April 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1271553.stm|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> [[Martin Flood]] from the Australian version, who was investigated by producers after suspicions that he had cheated, much like [[Charles Ingram]], but was later cleared;<ref>{{cite news|title=Second Aussie 'Millionaire' winner emerges|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/11/14/1131951103121.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> [[Mana Ashida]] from the Japanese version; and Sushil Kumar from the Indian version, who is often referred to in Western media as the \"real-life ''Slumdog Millionaire''\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Burke|first=Jason|title='Real Slumdog Millionaire' is first to win $1m on Indian gameshow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/27/real-slumdog-millionaire-indian-gameshow?newsfeed=true|accessdate=6 September 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Stanglin|first=Douglas|title=Real-life 'Slumdog Millionaire' wins $1M in India|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/11/real-life-slumdog-millionaire-wins-1m-in-india/1?csp=34news|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Indian man becomes real life Slumdog Millionaire as he wins game show|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/8866558/Indian-man-becomes-real-life-Slumdog-Millionaire-as-he-wins-game-show.html|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Magnier|first=Mark|title=Indian from modest background becomes TV game show millionaire|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/28/world/la-fg-india-slumdog-20111029|accessdate=6 September 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Beard|first=Lanford|title='Slumdog Millionaire' comes to life for Sushil Kumar|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/27/slumdog-millionaire-sushil-kumar|accessdate=7 March 2015|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly PopWatch|date=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Original version==\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

In 2016 TV Nova returned the show with the original name ''Chcete b\u00fdt milin\u00e1\u0159em?'' For now, the show was hosted by the czech actor [[Marek Va\u0161ut]], but it ran for just a one season and then it was cancelled. The main prize of ''Chcete b\u00fdt milion\u00e1\u0159em'' was 10 milions czech crowns, in ''Milion\u00e1\u0159'' it was 2 milion crowns.\n* In 2001, a Hong Kong version called ''[[Baak Maan Fu Yung]]'' was launched by [[Asia Television]]. It ran until 2005, and was hosted by actor [[Kenneth Chan Kai-tai|Kenneth Chan]].\n* Singapore hosted its own version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' in both English and Chinese versions (dubbed ''Bai Wan Da Ying Jia''), and ran until 2003. It was hosted by Mark van Cuylenberg (or simply known by the stage name of 'The Flying Dutchman') in the English version, and Taiwanese actor Timothy Chao in the Chinese version. The series produced no top prize winners on either versions, but one contestant, Steven Tan, won $250,000 on December 27, 2001, and Tan remained as the biggest cash winner in Singaporean game show's history since.<ref>\n{{cite book |author=8 days |title= 8 days Issue 587|url= |location= Singapore |publisher= MediaCorp|page= 12|date= January 3, 2002|isbn=}}</ref>\n* In 2007, a [[B\u01cei W\u00e0n Zh\u00ec Du\u014d X\u012bng|Chinese version]] was launched, hosted by L\u01d0 F\u00e1n.

A similar show entitled ''[[Show do Milh\u00e3o]]'' (which was hosted by [[Silvio Santos]]) aired on [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]] between 1999 and 2003 (with a further revival in 2009).\n* In 2018, a Nepalese version of the game was launched under the title of ''[[Ko Banchha Crorepati]]''. The show is hosted by [[Rajesh Hamal]] on [[AP1 Television|AP1 HD]].\n* On 11 August 2018, a Mauritian Version has been launched on [[MBC 1 (Mauritius)|MBC 1]] by the [[Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://millions.mu/|title=Qui veut gagner des millions ?|website=millions.mu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> The show is present by Sandra Mayotte, 14th female host for the franchise \"Qui Veut Gagner Des Millions?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://millions.mu/sandra-mayotte/|title=Qui veut gagner des millions ?|website=millions.mu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref>\n* In 2020, a Thai version entitled ''\u0e43\u0e04\u0e23\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e28\u0e23\u0e29\u0e10\u0e35'' on [[PPTV (Thailand)|PPTV]].

The Strachans' score provides drama and tension, and unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] takes inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and their cues from the 6th/3rd to 10th/7th question, and then from the 11th/8th question onwards, take the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan |last=Smurthwaite |first=Nick |newspaper=[[The Stage]] |date=21 March 2005 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991 |archivedate=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On [[Game Show Network]] (GSN)'s ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\">{{Cite episode|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|series=Gameshow Hall of Fame|publisher=GSN|date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Strachans' ''Millionaire'' soundtrack was honoured by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] with numerous awards, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the U.S. version's clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favour of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=21 August 2014|access-date=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821203218/http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|archive-date=21 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\n[[File:Milonario El Salvador.jpg|thumb|TV studio of ''[[\u00bfQui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario? (Salvadoran game show)|\u00bfQui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario?]]'', the [[Salvadorian]] version of the show.]]\nThe basic set design used in the ''Millionaire'' franchise was conceived by British [[production designer]] [[Andy Walmsley]], and is the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> Unlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the programme feels more like a [[Thriller film|movie thriller]] than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The main game typically has the contestant and host sit in \"Hot Seats\",<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> which are slightly-modified, {{convert|3|foot|m}}-high Pietranera Arco All chairs situated in the centre of the stage; an [[LG Electronics|LG]] computer monitor directly facing each seat displays questions and other pertinent information.\n\nThe lighting system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses further into the game. There are also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporised, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside a prison while an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the U.S. ''Millionaire'' introduced its shuffle format, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able to walk around the stage. According to Vieira, the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|date=15 September 2010|network=Syndicated}}</ref> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colours and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=10 September 2012|accessdate=12 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Catchphrase===\n''Millionaire'' has made [[catchphrase]]s out of several lines used on the show. The most well-known of these catchphrases is the host's question \"Is that your final answer?\", asked whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified.<ref name=\"Commentary\">Commentary provided by Tarrant on the DVD ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?: Magic Moments and More''.</ref> The question is asked because the rules require that the contestants must clearly indicate their choices before they are made official, the nature of the game allowing them to ponder the options before committing to an answer. Regularly on tier-three questions, a dramatic pause occurs between the contestant's statement of their answer and the host's acknowledgement of whether or not it is correct.\n\nMany parodies of ''Millionaire'' have capitalised on the \"final answer\" catchphrase. In the United States, the phrase was popularised by Philbin during his tenure as the host of that country's version,<ref name=\"TV Series Finale\"/> to the extent that [[TV Land]] listed it in its special ''100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases'', which aired in 2006.<ref>The Star Ledger. 11 December 2006</ref>\n\nOn the Australian versions, McGuire replaces the phrase with \"Lock it in?\"; likewise, the Indian version's hosts have used varying \"lock\" catchphrases. There are also a number of other non-English versions of ''Millionaire'' where the host does not ask \"[Is that your] final answer?\" or a literal translation thereof.<ref>Certain non-English ''Millionaire'' shows' hosts, in their \"final answer\" phrases, translate these words as \"definitive answer\", \"final decision\", etc.</ref> Besides the \"final answer\" question, other catchphrases used on the show include the contestants' requests to use lifelines, such as \"I'd like to phone a friend\"; and a line that Tarrant spoke whenever a contestant was struggling with a particular question, \"Some questions are only easy if you know the answer.\"<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' has been credited with single-handedly reviving interest in, and breaking new ground for, the television game show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> It revolutionised the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the most popular game shows in television history, and is credited by some with paving the way for the phenomenon of reality programming.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Awards, accolades and honours===\nIn 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] honoured the UK version of ''Millionaire'' by ranking it number 23 on its \"BFI TV 100\" list, which compiled what British television industry professionals believed were the greatest programmes to have ever originated from that country.<ref>{{cite web|title=The BFI TV 100 at the BFI website |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/index.html |publisher=British Film Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524092249/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/index.html |archivedate=24 May 2009 }}</ref> The UK ''Millionaire'' also won the 1999 [[British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Award]] for Best Entertainment Programme, and four [[National Television Awards]] for Most Popular Quiz Programme from 2002 to 2005.\n\nThe original primetime version of the U.S. ''Millionaire'' won two [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show|Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show]] in 2000 and 2001.

In September 2001, Ingram took part in the game show for two days, joined by his wife Diana and college lecturer [[Tecwen Whittock]]. After his first day, he devised a plan to help him win the \u00a31 million cash prize the following day \u2013 for each question he faced, Ingram would read out the answers for a question, whereupon Whittock, who sat amongst the contestants who would play Fastest Finger First, would cough whenever the correct answer was spoken out. As Ingram drew close to the top prize, production staff backstage became suspicious over the amount of back noise Whittock was creating with his coughing. In addition, they also became concerned that Ingram showed no sign of having specialist knowledge on any subject he faced in his questions, in contrast to previous contestants. After the episode had been filmed, an investigation was ordered. Ingram was informed that he was suspected of cheating, and thus was not allowed to take his winnings; his reaction to this news further justified suspicions he had cheated. When the footage was reviewed, staff began to notice the pattern between Whittock's coughing and Ingram's behaviour when he chose an answer. After suspending the broadcast of both episodes Ingram featured in, police were called in to investigate the matter further.\n\nIn April 2003, Ingram, Diana, and Whittock were taken to court on the charge of using fraudulent means to win the top prize on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''. During the trial, the defence claimed that Whittock had simply suffered from allergies during recording of the second episode, but the prosecution refuted this by revealing footage that showed his coughing stopped, upon Ingram leaving the set and Whittock subsequently taking his turn on the main game. The trial concluded with all three being found guilty and receiving suspended sentences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2910119.stm|title=Millionaire trio escape jail|work=BBC News|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref> After the trial, ITV aired a documentary about the scandal, along with Ingram's entire game, complete with Whittock's coughing sounds.

This game featured an altered version of the shuffle format, condensing the number of questions to twelve\u2014eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.<ref>The rules of the Facebook game are sourced from the following page: {{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/playmillionaire/app_423340984404330|publisher=Ludia|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Scrapped animated spin-off===\nIn September 2001, [[Celador]] signed a deal with [[DIC Entertainment]] to produce a cartoon based on the show titled ''The Adventures of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? \u2013 The Animated Series''.<ref>https://www.c21media.net/celador-dic-to-make-animated-millionaire/</ref><ref>https://www.awn.com/news/dic-asks-celedor-your-final-answer</ref> The series was to follow fictional winners of the show, who would have used their prize money to take trips to various exotic locations, while the fictional host would keep in touch with them through the Millionaire Command Center.\n\nThe series was planned to be shown off at [[MIPCOM]] that year, however nothing else was confirmed for the series, and was silently scrapped without a formal announcement.\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!}}\n[[File:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Play It! Sound Stage after 2004 closure.jpg|thumb|right|The building housing the California version after its 2004 closure]]\nA theme park attraction based on the show, known as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!]]'', appeared at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (when it was known as ''Disney-MGM Studios'') at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] and at [[Disney California Adventure Park]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a \"Fastest Finger\" question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show.

Are we one big grand experiment in the basic overall blink of the universe, or the galaxy? In which case, who is behind it?

Movies: Ridley Scott |publisher=Yahoo! |date=30 November 1937 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> His visual style, incorporating a detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent generation of filmmakers.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Visual style\"/> Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples include ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and ''Blade Runner''; the ''LA Times'' critic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter \"Blade Crawler\" \"because it's so damn slow\". Another technique he employs is use of sound or music to build tension, as heard in ''Alien'', with hissing steam, beeping computers and the noise of the machinery in the space ship. Scott claims to have an [[eidetic memory]], which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/ridley-scott-magic-comes-over-the-horizon-every-day/ |title=Ridley Scott: 'Magic comes over the horizon every day' &#124; Hero Complex \u2013 movies, comics, pop culture|work=Los Angeles Times |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nScott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: \"I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and&nbsp;\u2013 whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up&nbsp;\u2013 then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on.\"<ref name=\"gangster\"/>\n\n[[Artificial intelligence]] is a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, particularly in ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 121-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> The recent book ''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'' identifies [[Alan Turing]] and [[John Searle]], a professor at the University of California, as presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as the [[Turing test]] and the [[Chinese Room]] Thought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled \"What's Wrong with Building Replicants,\" which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 136-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> The chapter titled \"Artificial Intelligence in ''Blade Runner'', ''Alien'', and ''Prometheus'',\" concludes by citing the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] in the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants in ''Blade Runner'' (Rutger Hauer), the android [[Ash (Alien)|Ash]] (Ian Holm) in ''Alien'', and the android [[David 8]] (Michael Fassbender) in ''Prometheus'', where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 140-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref>\n\n==DVD format and Director's Cut==\nScott is known for his enthusiasm for the DVD format, providing [[Audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentaries]] and interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine, he stated: \"After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it.\"<ref name=\"totalfilm\"/>\n\nRunning alongside his enthusiasm for DVD, Scott is known for his use of the [[director's cut]].<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> The positive reaction to the ''Blade Runner'' Director's Cut encouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (including ''Legend'' and ''Kingdom of Heaven''), which have been met with great acclaim.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.\n\n==Accolades==\n[[File:Ridley Scott at the RCA July 2015.jpg|thumb|Sir Ridley Scott, Honorary Doctor, at the [[Royal College of Art]], July 2015]]\nScott was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[2003 New Year Honours]] for services to the British film industry.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=56797 |date=31 December 2002 |page=1 |supp=y}}</ref> He received his accolade from [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] at an investiture ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 July 2003.<ref name=\"knighted\"/> Scott admitted feeling \"stunned and truly humbled\" after the ceremony, saying, \"As a boy growing up in [[South Shields]], I could never have imagined that I would receive such a special recognition.

Examples include ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and ''Blade Runner''; the ''LA Times'' critic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter \"Blade Crawler\" \"because it's so damn slow\". Another technique he employs is use of sound or music to build tension, as heard in ''Alien'', with hissing steam, beeping computers and the noise of the machinery in the space ship. Scott claims to have an [[eidetic memory]], which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/ridley-scott-magic-comes-over-the-horizon-every-day/ |title=Ridley Scott: 'Magic comes over the horizon every day' &#124; Hero Complex \u2013 movies, comics, pop culture|work=Los Angeles Times |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nScott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: \"I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras.

So you move on.\"<ref name=\"gangster\"/>\n\n[[Artificial intelligence]] is a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, particularly in ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 121-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> The recent book ''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'' identifies [[Alan Turing]] and [[John Searle]], a professor at the University of California, as presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as the [[Turing test]] and the [[Chinese Room]] Thought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled \"What's Wrong with Building Replicants,\" which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 136-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> The chapter titled \"Artificial Intelligence in ''Blade Runner'', ''Alien'', and ''Prometheus'',\" concludes by citing the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] in the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants in ''Blade Runner'' (Rutger Hauer), the android [[Ash (Alien)|Ash]] (Ian Holm) in ''Alien'', and the android [[David 8]] (Michael Fassbender) in ''Prometheus'', where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 140-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref>\n\n==DVD format and Director's Cut==\nScott is known for his enthusiasm for the DVD format, providing [[Audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentaries]] and interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine, he stated: \"After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity.

Created by [[William J. Bell]], the role was introduced in 1990 \u2014 by [[Edward J. Scott]] \u2014 under the portrayal of [[Kimberlin Brown]], who portrayed the role for many intervals on both soaps until 2006. That same year, [[Michelle Stafford]] took over the role, after Sheila had plastic surgery to look like  [[Phyllis Summers]]. Brown returned to the role of Sheila on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', beginning on June 9, 2017.\n\nSheila is known as a [[villain]]. A significant portion of Sheila's history on both soaps revolves around her long-running conflict with [[Lauren Fenmore]], whom she has attempted to kill on multiple occasions. She has also had conflicts with [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]], [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]], [[Amber Moore]], [[Taylor Hayes (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Taylor Hayes]], [[Brooke Logan]], [[Phyllis Summers]], and [[Quinn Fuller]].\n\n==Casting and creation==\nThe role was portrayed by [[Kimberlin Brown]] for a total of 16 years.

There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [I mean] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to.

So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that.

Sheila was a nurse who worked at Genoa City Memorial Hospital and immediately fell in love with the married [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Dr. Scott Grainger]]. Her feelings for Scott quickly turned from infatuation to obsession. In order to steal him away from his wife [[Lauren Fenmore]], Sheila drugged him and had sex with him, resulting in a pregnancy. At the same time Lauren also became pregnant by Scott but didn't tell him. When the truth about the father of Sheila's baby came out, Scott felt obligated, so he thus divorced Lauren and married Sheila.\n\nSheila's baby died, unbeknownst to Scott, and she secretly switches Lauren's newborn with a [[black market]] baby, which Lauren named Dylan. Sheila began passing Lauren's baby off as her own, and Dylan eventually dies from [[meningitis]]. Sheila's mother, Molly Carter, found out about her daughter's crime and intended to tell Lauren the truth, but suffers a stroke that rendered her speechless. Sheila sent her mother to her farmhouse in Michigan before Molly could expose her. Lauren eventually found out about the baby switch, but not before Sheila kidnapped both Lauren and Molly, and almost succeeded in killing both women, when during a brief struggle Lauren accidentally kicked over a lantern on a coffee table, setting the farmhouse they were imprisoned in on fire. Lauren and Molly are rescued by Lauren's ex-husband, private investigator [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]], and his secretary, [[Lynne Bassett]]. Sheila was never found, and authorities presumed that she perished in the fire when a body burned beyond recognition turned up in the ashes. The corpse turned out to be a meter man that had visited the house just before the fire started; Sheila had escaped from the burning building. Picking up a discarded newspaper in an area diner, she read about an opening working as a company nurse for the Forresters in [[Los Angeles]]. She left Wisconsin to travel to California. Meanwhile, Lauren is reunited with Scott and her real son, [[Scott Grainger, Jr.|Scott Jr.]]\n\n===1992\u20131998===\nIn 1992, Sheila is reintroduced on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' and she quickly worms her way into fashion [[CEO]] [[Eric Forrester]] ([[John McCook]])'s life by becoming the company nurse at [[Forrester Creations]] in [[Los Angeles]], as well as working as [[Rick Forrester]]'s nanny (after staging an accident that leaves the former nanny, Judy, injured, and later threatening Judy and her family). Sheila and Eric fall in love and are eventually engaged, which angers Eric's ex-wife [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]] ([[Susan Flannery]]), who suspects Sheila is a [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]] and a liar.  To Sheila's dismay, Eric's most recent ex-wife [[Brooke Logan Forrester]] ([[Katherine Kelly Lang]]) is pregnant with a child that may either belong to Eric or his son [[Ridge Forrester]] ([[Ronn Moss]]). After [[Bridget Forrester]] is born, Sheila manipulates the paternity test so that everyone will believe Ridge is the father. Security guard [[Mike Guthrie]] (Ken Hanes) catches her in the act and after threatening to blackmail her with the details, Sheila sets loose a vicious dog to attack him.\n\nMeanwhile, Lauren finds out that Sheila is alive and well, and living on the West Coast. Lauren follows her and they once again fight. Lauren threatens to expose Sheila to the Forrester family, but Sheila turns the tables on Lauren by [[blackmail]]ing her with pictures she took of Lauren sleeping with [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]) and sent to Lauren as puzzle pieces.  Despite Sheila's love for Eric, she panics when Lauren attempts to disclose her past at the wedding, and leaves a heartbroken Eric at the altar.  After the guests leave, Sheila returns to the chapel and pleads for Eric's forgiveness.  Although Eric demands answers, he eventually forgives Sheila and the two are married. Sheila and Brooke become close friends.  Sheila and Eric's marriage becomes rocky when Sheila accepts a job from Brooke, who seizes control of Forrester Creations with her patent on the BeLieF formula.  Eric feels betrayed by her actions and a rift is created in their marriage.  Sheila proposes the two take a vacation and use this time to reconnect.  The two leave town for [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]].  Scott, who became ill, also vacations with Lauren in Catalina Island, where the two run into Eric and Sheila.  Lauren intends to use Scott to expose Sheila's past to Eric; however, Scott, still caring for Sheila, keeps mum.   Scott eventually dies on the island as a result of his illness.  With both women by his side, he wishes that Lauren give Sheila a second chance. Lauren tearfully agrees.\n\nWhen Sheila becomes concerned that Eric is excluding her from his will, she decides she would be more financially secure if she gave Eric a child.  After a [[one-night stand]] with former rival Connor Davis (Scott Thompson Baker), Sheila goes to Eric claiming she is pregnant with his child. Eric, who had recently had a [[vasectomy]], tells Sheila he wants a divorce. Brooke's fiance [[James Warwick (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Dr. James Warwick]] ([[Ian Buchanan]]) turns out to be a friend of Sheila's former [[psychiatrist]] Jay Garvin. James suspects Sheila is hiding something from the family, and tries to pry information from Dr. Garvin.  However, during a brief struggle, Sheila accidentally pushes Jay off a balcony and to his death.  James later learns from Lauren the secrets of her past. After attempting to drown Lauren in a hot tub, Sheila kidnaps James with the help of her new partner-in-crime, the security guard Mike. She imprisons him in the basement of her house (known as \"The Houdini House\") for some time. When James escapes and her secrets finally surface, she holds Stephanie, Eric, Ridge, Brooke, Lauren and James hostage in the Forrester mansion, welcoming them to her \"goodbye party.\"\n\nAt the \"party,\" Sheila tells everyone in attendance how they had personally wronged her, and threatens to kill them. Holding a gun to Stephanie, Sheila has a change of heart when the others step in front of her, and swallows a bottle of poison. Having survived, Sheila is placed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], under the care of Dr. Brian Carey ([[Kin Shriner]]), but does not remain there for long, despite Stephanie's attempts to keep her there. Sheila tries to revive her friendship with Brooke, who sides with her at first, but later wants nothing to do with her. She begins dating neighbor Grant Chambers ([[Charles Grant (actor)|Charles Grant]]), and later her psychiatrist, James Warwick.  She continues to see James at this time, and memories of her [[child abuse|abusive]] childhood are revealed.\n\nSheila meets [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]] ([[Barbara Crampton]]), whom she befriends. The two are amazed to discover they both have ties to the same family. When Stephanie attempts to take Brooke's children, Sheila poisons her by replacing her medication with mercury pills until Stephanie losing her sanity and she is inpatient in a psychiatric hospital. Sheila also makes an enemy of Forrester Creations' rival, [[Sally Spectra]] ([[Darlene Conley]]) who defends Stephanie to her, thus planting the seeds of the eventual friendship between Stephanie and Sally. Ultimately Sheila frames Maggie for the poisoning of Stephanie, but later Maggie realizing who was behind the poisoning, fights with Sheila and accidentally pushes her onto a fire poker, seriously injuring her. After the fire poker incident, Sheila sets her sights on proving to James that she has changed for the better, in the hopes that he will fall in love with her. However, James has feelings for Maggie instead. Maggie goes to Sheila's house to inform her that she needs to find a new therapist, because Maggie wouldn't allow her to see James anymore. As Maggie taunts her, Sheila snaps and nearly chokes Maggie to death. Mike later kidnaps her and holds her prisoner at an amusement park. Sheila, wanting to prove to James that she had changed, agrees to release Maggie.\n\nAfter having crashed James and Maggie's wedding, Sheila reveals that she has become pregnant after a night alone with James. The three come to a [[legal settlement|settlement]] that Sheila would temporarily stay with them until her baby was born, and the child would be given to James and Maggie.  After Sheila hands her baby, Mary, over to the Warwicks, she relocates to [[Death Valley]], where she meets [[Amber Moore]] ([[Adrienne Frantz]]). Anxious to see her daughter, Sheila suggests that Amber babysit for James and Maggie, so that she can secretly visit Mary in LA. Amber is hired and keeps her alliance with Sheila secret for some time, but when Sheila threatens her, she reveals to James and Maggie the real reason why she applied to be Mary's babysitter. Sheila eventually takes matters into her own hands and takes Mary back. James attempts to trick Sheila into marrying him, so that he can gain full custody of his daughter. When Sheila realizes the marriage is a set-up, she attempts to kill herself again by jumping off a roof.  James, who had actually fallen for Sheila during this time, promises to stay with her. Meanwhile, an angry Maggie sneaks into Sheila's hospital room and cuts off her [[oxygen]]. Sheila is rescued by doctors and Maggie is immediately arrested. With the help of Mike and his brother Martin, a desperate Maggie captures Sheila and holds her prisoner, appropriately, in the house from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].  When Sheila escapes, James demands that Maggie leave.  Maggie and Lauren later team up in an attempt to drive Sheila over the edge. They wire Sheila's house with hidden cameras and an audio system, while the former nanny Judy surprises Sheila on her doorstep.  The plan fails, however, and Maggie, realizing James and the baby are lost to her, leaves town. When a friendship begins between James and Stephanie, a [[paranoia|paranoid]] Sheila becomes jealous and attempts to drown Stephanie in a pool.  To prevent Stephanie from telling anyone about this incident, Sheila threatens to kill Stephanie's grandson, [[Thomas Forrester]].  Sheila is arrested for the threat, but secretly switches places with a woman named Sybil.  After breaking out of prison in disguise, Sheila shoots Stephanie, kidnaps baby Mary and leaves town.\n\n===2002\u20132003===\nSheila returns to Los Angeles four years later to find her now-teenage daughter [[Erica Lovejoy|Mary]] (whom she had renamed Erica Lovejoy) ([[Courtnee Draper]]). Erica, who is completely unaware of her mother's past or her own real name, has traveled to L.A. to meet her idol - Amber Forrester. She soon develops a crush on Amber's husband, [[Rick Forrester]], although she never intends to act on her feelings. Sheila convinces Erica to seduce Rick, saying that a Forrester man would never abandon the woman carrying his child. She then pays off a man named Lance to drug Amber and take her to bed.  Amber tracks Lance down and begins to question him. When a nervous Lance threatens to tell Amber everything, Sheila kills him by releasing a jar of [[bee]]s into his apartment.  Amber becomes increasingly suspicious and confronts Erica in Rick's office. During a struggle, Erica falls and hits her head on a desk, making Amber look guilty of pushing her.  At the hospital, a disguised Sheila confronts Amber, warning her to stay away from her daughter.  Amber decides to look for clues at Erica's apartment, but is impeded when Sheila throws a pot at the window and the police arrive, arresting Amber and causing the Forresters to distrust her further.  Meanwhile, while browsing through a photo album of Eric's, Erica is startled to find a picture of her mother.  She learns that Sheila was formerly married to Eric, and that her mother wants her to live the life she had always dreamed of with Rick.  Sheila pushes Erica to have sex with Rick, so that she can live vicariously as a Forrester through her daughter.\n    \nAs a reluctant Erica is about to carry out her mother's plan, Rick's brother Ridge bursts in and exposes Erica's true identity. Rick kicks Erica out, but not before Sheila kidnaps Amber, who is stunned to learn that Erica is really Mary Warwick.  Sheila stages a crime scene and drags Amber off to her apartment. [[Massimo Marone]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]), who had been romantically involved with Sheila for a short time, gets a call from her, and Stephanie recognizes her voice.  The two track Sheila and Amber down.  Sheila then flees and holds Eric and [[Taylor Hayes Forrester]] ([[Hunter Tylo]]) hostage at the mansion. But when Brooke walks into the room, a struggle ensues in which Taylor and Brooke are shot. Brooke survives her wounds, whereas Taylor succumbs (a few years later, Taylor was revealed to still be alive). Sheila is arrested and subsequently confronted by her daughter, who condemns Sheila's actions and wants nothing to do with her. Sheila is jailed for her crimes but soon escapes with the help of a sympathetic warden named Sugar ([[Robin Mattson]]).   \n   \nShe then kidnaps Ridge and Brooke, while on their [[South American]] [[honeymoon]]. Soon Ridge's half-brother [[Nick Marone]] ([[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]]) arrives to rescue Ridge but he is soon captured by Sheila as well. When Ridge and Nick's father, Massimo, arrives to deliver the ransom, Sheila reveals that she had a baby daughter, Diana, whom she claims to be the result of the fling she had with Massimo during her previous trip to L.A. When Massimo tries (unsuccessfully) to trick Sheila into handing over the infant, she and Sugar run away. Brooke and Nick are soon rescued; however, it is believed that Ridge had been burned to death in the foundry Sheila stashed him in. Soon after, it is revealed that Ridge had survived, and he reunites with Brooke on the island.\n\n===2005\u20132007===\nSheila returns to Genoa City (on ''The Young and the Restless'') after being unseen for ten years, and begins terrorizing Lauren Fenmore once again, by indirectly turning her now-adult son Scott ([[Blair Redford]]) against her, under the alias Brenda Harris. It is soon revealed that the woman in the psychiatric hospital who was believed to be Sheila is actually Sugar - Sheila drugged and tricked her into having plastic surgery in order to look just like Sheila, and then turned Sugar in to the police. Meanwhile, the real Sheila develops another persona, Jennifer Mitchell, by wearing a fake nose, wig, and speaking in a British accent. She allies with [[The Young and the Restless characters (2000s)#Tom Fisher|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]), who helps her in her scheme to poison Lauren with a necklace that Scott offers to his mother as a gift. In exchange, Tom has Sheila manipulate his estranged wife [[Gloria Abbott Bardwell|Gloria Abbott]] ([[Judith Chapman]]) into giving him money and later bailing him out of prison.\n\nWhen Lauren plans a rooftop dinner with her fianc\u00e9 [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]), Sheila surprises her and persuades her to commit suicide by jumping off of the roof. Lauren believes Sheila is a hallucination, but before she can jump, Michael rescues her. At the hospital, Sheila sneaks into Lauren's room as \"Jennifer,\" and attempts to inject the poison into Lauren's bloodstream, but is interrupted. She then convinces Tom \u2014 Michael's stepfather \u2014 to help her abduct Lauren from a yacht while on her honeymoon with Michael. She then bombs the yacht, hoping to kill both Lauren and Tom, whom she wants to take the fall for the crime.  Tom realizes Sheila's plan, and traps both Sheila and Lauren in a bomb shelter.  Tom leaves the two together and in the meantime is shot and killed by [[John Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|John Abbott]] ([[Jerry Douglas]]). As the bomb shelter collapses, Lauren is astonished when Sheila saves her life.  Meanwhile, Sugar manages to leave the psychiatric hospital, and goes to see Scott, who believes she is Sheila. Sugar then proceeds to stab him in order to exact her revenge on Sheila. Sugar is arrested; upon seeing her, Lauren immediately knows it is not Sheila whose ankle is sprained.  The real Sheila is seen in a plastic surgeon's office, asking for a new face.\n\nMonths later: it is revealed that Sheila Carter is still alive, had plastic surgery to look like [[Phyllis Summers Newman]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]), and that Paul Williams had been hiding the fact that he had been keeping her locked in a cage she had constructed in an abandoned warehouse. Ultimately, Sheila is determined to escape and take Phyllis's place in order to infiltrate Michael and Lauren's lives. Sheila is accidentally freed from the prison she created for Lauren by Maggie Sullivan, Paul's girlfriend. After acting as a kidnap victim and pleading for Maggie's help, Maggie sets her free but Sheila chokes her unconscious, steals her gun, and then shoots her, but Maggie survives.\n\nSubsequently, Paul returns to the warehouse only to be ambushed by Sheila who imprisons both Paul and Maggie in that cage. Sheila then went to Phyllis', tied her up and waited for Lauren and baby Fen to arrive while taunting Phyllis about how great it would be to take over her life with her husband [[Nicholas Newman]] ([[Joshua Morrow]]) and her baby Summer. After Lauren arrived she was tied up, and Sheila flees with Phyllis and babies Fen and Summer as hostages. By this time, Michael arrives at the warehouse and frees Paul and Maggie, the latter being taken to the hospital.\n\nPosing as an elderly woman named Betsy, Sheila takes Phyllis, Summer, and Fen to a nearby retirement home to hide out. After learning of their location, Lauren goes to that home carrying a gun in her purse. Following a tip from a neighbor, Lauren finds Sheila's apartment and forces her way inside. Sheila and Phyllis then argue over who is who, and Lauren screams at them to stop. Sheila then runs to grab baby Summer in order to use her as a shield against Lauren; Phyllis tells Lauren to point the gun at her to protect her daughter, and a frightened Lauren, realizing the real Phyllis would never put her daughter in the line of fire, turns to Sheila and shoots her. Sheila is then declared dead at the scene.\n\n===2010, 2012===\nIn 2010, Sarah Smythe, Sheila Carter's sister, arrives in Genoa City. Having herself had plastic surgery to resemble Lauren, Sarah holds both Phyllis and Lauren responsible for her sister's death. Sarah devises a plan with [[Daisy Carter]] and [[Ryder Callahan]], Sheila's twins with Tom Fisher, to take over Lauren's life and riches. The plan fails, with Lauren shooting and killing Sarah in self-defense to Sarah's attempt to fire her gun at Phyllis. In 2012, a woman claiming to be Daisy's mother checks her out of a mental institution, signing the name \"Sheila Carter\" on the release form. Michael has said signature analyzed to see if it fits Sheila's handwriting, and results turn out to be inconclusive.\n\n===2017\u20132018===\nSheila (Brown) returns to Los Angeles in June 2017. When she attempts to leave [[Katie Logan]] ([[Heather Tom]])'s home without being noticed, [[Quinn Fuller|Quinn Forrester]] ([[Rena Sofer]]) hears her leaving, immediately asking who she is. Introducing herself as a friend of the [[Logan family]], Sheila reveals herself to Katie, asking for her assistance in making amends with those she had wronged in Los Angeles. Startled by her arrival, Katie immediately alerts Eric of Sheila's re-appearance; arriving at Katie's and believing that Sheila is the one who shot at Quinn, Eric escorts Sheila to the police station, and has her arrested for violating an order of protection he had previously filed years prior.  When it is revealed that [[Deacon Sharpe]] ([[Sean Kanan]]) is the one who was targeting Quinn, Eric extends an olive branch to Sheila, welcoming her back to the Forrester estate, much to the disapproval of Quinn and Ridge ([[Thorsten Kaye]]). Sheila immediately begins to dig into the life of Eric, rooting herself into his marriage with Quinn. After scheming with Forrester security officer, Charlie Webber, Sheila exposes Quinn's affair with Ridge.  As Sheila comforts and supports an emotionally hurt Eric, she is confronted by [[Steffy Forrester]] ([[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]]), who \u2014 believing Sheila to be armed \u2014 shoots her in Eric's hotel room, but she survives, only sustaining a flesh wound.  Sheila continues to insinuate herself into Eric's life, faking a concussion after a catfight with Quinn to manipulate Eric into letting her stay in the Forrester mansion.  Sheila blackmails her ex-husband, James Warwick, into lying about the severity of her condition, but slips up when Quinn catches her walking around normally.  Sheila gets a waitressing job in town to eavesdrop on the residents of Los Angeles, and later offers Eric's estate manager Mateo money to seduce Quinn, but her plan is foiled when Mateo tells Quinn the truth.  Sheila is thrilled when Eric invites her to the Forrester mansion with the intention of replacing Quinn's portrait with Sheila's, but this turns out to be a ruse.  As Eric and Quinn again demand that Sheila leave, Sheila smiles to herself outside the closed mansion door.\n\n==Critical reception==\nSheila is often considered to be one of the most popular villains in daytime.<ref name=\"Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/slideshow/2013/06/15/soap-opera-villains-bad-guys-daytime-emmys |title=Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains|website=www.hlntv.com |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> Kimberlin Brown was nominated for a Daytime Emmy in the role as Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1993.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/whoswho/sheila.php Sheila Carter biography] at SoapCentral\n\n{{The Young and the Restless}}\n{{The Bold and the Beautiful}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carter, Sheila}}\n[[Category:The Young and the Restless characters]]\n[[Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1990]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional nurses]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| name = Sheila Carter<!--The title of the page should be left here-->\n| series = The Young and the Restless\n| image = File:Kimberlin Brown as Sheila Carter.png\n| caption = Kimberlin Brown as Sheila Carter\n| image2 =File:Pheila.jpg\n| imagesize2=200px\n| caption2 = Michelle Stafford as Sheila Carter\n| portrayer = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Kimberlin Brown]] (1990\u20132006, 2017\u2013present)\n* [[Michelle Stafford]] (2006\u20132007)\n}}\n| creator = [[William J.

Scott]] \u2014 under the portrayal of [[Kimberlin Brown]], who portrayed the role for many intervals on both soaps until 2006. That same year, [[Michelle Stafford]] took over the role, after Sheila had plastic surgery to look like  [[Phyllis Summers]]. Brown returned to the role of Sheila on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', beginning on June 9, 2017.\n\nSheila is known as a [[villain]]. A significant portion of Sheila's history on both soaps revolves around her long-running conflict with [[Lauren Fenmore]], whom she has attempted to kill on multiple occasions.

Sheila was a nurse who worked at Genoa City Memorial Hospital and immediately fell in love with the married [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Dr. Scott Grainger]]. Her feelings for Scott quickly turned from infatuation to obsession. In order to steal him away from his wife [[Lauren Fenmore]], Sheila drugged him and had sex with him, resulting in a pregnancy. At the same time Lauren also became pregnant by Scott but didn't tell him. When the truth about the father of Sheila's baby came out, Scott felt obligated, so he thus divorced Lauren and married Sheila.\n\nSheila's baby died, unbeknownst to Scott, and she secretly switches Lauren's newborn with a [[black market]] baby, which Lauren named Dylan. Sheila began passing Lauren's baby off as her own, and Dylan eventually dies from [[meningitis]]. Sheila's mother, Molly Carter, found out about her daughter's crime and intended to tell Lauren the truth, but suffers a stroke that rendered her speechless. Sheila sent her mother to her farmhouse in Michigan before Molly could expose her. Lauren eventually found out about the baby switch, but not before Sheila kidnapped both Lauren and Molly, and almost succeeded in killing both women, when during a brief struggle Lauren accidentally kicked over a lantern on a coffee table, setting the farmhouse they were imprisoned in on fire. Lauren and Molly are rescued by Lauren's ex-husband, private investigator [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]], and his secretary, [[Lynne Bassett]]. Sheila was never found, and authorities presumed that she perished in the fire when a body burned beyond recognition turned up in the ashes. The corpse turned out to be a meter man that had visited the house just before the fire started; Sheila had escaped from the burning building. Picking up a discarded newspaper in an area diner, she read about an opening working as a company nurse for the Forresters in [[Los Angeles]]. She left Wisconsin to travel to California. Meanwhile, Lauren is reunited with Scott and her real son, [[Scott Grainger, Jr.|Scott Jr.]]\n\n===1992\u20131998===\nIn 1992, Sheila is reintroduced on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' and she quickly worms her way into fashion [[CEO]] [[Eric Forrester]] ([[John McCook]])'s life by becoming the company nurse at [[Forrester Creations]] in [[Los Angeles]], as well as working as [[Rick Forrester]]'s nanny (after staging an accident that leaves the former nanny, Judy, injured, and later threatening Judy and her family). Sheila and Eric fall in love and are eventually engaged, which angers Eric's ex-wife [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]] ([[Susan Flannery]]), who suspects Sheila is a [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]] and a liar.  To Sheila's dismay, Eric's most recent ex-wife [[Brooke Logan Forrester]] ([[Katherine Kelly Lang]]) is pregnant with a child that may either belong to Eric or his son [[Ridge Forrester]] ([[Ronn Moss]]). After [[Bridget Forrester]] is born, Sheila manipulates the paternity test so that everyone will believe Ridge is the father. Security guard [[Mike Guthrie]] (Ken Hanes) catches her in the act and after threatening to blackmail her with the details, Sheila sets loose a vicious dog to attack him.\n\nMeanwhile, Lauren finds out that Sheila is alive and well, and living on the West Coast. Lauren follows her and they once again fight. Lauren threatens to expose Sheila to the Forrester family, but Sheila turns the tables on Lauren by [[blackmail]]ing her with pictures she took of Lauren sleeping with [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]) and sent to Lauren as puzzle pieces.  Despite Sheila's love for Eric, she panics when Lauren attempts to disclose her past at the wedding, and leaves a heartbroken Eric at the altar.  After the guests leave, Sheila returns to the chapel and pleads for Eric's forgiveness.  Although Eric demands answers, he eventually forgives Sheila and the two are married. Sheila and Brooke become close friends.  Sheila and Eric's marriage becomes rocky when Sheila accepts a job from Brooke, who seizes control of Forrester Creations with her patent on the BeLieF formula.  Eric feels betrayed by her actions and a rift is created in their marriage.  Sheila proposes the two take a vacation and use this time to reconnect.  The two leave town for [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]].  Scott, who became ill, also vacations with Lauren in Catalina Island, where the two run into Eric and Sheila.  Lauren intends to use Scott to expose Sheila's past to Eric; however, Scott, still caring for Sheila, keeps mum.   Scott eventually dies on the island as a result of his illness.  With both women by his side, he wishes that Lauren give Sheila a second chance. Lauren tearfully agrees.\n\nWhen Sheila becomes concerned that Eric is excluding her from his will, she decides she would be more financially secure if she gave Eric a child.  After a [[one-night stand]] with former rival Connor Davis (Scott Thompson Baker), Sheila goes to Eric claiming she is pregnant with his child. Eric, who had recently had a [[vasectomy]], tells Sheila he wants a divorce. Brooke's fiance [[James Warwick (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Dr. James Warwick]] ([[Ian Buchanan]]) turns out to be a friend of Sheila's former [[psychiatrist]] Jay Garvin. James suspects Sheila is hiding something from the family, and tries to pry information from Dr. Garvin.  However, during a brief struggle, Sheila accidentally pushes Jay off a balcony and to his death.  James later learns from Lauren the secrets of her past. After attempting to drown Lauren in a hot tub, Sheila kidnaps James with the help of her new partner-in-crime, the security guard Mike. She imprisons him in the basement of her house (known as \"The Houdini House\") for some time. When James escapes and her secrets finally surface, she holds Stephanie, Eric, Ridge, Brooke, Lauren and James hostage in the Forrester mansion, welcoming them to her \"goodbye party.\"\n\nAt the \"party,\" Sheila tells everyone in attendance how they had personally wronged her, and threatens to kill them. Holding a gun to Stephanie, Sheila has a change of heart when the others step in front of her, and swallows a bottle of poison. Having survived, Sheila is placed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], under the care of Dr. Brian Carey ([[Kin Shriner]]), but does not remain there for long, despite Stephanie's attempts to keep her there. Sheila tries to revive her friendship with Brooke, who sides with her at first, but later wants nothing to do with her. She begins dating neighbor Grant Chambers ([[Charles Grant (actor)|Charles Grant]]), and later her psychiatrist, James Warwick.  She continues to see James at this time, and memories of her [[child abuse|abusive]] childhood are revealed.\n\nSheila meets [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]] ([[Barbara Crampton]]), whom she befriends. The two are amazed to discover they both have ties to the same family. When Stephanie attempts to take Brooke's children, Sheila poisons her by replacing her medication with mercury pills until Stephanie losing her sanity and she is inpatient in a psychiatric hospital. Sheila also makes an enemy of Forrester Creations' rival, [[Sally Spectra]] ([[Darlene Conley]]) who defends Stephanie to her, thus planting the seeds of the eventual friendship between Stephanie and Sally. Ultimately Sheila frames Maggie for the poisoning of Stephanie, but later Maggie realizing who was behind the poisoning, fights with Sheila and accidentally pushes her onto a fire poker, seriously injuring her. After the fire poker incident, Sheila sets her sights on proving to James that she has changed for the better, in the hopes that he will fall in love with her. However, James has feelings for Maggie instead. Maggie goes to Sheila's house to inform her that she needs to find a new therapist, because Maggie wouldn't allow her to see James anymore. As Maggie taunts her, Sheila snaps and nearly chokes Maggie to death. Mike later kidnaps her and holds her prisoner at an amusement park. Sheila, wanting to prove to James that she had changed, agrees to release Maggie.\n\nAfter having crashed James and Maggie's wedding, Sheila reveals that she has become pregnant after a night alone with James. The three come to a [[legal settlement|settlement]] that Sheila would temporarily stay with them until her baby was born, and the child would be given to James and Maggie.  After Sheila hands her baby, Mary, over to the Warwicks, she relocates to [[Death Valley]], where she meets [[Amber Moore]] ([[Adrienne Frantz]]). Anxious to see her daughter, Sheila suggests that Amber babysit for James and Maggie, so that she can secretly visit Mary in LA. Amber is hired and keeps her alliance with Sheila secret for some time, but when Sheila threatens her, she reveals to James and Maggie the real reason why she applied to be Mary's babysitter. Sheila eventually takes matters into her own hands and takes Mary back. James attempts to trick Sheila into marrying him, so that he can gain full custody of his daughter. When Sheila realizes the marriage is a set-up, she attempts to kill herself again by jumping off a roof.  James, who had actually fallen for Sheila during this time, promises to stay with her. Meanwhile, an angry Maggie sneaks into Sheila's hospital room and cuts off her [[oxygen]]. Sheila is rescued by doctors and Maggie is immediately arrested. With the help of Mike and his brother Martin, a desperate Maggie captures Sheila and holds her prisoner, appropriately, in the house from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].  When Sheila escapes, James demands that Maggie leave.  Maggie and Lauren later team up in an attempt to drive Sheila over the edge. They wire Sheila's house with hidden cameras and an audio system, while the former nanny Judy surprises Sheila on her doorstep.  The plan fails, however, and Maggie, realizing James and the baby are lost to her, leaves town. When a friendship begins between James and Stephanie, a [[paranoia|paranoid]] Sheila becomes jealous and attempts to drown Stephanie in a pool.  To prevent Stephanie from telling anyone about this incident, Sheila threatens to kill Stephanie's grandson, [[Thomas Forrester]].  Sheila is arrested for the threat, but secretly switches places with a woman named Sybil.  After breaking out of prison in disguise, Sheila shoots Stephanie, kidnaps baby Mary and leaves town.\n\n===2002\u20132003===\nSheila returns to Los Angeles four years later to find her now-teenage daughter [[Erica Lovejoy|Mary]] (whom she had renamed Erica Lovejoy) ([[Courtnee Draper]]). Erica, who is completely unaware of her mother's past or her own real name, has traveled to L.A. to meet her idol - Amber Forrester. She soon develops a crush on Amber's husband, [[Rick Forrester]], although she never intends to act on her feelings. Sheila convinces Erica to seduce Rick, saying that a Forrester man would never abandon the woman carrying his child. She then pays off a man named Lance to drug Amber and take her to bed.  Amber tracks Lance down and begins to question him. When a nervous Lance threatens to tell Amber everything, Sheila kills him by releasing a jar of [[bee]]s into his apartment.  Amber becomes increasingly suspicious and confronts Erica in Rick's office. During a struggle, Erica falls and hits her head on a desk, making Amber look guilty of pushing her.  At the hospital, a disguised Sheila confronts Amber, warning her to stay away from her daughter.  Amber decides to look for clues at Erica's apartment, but is impeded when Sheila throws a pot at the window and the police arrive, arresting Amber and causing the Forresters to distrust her further.  Meanwhile, while browsing through a photo album of Eric's, Erica is startled to find a picture of her mother.  She learns that Sheila was formerly married to Eric, and that her mother wants her to live the life she had always dreamed of with Rick.  Sheila pushes Erica to have sex with Rick, so that she can live vicariously as a Forrester through her daughter.\n    \nAs a reluctant Erica is about to carry out her mother's plan, Rick's brother Ridge bursts in and exposes Erica's true identity. Rick kicks Erica out, but not before Sheila kidnaps Amber, who is stunned to learn that Erica is really Mary Warwick.  Sheila stages a crime scene and drags Amber off to her apartment. [[Massimo Marone]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]), who had been romantically involved with Sheila for a short time, gets a call from her, and Stephanie recognizes her voice.  The two track Sheila and Amber down.  Sheila then flees and holds Eric and [[Taylor Hayes Forrester]] ([[Hunter Tylo]]) hostage at the mansion. But when Brooke walks into the room, a struggle ensues in which Taylor and Brooke are shot. Brooke survives her wounds, whereas Taylor succumbs (a few years later, Taylor was revealed to still be alive). Sheila is arrested and subsequently confronted by her daughter, who condemns Sheila's actions and wants nothing to do with her. Sheila is jailed for her crimes but soon escapes with the help of a sympathetic warden named Sugar ([[Robin Mattson]]).   \n   \nShe then kidnaps Ridge and Brooke, while on their [[South American]] [[honeymoon]]. Soon Ridge's half-brother [[Nick Marone]] ([[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]]) arrives to rescue Ridge but he is soon captured by Sheila as well. When Ridge and Nick's father, Massimo, arrives to deliver the ransom, Sheila reveals that she had a baby daughter, Diana, whom she claims to be the result of the fling she had with Massimo during her previous trip to L.A. When Massimo tries (unsuccessfully) to trick Sheila into handing over the infant, she and Sugar run away. Brooke and Nick are soon rescued; however, it is believed that Ridge had been burned to death in the foundry Sheila stashed him in. Soon after, it is revealed that Ridge had survived, and he reunites with Brooke on the island.\n\n===2005\u20132007===\nSheila returns to Genoa City (on ''The Young and the Restless'') after being unseen for ten years, and begins terrorizing Lauren Fenmore once again, by indirectly turning her now-adult son Scott ([[Blair Redford]]) against her, under the alias Brenda Harris. It is soon revealed that the woman in the psychiatric hospital who was believed to be Sheila is actually Sugar - Sheila drugged and tricked her into having plastic surgery in order to look just like Sheila, and then turned Sugar in to the police. Meanwhile, the real Sheila develops another persona, Jennifer Mitchell, by wearing a fake nose, wig, and speaking in a British accent. She allies with [[The Young and the Restless characters (2000s)#Tom Fisher|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]), who helps her in her scheme to poison Lauren with a necklace that Scott offers to his mother as a gift. In exchange, Tom has Sheila manipulate his estranged wife [[Gloria Abbott Bardwell|Gloria Abbott]] ([[Judith Chapman]]) into giving him money and later bailing him out of prison.\n\nWhen Lauren plans a rooftop dinner with her fianc\u00e9 [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]), Sheila surprises her and persuades her to commit suicide by jumping off of the roof. Lauren believes Sheila is a hallucination, but before she can jump, Michael rescues her. At the hospital, Sheila sneaks into Lauren's room as \"Jennifer,\" and attempts to inject the poison into Lauren's bloodstream, but is interrupted. She then convinces Tom \u2014 Michael's stepfather \u2014 to help her abduct Lauren from a yacht while on her honeymoon with Michael. She then bombs the yacht, hoping to kill both Lauren and Tom, whom she wants to take the fall for the crime.  Tom realizes Sheila's plan, and traps both Sheila and Lauren in a bomb shelter.  Tom leaves the two together and in the meantime is shot and killed by [[John Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|John Abbott]] ([[Jerry Douglas]]). As the bomb shelter collapses, Lauren is astonished when Sheila saves her life.  Meanwhile, Sugar manages to leave the psychiatric hospital, and goes to see Scott, who believes she is Sheila. Sugar then proceeds to stab him in order to exact her revenge on Sheila. Sugar is arrested; upon seeing her, Lauren immediately knows it is not Sheila whose ankle is sprained.  The real Sheila is seen in a plastic surgeon's office, asking for a new face.\n\nMonths later: it is revealed that Sheila Carter is still alive, had plastic surgery to look like [[Phyllis Summers Newman]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]), and that Paul Williams had been hiding the fact that he had been keeping her locked in a cage she had constructed in an abandoned warehouse. Ultimately, Sheila is determined to escape and take Phyllis's place in order to infiltrate Michael and Lauren's lives. Sheila is accidentally freed from the prison she created for Lauren by Maggie Sullivan, Paul's girlfriend. After acting as a kidnap victim and pleading for Maggie's help, Maggie sets her free but Sheila chokes her unconscious, steals her gun, and then shoots her, but Maggie survives.\n\nSubsequently, Paul returns to the warehouse only to be ambushed by Sheila who imprisons both Paul and Maggie in that cage. Sheila then went to Phyllis', tied her up and waited for Lauren and baby Fen to arrive while taunting Phyllis about how great it would be to take over her life with her husband [[Nicholas Newman]] ([[Joshua Morrow]]) and her baby Summer. After Lauren arrived she was tied up, and Sheila flees with Phyllis and babies Fen and Summer as hostages. By this time, Michael arrives at the warehouse and frees Paul and Maggie, the latter being taken to the hospital.\n\nPosing as an elderly woman named Betsy, Sheila takes Phyllis, Summer, and Fen to a nearby retirement home to hide out. After learning of their location, Lauren goes to that home carrying a gun in her purse. Following a tip from a neighbor, Lauren finds Sheila's apartment and forces her way inside. Sheila and Phyllis then argue over who is who, and Lauren screams at them to stop. Sheila then runs to grab baby Summer in order to use her as a shield against Lauren; Phyllis tells Lauren to point the gun at her to protect her daughter, and a frightened Lauren, realizing the real Phyllis would never put her daughter in the line of fire, turns to Sheila and shoots her. Sheila is then declared dead at the scene.\n\n===2010, 2012===\nIn 2010, Sarah Smythe, Sheila Carter's sister, arrives in Genoa City. Having herself had plastic surgery to resemble Lauren, Sarah holds both Phyllis and Lauren responsible for her sister's death. Sarah devises a plan with [[Daisy Carter]] and [[Ryder Callahan]], Sheila's twins with Tom Fisher, to take over Lauren's life and riches. The plan fails, with Lauren shooting and killing Sarah in self-defense to Sarah's attempt to fire her gun at Phyllis. In 2012, a woman claiming to be Daisy's mother checks her out of a mental institution, signing the name \"Sheila Carter\" on the release form. Michael has said signature analyzed to see if it fits Sheila's handwriting, and results turn out to be inconclusive.\n\n===2017\u20132018===\nSheila (Brown) returns to Los Angeles in June 2017. When she attempts to leave [[Katie Logan]] ([[Heather Tom]])'s home without being noticed, [[Quinn Fuller|Quinn Forrester]] ([[Rena Sofer]]) hears her leaving, immediately asking who she is. Introducing herself as a friend of the [[Logan family]], Sheila reveals herself to Katie, asking for her assistance in making amends with those she had wronged in Los Angeles. Startled by her arrival, Katie immediately alerts Eric of Sheila's re-appearance; arriving at Katie's and believing that Sheila is the one who shot at Quinn, Eric escorts Sheila to the police station, and has her arrested for violating an order of protection he had previously filed years prior.  When it is revealed that [[Deacon Sharpe]] ([[Sean Kanan]]) is the one who was targeting Quinn, Eric extends an olive branch to Sheila, welcoming her back to the Forrester estate, much to the disapproval of Quinn and Ridge ([[Thorsten Kaye]]). Sheila immediately begins to dig into the life of Eric, rooting herself into his marriage with Quinn. After scheming with Forrester security officer, Charlie Webber, Sheila exposes Quinn's affair with Ridge.  As Sheila comforts and supports an emotionally hurt Eric, she is confronted by [[Steffy Forrester]] ([[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]]), who \u2014 believing Sheila to be armed \u2014 shoots her in Eric's hotel room, but she survives, only sustaining a flesh wound.  Sheila continues to insinuate herself into Eric's life, faking a concussion after a catfight with Quinn to manipulate Eric into letting her stay in the Forrester mansion.  Sheila blackmails her ex-husband, James Warwick, into lying about the severity of her condition, but slips up when Quinn catches her walking around normally.  Sheila gets a waitressing job in town to eavesdrop on the residents of Los Angeles, and later offers Eric's estate manager Mateo money to seduce Quinn, but her plan is foiled when Mateo tells Quinn the truth.  Sheila is thrilled when Eric invites her to the Forrester mansion with the intention of replacing Quinn's portrait with Sheila's, but this turns out to be a ruse.  As Eric and Quinn again demand that Sheila leave, Sheila smiles to herself outside the closed mansion door.\n\n==Critical reception==\nSheila is often considered to be one of the most popular villains in daytime.<ref name=\"Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/slideshow/2013/06/15/soap-opera-villains-bad-guys-daytime-emmys |title=Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains|website=www.hlntv.com |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> Kimberlin Brown was nominated for a Daytime Emmy in the role as Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1993.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/whoswho/sheila.php Sheila Carter biography] at SoapCentral\n\n{{The Young and the Restless}}\n{{The Bold and the Beautiful}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carter, Sheila}}\n[[Category:The Young and the Restless characters]]\n[[Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1990]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional nurses]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Carter"}
