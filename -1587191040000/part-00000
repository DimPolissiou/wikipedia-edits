The program's name is a tribute to former Prime Minister and widow of President Zardari, [[Benazir Bhutto]], who was assassinated in 2007.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nSince 2005, the purchasing power of many Pakistani families has been eroded by high inflation and the increasing cost of food and oil.  BISP arose against this backdrop as a means to address reductions in purchasing power.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Along with the economic development aims of the program, BISP also seeks to empower women by presenting cash transfers directly to female members of households.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP is currently the largest aid program in Pakistan and the government's third largest budgetary allocation.  BISP spending accounts for 0.3% of Pakistan's GDP.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn the 2008\u20132009 fiscal year, more than 3 million Pakistani families received cash transfers through BISP; this figure accounts for 1.5% of the general population{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}} and 10% of the population below the poverty level.  For the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year, the program was expanded to cover 5 million low-income families.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  At the program's start in 2008, the Pakistani government allocated RS 34&nbsp;billion, or $425&nbsp;million, for BISP; the allocation doubled to RS 70&nbsp;billion, or $875&nbsp;million in the following year.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme is planning to launch a new initiative that encourages [[human capital]] development through a [[conditional cash transfer]].  The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will condition cash payments on primary school enrolment for the children of eligible families.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}} On 18 June 2017, BISP launched an e-commerce platform for its beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/millennialpk/pakistans-new-plan-to-eradicate-poverty-use-embroidery-4a14b5cdfac0|title=Pakistan\u2019s New Plan to Eradicate Poverty: Use Embroidery|last=Wani|first=Shahrukh|date=2017-06-18|website=Medium|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Eligibility==\nTo be eligible for cash payments under BISP, families must earn less than RS 6,000 per month; equivalent to $67.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Further eligibility requirements stipulate that:\n*Families must have a female applicant holding a valid ID card\n*An individual applicant must be a widowed or divorced female without male family members\n*Eligible families include those with physically or mentally disabled individuals\n\nFamilies deemed ineligible for cash payments through BISP include those with:{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n*Members employed by the Pakistani government, army, or any other government-affiliated agency\n*Members drawing a pension or receiving post-retirement benefits from the government\n*Family members owning more than 3 acres of farmland or more than 80 square yards of residential land\n*Members receiving income from other sources\n*Members holding a machine readable passport\n*Members with a National Identity Card for Overseas citizens\n*Members with a bank account excluding microfinance banks and those catering to low-inc\nome families\n\n==Benefits==\nEligible families receive cash payments of 4834 quarterly.  This amount increases the purchasing power for families earning approximately RS 5,000 each month by 20%.  Most low-income families spend 50\u201370% of total income on food alone.  According to BISP, the cash payment of RS 3,000 every two months, or RS 1,500 each month, will allow a family of 5\u20136 to purchase 20\u201325 days worth of flour.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\n==Criticism==\nSince the program's inception, critics have pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design.  Some claim that the amount of RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished families above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month.  Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality.  Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers.{{Sfn|Rawlings-Rubio 2003}}  Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n \nThere have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism.  By some estimates, only 50\u201360 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed.  Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates.  For example, in the Prime Minister's hometown of Multan, there is twice the number of people receiving BISP payments than in Lahore, the opposition party's stronghold.  Punjab, another area where opposition parties dominate, has the lowest ratio of eligible families\u20141,974 for every 100,000 people; versus 6,829 families for every 100,000 people in Sindh, the ruling party's stronghold.{{Sfn|Ghauri 2012}}  Beneficiaries have also complained that the postal service charges an additional RS 100 to RS 200 for each delivery of payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nOther critics have argued that as the Benazir Income Support Programme makes up a substantial portion of the Pakistani government's budget, impact evaluations should be conducted to evaluate the benefits and actual need for the program.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

BISP spending accounts for 0.3% of Pakistan's GDP.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn the 2008\u20132009 fiscal year, more than 3 million Pakistani families received cash transfers through BISP; this figure accounts for 1.5% of the general population{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}} and 10% of the population below the poverty level.  For the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year, the program was expanded to cover 5 million low-income families.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  At the program's start in 2008, the Pakistani government allocated RS 34&nbsp;billion, or $425&nbsp;million, for BISP; the allocation doubled to RS 70&nbsp;billion, or $875&nbsp;million in the following year.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme is planning to launch a new initiative that encourages [[human capital]] development through a [[conditional cash transfer]].  The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will condition cash payments on primary school enrolment for the children of eligible families.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}} On 18 June 2017, BISP launched an e-commerce platform for its beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/millennialpk/pakistans-new-plan-to-eradicate-poverty-use-embroidery-4a14b5cdfac0|title=Pakistan\u2019s New Plan to Eradicate Poverty: Use Embroidery|last=Wani|first=Shahrukh|date=2017-06-18|website=Medium|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme has been implemented in the provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Baluchistan]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtonnkhwa]].  The program also operates in the federally administered regions of [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]], and the Islamabad Capital Territory.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nIn its first year of operation, recipients of BISP cash transfers were identified and selected by Parliamentarians through a process of recommendation.  Each Parliamentarian received 8,000 forms to distribute throughout his or her constituency.  Selected individuals underwent an eligibility verification process through the National Database and Registration Authority.  A final list of eligible families was generated and sent to the postal service.  Funds were disbursed from the Treasury directly to the postal service and then delivered to the female head of eligible households.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn April 2009, the process for identifying a selecting eligible families through Parliamentarian recommendation was ended.  The identification process has been reformed and now uses a Poverty Scorecard.  Through the Poverty Scorecard, families are identified through a proxy means test.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}  The Poverty Scorecard has been approved by the World Bank and requires families to answer 13 questions regarding assets and expenses in a survey.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  The poverty survey has been tested in 16 districts and will be distributed nationwide.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nInternal monitoring systems are being developed to track deliveries and payment amounts to eligible families.  Another mechanism to address corruption and political favouritism is being considered that would allow a neutral third party access to the list of eligible families to verify eligibility.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nRecently, BISP has expanded to include several special initiatives.  The Waseela-e-Haq program empowers women through the provision of small loans.  A vocation training program, Waseela-e-Rozgar, offers members of eligible families up to 1 year of professional training.  The Waseela-e-Sehat program provides financial assistance specifically for obtaining basic health care.  BISP will launch its first program that conditions cash payments on schooling. The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will require families receiving cash payments to enroll children between the ages of 5 to 12 to enroll in primary education.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP also provides cash payments for emergency relief efforts.  These payments are similar to the payments received by low-income families but are distributed to families affected by terrorism, war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\n==Eligibility==\nTo be eligible for cash payments under BISP, families must earn less than RS 6,000 per month; equivalent to $67.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Further eligibility requirements stipulate that:\n*Families must have a female applicant holding a valid ID card\n*An individual applicant must be a widowed or divorced female without male family members\n*Eligible families include those with physically or mentally disabled individuals\n\nFamilies deemed ineligible for cash payments through BISP include those with:{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n*Members employed by the Pakistani government, army, or any other government-affiliated agency\n*Members drawing a pension or receiving post-retirement benefits from the government\n*Family members owning more than 3 acres of farmland or more than 80 square yards of residential land\n*Members receiving income from other sources\n*Members holding a machine readable passport\n*Members with a National Identity Card for Overseas citizens\n*Members with a bank account excluding microfinance banks and those catering to low-inc\nome families\n\n==Benefits==\nEligible families receive cash payments of 4834 quarterly.  This amount increases the purchasing power for families earning approximately RS 5,000 each month by 20%.  Most low-income families spend 50\u201370% of total income on food alone.  According to BISP, the cash payment of RS 3,000 every two months, or RS 1,500 each month, will allow a family of 5\u20136 to purchase 20\u201325 days worth of flour.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\n==Criticism==\nSince the program's inception, critics have pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design.  Some claim that the amount of RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished families above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month.  Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality.  Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers.{{Sfn|Rawlings-Rubio 2003}}  Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n \nThere have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism.  By some estimates, only 50\u201360 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed.  Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates.  For example, in the Prime Minister's hometown of Multan, there is twice the number of people receiving BISP payments than in Lahore, the opposition party's stronghold.  Punjab, another area where opposition parties dominate, has the lowest ratio of eligible families\u20141,974 for every 100,000 people; versus 6,829 families for every 100,000 people in Sindh, the ruling party's stronghold.{{Sfn|Ghauri 2012}}  Beneficiaries have also complained that the postal service charges an additional RS 100 to RS 200 for each delivery of payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nOther critics have argued that as the Benazir Income Support Programme makes up a substantial portion of the Pakistani government's budget, impact evaluations should be conducted to evaluate the benefits and actual need for the program.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\n==List of Chairpersons of Benazir Income Support Program==\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n!align=center|Name of Chairperson\n!align=center|Entered Office\n!align=center|Left Office\n|-\n|[[Farzana Raja]]\n|July 2008\n|March 2013\n|-\n|Vacant\n|March 2013\n|November 2013\n|-\n|[[Enver Baig]]\n|November 2013\n|November 2014\n|-\n|Vacant\n|November 2014\n|February 2015\n|-\n|[[Marvi Memon]]\n|February 2015\n|June 2018\n|-\n|Vacant\n|June 2018\n|October 2018\n|-\n|[[Sania Nishtar]]\n|October 2018\n|Present\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

Spencer's biggest rival is her older sister, Melissa, and the two are constantly fighting over something. Their relationship is often strained by the fact that Spencer has a habit of crushing on Melissa's boyfriends. In the first season, she begins a relationship with fellow student and strained Rosewood student Toby Cavanaugh. Throughout the series, Spencer is revealed to be the biological daughter of Mary Drake and the sister of Charlotte Drake.\n\n===Aria Montgomery===\n{{main|Aria Montgomery}}\nConsidered the \"alternative\" one of the group, '''Aria Montgomery''', portrayed by [[Lucy Hale]], is more outgoing in fashion and what she sees as acceptable behavior. She moves back to Rosewood with her family after living in Iceland for a year. Before Alison's death, she and Alison discovered that Aria's father was having an affair with one of his former students, Meredith, who became his coworker at Hollis College. Alison encourages Aria to tell her mother the truth, but instead, Aria reluctantly agrees to keep her father's secret. On top of that, she finds herself involved with her high school English teacher, Ezra Fitz, after making out with him in a pub bathroom and discovering he was her English teacher on the first day of school.\n\n===Hanna Marin===\n{{main|Hanna Marin}}\nPretty and fierce, '''Hanna Marin''', portrayed by [[Ashley Benson]], is the diva and \"[[it girl]]\" of the group, having taken Alison's place as the most popular girl at Rosewood High.

She feels betrayed by her father, who has remarried, and she does not get along well with his new wife and daughter. When Hanna's mother falls upon financial hardship, she steals thousands of dollars from the bank she worked at, which Hanna is forced to keep a secret.\n\n===Emily Fields===\n{{main|Emily Fields}}\nThe \"[[Jock (athlete)|jock]]\" of the group, '''Emily Fields''', portrayed by [[Shay Mitchell]], is a highly competitive swimmer, considered the star of Rosewood's swimming team. She is shown as a sweet and shy young. For a short time, Emily lives with Hanna, after her mother moves to Texas to live with Emily's father, who is stationed in Fort Hood. She begins to question her sexuality because of her feeling for Alison, but later accepts the fact that she is a lesbian and starts to date girls. She eventually begins a relationship with Sara Harvey, until she discovers that she is an ally of the antagonist.\n\n===Alison DiLaurentis===\n{{main|Alison DiLaurentis}}\nThe former \"[[Queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]]\" of her clique, '''Alison DiLaurentis''', portrayed by [[Sasha Pieterse]], used to be the most popular girl in school before her disappearance and alleged death. Although she cared for her friends, she enjoyed using their deepest secrets against them to keep them in line. Charming and manipulative, Alison was skilled at finding ways to blackmail everyone, and many people hated her. She knew everybody's secrets, but since she's been gone her friends are beginning to realize how little they really knew about her. She is revealed to be alive and on the run from \"A.\"\n\n===Mona Vanderwaal===\n{{main|Mona Vanderwaal}}\nA former \"unpopular\" girl at Rosewood, '''Mona Vanderwaal''', portrayed by [[Janel Parrish]], longed to be accepted into Alison's group and was continuously mocked by her. After Alison's disappearance, Mona befriended Hanna and they underwent an \"extreme makeover\" together; as a result, they both became popular students. When \"A\" appears, Mona becomes jealous of Hanna rekindling her friendships with the other Liars. She dislikes Caleb and makes attempts to break Hanna and Caleb up, though to no avail. She becomes romantically involved with Noel, much to Hanna's disapproval, but is later dumped by him for Jenna. When \"A\" begins sending Mona threatening notes, she grows closer to the Liars. In the second-season finale, she is in fact revealed to actually be \"A\" when she and Spencer travel to the Lost Woods Resort to uncover \"A\"'s lair. She is committed to a mental institution, Radley, after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]].\n\n===\"A\"{{anchor|A|A.D.|Uber A}}===\n{{main|A (Pretty Little Liars)}}\nThe main [[antagonist]], \"'''A'''\" is stalking and torturing the Liars in relentless and creative ways and also threatens their friends and family. In the second-season finale, it is revealed that Mona is \"A\". She is also the one who stalked Alison before her disappearance. However, when she is sent to Radley sanitarium, she is visited by CeCe Drake, who offers her a partnership and takes over the team of \"A's\", known as the A-Team. The team consists of Mona, Toby, Spencer, Sara, Lucas, Melissa, Wilden, Jenna, Noel, and Wren. Five years later, Alex Drake takes over and becomes Uber A, known as \"A.D.\", and forms the A.D.

He asked Aria to keep his affair with a student, Meredith, a secret after Aria witnessed them kissing. Regretting the affair and wanting them to be a family again, Byron moves the family to Iceland for a year as a sabbatical. The relationship between Byron and Ella becomes strained after A sends her a letter revealing Byron's affair. After spending some time apart, Ella and Byron slowly begin to rebuild their relationship. When Mike becomes depressed, Byron reveals that his brother Scott, who committed suicide, also suffered from mental illness; Byron feels guilty for not doing anything to help his brother. Byron finds out that Ezra is involved in a relationship with Aria after they tell him and Ella and is furious about it. In an effort to get Ezra away from Aria, Byron recommends him for a job in New Orleans. He also plots to send Aria to an all girls boarding school in Vermont. When Aria threatens to reveal his affair to his boss, he backs off from her but gets Ezra fired from Hollis. In season 3, Byron and Ella have divorced and Ella has moved out of the house. Byron starts seeing Meredith again. He informs Aria that Meredith got a job at Rosewood High, were Aria attends and Ella teaches. In the Halloween episode, it is revealed by Garrett that Byron may have seen Alison on the night she died. Alison told him,\"you know what I'm capable of!\"\n*{{anchor|Ella Montgomery}}'''Ella Montgomery''' ([[Holly Marie Combs]]) (seasons 1\u20137) is Aria's mother, as well as a teacher at Rosewood High. Ella believes in treating her children as friends, not as property. She has mentioned that she doesn't want to push into Aria's private life, and she thinks that Aria should be allowed to keep secrets. Ella was unaware of her husband's affair with a student until \"A\" sent her a letter. After asking Byron to move out, and his refusal, she left the home. Eventually, Aria found out her parents were secretly getting back together, and Ella decides to move back in. When her son, Mike, is depressed, she doesn't feel he needs medication, and remains somewhat in denial about his illness. She finally receives her wake-up call when he attacks her in his bedroom. When Ella found out Aria was dating Ezra, she was angry, but she believed Aria when she said she had broken it off, and tried to win her back her freedom, which Byron didn't think she deserved. Later, she finds out that Aria and Ezra are still together, and decides she is going to try to understand their relationship. Ella is aware of A, and tries to send Aria to a boarding school to get away. Aria is furious, and blackmails her mother into not going through with it. Ella tearfully tells Aria how ashamed she is, and how she doesn't know how to save their relationship. In season 3, she and Byron have divorced and Ella tries to move on with her life not knowing how. Aria creates a profile for her on a dating website under the nickname \"Hot Mamma.\" Ella is furious at Aria but later she likes the idea and starts dating again.

In season 4, she leaves Rosewood so she can go live with her boyfriend in Europe but returns at the end of season 4.\n* {{anchor|Mike Montgomery}}'''Mike Montgomery''' ([[Cody Christian]]) (seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20136) is Aria's younger brother. A lacrosse player, he suffers from a mental illness, which causes him to burst into fits of anger and later leads him to break into people's houses for fun, before he begins to shut down emotionally and withdraw completely from his family. He blames Aria for the trouble between their parents. Mike accidentally discovered that Jenna and Garrett knew each other when he stole a pot made Jenna from Garrett's house. Mike reveals to Aria that the only reason he punched Ezra was because after Ezra and Aria announced they are a couple, he feared what Byron would have done to hurt Ezra judging by the look on his face and thought, \"better I do it, than him.\" Throughout the rest of the series he appears to have improved after going to a therapist. It does not tell when or if he was still seeing his therapist. He seemed to forgive Aria and their relationship is better. He stopped being rebellious and more focused of his family's problems and helping them out. He is dating Mona Vanderwaal.\n\n===Friends===\n* {{anchor|Holden Strauss}}'''Holden Strauss''' ([[Shane Coffey]]) (seasons 2\u20133, 7) is a childhood friend of Aria's who returns with his family from a year abroad in Portugal in the middle of Season 2.

We later find out that his secret is more serious than it seemed at first when he accidentally reveals a very large bruise on his stomach, but he tells Aria not to worry about it. He eventually tells her that he is doing Tae Kwan Do, a Korean martial art, and that his parents forbid him to keep training, that is why he needs a cover. The situation turns out to be more complicated, though, when Ella tells Aria that Holden has a heart condition that could kill him any time. Aria goes to watch one of Holden's fights and she sees how much he loves to fight.

He became romantically involved with Aria after the two met at a bar and instantly bonded. When he discovered that Aria was his student, he attempted to break things off, but found himself unable to do so. He broke up with Aria for a little while in order to take time to think about their relationship. He quit his teaching position at Rosewood just before Noel threatened to expose Aria and Ezra's relationship. Ezra later explains to Aria that he was engaged to a girl named Jackie when he was in college, but that she broke it off; Jackie later returns to Rosewood after getting a teaching position at Hollis. Although Ezra loves Aria, he seems to still have some lingering feelings for Jackie, and the two remain close. His relationship with Aria is often strained by the fact that they have to hide that they are together. He confesses to Ella that he loves Aria (though she misunderstands and believes he is talking about Spencer) when he comes to comfort Aria after her arrest. In \"Through Many Danger, Toils, and Snares\" we find out that Aria broke up with Ezra because of Jackie threatening to expose their relationship but they later get back together after Aria explains to Ezra that Jackie was the reason why she broke up with him. Ezra and Aria later tell Byron and Ella that they are a couple which leads him to getting punched by Mike (though it's told he only did it fearing what Byron what would have done instead). Ezra later tells Jackie, who comes into his office trying to convince him it'll never work out for him and Aria due to age difference and the fact she's still a teenager, to get out of his office, saying he will not let her do anything to harm or hurt Aria ever again and that he wants nothing more to do with Jackie herself. Aria continues to attempt to convince her parents to allow her to date Ezra but in the meantime they try to set her up with someone else. When Aria calls Ezra, he tells her not to call him again. The two later rekindle their relationship when Aria leaves him a voice mail telling Ezra that, if he doesn't meet up with her, their relationship is over for good. Ezra turns up at the last minute after a student tells him to 'be bold' and the two kiss in the rain. Aria decides not to tell her friends that the two are back together, hoping that, by keeping it from them, she can also keep it from \"A\". They later have sex in his apartment after Ezra finds out that he has been fired from Hollis. In season 3, Aria and Ezra celebrate their one-year anniversary. Their relationship seems to be going smoothly until Ezra's younger brother Wesley \"Wes\" drops by unexpectedly. Bumps are soon formed in their relationship when Aria learns of Ezra getting his high school girlfriend Maggie pregnant and his mother paying her to disappear from his life, even though he wanted to do the right thing. Aria tracks Maggie down and discovers that she kept the baby, who is now a healthy 7-year-old boy named Malcolm, whom Ezra finds out about from a distraught Spencer. This leads him to leave Rosewood and seek out Maggie and his son; Ezra is back in Rosewood but only one day after he's back he gets a phone call from Maggie; Mrs. Fitzgerald sold Maggie's condo. Maggie asked Ezra if she and Malcolm can stay in Rosewood near him for a couple of days. Later when Spencer is part of the A-team, she picks up Malcolm from his karate class but is actually kidnapping him. Aria frantically tries to find him and when she does he tells her that Aria's friend Alison picked him up. Ezra gets a job at Rosewood High as a substitute teacher. After all the incidents with Malcolm, Aria decides that it is best that her and Ezra break up just after kissing him on the school stairs. In season four Ezra starts teaching full-time at Rosewood High again. After Aria has a dream that Ezra got arrested because of her she decided they should see other people, something Ezra had already suggested. Ezra would still do anything for Aria, as whenever she is having trouble he still steps up to help her. Ezra finds out Malcolm isn't really his son. In the season four summer finale, the Liars find a lair that they believe belongs to \"A\" and we see that Ezra is the owner, leading fans to believe him to be \"A\". However, he reveals in \"Free Fall\" that he is writing a book about Alison. He is also Board Shorts but is not the guy Alison met with at Cape May known as \"Beach Hottie\".

He is attracted to Hanna's mom, Ashley, whom he once drove home after she had been drinking and asked for a ride, later sleeping with her to make up for not charging Hanna, who was caught shoplifting. He is distrustful of the girls, frequently questioning them beyond normal means, such as when he humiliates Emily by outing her to her friends. The detective returns in season 2 episode 12, when the girls are arrested. Officer Reynolds suggests there could be a raise in this for him, as he had his suspicions of the girls to start with. He reveals to them that he knew the murder weapon all along, and the girls had just been caught with it. He had strong feelings towards them all especially Hanna, and was determined that they would be thrown into jail. The girls are very grateful for Spencer's mom for getting them out of it and landing them with community service. When Ashley begins to worry that someone is still trying to get to her daughter, she goes to Darren for help, asking him if he had anything to do with Hanna's police report being released. Darren says that information could get him fired, and he didn't release the report. The Liars find a picture of Wilden, CeCe, and Alison on his boat in Cape May the Summer Ali died. They think Wilden is the father of Alison's alleged baby. Later, Wilden confronts Ashley and when he reaches for his gun, she hits him with her car and flees the scene. When she returns with Hanna, his body is missing. His car was later found in Hanna's garage and she takes it to the lake and dumps it. In the season 4 premiere, Wilden was killed and his body was found next to his car. Also, it was revealed that he is one of the people dressed as the Queen of Hearts in the Halloween episode \"This Is a Dark Ride\" along with Melissa Hastings. The town believed that Ashley was responsible for the murder, but in the season 4 finale, it was revealed that CeCe Drake was responsible for Wilden's murder. It has been revealed that Wilden helped cover up for CeCe the night she escaped Radley and hit Ali. He was also responsible for the murder of Garrett Reynolds.\n*{{Anchor|Nigel Wright}}'''Nigel Wright''' ([[Wyatt Nash]]) (season 4) was Jenna Marshall's boyfriend, who accompanies her to Darren Wilden's funeral.
