The song was written by [[Charli XCX]], [[Ross Golan]], and its producers [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] and [[Benny Blanco]]. The song was released as the second single from ''Revival'' on September 10, 2015. It was initially composed by XCX with Stargate and later recorded by Gomez without the former in the studio at the time. \"Same Old Love\" is a [[midtempo]] [[electropop]] and [[synth-pop]] song backed by a [[Wonky (music)|wonky]] piano [[Loop (music)|loop]], a finger-click [[Beat (music)|beat]] and [[Italo disco]] synths. In the song, Gomez uses a forceful, emotive tone and a raspy delivery that are both uncharacteristic for her, accompanied by XCX\u2019s chorus vocals. According to Gomez, the lyrics are a representation of various stages of different relationships and are about getting rid of everything toxic in her life, also inspired by her relationship with her father.\n\nA number of remixes were commissioned for its release, including an official remix featuring rapper [[Fetty Wap]]. [[Music journalism|Music critics]] mostly complimented its catchy tune and understated, moody sound. The song peaked at number five on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], marking Gomez's fourth top 10 and second consecutive top five single from the album. \"Same Old Love\" also reached number one on the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart and the top 10 in Canada, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\n\"Same Old Love\" was accompanied by a [[music video]] directed by [[Michael Haussman]] and filmed in the [[Broadway Theater District (Los Angeles)|Broadway Theater District]] of [[Los Angeles]]. It premiered as an [[Apple Music]] exclusive on September 22, 2015 and was released on [[Vevo]] channel on October 7, 2015. The video was well received by critics who complimented Gomez's styling and the emotional storyline. It was inspired by works from singer [[Tony Bennett]] and Gomez's relationships with her loved ones and fans. It featured Gomez witnessing several dramatic vignettes on the streets of Los Angeles, and performing at a theater. Gomez promoted \"Same Old Love\" with several televised performances, including on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]],'' ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]],'' and at the [[2015 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Charli XCX (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|left|120px|The lyrics of \"Same Old Love\" were composed by [[Charli XCX]] (''pictured'') who also contributed with [[backing vocal]] during the [[refrain|chorus]].]]\n\n\"Same Old Love\" was written by English singer Charli XCX and Norwegian production team Stargate. During a session for Selena Gomez's 2015 studio album ''[[Revival (Selena Gomez album)|Revival]]'', Stargate presented the track to Gomez who acceded and subsequently recorded it. XCX was not at the session, although her manager was present throughout the song's recording process.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feeney|first=Nolan|date=September 30, 2015|title=Selena Gomez on Her New Album and Media Scrutiny: 'I Just Don't Care About the Noise Anymore'|url=http://time.com/4053719/selena-gomez-revival-interview/|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=December 20, 2015}}</ref> The final composition featured additional writing from Ross Golan, and Benny Blanco who also produced the song with Stargate.<ref name=\"Notes\" /> Gomez was drawn to the song as she was a fan of XCX's music and cited an emotional connection with its lyrics.

The song was written by [[Charli XCX]], [[Ross Golan]], and its producers [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] and [[Benny Blanco]]. The song was released as the second single from ''Revival'' on September 10, 2015. It was initially composed by XCX with Stargate and later recorded by Gomez without the former in the studio at the time. \"Same Old Love\" is a [[midtempo]] [[electropop]] and [[synth-pop]] song backed by a [[Wonky (music)|wonky]] piano [[Loop (music)|loop]], a finger-click [[Beat (music)|beat]] and [[Italo disco]] synths. In the song, Gomez uses a forceful, emotive tone and a raspy delivery that are both uncharacteristic for her, accompanied by XCX\u2019s chorus vocals. According to Gomez, the lyrics are a representation of various stages of different relationships and are about getting rid of everything toxic in her life, also inspired by her relationship with her father.\n\nA number of remixes were commissioned for its release, including an official remix featuring rapper [[Fetty Wap]]. [[Music journalism|Music critics]] mostly complimented its catchy tune and understated, moody sound. The song peaked at number five on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], marking Gomez's fourth top 10 and second consecutive top five single from the album. \"Same Old Love\" also reached number one on the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart and the top 10 in Canada, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\n\"Same Old Love\" was accompanied by a [[music video]] directed by [[Michael Haussman]] and filmed in the [[Broadway Theater District (Los Angeles)|Broadway Theater District]] of [[Los Angeles]]. It premiered as an [[Apple Music]] exclusive on September 22, 2015 and was released on [[Vevo]] channel on October 7, 2015. The video was well received by critics who complimented Gomez's styling and the emotional storyline. It was inspired by works from singer [[Tony Bennett]] and Gomez's relationships with her loved ones and fans. It featured Gomez witnessing several dramatic vignettes on the streets of Los Angeles, and performing at a theater. Gomez promoted \"Same Old Love\" with several televised performances, including on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]],'' ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]],'' and at the [[2015 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Charli XCX (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|left|120px|The lyrics of \"Same Old Love\" were composed by [[Charli XCX]] (''pictured'') who also contributed with [[backing vocal]] during the [[refrain|chorus]].]]\n\n\"Same Old Love\" was written by English singer Charli XCX and Norwegian production team Stargate.

European [[transgender]] people have been present in the land now known as the United States at least since the early 1600s. Before Western contact, some [[Native American tribes]] had [[third gender]] people whose [[social role]]s varied from tribe to tribe.

Raymond claimed this was done in order \"to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality\", adding: \"All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive.\" In this charge, Raymond echoed feminist [[Robin Morgan]]'s charge at the 1973 West Coast Lesbian Conference, held in Los Angeles, that pre-op transsexual folk singer Beth Elliott, who had performed the previous day, was \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\"<ref>Robin Morgan, \"Keynote Address\" Lesbian Tide.

''The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.'' Teachers College Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-2164-4}}</ref> Raymond accused Stone by name of plotting to destroy the [[Olivia Records]] collective and womanhood in general with \"male energy\". In 1976, prior to publication, Raymond had sent a draft of the chapter attacking Stone to the Olivia collective \"for comment\", apparently in anticipation of outing Stone. Raymond appeared unaware that Stone had informed the collective of her transgender status before agreeing to join. The collective did return comments to Raymond, suggesting that her description of transgender people and of Stone's place in and effect on the collective was at odds with the reality of the collective's interaction with Stone. Raymond responded by increasing the virulence of her attack on Stone in the published version of the manuscript:\n\n<blockquote>Masculine behavior is notably obtrusive. It is significant that transsexually constructed lesbian feminists have inserted themselves into positions of importance and/or performance in the feminist community. Sandy Stone, the transsexual engineer with Olivia Records, an \"all-women\" recording company, illustrates this well. Stone is not only crucial to the Olivia enterprise but plays a very dominant role there. The...visibility he achieved in the aftermath of the Olivia controversy...only serves to enhance his previously dominant role and to divide women, as men frequently do, when they make their presence necessary and vital to women. As one woman wrote: \"I feel raped when Olivia passes off Sandy...as a real woman. After all his male privilege, is he going to cash in on lesbian feminist culture too?\"<ref name=\"raymond1979\"/></blockquote> The collective responded in turn by publicly defending Stone in various feminist publications of the time. Stone continued as a member of the collective and continued to record Olivia artists until political dissension over her transgender status, exacerbated by Janice's book, culminated in 1979 in the threat of a boycott of Olivia products. After long debate, Stone left the collective and returned to Santa Cruz.\n\nBy the late 1970s, despite increasing recognition in medical circles, the battle for acceptance was far from won and some of the reverses of this period included the dissolution of some of the first transsexual advocacy groups including the NTCU, and the loss of support in both gay and feminist circles.<ref name=\"Meyerowitz-2009\" />{{rp|255}}\n\nIn 1980, transgender people were officially classified by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] as having \"[[gender identity disorder]].\"<ref name=\"glbtq\" />\n\nThe 1980s saw the founding of a number of newsletters and magazines of central importance to trans people. In the 1980s, most of the subscribers to [[Rupert Raj]]'s Toronto-based publications, ''Metamorphosis'' and ''Gender NetWorker'', were Americans. Metamorphosis was founded by Raj in early 1982 as a bi-monthly newsletter. It was a \"newsletter exclusively for F-M men\" (with an intended readership among their families, wives/girlfriends, as well as professionals and \"para professionals interested in female TSism\"). By the third issue, the newsletter averaged around 8 pages, whereas in 1986, most issues were 24 pages; the last issue was in 1988. In 1986 transgender activist Lou Sullivan founded the support group that grew into [[FTM International]], the leading advocacy group for transgender men, and began publishing ''The FTM Newsletter''.<ref name=\"glbtq\" /> Gender NetWorker was founded by Raj in 1988, and lasted two issues.

It also launched a Corporate Diversity Pledge of Fortune 500 companies that had added \"gender identity\" to their non-discrimination policies (since HRC's at that point was only \"sexual orientation\") as well as a similar Congressional Diversity Pledge. However, GenderPAC saw its focus as also including gender non-conforming gays and lesbians who were discriminated against, causing a split in the organization.

European [[transgender]] people have been present in the land now known as the United States at least since the early 1600s. Before Western contact, some [[Native American tribes]] had [[third gender]] people whose [[social role]]s varied from tribe to tribe. People dressing and living differently from their [[sex assignment]] at birth and contributing to various aspects of [[American history]] and [[American culture|culture]] have been documented from the [[Timeline of United States history#17th century|17th century]] to the present day. In the 20th and 21st centuries, advances in [[sex reassignment surgery]] as well as [[transgender activism]] have influenced transgender life and the popular perception of transgender people in the United States.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Prior to 1800===\n[[File:Catlin - Dance to the berdache.jpg|thumb|Anthropologist [[George Catlin]]'s painting, \"Dance to the [[Berdache]]\"[sic].

Raymond claimed this was done in order \"to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality\", adding: \"All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive.\" In this charge, Raymond echoed feminist [[Robin Morgan]]'s charge at the 1973 West Coast Lesbian Conference, held in Los Angeles, that pre-op transsexual folk singer Beth Elliott, who had performed the previous day, was \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\"<ref>Robin Morgan, \"Keynote Address\" Lesbian Tide.

''The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.'' Teachers College Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-2164-4}}</ref> Raymond accused Stone by name of plotting to destroy the [[Olivia Records]] collective and womanhood in general with \"male energy\". In 1976, prior to publication, Raymond had sent a draft of the chapter attacking Stone to the Olivia collective \"for comment\", apparently in anticipation of outing Stone. Raymond appeared unaware that Stone had informed the collective of her transgender status before agreeing to join. The collective did return comments to Raymond, suggesting that her description of transgender people and of Stone's place in and effect on the collective was at odds with the reality of the collective's interaction with Stone. Raymond responded by increasing the virulence of her attack on Stone in the published version of the manuscript:\n\n<blockquote>Masculine behavior is notably obtrusive. It is significant that transsexually constructed lesbian feminists have inserted themselves into positions of importance and/or performance in the feminist community. Sandy Stone, the transsexual engineer with Olivia Records, an \"all-women\" recording company, illustrates this well. Stone is not only crucial to the Olivia enterprise but plays a very dominant role there. The...visibility he achieved in the aftermath of the Olivia controversy...only serves to enhance his previously dominant role and to divide women, as men frequently do, when they make their presence necessary and vital to women. As one woman wrote: \"I feel raped when Olivia passes off Sandy...as a real woman. After all his male privilege, is he going to cash in on lesbian feminist culture too?\"<ref name=\"raymond1979\"/></blockquote> The collective responded in turn by publicly defending Stone in various feminist publications of the time. Stone continued as a member of the collective and continued to record Olivia artists until political dissension over her transgender status, exacerbated by Janice's book, culminated in 1979 in the threat of a boycott of Olivia products. After long debate, Stone left the collective and returned to Santa Cruz.\n\nBy the late 1970s, despite increasing recognition in medical circles, the battle for acceptance was far from won and some of the reverses of this period included the dissolution of some of the first transsexual advocacy groups including the NTCU, and the loss of support in both gay and feminist circles.<ref name=\"Meyerowitz-2009\" />{{rp|255}}\n\nIn 1980, transgender people were officially classified by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] as having \"[[gender identity disorder]].\"<ref name=\"glbtq\" />\n\nThe 1980s saw the founding of a number of newsletters and magazines of central important to trans people.

Metamorphosis was founded by Raj in early 1982 as a bi-monthly newsletter. It was a \"newsletter exclusively for F-M men\" (with an intended readership among their families, wives/girlfriends, as well as professionals and \"para professionals interested in female TSism\"). By the third issue, the newsletter averaged around 8 pages, whereas in 1986, most issues were 24 pages; the last issue was in 1988.

GenderPAC organized the first National Gender Lobby Day on Capitol Hill the following year, with help from activists Phyllis Frye and Jane Fee. It also launched a Corporate Diversity Pledge of Fortune 500 companies that had added \"gender identity\" to their non-discrimination policies (since HRC's at that point was only \"sexual orientation\") as well as a similar Congressional Diversity Pledge. However, GenderPAC saw its focus as also including gender non-conforming gays and lesbians who were discriminated against, causing a split in the organization.
