According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==History==\nThe town was once a Barangay of the capital town, [[Malaybalay]]. It was named after a Banglas tree, endemic tree species that inhabit and growing abundantly and distinctively only on this portion of the upper Pulangui. Banglas is hardwood that usually grows in the rocky portion of the Bobunawan riverbanks. Kabanglasan literally means a place that has plenty of Banglas.\n\nCabanglasan was created as a separate municipality from Malaybalay on August 13, 1979 by virtue of Republic Act 6489.\n\nThe movement for the separation of Cabanglasan from his mother municipality (Malaybalay) began in the early 1960s when the people of Pulangi region petitioned for the secession. This prompted the passage of House Bill No. 2789 in Congress by the then Congressman Cesar M. Fortich. The bill was enacted into law without executive approval under Republic Act 6489 but its implementation was delayed due to the declaration of martial law.\n\nDue to the persistence of the residents as spearheaded by Datu Maliwanag (Saturnino P. Linsagan), then President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] referred the matter to the mother municipality, Malaybalay. A plebiscite was then held wherein the majority voted for the implementation of RA 6489. On August 13, 1979, the first set of municipal officials headed by Mayor Saturnino P. Linsagan aka Datu Maliwanag to his tribesmen, took their oath and held their first session.\n\n==Geography==\nCabanglasan is geographically located between east longitude 125 degrees 27 minutes and north latitude 8 degrees and 3 minutes. It is located at the eastern part of the province of Bukidnon, bounded in the north and west by the City of Malaybalay and the south by the Municipality of San Fernando, and in the east by the province of Agusan del Sur.\n\nIt has a total area of {{Convert|24330|ha}}, of which 38% is Alienable and Disposable (A&D) land and 62% is timberland. It has 15 barangays, 5 of which are situated within timberland namely; Freedom, Mandahican, Mauswagon, Jasaan, and Cananga-an. Five barangays, namely; Anlugan, Cabanglasan proper, Iba, Mandaing and Dalacutan are located within A&D land while the remaining 5 barangays such as; Cabulohan, Capinonan, Imbatug, Paradise and Mauswagon are located within both timberland and A&D.\n\nIt occupies 2.52% of the total provincial area of Bukidnon and 0.74% of the regional area (Northern Mindanao).\n\n===Slope===\n\nThe major part of the municipality is classified under slope class 8 to 15 percent. Where such areas are found, it is contiguous to level areas, identified as water retaining areas potentially suited to intensive palay production. Along its North, East and South boundaries is slope class 30% and above, hilly and mountainous are declared as forestal, but not necessarily foliaged. Cabanglasan has an average elevation of 465 meters above sea level.\n\n===Climate===\n\nCabanglasan fall under the fourth type. It means that rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. May to December is usually the period with long rainfalls. While driest months last from January to April. Mountain climates reasonably form another type of climate. As far as some climatological elements are concerned, except as to temperature, rainfall generally increases with height.\n\n===Barangays===\nCabanglasan is politically subdivided into 15 [[barangay]]s.\n\n<!-- arranged by PSGC for easier updates in the future -->\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322001| Cabulohan     | 2179| 2121}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322002| Canangaan     | 2764| 2943}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322003| Iba           | 4000| 3406}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322004| Imbatug       | 2279| 2265}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322005| Lambangan     | 1112| 1073}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322006| Mandaing      | 1682| 1616}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322007| Paradise      | 2470| 2331}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322008| [[Poblacion]] | 5928| 5710}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322009| Anlogan       | 1715| 1622}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322010| Capinonan     | 2675| 2662}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322011| Dalacutan     |  614|  559}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322012| Freedom       | 1498| 1714}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322013| Mandahikan    | 2489| 1840}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322014| Mauswagon     | 1142| 1123}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322015| Jasaan        | 1450| 1442}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|bottom|32427}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Cabanglasan\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = \n| 1939 = \n| 1948 = \n| 1960 = \n| 1970 = \n| 1975 = \n| 1980 = 16843\n| 1990 = 26351\n| 1995 = 29288\n| 2000 = 32305\n| 2007 = 32817\n| 2010 = 32427\n| 2015 = 33997\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Cabanglasan was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nCabanglasan was created to become a municipality on August 13, 1979 by virtue of Republic Act 6489. On the following year, 1980, a regular census on population and housing was conducted nationwide, wherein Cabanglasan had an actual population count of 16,843.\n\nIn 1990, there was another census of population and housing. Because of the presence of the two logging companies, the T.H. Valderrama and Talakag Timber Incorporated, the population of this town grew to 26,351, an increase of about 9,508 or 56.45%. During those Censal years Barangays Cabulohan, Capinonan and Imbatug had a greater number of population because it was where the logging companies established their plant and housing camps.\n\nIn 1995, a mid-decade census on population and housing was made. During that year, Cabanglasan had a population of 29,288 or an increase of 11.15%. However, due to the closure of the two logging companies in 1991, the population of the three barangays mentioned above decreased while the population of other barangays increased. Barangay Poblacion had an increase of 68.2116%. In 1990, its population was only 2,287 but it grew to 3,847 in 1995. This increase was due to the influx of former workers from the logging companies who settled in the neighboring barangays. As a result, the overall population count of the municipality increased at an average growth rate of 2.50%.\n\nAnother factor of this population increase is the ongoing progress and development of this municipality, such as road accessibility to the different barangays and sitios, farm modernization, electrification and the coming of small and medium investors to establish their business in the Poblacion. With this positive trend we it can be projected that the increase of population will continue and the coming of investors would provide job opportunities to our people.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Update|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Transportation===\n\nBeing typically landlocked, the means of transportation for intra-municipal travel is through jeepneys and motorcycles, buses and jeepneys can be availed of for travels going out of the municipality.\n\nMost of the vehicles (82%) are privately owned. About 16 percent are public utility vehicles while only 2% belonged to the government.\n\nThe whole stretch of the national highway (21.61&nbsp;km) is still gravel-paved. Of the 15.065&nbsp;km municipal road, 4% percent has already been converted to concrete pavement, 9% is gravel-paved, and the rest is still earth-paved. The aggregate length of barangay roads in the municipality has been recorded at 287.409&nbsp;km. Nearly 41 percent (117.603) of this is gravel-paved, a little over half (56%) of the total length is still unpaved while only less than one percent (1%) has been concreted. It can also be noted that earth-paved roads \u2013 especially roads going to the interior sitios are not passable during rainy season.\n\nBridges link gaps between rivers. For areas which are not regular routes of land transportation but are bounded by rivers, hanging footbridges were constructed.\n\n===Communication===\n\nPostal services of the municipality is being provided by the Bureau of Post which is manned by a Postmaster. Being undermanned the postmaster also served as the municipality\u2019s letter carrier.\n\nFor telecommunication, the provincial government had installed a single side band radio at the municipality. This is actually part of the Provincial Radio Communication Network. Through this system the municipality is able to reach out to other parts of the province directly or via relay stations. This is being complemented by handheld radios in some barangays which the municipality used for transmitting messages to these areas. Cabanglasan\u2019s populace is also kept abreast of recent information which is of regional and/or national significance through two Television channels which signal covered the municipality. These are the ABS-CBN (Channel 2) and GMA (Channel 12). AM and FM Band radio Stations from Malaybalay, Valencia, Cagayan and Davao also reached the municipality. Print media on the other hand only include a local newspaper (Bukidnon Newswatch) which has a weekly circulation.\n\n===Water systems===\n\nSprings, rivers and deep wells are the sources of water supply used for both domestic water supply and irrigation needs. Deep wells and springs are commonly used as potable water supply. Local government, congressional initiative, regional and senatorial funds are used to develop these sources. The municipal government\u2019s ardent thrust to provide basic services to its constituents can be well manifested by its current pursuit to develop a level III type of water system through funding from the World Bank. The municipal government had entered into a loan agreement with the bank to develop a system that will provide for an individual pipe connection for each household within the barangays of Poblacion and Iba. Data shows that Level I and Level II type of systems are the most prevalent type of water supply in the municipality. Level I water system is currently serving 7.17% of the total households. Likewise, Level II is providing water for 47.39% of all households, while Level III only served 3.62% of the total. The rest (41.82%) still remained un-served by a water supply system\n\n===Health services===\n\nThe health service in the Municipality of Cabanglasan is catered by the Municipal Health Office (MHO) and one private lying-in clinic. The former handles the public health services and some clinical services while the latter serves most of the clinical cases. The MHO is located at Poblacion and the nine Barangay Health Stations are located in the different barangays. These serve as channels in providing basic health services to the general populace. The office is manned by one Medical Doctor, one Dentist, one DOH-Nurse, four permanent Rural Health Midwives (RHMs), five Job Order RHMs, one Rural Sanitary Inspector (RSI) and one Dental Aid. The health personnel is augmented by 175 [[Barangay Health Worker]]s (BHW) 38 \u201chilots\u201d and other health oriented NGOs such as BIDANI, MAP, and the German Rolling Clinic.\n\nHealth statistics showed that the four leading causes of morbidity fall under communicable diseases which are preventable in nature but there was a gradual increase of such cases in the past few years. This increase could be attributed to the lack of permanent personnel assigned in far-flung and strategically located barangays. Another contributing factor is the inadequate supply of medicines and medical logistics which are necessary in the implementation of health services and programs. Records from the nutrition program of the municipality revealed the high prevalence rate of malnutrition has gradually decreased. This accomplishment was due to the full support of the Local Government Unit and Department of Health, and the increased awareness of the general populace on proper nutrition.\n\n===Security===\n\nThe total population is 29,288 as of 1995 having a ratio of one policeman per 1,220 inhabitants. The national standard ratio is one policeman per one thousand inhabitants. Therefore, Cabanglasan police force needs 15 Policemen to meet the standard ratio.\n\nSpecial Force (SF) of the Philippine Army (PA) established four strategic detachment, located at Barangay Poblacion, Freedom, Cananga-an and Jasaan. Each detachment is manned by two regular elements of the SF-PA assisted by their respective CAFGUs (Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Units). Cabanglasan police force is headed by one Police Commission Officer (PCO) as Chief of Police (COP), twenty three Police Non-Commission Officer (PCNO\u2019s) with five police community precinct. Each PCP headed by one policeman assisted by their respective Bantay Bayan/CVOs (Civilian Volunteers Organization). The area of responsibility or coverage has one PCP for every three Barangays.\n\n==Education==\n{{Update|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Elementary===\n\nThe data on existing schools and facilities are complete which are indicative of the overall picture of the District of Cabanglasan. There are 26 elementary schools within the municipality three schools are within the urban center, while the remaining 23 schools are distributed throughout the rural areas. Each barangay has at least one elementary school with Iba and Poblacion having the biggest area in terms of hectares. All schools have playgrounds, some have clinics but none of them has a laboratory, shop or library.\n\n===Secondary===\n\nThe Municipality of Cabanglasan has two secondary schools, one is a public school and one is a private secondary school, namely: Cabulohan-Paradise Nationalized Agricultural High School and Fr.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==History==\nThe town was once a Barangay of the capital town, [[Malaybalay]]. It was named after a Banglas tree, endemic tree species that inhabit and growing abundantly and distinctively only on this portion of the upper Pulangui. Banglas is hardwood that usually grows in the rocky portion of the Bobunawan riverbanks. Kabanglasan literally means a place that has plenty of Banglas.\n\nCabanglasan was created as a separate municipality from Malaybalay on August 13, 1979 by virtue of Republic Act 6489.\n\nThe movement for the separation of Cabanglasan from his mother municipality (Malaybalay) began in the early 1960s when the people of Pulangi region petitioned for the secession. This prompted the passage of House Bill No. 2789 in Congress by the then Congressman Cesar M. Fortich. The bill was enacted into law without executive approval under Republic Act 6489 but its implementation was delayed due to the declaration of martial law.\n\nDue to the persistence of the residents as spearheaded by Datu Maliwanag (Saturnino P. Linsagan), then President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] referred the matter to the mother municipality, Malaybalay. A plebiscite was then held wherein the majority voted for the implementation of RA 6489. On August 13, 1979, the first set of municipal officials headed by Mayor Saturnino P. Linsagan aka Datu Maliwanag to his tribesmen, took their oath and held their first session.\n\n==Geography==\nCabanglasan is geographically located between east longitude 125 degrees 27 minutes and north latitude 8 degrees and 3 minutes. It is located at the eastern part of the province of Bukidnon, bounded in the north and west by the City of Malaybalay and the south by the Municipality of San Fernando, and in the east by the province of Agusan del Sur.\n\nIt has a total area of {{Convert|24330|ha}}, of which 38% is Alienable and Disposable (A&D) land and 62% is timberland. It has 15 barangays, 5 of which are situated within timberland namely; Freedom, Mandahican, Mauswagon, Jasaan, and Cananga-an. Five barangays, namely; Anlugan, Cabanglasan proper, Iba, Mandaing and Dalacutan are located within A&D land while the remaining 5 barangays such as; Cabulohan, Capinonan, Imbatug, Paradise and Mauswagon are located within both timberland and A&D.\n\nIt occupies 2.52% of the total provincial area of Bukidnon and 0.74% of the regional area (Northern Mindanao).\n\n===Slope===\n\nThe major part of the municipality is classified under slope class 8 to 15 percent. Where such areas are found, it is contiguous to level areas, identified as water retaining areas potentially suited to intensive palay production. Along its North, East and South boundaries is slope class 30% and above, hilly and mountainous are declared as forestal, but not necessarily foliaged. Cabanglasan has an average elevation of 465 meters above sea level.\n\n===Climate===\n\nCabanglasan fall under the fourth type. It means that rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. May to December is usually the period with long rainfalls. While driest months last from January to April. Mountain climates reasonably form another type of climate. As far as some climatological elements are concerned, except as to temperature, rainfall generally increases with height.\n\n==Barangays==\nCabanglasan is politically subdivided into 15 [[barangay]]s.\n\n<!-- arranged by PSGC for easier updates in the future -->\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322001| Cabulohan     | 2179| 2121}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322002| Canangaan     | 2764| 2943}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322003| Iba           | 4000| 3406}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322004| Imbatug       | 2279| 2265}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322005| Lambangan     | 1112| 1073}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322006| Mandaing      | 1682| 1616}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322007| Paradise      | 2470| 2331}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322008| [[Poblacion]] | 5928| 5710}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322009| Anlogan       | 1715| 1622}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322010| Capinonan     | 2675| 2662}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322011| Dalacutan     |  614|  559}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322012| Freedom       | 1498| 1714}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322013| Mandahikan    | 2489| 1840}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322014| Mauswagon     | 1142| 1123}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|101322015| Jasaan        | 1450| 1442}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|bottom|32427}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Cabanglasan\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = \n| 1939 = \n| 1948 = \n| 1960 = \n| 1970 = \n| 1975 = \n| 1980 = 16843\n| 1990 = 26351\n| 1995 = 29288\n| 2000 = 32305\n| 2007 = 32817\n| 2010 = 32427\n| 2015 = 33997\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Cabanglasan was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nCabanglasan was created to become a municipality on August 13, 1979 by virtue of Republic Act 6489. On the following year, 1980, a regular census on population and housing was conducted nationwide, wherein Cabanglasan had an actual population count of 16,843.\n\nIn 1990, there was another census of population and housing. Because of the presence of the two logging companies, the T.H. Valderrama and Talakag Timber Incorporated, the population of this town grew to 26,351, an increase of about 9,508 or 56.45%. During those Censal years Barangays Cabulohan, Capinonan and Imbatug had a greater number of population because it was where the logging companies established their plant and housing camps.\n\nIn 1995, a mid-decade census on population and housing was made. During that year, Cabanglasan had a population of 29,288 or an increase of 11.15%. However, due to the closure of the two logging companies in 1991, the population of the three barangays mentioned above decreased while the population of other barangays increased. Barangay Poblacion had an increase of 68.2116%. In 1990, its population was only 2,287 but it grew to 3,847 in 1995. This increase was due to the influx of former workers from the logging companies who settled in the neighboring barangays. As a result, the overall population count of the municipality increased at an average growth rate of 2.50%.\n\nAnother factor of this population increase is the ongoing progress and development of this municipality, such as road accessibility to the different barangays and sitios, farm modernization, electrification and the coming of small and medium investors to establish their business in the Poblacion. With this positive trend we it can be projected that the increase of population will continue and the coming of investors would provide job opportunities to our people.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Update|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Transportation===\n\nBeing typically landlocked, the means of transportation for intra-municipal travel is through jeepneys and motorcycles, buses and jeepneys can be availed of for travels going out of the municipality.\n\nMost of the vehicles (82%) are privately owned. About 16 percent are public utility vehicles while only 2% belonged to the government.\n\nThe whole stretch of the national highway (21.61&nbsp;km) is still gravel-paved. Of the 15.065&nbsp;km municipal road, 4% percent has already been converted to concrete pavement, 9% is gravel-paved, and the rest is still earth-paved. The aggregate length of barangay roads in the municipality has been recorded at 287.409&nbsp;km. Nearly 41 percent (117.603) of this is gravel-paved, a little over half (56%) of the total length is still unpaved while only less than one percent (1%) has been concreted. It can also be noted that earth-paved roads \u2013 especially roads going to the interior sitios are not passable during rainy season.\n\nBridges link gaps between rivers. For areas which are not regular routes of land transportation but are bounded by rivers, hanging footbridges were constructed.\n\n===Communication===\n\nPostal services of the municipality is being provided by the Bureau of Post which is manned by a Postmaster. Being undermanned the postmaster also served as the municipality\u2019s letter carrier.\n\nFor telecommunication, the provincial government had installed a single side band radio at the municipality. This is actually part of the Provincial Radio Communication Network. Through this system the municipality is able to reach out to other parts of the province directly or via relay stations. This is being complemented by handheld radios in some barangays which the municipality used for transmitting messages to these areas. Cabanglasan\u2019s populace is also kept abreast of recent information which is of regional and/or national significance through two Television channels which signal covered the municipality. These are the ABS-CBN (Channel 2) and GMA (Channel 12). AM and FM Band radio Stations from Malaybalay, Valencia, Cagayan and Davao also reached the municipality. Print media on the other hand only include a local newspaper (Bukidnon Newswatch) which has a weekly circulation.\n\n===Water systems===\n\nSprings, rivers and deep wells are the sources of water supply used for both domestic water supply and irrigation needs. Deep wells and springs are commonly used as potable water supply. Local government, congressional initiative, regional and senatorial funds are used to develop these sources. The municipal government\u2019s ardent thrust to provide basic services to its constituents can be well manifested by its current pursuit to develop a level III type of water system through funding from the World Bank. The municipal government had entered into a loan agreement with the bank to develop a system that will provide for an individual pipe connection for each household within the barangays of Poblacion and Iba. Data shows that Level I and Level II type of systems are the most prevalent type of water supply in the municipality. Level I water system is currently serving 7.17% of the total households. Likewise, Level II is providing water for 47.39% of all households, while Level III only served 3.62% of the total. The rest (41.82%) still remained un-served by a water supply system\n\n===Health services===\n\nThe health service in the Municipality of Cabanglasan is catered by the Municipal Health Office (MHO) and one private lying-in clinic. The former handles the public health services and some clinical services while the latter serves most of the clinical cases. The MHO is located at Poblacion and the nine Barangay Health Stations are located in the different barangays. These serve as channels in providing basic health services to the general populace. The office is manned by one Medical Doctor, one Dentist, one DOH-Nurse, four permanent Rural Health Midwives (RHMs), five Job Order RHMs, one Rural Sanitary Inspector (RSI) and one Dental Aid. The health personnel is augmented by 175 [[Barangay Health Worker]]s (BHW) 38 \u201chilots\u201d and other health oriented NGOs such as BIDANI, MAP, and the German Rolling Clinic.\n\nHealth statistics showed that the four leading causes of morbidity fall under communicable diseases which are preventable in nature but there was a gradual increase of such cases in the past few years. This increase could be attributed to the lack of permanent personnel assigned in far-flung and strategically located barangays. Another contributing factor is the inadequate supply of medicines and medical logistics which are necessary in the implementation of health services and programs. Records from the nutrition program of the municipality revealed the high prevalence rate of malnutrition has gradually decreased. This accomplishment was due to the full support of the Local Government Unit and Department of Health, and the increased awareness of the general populace on proper nutrition.\n\n===Security===\n\nThe total population is 29,288 as of 1995 having a ratio of one policeman per 1,220 inhabitants. The national standard ratio is one policeman per one thousand inhabitants. Therefore, Cabanglasan police force needs 15 Policemen to meet the standard ratio.\n\nSpecial Force (SF) of the Philippine Army (PA) established four strategic detachment, located at Barangay Poblacion, Freedom, Cananga-an and Jasaan. Each detachment is manned by two regular elements of the SF-PA assisted by their respective CAFGUs (Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Units). Cabanglasan police force is headed by one Police Commission Officer (PCO) as Chief of Police (COP), twenty three Police Non-Commission Officer (PCNO\u2019s) with five police community precinct. Each PCP headed by one policeman assisted by their respective Bantay Bayan/CVOs (Civilian Volunteers Organization). The area of responsibility or coverage has one PCP for every three Barangays.\n\n==Education==\n{{Update|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Elementary===\n\nThe data on existing schools and facilities are complete which are indicative of the overall picture of the District of Cabanglasan. There are 26 elementary schools within the municipality three schools are within the urban center, while the remaining 23 schools are distributed throughout the rural areas. Each barangay has at least one elementary school with Iba and Poblacion having the biggest area in terms of hectares. All schools have playgrounds, some have clinics but none of them has a laboratory, shop or library.\n\n===Secondary===\n\nThe Municipality of Cabanglasan has two secondary schools, one is a public school and one is a private secondary school, namely: Cabulohan-Paradise Nationalized Agricultural High School and Fr.

Bush]] as [[President of the United States|president]] and the [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House election]], as well as many state and local elections. Senators who were elected in [[1998 United States Senate elections|1998]], known as [[Classes of United States Senators|Senate Class 3]], were seeking re-election or retiring in 2004. This was the third consecutive election for Senate Class 3 where the Democrats either broke even or lost seats.  This also marked the first time since 1980 in which a presidential candidate from either party won with coattails in the Senate. As of 2018, these are the last elections held during a Presidential election year in which the Republicans made a net gain of seats.\n\n==Gains and losses==\nRepublicans won six seats but lost two themselves, giving them a net gain of four seats. Five of the six gains came from Southern states. Conservative Democrat [[Zell Miller]] of [[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]], who campaigned for President [[George W. Bush|Bush]], chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[Johnny Isakson]] won his seat; Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] of [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]] chose not to run for re-election and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]]; Democratic vice presidential nominee [[John Edwards]] did not run for re-election and Republican [[Richard Burr]] won his [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|North Carolina]] seat; Democrat [[Bob Graham]] of [[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]] chose not to run for re-election, and his seat went to Republican [[Mel Martinez]]; [[List of United States Senators from Louisiana|Louisiana]] Democrat [[John Breaux]] chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[David Vitter]] won his seat, and in [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|South Dakota]], Republican [[John Thune]] defeated the incumbent Senate minority leader [[Tom Daschle]], the first time since [[1952 United States Senate elections|1952]] that a sitting party leader lost re-election. Republican Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] of [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Barack Obama]] won in a landslide, becoming the Senate's only black member and only the third popularly elected since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Also, Republican Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] of [[List of United States Senators from Colorado|Colorado]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Ken Salazar]] won the open seat.\n\n==Results summary==\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:44%;\" | '''44'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (US)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:1%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:55%;\" | '''55'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:44%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:55%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{United States Senate elections results, 2004}}\n\n== Change in composition ==\n\n=== Before the elections ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:800px\"\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|1}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|2}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|3}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|4}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|5}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|6}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|7}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|8}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|9}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|10}}\n\n|-\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|20}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|19}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|18}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|17}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|16}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|15}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|14}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|13}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|12}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|11}}\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|21}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|22}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|23}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|24}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|25}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|26}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|27}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|28}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|29}}\n!

The Democrats, therefore, needed to make a net gain of at least two seats from retiring or incumbent Republicans to gain control of the Senate (one seat if Kerry won the presidency). In the election, incumbent senators won reelection in all races but one ([[Senate Minority Leader|Democratic leader]] [[Tom Daschle]], in [[South Dakota]], lost to Republican [[John Thune]]). The seats of retiring senators were taken by the opposing party in [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[South Carolina]]. In fact, the only retiring senator whose seat was taken by a member of his party was Republican [[Don Nickles]] of [[Oklahoma]], who was succeeded by [[Tom Coburn]].\n\nRepublicans gained four seats in the 2004 elections, and entered the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] with a 55\u201344\u20131 lead. While such a majority is formidable, it is still less than the 60 seats needed to override a [[filibuster (legislative tactic)|filibuster]] and completely control the body's agenda and procedures.\n\n===Major parties===\n\nOne Republican seat, that of retiring Senator Peter Fitzgerald in Illinois, was easily taken by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], who would be elected [[President of the United States]] four years later. In Colorado, retiring Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]]'s seat was narrowly taken by Democrat [[Ken Salazar]]. In Alaska, Republican [[Lisa Murkowski]] won reelection in a tight race. In Oklahoma, [[Tom Coburn]] kept [[Don Nickles]]' seat in Republican hands, while in Kentucky, Republican [[Jim Bunning]] won a second term by a very narrow margin.\n\nThe Democrats' prospects were weakened by the fact that five of their six incumbent senators in Southern states were retiring (the sixth, [[Blanche Lincoln]] of [[Arkansas]], easily won reelection). Retiring Georgia Sen. [[Zell Miller]]'s seat, contested by [[Denise Majette]], was lost in a landslide, as was that of South Carolina Sen. [[Ernest Hollings]]. In North Carolina, Democrat [[Erskine Bowles]] lost [[John Edwards]]'s seat to Republican [[Richard Burr]]. Especially close races in Florida, Louisiana, and South Dakota all resulted in turnovers to the Republicans.\n\n===Third and minor parties===\nThe [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]], [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution]], and [[United States Green Party|Green]] parties contested many of the seats. No candidate from any of these parties received sufficient support to achieve election, but some may have affected the outcome of the Alaska and Florida races by drawing votes away from the major party candidates. Of the 34 senate seats up for grabs, the Libertarians ran candidates in 20 of the races, the Constitutionalists ran 10 candidates, and the Greens ran 7 candidates.\n\n[[List of political parties in the United States|Minor parties]] in a number of states contested one or more Senate seats. Examples include the America First Party, the [[Labor Party (United States, 1996)|Labor Party]], the [[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]. None of these parties gained a seat in this election nor received a significant number of votes.\n\n== Race summary ==\n=== Special elections during the 108th Congress ===\nThere were no special elections during the 108th Congress.\n\n=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===\nIn these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 2005; ordered by state.\n\nAll of the elections involved the Class 3 seats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State<br/>{{small|(linked to<br/>summaries below)}}\n! colspan=3 | Incumbent\n! rowspan=2 | Results\n! rowspan=2 | Candidates\n\n|-\n!

In the spring, the campaign hired fundraising staff from the defunct presidential campaigns of [[Howard Dean]] and [[Bob Graham]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, and subsequently posted much higher fundraising numbers over the summer{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Online grassroots techniques devised for the Dean campaign (Castor became a [[Dean Dozen]] candidate in August{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}) were one contributing factor{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: another was the support of [[EMILY's List]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, which named Castor as its highest-rated candidate for the 2004 election cycle{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, even when her support for banning intact dilation and extraction (D&X) abortions was not in line with the EMILY's List support for woman's issues{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. The latter was a source of criticism during the August primary heat - a complaint was filed by a Deutsch supporter with the Federal Election Commission accusing inappropriate coordination with EMILY's List{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. The complaint was dismissed by the Federal Election Commission in 2005{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nCastor's handling of [[Sami Al-Arian]] became another source of criticism during the campaign{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. In June, [[American Democracy Project (527 group in Florida)|The American Democracy Project]], a [[527 group]] founded by [[Bernie Friedman]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, began attacking Castor's handling of the incident, alleging that she had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian in the mid-1990s{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Castor responded by stating that she never had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian, who was a [[tenure|tenured professor]] at the time{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. On June 29, Senator Graham, who had previously remained outside of the Al-Arian controversy, released a statement that \"Betty Castor acted appropriately as President of the University of South Florida to deal with Sami Al-Arian\"{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: later, Graham and Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] brokered an agreement between the Democratic candidates to refrain from negative campaigning against each other{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, although this agreement appeared to break down in the final weeks of the race, when Deutsch launched attack ads on television{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nDespite these controversies, Castor won the Democratic nomination on August 31. She was defeated, however, by Republican candidate [[Mel Mart\u00ednez]] in a close race on November 2, 2004. The overwhelming support for Mart\u00ednez among Latinos effectively counterbalanced Castor's relatively high popularity among swing voters throughout the state.\n\nThere was some speculation that Castor would run for [[Governor of Florida]] in 2006 to replace [[Jeb Bush]], who was ineligible for re-election due to term limits, but she announced in 2005 that she would not be a candidate.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = 2004 United States Senate election in Florida<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#9|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = Melqu\u00edades Rafael Mart\u00ednez Ruiz\n | votes      = 3,672,864\n | percentage = 49.43\n | change     = +11.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Elizabeth Castor\n | votes      = 3,590,201\n | percentage = 48.32\n | change     = \u221214.15%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Veterans Party of America\n | candidate  = Dennis F.

Democratic U.S. Representative [[Denise Majette]] became both the first African American and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Republican U.S. Representative [[Johnny Isakson]] won the open seat.\n\nThe results were almost a complete reversal from the previous election in 2000.\n\nMajette's announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone's call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that \"God\" had told her to run for the Senate. She received important endorsements from U.S. Senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[Debbie Stabenow]] of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette.

Despite the state Republican Party's strong history of embracing a moderate philosophy, the influence of conservatism among rank-and-file members had been steadily growing for decades; because of his liberal social views, Specter was often considered to be a \"[[Republican in Name Only]]\" by the right.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=1998+ridge+itkin&source=bl&ots=AK6b-Ut25d&sig=ln8QefiZodyBTkRiIzEYxTt21Ro&hl=en&ei=cPjETOLTOoOglAenj8EH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=klink&f=false|title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004|first=John J.|last=Kennedy|date=20 December 2017|publisher=University Press of America|accessdate=20 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although Specter had a huge fundraising advantage, Toomey was aided by $2 million of advertising from the [[Club for Growth]], a conservative [[political action committee]] that focuses on fiscal issues and targets moderate Republican incumbents.  Toomey criticized Specter as a spendthrift on economic policy and as out of touch with his own party on social issues. Although Toomey had difficulty with name recognition early in the campaign, he built huge momentum over the final weeks preceding the primary, and Specter appeared to have transitioned from having a comfortable lead to being behind his challenger <ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nSpecter received a huge boost from the vocal support of President [[George W. Bush]]; most of the state's Republican establishment also closed ranks behind Specter. This included Pennsylvania's other U.S. Senator, [[Rick Santorum]], who was noted for his social conservative views.

The retirement of Democratic Senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] gave the Republicans an opportunity to pick up the seat and with no other interesting positions up for election in 2004, a crowded field developed in the Republican primary.  Furthermore, the Republicans were motivated by having President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] at the top of the ticket enabling them to ride his coattails to victory.\n\nFormer [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[David Beasley]], from the [[Pee Dee]], entered the race and quickly emerged as the frontrunner because of his support from the evangelical voters.  However, during his term as governor from 1994 to 1998 he had greatly angered the electorate by proposing to remove the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate Naval Jack]] from the dome of the statehouse and by being against the adoption of a [[South Carolina Education Lottery|state lottery]] to provide for college scholarships. Both positions led to the loss of his [[1998 South Carolina gubernatorial election|re-election in 1998]] and the issues continued to trouble him in the Senate race.\n\nThe battle for second place in the primary was between [[The Upstate|Upstate]] congressman, [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] developer [[Thomas Ravenel]].  DeMint was able to squeak out a second-place finish because [[Charlie Condon]], a former [[South Carolina Attorney General|Attorney General of South Carolina]], split the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] vote with Ravenel thus providing DeMint the margin he needed.  In addition, while many voters were attracted to the Ravenel campaign and felt that he had a future in politics, they believed that he should set his sights on a less high-profile office first before trying to become senator.  Resigned to defeat, Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the runoff election.\n\nIn the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on June 22, 2004, DeMint scored a surprising victory over Beasley.  Ravenel's endorsement of DeMint proved crucial as the Lowcountry counties heavily went for the Representative from the Upstate.  Also, Beasley had burnt too many bridges while governor and was unable to increase his share of the vote in the runoff.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Republican Primary Election\n\n|-\n!

He stressed to the voters that he would follow conservative principles and provide an important Republican vote in the closely divided Senate.  Democrats fared poorly in statewide elections in South Carolina, so Tenenbaum tried to make the race about issues rather than party identification.  She attacked DeMint's support of the [[FairTax]] proposal because it would increase the sales tax by 23%.  The election victory by DeMint merely cemented South Carolina's shift to the Republican column as the best candidate the Democrats could offer was soundly defeated by the typical 10 point margin.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 2004}}\n {{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jim DeMint]]\n | votes      = 857,167\n | percentage = 53.6\n | change     = +7.9%\n}}\n {{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Inez Tenenbaum]]\n | votes      = 704,384\n | percentage = 44.1\n | change     = \u22128.6%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (US)\n | candidate  = Patrick Tyndall\n | votes      = 13,464\n | percentage = 0.8\n | change     = +0.8%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = Rebekah E.

Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6\u201349.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party's leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other's defeat. Daschle's loss resulted in the first ousting of a majority or minority leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator [[Ernest McFarland]] lost his seat to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Daschle's Senate term expired on January 3, 2005.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the \"chief obstructionist\" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using [[filibuster]]s to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle's positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state's residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a very high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects.\n\nDaschle responded to Thune's claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the [[September 11 attacks]] when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush's address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to \"rubber stamp what the administration is doing.\" Daschle's use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the [[Republican National Committee]] to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Thune accused Daschle of \"emboldening the enemy\" in his skepticism of the [[Iraq War]].\n\nDaschle also noticeably relied very heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that [[Stephanie Herseth Sandlin|Stephanie Herseth]]'s election to the state's only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in many decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle's lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result.\n\nWhen the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49\u201349 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.\n\nThune was an aide to former Senator [[James Abdnor]], the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate.\n\nDaschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota)|Tim Johnson]] in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, [[South Dakota]] would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune's whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems very likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Dakota general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#41|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[John Thune]]\n | votes      = 197,848\n | percentage = 50.58\n | change     = +14.17%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Tom Daschle]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 193,340\n | percentage = 49.42\n | change     = \u221212.72%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 4,508\n | percentage = 1.15\n | change     = \u221224.58%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 391,188\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Utah ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Utah Election\n| country           = Utah\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 1998 United States Senate election in Utah\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = 2010 United States Senate election in Utah\n| next_year         = 2010\n| flag_year         = 1913\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Bob Bennett official portrait, 2009.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]'''\n| party1            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''626,640'''\n| percentage1       = '''68.7%'''\n\n| image2            = No image.svg\n| nominee2          = Paul Van Dam\n| party2            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 258,955\n| percentage2       = 28.4%\n\n| map_image         = Utah allred.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| before_party      = Republican Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| after_party       = Republican Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2004 United States Senate election in Utah}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Utah}}\nIncumbent Republican Bob Bennett won re-election to a third term easily beating Democrat Paul Van Dam, former [[Attorney General of Utah]] and former [[Salt Lake County]] District Attorney\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Utah general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#44|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 626,640\n | percentage = 68.73\n | change     = +4.75%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Paul Van Dam\n | votes      = 258,955\n | percentage = 28.40\n | change     = \u22124.57%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (US)\n | candidate  = Gary R.

Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]] since [[Miles Poindexter]] in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003\u2013present|war in Iraq]]. Nethercutt supported the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start, and his campaign never gained much traction.

Bush]] as [[President of the United States|president]] and the [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House election]], as well as many state and local elections. Senators who were elected in [[1998 United States Senate elections|1998]], known as [[Classes of United States Senators|Senate Class 3]], were seeking re-election or retiring in 2004. This was the third consecutive election for Senate Class 3 where the Democrats either broke even or lost seats.  This also marked the first time since 1980 in which a presidential candidate from either party won with coattails in the Senate. As of 2018, these are the last elections held during a Presidential election year in which the Republicans made a net gain of seats.\n\n==Gains and losses==\nRepublicans won six seats but lost two themselves, giving them a net gain of four seats. Five of the six gains came from Southern states. Conservative Democrat [[Zell Miller]] of [[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]], who campaigned for President [[George W. Bush|Bush]], chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[Johnny Isakson]] won his seat; Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] of [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]] chose not to run for re-election and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]]; Democratic vice presidential nominee [[John Edwards]] did not run for re-election and Republican [[Richard Burr]] won his [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|North Carolina]] seat; Democrat [[Bob Graham]] of [[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]] chose not to run for re-election, and his seat went to Republican [[Mel Martinez]]; [[List of United States Senators from Louisiana|Louisiana]] Democrat [[John Breaux]] chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[David Vitter]] won his seat, and in [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|South Dakota]], Republican [[John Thune]] defeated the incumbent Senate minority leader [[Tom Daschle]], the first time since [[1952 United States Senate elections|1952]] that a sitting party leader lost re-election. Republican Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] of [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Barack Obama]] won in a landslide, becoming the Senate's only black member and only the third popularly elected since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Also, Republican Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] of [[List of United States Senators from Colorado|Colorado]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Ken Salazar]] won the open seat.\n\n==Results summary==\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:44%;\" | '''44'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (US)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:1%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:55%;\" | '''55'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:44%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:55%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{United States Senate elections results, 2004}}\n\n== Change in composition ==\n\n=== Before the elections ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:800px\"\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|1}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|2}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|3}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|4}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|5}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|6}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|7}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|8}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|9}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|10}}\n\n|-\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|20}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|19}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|18}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|17}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|16}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|15}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|14}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|13}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|12}}\n| width=50px {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|11}}\n\n|-\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|21}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|22}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|23}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|24}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|25}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|26}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|27}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|28}}\n| {{party shading/Democratic}} | D{{Sub|29}}\n!

(The independent, [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]], was allied with the Democratic caucus and had voted with Democrats to give them the majority in the past.) The Democrats, therefore, needed to make a net gain of at least two seats from retiring or incumbent Republicans to gain control of the Senate (one seat if Kerry won the presidency). In the election, incumbent senators won reelection in all races but one ([[Senate Minority Leader|Democratic leader]] [[Tom Daschle]], in [[South Dakota]], lost to Republican [[John Thune]]). The seats of retiring senators were taken by the opposing party in [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[South Carolina]]. In fact, the only retiring senator whose seat was taken by a member of his party was Republican [[Don Nickles]] of [[Oklahoma]], who was succeeded by [[Tom Coburn]].\n\nRepublicans gained four seats in the 2004 elections, and entered the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] with a 55\u201344\u20131 lead. While such a majority is formidable, it is still less than the 60 seats needed to override a [[filibuster (legislative tactic)|filibuster]] and completely control the body's agenda and procedures.\n\n===Major parties===\n\nOne Republican seat, that of retiring Senator Peter Fitzgerald in Illinois, was easily taken by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], who would be elected [[President of the United States]] four years later. In Colorado, retiring Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]]'s seat was narrowly taken by Democrat [[Ken Salazar]]. In Alaska, Republican [[Lisa Murkowski]] won reelection in a tight race. In Oklahoma, [[Tom Coburn]] kept [[Don Nickles]]' seat in Republican hands, while in Kentucky, Republican [[Jim Bunning]] won a second term by a very narrow margin.\n\nThe Democrats' prospects were weakened by the fact that five of their six incumbent senators in Southern states were retiring (the sixth, [[Blanche Lincoln]] of [[Arkansas]], easily won reelection). Retiring Georgia Sen. [[Zell Miller]]'s seat, contested by [[Denise Majette]], was lost in a landslide, as was that of South Carolina Sen. [[Ernest Hollings]]. In North Carolina, Democrat [[Erskine Bowles]] lost [[John Edwards]]'s seat to Republican [[Richard Burr]]. Especially close races in Florida, Louisiana, and South Dakota all resulted in turnovers to the Republicans.\n\n===Third and minor parties===\nThe [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]], [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution]], and [[United States Green Party|Green]] parties contested many of the seats. No candidate from any of these parties received sufficient support to achieve election, but some may have affected the outcome of the Alaska and Florida races by drawing votes away from the major party candidates. Of the 34 senate seats up for grabs, the Libertarians ran candidates in 20 of the races, the Constitutionalists ran 10 candidates, and the Greens ran 7 candidates.\n\n[[List of political parties in the United States|Minor parties]] in a number of states contested one or more Senate seats. Examples include the America First Party, the [[Labor Party (United States, 1996)|Labor Party]], the [[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]. None of these parties gained a seat in this election nor received a significant number of votes.\n\n== Race summary ==\n=== Special elections during the 108th Congress ===\nThere were no special elections during the 108th Congress.\n\n=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===\nIn these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 2005; ordered by state.\n\nAll of the elections involved the Class 3 seats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State<br/>{{small|(linked to<br/>summaries below)}}\n! colspan=3 | Incumbent\n! rowspan=2 | Results\n! rowspan=2 | Candidates\n\n|-\n!

In the spring, the campaign hired fundraising staff from the defunct presidential campaigns of [[Howard Dean]] and [[Bob Graham]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, and subsequently posted much higher fundraising numbers over the summer{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Online grassroots techniques devised for the Dean campaign (Castor became a [[Dean Dozen]] candidate in August{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}) were one contributing factor{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: another was the support of [[EMILY's List]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, which named Castor as its highest-rated candidate for the 2004 election cycle{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, even when her support for banning intact dilation and extraction (D&X) abortions was not in line with the EMILY's List support for woman's issues{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

The complaint was dismissed by the Federal Election Commission in 2005{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nCastor's handling of [[Sami Al-Arian]] became another source of criticism during the campaign{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. In June, [[American Democracy Project (527 group in Florida)|The American Democracy Project]], a [[527 group]] founded by [[Bernie Friedman]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, began attacking Castor's handling of the incident, alleging that she had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian in the mid-1990s{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Castor responded by stating that she never had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian, who was a [[tenure|tenured professor]] at the time{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. On June 29, Senator Graham, who had previously remained outside of the Al-Arian controversy, released a statement that \"Betty Castor acted appropriately as President of the University of South Florida to deal with Sami Al-Arian\"{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: later, Graham and Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] brokered an agreement between the Democratic candidates to refrain from negative campaigning against each other{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, although this agreement appeared to break down in the final weeks of the race, when Deutsch launched attack ads on television{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.\n\nDespite these controversies, Castor won the Democratic nomination on August 31. She was defeated, however, by Republican candidate [[Mel Mart\u00ednez]] in a close race on November 2, 2004. The overwhelming support for Mart\u00ednez among Latinos effectively counterbalanced Castor's relatively high popularity among swing voters throughout the state.\n\nThere was some speculation that Castor would run for [[Governor of Florida]] in 2006 to replace [[Jeb Bush]], who was ineligible for re-election due to term limits, but she announced in 2005 that she would not be a candidate.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = 2004 United States Senate election in Florida<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#9|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = Melqu\u00edades Rafael Mart\u00ednez Ruiz\n | votes      = 3,672,864\n | percentage = 49.43\n | change     = +11.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Elizabeth Castor\n | votes      = 3,590,201\n | percentage = 48.32\n | change     = \u221214.15%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Veterans Party of America\n | candidate  = Dennis F.

Democratic U.S. Representative [[Denise Majette]] became both the first African American and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Republican U.S. Representative [[Johnny Isakson]] won the open seat.\n\nThe results were almost a complete reversal from the previous election in 2000.\n\nMajette's announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone's call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that \"God\" had told her to run for the Senate. She received important endorsements from U.S. Senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[Debbie Stabenow]] of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette.

Despite the state Republican Party's strong history of embracing a moderate philosophy, the influence of conservatism among rank-and-file members had been steadily growing for decades; because of his liberal social views, Specter was often considered to be a \"[[Republican in Name Only]]\" by the right.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=1998+ridge+itkin&source=bl&ots=AK6b-Ut25d&sig=ln8QefiZodyBTkRiIzEYxTt21Ro&hl=en&ei=cPjETOLTOoOglAenj8EH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=klink&f=false|title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004|first=John J.|last=Kennedy|date=20 December 2017|publisher=University Press of America|accessdate=20 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although Specter had a huge fundraising advantage, Toomey was aided by $2 million of advertising from the [[Club for Growth]], a conservative [[political action committee]] that focuses on fiscal issues and targets moderate Republican incumbents.  Toomey criticized Specter as a spendthrift on economic policy and as out of touch with his own party on social issues. Although Toomey had difficulty with name recognition early in the campaign, he built huge momentum over the final weeks preceding the primary, and Specter appeared to have transitioned from having a comfortable lead to being behind his challenger <ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nSpecter received a huge boost from the vocal support of President [[George W. Bush]]; most of the state's Republican establishment also closed ranks behind Specter. This included Pennsylvania's other U.S. Senator, [[Rick Santorum]], who was noted for his social conservative views.

The retirement of Democratic Senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] gave the Republicans an opportunity to pick up the seat and with no other interesting positions up for election in 2004, a crowded field developed in the Republican primary.  Furthermore, the Republicans were motivated by having President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] at the top of the ticket enabling them to ride his coattails to victory.\n\nFormer [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[David Beasley]], from the [[Pee Dee]], entered the race and quickly emerged as the frontrunner because of his support from the evangelical voters.  However, during his term as governor from 1994 to 1998 he had greatly angered the electorate by proposing to remove the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate Naval Jack]] from the dome of the statehouse and by being against the adoption of a [[South Carolina Education Lottery|state lottery]] to provide for college scholarships. Both positions led to the loss of his [[1998 South Carolina gubernatorial election|re-election in 1998]] and the issues continued to trouble him in the Senate race.\n\nThe battle for second place in the primary was between [[The Upstate|Upstate]] congressman, [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] developer [[Thomas Ravenel]].  DeMint was able to squeak out a second-place finish because [[Charlie Condon]], a former [[South Carolina Attorney General|Attorney General of South Carolina]], split the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] vote with Ravenel thus providing DeMint the margin he needed.  In addition, while many voters were attracted to the Ravenel campaign and felt that he had a future in politics, they believed that he should set his sights on a less high-profile office first before trying to become senator.  Resigned to defeat, Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the runoff election.\n\nIn the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on June 22, 2004, DeMint scored a surprising victory over Beasley.  Ravenel's endorsement of DeMint proved crucial as the Lowcountry counties heavily went for the Representative from the Upstate.  Also, Beasley had burnt too many bridges while governor and was unable to increase his share of the vote in the runoff.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Republican Primary Election\n\n|-\n!

He stressed to the voters that he would follow conservative principles and provide an important Republican vote in the closely divided Senate.  Democrats fared poorly in statewide elections in South Carolina, so Tenenbaum tried to make the race about issues rather than party identification.  She attacked DeMint's support of the [[FairTax]] proposal because it would increase the sales tax by 23%.  The election victory by DeMint merely cemented South Carolina's shift to the Republican column as the best candidate the Democrats could offer was soundly defeated by the typical 10 point margin.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 2004}}\n {{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jim DeMint]]\n | votes      = 857,167\n | percentage = 53.6\n | change     = +7.9%\n}}\n {{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Inez Tenenbaum]]\n | votes      = 704,384\n | percentage = 44.1\n | change     = \u22128.6%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (US)\n | candidate  = Patrick Tyndall\n | votes      = 13,464\n | percentage = 0.8\n | change     = +0.8%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = Rebekah E.

Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6\u201349.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party's leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other's defeat. Daschle's loss resulted in the first ousting of a majority or minority leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator [[Ernest McFarland]] lost his seat to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Daschle's Senate term expired on January 3, 2005.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the \"chief obstructionist\" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using [[filibuster]]s to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle's positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state's residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a very high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects.\n\nDaschle responded to Thune's claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the [[September 11 attacks]] when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush's address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to \"rubber stamp what the administration is doing.\" Daschle's use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the [[Republican National Committee]] to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Thune accused Daschle of \"emboldening the enemy\" in his skepticism of the [[Iraq War]].\n\nDaschle also noticeably relied very heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that [[Stephanie Herseth Sandlin|Stephanie Herseth]]'s election to the state's only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in many decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle's lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result.\n\nWhen the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49\u201349 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.\n\nThune was an aide to former Senator [[James Abdnor]], the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate.\n\nDaschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota)|Tim Johnson]] in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, [[South Dakota]] would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune's whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems very likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = South Dakota general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#41|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[John Thune]]\n | votes      = 197,848\n | percentage = 50.58\n | change     = +14.17%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Tom Daschle]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 193,340\n | percentage = 49.42\n | change     = \u221212.72%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 4,508\n | percentage = 1.15\n | change     = \u221224.58%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 391,188\n | percentage = \n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Utah ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Utah Election\n| country           = Utah\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 1998 United States Senate election in Utah\n| previous_year     = 1998\n| next_election     = 2010 United States Senate election in Utah\n| next_year         = 2010\n| flag_year         = 1913\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n\n| image1            = Bob Bennett official portrait, 2009.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]'''\n| party1            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''626,640'''\n| percentage1       = '''68.7%'''\n\n| image2            = No image.svg\n| nominee2          = Paul Van Dam\n| party2            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 258,955\n| percentage2       = 28.4%\n\n| map_image         = Utah allred.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| before_party      = Republican Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]]\n| after_party       = Republican Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2004 United States Senate election in Utah}}\n{{See also|List of United States Senators from Utah}}\nIncumbent Republican Bob Bennett won re-election to a third term easily beating Democrat Paul Van Dam, former [[Attorney General of Utah]] and former [[Salt Lake County]] District Attorney\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Utah general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#44|title=2004 ELECTION STATISTICS|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 626,640\n | percentage = 68.73\n | change     = +4.75%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Paul Van Dam\n | votes      = 258,955\n | percentage = 28.40\n | change     = \u22124.57%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Constitution Party (US)\n | candidate  = Gary R.

Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]] since [[Miles Poindexter]] in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003\u2013present|war in Iraq]]. Nethercutt supported the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start, and his campaign never gained much traction.

By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velikiy kniaz'\"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Vladimir I (grand prince of Kiev) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kiev|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'. Princely succession moved from elder to younger brother and from uncle to nephew, as well as from father to son. Junior members of the dynasty usually began their official careers as rulers of a minor district, progressed to more lucrative principalities, and then competed for the coveted throne of Kiev.\n\n===Fragmentation and decline===\nThe gradual disintegration of the Kievan Rus' began in the 11th century, after the death of [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kievan wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trade routes to Asia and the Near East.

In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code; they were theoretically equal to the prince; so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]].

Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271).

By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velikiy kniaz'\"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Vladimir I (grand prince of Kiev) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kiev|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'. Princely succession moved from elder to younger brother and from uncle to nephew, as well as from father to son. Junior members of the dynasty usually began their official careers as rulers of a minor district, progressed to more lucrative principalities, and then competed for the coveted throne of Kiev.\n\n===Fragmentation and decline===\nThe gradual disintegration of the Kievan Rus' began in the 11th century, after the death of [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kievan wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trade routes to Asia and the Near East.

In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code; they were theoretically equal to the prince; so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]].

Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271).

The geography of Ferrol meant that an entire Spanish fleet could slip out on a single tide. By the time the British were able to resume the blockade, the Spanish would be safely away and out to sea. Despite these advantages, a decline set during the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], and in 1800, during the [[Ferrol Expedition (1800)]], after the defences had been reduced, a British fleet of 109 vessels landed troops on the beach of Doni\u00f1os to take the Castle of San Felipe.

The geography of Ferrol meant that an entire Spanish fleet could slip out on a single tide. By the time the British were able to resume the blockade, the Spanish would be safely away and out to sea. Despite these advantages, a decline set during the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], and in 1800, during the [[Ferrol Expedition (1800)]], after the defences had been reduced, a British fleet of 109 vessels landed troops on the beach of Doni\u00f1os to take the Castle of San Felipe. Although only equipped with meagre artillery, the castle's small defence force under the command of [[Andrade|Count Donadio]] together with a sizable number of volunteer citizens of Ferrol, successfully resisted the attack and the fleet withdrew. The alliance with the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Peninsular War]] of 1808\u201314 failed to prevent the deterioration in the town\u2019s fortunes.

The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor [[Richard O'Brien]], who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 [[Musical theatre|musical stage production]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a [[parody]] tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and horror [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars [[Tim Curry]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Barry Bostwick]] and is narrated by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] with cast members from the original [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]], and [[Belasco Theatre]] productions including [[Nell Campbell]] and [[Patricia Quinn]].\n\nThe story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is [[Dr. Frank N. Furter]], an apparently [[mad scientist]] who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control.\n\nThe film was shot in the United Kingdom at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] and on location at an old country estate named [[Oakley Court]], best known for its earlier use by [[Hammer Film Productions]]. A number of [[Theatrical property|props]] and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many [[kitsch]] science fiction and horror films, costume designer [[Sue Blane]] conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly affected the development of [[punk fashion|punk rock fashion]] trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.<ref name=\"punkblane\">{{cite book|last= Thompson | first=Dave |author-link=Dave Thompson (author)|url = https://books.google.com/?id=qx6GDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1785&lpg=PA1785&dq=Sue+blane,+punk+rock#v=onepage&q=Sue%20blane%2C%20punk%20rock&f=false  |title= The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic|publisher = Applause Theatre & Cinema Books|date=1 February 2016 | page = 1785|isbn= 978-1495007477}}</ref>\n\nAlthough largely critically panned on initial release, it soon became known as a [[midnight movie]] when audiences began participating with the film at the [[Waverly Theater]] in [[New York City]] in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This \"shadow cast\" mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-syncing their character's lines. Still in [[limited release]] four decades after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. It is often shown close to [[Halloween]]. Today, the film has [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|a large international cult following]] and has been considered by many as [[List of films considered the best#Genres or media#Musical|one of the greatest musical films of all time]]. It was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Criminology|criminologist]] narrates the tale of the newly engaged and innocent couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, who find themselves lost and with a flat tire on a cold and rainy late November evening, near a town called Denton in 1974. Seeking a telephone, the couple walks to a nearby castle where they discover a group of strange and outlandish people who are holding an Annual Transylvanian Convention. They are soon swept into the world of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a self-proclaimed \"sweet [[transvestism|transvestite]] from Transsexual, Transylvania\". The ensemble of convention attendees also includes servants Riff Raff, his sister Magenta, and a groupie named Columbia.\n\nIn his lab, Frank claims to have discovered the \"secret to life itself\". His creation, Rocky, is brought to life. The ensuing celebration is soon interrupted by Eddie (an ex-delivery boy, both Frank's ex-lover and Columbia's current partner, as well as partial brain donor to Rocky) who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle. Eddie then proceeds to seduce Columbia, get the Transylvanians dancing and singing and intrigue Brad and Janet. When Rocky starts dancing and enjoying the performance, a jealous Frank kills Eddie with a pickax. Columbia screams in horror, devastated by Eddie's death. Frank justifies killing Eddie as a \"[[Euthanasia|mercy killing]]\" to Rocky and they depart to the bridal suite.\n\nBrad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms, where each is visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad (when visiting Janet) and then as Janet (when visiting Brad). Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, when she discovers Frank in bed with Brad (who is smoking a cigarette) on a video monitor. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.\n\nAfter discovering that his creation is missing, Frank returns to the lab with Brad and Riff Raff, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him; Brad denies any knowledge of it, and Dr. Scott assures Frank that Brad is totally not involved in UFOs. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Magenta interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.\n\nRocky and the guests share an uncomfortable dinner, which they soon realize has been prepared from Eddie's mutilated remains. Janet runs screaming into Rocky's arms, provoking Frank to chase her through the halls. Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky, and Columbia all meet in Frank's lab, where Frank captures them with the [[Medusa]] Transducer, transforming them into nude statues. After dressing them in cabaret costume, Frank \"unfreezes\" them, and they perform a live cabaret floor show, complete with an [[RKO]] tower and a swimming pool, with Frank as the leader.\n\nRiff Raff and Magenta interrupt the performance, revealing themselves and Frank to be aliens from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. They stage a coup and announce a plan to return to their home planet. In the process, they kill Columbia and Frank, who has \"failed his mission\". An enraged Rocky gathers Frank in his arms, climbs to the top of the tower, and plunges to his death in the pool below. Riff Raff and Magenta release Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott, then depart by lifting off in the castle itself. The survivors are then left crawling in the dirt, and the narrator concludes that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planet's surface, \"lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, an eccentric bisexual transvestite scientist \n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Janet Weiss, a heroine\n* [[Barry Bostwick]] as Brad Majors, a hero\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Riff Raff, a handyman\n* [[Patricia Quinn]] as Magenta, a domestic\n* [[Nell Campbell]] (credited as Little Nell) as Columbia, a groupie\n* [[Jonathan Adams (British actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Dr. Everett V.

According to [[J. Hoberman]], author of ''Midnight Movies'', it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience. Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, \"Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch.\" Originally, Louis and other ''Rocky Horror'' pioneers\u2014including Amy Lazarus, Theresa Krakauskas, and Bill O'Brian\u2014did this to entertain each other, each week trying to come up with something new to make each other laugh. This quickly caught on with other theater goers and thus began this self-proclaimed \"counter point dialogue\", which became standard practice and was repeated nearly verbatim at each screening.<ref name=\"Dika2003\"/> Performance groups became a staple at ''Rocky Horror'' screenings due in part to the prominent New York City fan cast.<ref name=\"HenkinHenkin1979\"/> The New York City cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic [[Sal Piro]] and his friend Dori Hartley, the latter of whom portrayed Dr. Frank N.

The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor [[Richard O'Brien]], who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 [[Musical theatre|musical stage production]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a [[parody]] tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and horror [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars [[Tim Curry]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Barry Bostwick]] and is narrated by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] with cast members from the original [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]], and [[Belasco Theatre]] productions including [[Nell Campbell]] and [[Patricia Quinn]].\n\nThe story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is [[Dr. Frank N. Furter]], an apparently [[mad scientist]] who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control.\n\nThe film was shot in the United Kingdom at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] and on location at an old country estate named [[Oakley Court]], best known for its earlier use by [[Hammer Film Productions]]. A number of [[Theatrical property|props]] and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many [[kitsch]] science fiction and horror films, costume designer [[Sue Blane]] conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly affected the development of [[punk fashion|punk rock fashion]] trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.<ref name=\"punkblane\">{{cite book|last= Thompson | first=Dave |author-link=Dave Thompson (author)|url = https://books.google.com/?id=qx6GDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1785&lpg=PA1785&dq=Sue+blane,+punk+rock#v=onepage&q=Sue%20blane%2C%20punk%20rock&f=false  |title= The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic|publisher = Applause Theatre & Cinema Books|date=1 February 2016 | page = 1785|isbn= 978-1495007477}}</ref>\n\nAlthough largely critically panned on initial release, it soon became known as a [[midnight movie]] when audiences began participating with the film at the [[Waverly Theater]] in [[New York City]] in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This \"shadow cast\" mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-syncing their character's lines. Still in [[limited release]] four decades after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. It is often shown close to [[Halloween]]. Today, the film has [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|a large international cult following]] and has been considered by many as [[List of films considered the best#Genres or media#Musical|one of the greatest musical films of all time]]. It was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Criminology|criminologist]] narrates the tale of the newly engaged and innocent couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, who find themselves lost and with a flat tire on a cold and rainy late November evening, near a town called Denton in 1974. Seeking a telephone, the couple walks to a nearby castle where they discover a group of strange and outlandish people who are holding an Annual Transylvanian Convention. They are soon swept into the world of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a self-proclaimed \"sweet [[transvestism|transvestite]] from Transsexual, Transylvania\". The ensemble of convention attendees also includes servants Riff Raff, his sister Magenta, and a groupie named Columbia.\n\nIn his lab, Frank claims to have discovered the \"secret to life itself\". His creation, Rocky, is brought to life. The ensuing celebration is soon interrupted by Eddie (an ex-delivery boy, both Frank's ex-lover and Columbia's current partner, as well as partial brain donor to Rocky) who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle. Eddie then proceeds to seduce Columbia, get the Transylvanians dancing and singing and intrigue Brad and Janet. When Rocky starts dancing and enjoying the performance, a jealous Frank kills Eddie with a pickax. Columbia screams in horror, devastated by Eddie's death. Frank justifies killing Eddie as a \"[[Euthanasia|mercy killing]]\" to Rocky and they depart to the bridal suite.\n\nBrad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms, where each is visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad (when visiting Janet) and then as Janet (when visiting Brad). Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, when she discovers Frank in bed with Brad (who is smoking a cigarette) on a video monitor. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.\n\nAfter discovering that his creation is missing, Frank returns to the lab with Brad and Riff Raff, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him; Brad denies any knowledge of it, and Dr. Scott assures Frank that Brad is totally not involved in UFOs. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Magenta interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.\n\nRocky and the guests share an uncomfortable dinner, which they soon realize has been prepared from Eddie's mutilated remains. Janet runs screaming into Rocky's arms, provoking Frank to chase her through the halls. Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky, and Columbia all meet in Frank's lab, where Frank captures them with the [[Medusa]] Transducer, transforming them into nude statues. After dressing them in cabaret costume, Frank \"unfreezes\" them, and they perform a live cabaret floor show, complete with an [[RKO]] tower and a swimming pool, with Frank as the leader.\n\nRiff Raff and Magenta interrupt the performance, revealing themselves and Frank to be aliens from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. They stage a coup and announce a plan to return to their home planet. In the process, they kill Columbia and Frank, who has \"failed his mission\". An enraged Rocky gathers Frank in his arms, climbs to the top of the tower, and plunges to his death in the pool below. Riff Raff and Magenta release Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott, then depart by lifting off in the castle itself. The survivors are then left crawling in the dirt, and the narrator concludes that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planet's surface, \"lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, an eccentric bisexual transvestite scientist \n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Janet Weiss, a heroine\n* [[Barry Bostwick]] as Brad Majors, a hero\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Riff Raff, a handyman\n* [[Patricia Quinn]] as Magenta, a domestic\n* [[Nell Campbell]] (credited as Little Nell) as Columbia, a groupie\n* [[Jonathan Adams (British actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Dr. Everett V.

According to [[J. Hoberman]], author of ''Midnight Movies'', it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience. Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, \"Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch.\" Originally, Louis and other ''Rocky Horror'' pioneers\u2014including Amy Lazarus, Theresa Krakauskas, and Bill O'Brian\u2014did this to entertain each other, each week trying to come up with something new to make each other laugh. This quickly caught on with other theater goers and thus began this self-proclaimed \"counter point dialogue\", which became standard practice and was repeated nearly verbatim at each screening.<ref name=\"Dika2003\"/> Performance groups became a staple at ''Rocky Horror'' screenings due in part to the prominent New York City fan cast.<ref name=\"HenkinHenkin1979\"/> The New York City cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic [[Sal Piro]] and his friend Dori Hartley, the latter of whom portrayed Dr. Frank N. Furter and was one of several performers\u2014including Will Kohler as Brad Majors, Nora Poses as Janet, and Lilias Piro as Magenta\u2014in a flexible rotating cast.<ref name=\"HenkinHenkin1979\"/> The performances of the audience were scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters.<ref name=\"MathijsSexton2012\">{{cite book|author1=Ernest Mathijs|author2=Jamie Sexton|title=Cult Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EmSqIo4I-QC&pg=PA101 |date=30 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9642-3|pages=101\u2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Garrett3.jpg|thumb|upright|D.

The eventual production would entail the entire film being shot within a sound stage.
