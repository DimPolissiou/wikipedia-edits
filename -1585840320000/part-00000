As [[erotica]] was a form of social protest against the values of the culture at the time, as was with the famous book ''[[The Romance of Lust]]'', written as a few volumes between 1873\u20131876.

As seen in [[advertisements]] throughout, sex is portrayed without anyone needing to say a word.  However, in a lot of ways, this can be devastating to people's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyches]], especially women. Magazines feature women barely clothed in provocative positions, which can communicate that women are not good enough.
