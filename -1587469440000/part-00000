The resolution of adoption targets the prevention of the modern slavery epidemic in the form of human trafficking, which includes forcing children to engage in labor and combat.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn recognition of the history of African Americans (and remembering the Montford Point Marines who faced second-class citizenship), Jacksonville honored their heritage and the enfranchisement their ancestors received from the 13th Amendment.   The holiday (Freedom Day) will be celebrated on the second Monday in December, which will always fall between the dates of the states' ratification (6 December 1865) and Secretary of State's proclamation of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (18 December 1865).\nAnd Jackso Neville North Carolina hurricanes and earthquakes\ud83e\udd13\ud83c\udf68\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2016}}\nThe early history of Jacksonville starts with the end of the [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] wars in 1713. The forced removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes was followed by permanent settlement of the regions between [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. The headwaters of the [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]] became a center of production for naval stores, particularly turpentine.  The downtown waterfront park is built on the site of Wantland's Ferry, with bridges being constructed on either side of the original ferry site.\n\nIn 1752, a devastating hurricane destroyed the county seat of Johnston, and Wantlands Ferry, located further up the New River at the present site of Jacksonville was chosen as the site of the new county courthouse. The area was later known as Onslow Courthouse. In 1842, the town was incorporated and renamed Jacksonville in honor of former U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]].  The town was briefly captured and occupied in November 1862 by a raiding party led by [[U.S. Navy]] Lt. [[William B. Cushing]].\n\nJacksonville and Onslow County continued to rely on naval stores, lumber, and tobacco crops for industry. In 1939, Colonel George W. Gillette of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] surveyed and mapped the area from [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]] to [[Fort Sumter]], [[South Carolina]] which included the Onslow County coastline and the New River. The map is believed to have fostered the interest of the War and Navy Departments in establishing an amphibious training base in the area. Congressman [[Graham Arthur Barden]] of New Bern lobbied [[United States Congress|Congress]] to appropriate funds for the purchase of about {{convert|100,000|acre|km2}} along the eastern bank of the New River. The establishment in 1941 of Marine Barracks, New River, later renamed [[Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base]], led to the relocation of 700 families. While the landowners were compensated, many of the families displaced were sharecroppers who did not own the land on which their houses were built, and did not receive compensation for their structures. Some African American families were able to purchase property from Raymond Kellum and established the community of Kellumtown. Other displaced families established communities in Georgetown, Pickettown, Bell Fork, and Sandy Run. The latter communities have since been absorbed by Jacksonville. Colonel Gillette had planned to retire near the small village of Marine, ironically named after a local family whose surname was Marine, but lost his land to the acquisition, as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nConstruction of Camp Lejeune caused a population explosion in the small town of about 800 inhabitants, as new workers migrated to the area. Growth continued to be fueled by both young Marine families and military retirees. Today, Jacksonville's primary industry is retail sales and services.<ref>http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/north-carolina/jacksonville/work</ref> The primary migration draw continues to be the [[U.S. Marine Corps]].\n\nThe [[Bank of Onslow and Jacksonville Masonic Temple]], [[Mill Avenue Historic District]], and [[Pelletier House|Pelletier House and Wantland Spring]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nJacksonville is located at {{coord|34|45|35|N|77|24|35|W|type:city}} (34.759630, -77.409765).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|45.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|44.5|sqmi|km2}} of it are land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} of it (1.51%) is covered by water.

The resolution of adoption targets the prevention of the modern slavery epidemic in the form of human trafficking, which includes forcing children to engage in labor and combat.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn recognition of the history of African Americans (and remembering the Montford Point Marines who faced second-class citizenship), Jacksonville honored their heritage and the enfranchisement their ancestors received from the 13th Amendment.   The holiday (Freedom Day) will be celebrated on the second Monday in December, which will always fall between the dates of the states' ratification (6 December 1865) and Secretary of State's proclamation of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (18 December 1865).\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2016}}\nThe early history of Jacksonville starts with the end of the [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] wars in 1713. The forced removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes was followed by permanent settlement of the regions between [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. The headwaters of the [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]] became a center of production for naval stores, particularly turpentine.  The downtown waterfront park is built on the site of Wantland's Ferry, with bridges being constructed on either side of the original ferry site.\n\nIn 1752, a devastating hurricane destroyed the county seat of Johnston, and Wantlands Ferry, located further up the New River at the present site of Jacksonville was chosen as the site of the new county courthouse. The area was later known as Onslow Courthouse. In 1842, the town was incorporated and renamed Jacksonville in honor of former U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]].  The town was briefly captured and occupied in November 1862 by a raiding party led by [[U.S. Navy]] Lt. [[William B. Cushing]].\n\nJacksonville and Onslow County continued to rely on naval stores, lumber, and tobacco crops for industry. In 1939, Colonel George W. Gillette of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] surveyed and mapped the area from [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]] to [[Fort Sumter]], [[South Carolina]] which included the Onslow County coastline and the New River. The map is believed to have fostered the interest of the War and Navy Departments in establishing an amphibious training base in the area. Congressman [[Graham Arthur Barden]] of New Bern lobbied [[United States Congress|Congress]] to appropriate funds for the purchase of about {{convert|100,000|acre|km2}} along the eastern bank of the New River. The establishment in 1941 of Marine Barracks, New River, later renamed [[Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base]], led to the relocation of 700 families. While the landowners were compensated, many of the families displaced were sharecroppers who did not own the land on which their houses were built, and did not receive compensation for their structures. Some African American families were able to purchase property from Raymond Kellum and established the community of Kellumtown. Other displaced families established communities in Georgetown, Pickettown, Bell Fork, and Sandy Run. The latter communities have since been absorbed by Jacksonville. Colonel Gillette had planned to retire near the small village of Marine, ironically named after a local family whose surname was Marine, but lost his land to the acquisition, as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nConstruction of Camp Lejeune caused a population explosion in the small town of about 800 inhabitants, as new workers migrated to the area. Growth continued to be fueled by both young Marine families and military retirees. Today, Jacksonville's primary industry is retail sales and services.<ref>http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/north-carolina/jacksonville/work</ref> The primary migration draw continues to be the [[U.S. Marine Corps]].\n\nThe [[Bank of Onslow and Jacksonville Masonic Temple]], [[Mill Avenue Historic District]], and [[Pelletier House|Pelletier House and Wantland Spring]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nJacksonville is located at {{coord|34|45|35|N|77|24|35|W|type:city}} (34.759630, -77.409765).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|45.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|44.5|sqmi|km2}} of it are land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} of it (1.51%) is covered by water.
