As a simple example, if the tree root has only two children, one with weight <math>1/n</math> and one with weight <math>1-1/n</math>, then the aspect ratio of the smaller child will be <math>n</math>, which can be arbitrarily high. \nTo cope with this problem, several algorithms have been proposed that use regions that are general [[convex polygon]]s, not necessarily rectangular.\n\n'''Convex treemaps''' were developed in several steps, each step improved the upper bound on the aspect ratio.

The original tree is converted to a binary tree: each node with more than two children is replaced by a sub-tree in which each node has exactly two children.\n* B. Each region representing a node (starting from the root) is divided to two, using a line that keeps the angles between edges as large as possible. It is possible to prove that, if all edges of a convex polygon are separated by an angle of at least <math>\\phi</math>, then its aspect ratio is <math>O(1/\\phi)</math>. It is possible to ensure that, in a tree of depth <math>d</math>, the angle is divided by a factor of at most <math>d</math>, hence the aspect ratio guarantee.\n\n==== Orthoconvex treemaps ====\nIn convex treemaps, the aspect ratio cannot be constant - it grows with the depth of the tree. \nTo attain a constant aspect-ratio,  '''Orthoconvex treemaps'''<ref name=\"dsv2\"/> can be used. There, all regions are [[orthoconvex]] [[rectilinear polygon]]s with aspect ratio at most 64; and the leaves are either rectangles with aspect ratio at most 8, or L-shapes or S-shapes with aspect ratio at most 32.\n* For the special case where the depth is 1, they present an algorithm that uses only rectangles and L-shapes, and the aspect ratio is at most <math>2 + 2 /\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.15</math>; the internal nodes use only rectangles with aspect ratio at most <math>1+\\sqrt{3} \\approx 2.73</math>.\n\n=== Other treemaps ===\n'''Voronoi Treemaps'''<ref name=\"voronoi_algorithm\">{{Cite conference| last1 = Balzer | first1 = Michael | last2 = Deussen | first2 = Oliver | editor1-last = Stasko| editor1-first = John T.\n | editor2-last = Ward | editor2-first = Matthew O. | contribution = Voronoi Treemaps\n | pages = 7  | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | title = IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis 2005), 23-25 October 2005, Minneapolis, MN, USA | url = http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/publikationen/2005/voronoi_treemaps/Balzer%20et%20al.%20--%20Voronoi%20Treemaps.pdf\n | year = 2005}}.</ref> - based on [[Voronoi diagram]] calculations.

For example, [[mosaic plot]]s (also known as Marimekko diagrams) use rectangular tilings to show joint distributions (i.e., most commonly they are essentially stacked column plots where the columns are of different widths). The main distinguishing feature of a treemap, however, is the recursive construction that allows it to be extended to hierarchical data with any number of levels. This idea was invented by professor [[Ben Shneiderman]] at the [[University of Maryland Human \u2013 Computer Interaction Lab]] in the early 1990s.\n<ref name=shneiderman_0>{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/102377.115768|title=Tree visualization with tree-maps: 2-d space-filling approach|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|volume=11|pages=92\u201399|year=1992|last1=Shneiderman|first1=Ben|hdl=1903/367}}</ref><ref name=\"shneiderman_1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml |title=Treemaps for space-constrained visualization of hierarchies ~ Including the History of Treemap Research at the University of Maryland|author=Ben Shneiderman |author2=Catherine Plaisant |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2010|author2-link=Catherine Plaisant|author-link=Ben Shneiderman}}</ref> Shneiderman and his collaborators then deepened the idea by introducing a variety of interactive techniques for filtering and adjusting treemaps.\n\nThese early treemaps all used the simple \"slice-and-dice\" tiling algorithm. Despite many desirable properties (it is stable, preserves ordering, and is easy to implement), the slice-and-dice method often produces tilings with many long, skinny rectangles. In 1994 Mountaz Hascoet and [[Michel Beaudouin-Lafon]] invented a \"squarifying\" algorithm, later popularized by [[Jarke van Wijk]], that created tilings whose rectangles were closer to square. In 1999 [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]] used a variation of the \"squarifying\" algorithm that he called \"pivot and slice\" to create the first Web-based treemap, the SmartMoney Map of the Market, which displayed data on hundreds of companies in the U.S. stock market. Following its launch, treemaps enjoyed a surge of interest, especially in financial contexts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nA third wave of treemap innovation came around 2004, after [[Marcos Weskamp]] created the [[Newsmap]], a treemap that displayed news headlines.

The original tree is converted to a binary tree: each node with more than two children is replaced by a sub-tree in which each node has exactly two children.\n* B. Each region representing a node (starting from the root) is divided to two, using a line that keeps the angles between edges as large as possible. It is possible to prove that, if all edges of a convex polygon are separated by an angle of at least <math>\\phi</math>, then its aspect ratio is <math>O(1/\\phi)</math>. It is possible to ensure that, in a tree of depth <math>d</math>, the angle is divided by a factor of at most <math>d</math>, hence the aspect ratio guarantee.\n\n==== Orthoconvex treemaps ====\nIn convex treemaps, the aspect ratio cannot be constant - it grows with the depth of the tree. \nTo attain a constant aspect-ratio,  '''Orthoconvex treemaps'''<ref name=\"dsv2\"/> can be used. There, all regions are [[orthoconvex]] [[rectilinear polygon]]s with aspect ratio at most 64; and the leaves are either rectangles with aspect ratio at most 8, or L-shapes or S-shapes with aspect ratio at most 32.\n* For the special case where the depth is 1, they present an algorithm that uses only rectangles and L-shapes, and the aspect ratio is at most <math>2 + 2 /\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.15</math>; the internal nodes use only rectangles with aspect ratio at most <math>1+\\sqrt{3} \\approx 2.73</math>.\n\n=== Other treemaps ===\n'''Voronoi Treemaps'''<ref name=\"voronoi_algorithm\">{{Cite conference| last1 = Balzer | first1 = Michael | last2 = Deussen | first2 = Oliver | editor1-last = Stasko| editor1-first = John T.\n | editor2-last = Ward | editor2-first = Matthew O. | contribution = Voronoi Treemaps\n | pages = 7  | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | title = IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis 2005), 23-25 October 2005, Minneapolis, MN, USA | url = http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/publikationen/2005/voronoi_treemaps/Balzer%20et%20al.%20--%20Voronoi%20Treemaps.pdf\n | year = 2005}}.</ref> - based on [[Voronoi diagram]] calculations.

For example, [[mosaic plot]]s (also known as Marimekko diagrams) use rectangular tilings to show joint distributions (i.e., most commonly they are essentially stacked column plots where the columns are of different widths). The main distinguishing feature of a treemap, however, is the recursive construction that allows it to be extended to hierarchical data with any number of levels. This idea was invented by professor [[Ben Shneiderman]] at the [[University of Maryland Human \u2013 Computer Interaction Lab]] in the early 1990s.\n<ref name=shneiderman_0>{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/102377.115768|title=Tree visualization with tree-maps: 2-d space-filling approach|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|volume=11|pages=92\u201399|year=1992|last1=Shneiderman|first1=Ben|hdl=1903/367}}</ref><ref name=\"shneiderman_1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml |title=Treemaps for space-constrained visualization of hierarchies ~ Including the History of Treemap Research at the University of Maryland|author=Ben Shneiderman |author2=Catherine Plaisant |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2010|author2-link=Catherine Plaisant|author-link=Ben Shneiderman}}</ref> Shneiderman and his collaborators then deepened the idea by introducing a variety of interactive techniques for filtering and adjusting treemaps.\n\nThese early treemaps all used the simple \"slice-and-dice\" tiling algorithm. Despite many desirable properties (it is stable, preserves ordering, and is easy to implement), the slice-and-dice method often produces tilings with many long, skinny rectangles. In 1994 Mountaz Hascoet and [[Michel Beaudouin-Lafon]] invented a \"squarifying\" algorithm, later popularized by [[Jarke van Wijk]], that created tilings whose rectangles were closer to square. In 1999 [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]] used a variation of the \"squarifying\" algorithm that he called \"pivot and slice\" to create the first Web-based treemap, the SmartMoney Map of the Market, which displayed data on hundreds of companies in the U.S. stock market. Following its launch, treemaps enjoyed a surge of interest, especially in financial contexts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nA third wave of treemap innovation came around 2004, after [[Marcos Weskamp]] created the [[Newsmap]], a treemap that displayed news headlines.

In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.<ref name=\"IndoEats-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Surabaya====\nNamed after the city of [[Surabaya]] in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made.

However, unlike commonn rolled elongated fresh lumpia, lumpia Bandung is not served in [[spring roll]] form, but the lumpia skin is spread, topped with fillings, stacked and folded square just like an envelope. Unlike Semarang style lumpia that uses bamboo shoots and minced chicken, Bandung style lumpia filling uses julienned [[jicama]], [[beansprout]], scallion, garlic, chili, and scrambled egg, with [[palm sugar]] sauce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.viva.co.id/gaya-hidup/kuliner/1119989-resep-lumpia-basah-bandung-kudapan-sehat-bikin-ngiler|title=RESEP: Lumpia Basah Bandung, Kudapan Sehat Bikin Ngiler|last=VIVA|first=PT VIVA MEDIA BARU-|date=2019-02-11|website=www.viva.co.id|language=id|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n====Lumpia goreng====\n[[File:Lumpia at Teh Jawa, Purwokerto Station, Purwokerto 2015-03-20.jpg|thumb|right|Smaller size deep fried lumpia served with [[sambal]] hot sauce, sold as a snack in Purwokerto Train Station, Central Java]]\n''Lumpia goreng'' is a simple fried spring rolls filled with vegetables; the spring roll wrappers are filled with chopped carrots cut into matchstick size, shredded cabbage, and sometimes mushrooms.

They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino lumpia can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin wrapper made from just flour, water, and salt. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.<ref name=\"IndoEats-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Surabaya====\nNamed after the city of [[Surabaya]] in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made.

However, unlike commonn rolled elongated fresh lumpia, lumpia Bandung is not served in [[spring roll]] form, but the lumpia skin is spread, topped with fillings, stacked and folded square just like an envelope. Unlike Semarang style lumpia that uses bamboo shoots and minced chicken, Bandung style lumpia filling uses julienned [[jicama]], [[beansprout]], scallion, garlic, chili, and scrambled egg, with [[palm sugar]] sauce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.viva.co.id/gaya-hidup/kuliner/1119989-resep-lumpia-basah-bandung-kudapan-sehat-bikin-ngiler|title=RESEP: Lumpia Basah Bandung, Kudapan Sehat Bikin Ngiler|last=VIVA|first=PT VIVA MEDIA BARU-|date=2019-02-11|website=www.viva.co.id|language=id|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n====Lumpia goreng====\n[[File:Lumpia at Teh Jawa, Purwokerto Station, Purwokerto 2015-03-20.jpg|thumb|right|Smaller size deep fried lumpia served with [[sambal]] hot sauce, sold as a snack in Purwokerto Train Station, Central Java]]\n''Lumpia goreng'' is a simple fried spring rolls filled with vegetables; the spring roll wrappers are filled with chopped carrots cut into matchstick size, shredded cabbage, and sometimes mushrooms.

They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino lumpia can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin wrapper made from just flour, water, and salt. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

They have numerous variants that contain other ingredients like [[Pea#Types of pea|green pea]]s, ''kinchay'' ([[Chinese parsley]]) or raisins. ''Lumpiang Shanghai'' is commonly served with ''[[agre dulce]]'', but [[ketchup]] (tomato or [[ketchup|banana]]) and vinegar are popular alternatives.

The most common variant used mostly for fried lumpia is made from just flour, water, salt, and optionally [[cornstarch]]. This type of wrapper is characteristically paper-thin, much thinner than other spring roll wrappers. The ingredients are mixed into a wet dough, then left to stand for a few hours before cooking. A ball of dough is taken with one hand and smeared into a heated large flat metal plate greased with oil until a very thin circular film of it adheres to the pan and fries. It is cooked for a few seconds then quickly taken out and left to dry.<ref name=\"wrapperfil\">{{cite web |title=Marketman\u2019s Quest For The Thinnest Lumpia Wrappers\u2026 |url=http://www.marketmanila.com/archives/marketmans-quest-for-the-thinnest-lumpia-wrappers |website=Market Manila |accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"clk\">{{cite web |title=Lumpia Wrappers (Spring Roll Wrappers) |url=https://cheflolaskitchen.com/spring-roll-wrappers-lumpia-recipe/ |website=ChefLolasKitchen |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor \"fresh\" (non-fried) lumpia, the wrappers are usually made with egg in addition to the other basic ingredients (and it may use [[rice flour]]).

It is still thinner than other spring roll variants, but much thicker and softer than variants made from just flour and water.<ref name=\"wrapperfil\"/> \n\nIn modern mass production, Filipino lumpia wrappers are generally made by automated assembly-line machines similar to those used to make spring roll wrappers, differing only in the recipe and the thickness of the wrapper.

Isabela is home to more wild tortoises than all the other islands. Isabela's large size and notable topography created barriers for the slow-moving tortoises; apparently the creatures were unable to cross lava flows and other obstacles, causing several different sub-species of tortoise to develop.

The island is primarily noted for its geology, providing excellent examples of a geologic occurrence that created the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] including uplifts at Urvina Bay<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitgalapagos.travel/visitor-sites/urbina-bay-galapagos-islands.html|title=Galapagos Islands - Urbina Bay|website=www.visitgalapagos.travel|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref> and the Bolivar Channel<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruiz|first=Diego J.|last2=Wolff|first2=Matthias|date=2011-08-01|title=The Bolivar Channel Ecosystem of the Galapagos Marine Reserve: Energy flow structure and role of keystone groups|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138511011100075X|journal=Journal of Sea Research|language=en|volume=66|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1016/j.seares.2011.05.006|issn=1385-1101}}</ref>, [[tuff cone]]s at [https://discovergalapagos.com/tagus.html Tagus Cove], and Pulmace on Alcedo and [[Sierra Negra (Gal\u00e1pagos)|Sierra Negra]], one of the most active volcanoes in the world.\n\n==Wildlife==\nIsabela is also interesting for its [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. The young island does not follow the vegetation zones of the other islands. The relatively new lava fields and surrounding soils have not developed the sufficient nutrients required to support the varied life zones found on other islands.  Another obvious difference occurs on [[Volc\u00e1n Wolf|Volcan Wolf]] and [[Cerro Azul (Ecuador volcano)|Cerro Azul]]; these volcanoes loft above the cloud cover and are arid on top.\n\nIsabela's rich [[bird]], [[animal]] and marine life is beyond compare. Isabela is home to more wild tortoises than all the other islands. Isabela's large size and notable topography created barriers for the slow-moving tortoises; apparently the creatures were unable to cross lava flows and other obstacles, causing several different sub-species of tortoise to develop. Today, tortoises roam free in the calderas of [[Alcedo Volcano|Alcedo]], [[Volc\u00e1n Wolf|Wolf]], [[Cerro Azul (Ecuador volcano)|Cerro Azul]], Darwin<ref name=\":0\" />, and [[Sierra Negra (Gal\u00e1pagos)|Sierra Negra]].\n\nIntroduced [[goat]]s multiplied to over 100,000, but were eradicated by the [[Gal\u00e1pagos National Park]] Service and the [[Charles Darwin Foundation]] in 2006-2007.<ref>\"History and Achievements\". Charles Darwin Foundation.</ref> Since then, the vegetation has recovered greatly.\n\nOther noted species include [[Gal\u00e1pagos penguin|penguin]]s, [[Flightless cormorant|cormorant]]s, [[marine iguana]]s, [[Booby|boobies]], [[Brown pelican|pelican]]s and [[Grapsus grapsus|''Sally Lightfoot'' crabs]] abound. [[Gal\u00e1pagos land iguana]]s, [[Darwin's finch]]es, [[Gal\u00e1pagos hawk]]s, [[Gal\u00e1pagos dove]]s, and very interesting lowland vegetation. The west coast of Isabela in the Bolivar Channel is the best place in Gal\u00e1pagos for viewing whales and dolphin.\n\n==Human occupation==\nThe settlements of [[Puerto Villamil]] and Santo Tom\u00e1s were founded in 1893. By 1905, the population of the island was 200. Exports at the time were sulfur mined from [[fumarole]]s and lime made from [[coral]]. Tortoises were used for meat and oil.<ref name=gc>{{cite web|title=Human Discovery: Galapagos Colonists|url=http://www.galapagos.org/about_galapagos/colonists/|publisher=Galapagos Conservancy|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=white>{{cite web|last=White|first=W.

Also called '''sky radiation''', '''diffuse skylight''', or just '''skylight''', it is the determinative process for changing the colors of the [[sky]]. Approximately 23% of direct incident radiation of total [[sunlight]] is removed from the direct solar beam  by scattering into the atmosphere; of this amount (of incident radiation)  about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as [[photon diffusion|photon diffused]] skylight radiation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe dominant radiative scattering processes in the atmosphere are [[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie scattering]]; they are [[elastic scattering|elastic]], meaning that a photon of light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and without changing wavelength.\n\nUnder an overcast sky, there is no direct sunlight and all light results from diffused skylight radiation.\n\nProceeding from analyses of the aftermath of the eruption of the Philippines volcano Mount Pinatubo (in June 1991) and other studies:<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>  Diffused skylight, owing to its intrinsic structure and behavior, can illuminate under-canopy leaves, permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case; this in stark contrast to the effect of totally clear skies with direct sunlight that casts shadows onto understory leaves and thereby limits plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer, [[#The diffused skylight effect|(see below)]].\n\n==Color==\n[[Image:Trees-sky.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clear blue sky]]\nThe [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] scatters short-[[wavelength]] light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths. Because its wavelengths are shorter,  blue light is more strongly scattered than the longer-wavelength lights, red or green. Hence the result that when looking at the sky away from the direct incident [[sunlight]], the human eye perceives the sky to be blue.<ref>\"[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9062822 Rayleigh scattering].\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. 2007.

Scattering varies as a function of the ratio of particle diameters (of particulates in the atmosphere) to the wavelength of the incident radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, [[Rayleigh scattering]] occurs.  (In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios scattering varies in a more complex fashion, as described for spherical particles by the [[Mie theory]].) The laws of [[geometric optics]] begin to apply at higher ratios.\n\nDaily at any global venue experiencing  [[sunrise]] or [[sunset]], most of the solar beam of visible sunlight arrives nearly tangentially to Earth's surface. Here the trajectory of sunlight through the atmosphere is elongated such that much of the blue or green light is scattered away from the line of perceivable visible light. This phenomenon leaves the Sun's rays, and the clouds they illuminate, abundantly orange-to-red in colors, which one sees when looking at a sunset or sunrise.\n\nFor the example of the Sun at zenith, during broad daylight, the sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering, which also involves the [[diatomic]] gases [[nitrogen|{{chem|N|2}}]] and [[oxygen|{{chem|O|2}}]]. Near sunset and especially during twilight, absorption by [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}) significantly contributes to maintaining blue color in the evening sky.\n\n==Neutral points==\nFour commonly detectable points have zero [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of diffuse sky radiation. These ''neutral points'' lie along the [[vertical circle]] through the center of the [[Sun]]'s disk and the [[antisolar point]].\n*The '''Arago point''', named after [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago|its discoverer]], is customarily located at about 20\u00b0 above the antisolar point, but it lies at higher altitudes in turbid air. The latter property makes the Arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric [[turbidity]].\n*The '''Babinet point''', discovered by [[Jacques Babinet]] in 1840, is located about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 above the Sun; hence, it is difficult to observe because of solar glare.\n*The '''Brewster point''', discovered by [[David Brewster]] in 1840, is located about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 below the Sun; hence, it is difficult to observe because of solar glare.\n*The fourth point, located at about 20\u00b0 below the antisolar point, is visible only at higher altitudes in the air or in space.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Horv\u00e1th |first1=G |last2=Bern\u00e1th |first2=B |last3=Suhai |first3=B |last4=Barta |first4=A |last5=Wehner |first5=R |title=First observation of the fourth neutral polarization point in the atmosphere |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|date=October 2002 |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=2085\u201399 |pmid=12365628|bibcode=2002JOSAA..19.2085H |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.19.002085 }}</ref>\n\n==Under an overcast sky==\nThere is essentially no direct sunlight under an overcast sky, so all light is then diffuse sky radiation.

Also called '''sky radiation''', '''diffuse skylight''', or just '''skylight''', it is the determinative process for changing the colors of the [[sky]]. Approximately 23% of direct incident radiation of total [[sunlight]] is removed from the direct solar beam  by scattering into the atmosphere; of this amount (of incident radiation)  about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as [[photon diffusion|photon diffused]] skylight radiation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe dominant radiative scattering processes in the atmosphere are [[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie scattering]]; they are [[elastic scattering|elastic]], meaning that a photon of light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and without changing wavelength.\n\nUnder an overcast sky, there is no direct sunlight and all light results from diffused skylight radiation.\n\nProceeding from analyses of the aftermath of the eruption of the Philippines volcano Mount Pinatubo (in June 1991) and other studies:<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>  Diffused skylight, owing to its intrinsic structure and behavior, can illuminate under-canopy leaves, permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case; this in stark contrast to the effect of totally clear skies with direct sunlight that casts shadows onto understory leaves and thereby limits plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer, [[#The diffused skylight effect|(see below)]].\n\n==Color==\n[[Image:Trees-sky.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clear blue sky]]\nThe [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] scatters short-[[wavelength]] light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths.

Scattering varies as a function of the ratio of particle diameters (of particulates in the atmosphere) to the wavelength of the incident radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, [[Rayleigh scattering]] occurs.  (In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios scattering varies in a more complex fashion, as described for spherical particles by the [[Mie theory]].) The laws of [[geometric optics]] begin to apply at higher ratios.\n\nDaily at any global venue experiencing  [[sunrise]] or [[sunset]], most of the solar beam of visible sunlight arrives nearly tangentially to Earth's surface. Here the trajectory of sunlight through the atmosphere is elongated such that much of the blue or green light is scattered away from the line of perceivable visible light. This phenomenon leaves the Sun's rays, and the clouds they illuminate, abundantly orange-to-red in colors, which one sees when looking at a sunset or sunrise.\n\nFor the example of the Sun at zenith, during broad daylight, the sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering, which also involves the [[diatomic]] gases [[nitrogen|{{chem|N|2}}]] and [[oxygen|{{chem|O|2}}]]. Near sunset and especially during twilight, absorption by [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}) significantly contributes to maintaining blue color in the evening sky.\n\n==Neutral points==\nFour commonly detectable points have zero [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of diffuse sky radiation. These ''neutral points'' lie along the [[vertical circle]] through the center of the [[Sun]]'s disk and the [[antisolar point]].\n*The '''Arago point''', named after [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago|its discoverer]], is customarily located at about 20\u00b0 above the antisolar point, but it lies at higher altitudes in turbid air. The latter property makes the Arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric [[turbidity]].\n*The '''Babinet point''', discovered by [[Jacques Babinet]] in 1840, is located about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 above the Sun; hence, it is difficult to observe because of solar glare.\n*The '''Brewster point''', discovered by [[David Brewster]] in 1840, is located about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 below the Sun; hence, it is difficult to observe because of solar glare.\n*The fourth point, located at about 20\u00b0 below the antisolar point, is visible only at higher altitudes in the air or in space.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Horv\u00e1th |first1=G |last2=Bern\u00e1th |first2=B |last3=Suhai |first3=B |last4=Barta |first4=A |last5=Wehner |first5=R |title=First observation of the fourth neutral polarization point in the atmosphere |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|date=October 2002 |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=2085\u201399 |pmid=12365628|bibcode=2002JOSAA..19.2085H |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.19.002085 }}</ref>\n\n==Under an overcast sky==\nThere is essentially no direct sunlight under an overcast sky, so all light is then diffuse sky radiation. The flux of light is not very wavelength-dependent because the cloud droplets are larger than the light's wavelength and scatter all colors approximately equally. The light passes through the translucent clouds in a manner similar to frosted glass. The intensity ranges (roughly) from {{frac|1|6}} of direct sunlight for relatively thin clouds down to {{frac|1|1000}} of direct sunlight under the extreme of thickest storm clouds.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n==As a part of total radiation==\nOne of the equations for total solar radiation is:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mukherjee|first1=D.|last2=Chakrabarti|first2=S.|title=Fundamentals of Renewable Energy Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdxdezgeXAcC&pg=PA22|year=2004|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1540-7|page=22}}</ref>\n\n: <math>H_t= H_b R_b + H_d R_d + (H_b+H_d) R_r </math>\n\nwhere ''H<sub>b</sub>'' is the beam radiation irradiance, ''R<sub>b</sub>'' is the tilt factor for beam radiation, ''H<sub>d</sub>'' is the diffuse radiation irradiance, ''R<sub>d</sub>'' is the tilt factor for diffuse radiation and ''R<sub>r</sub>'' is the tilt factor for reflected radiation.\n\n''R<sub>b</sub>'' is given by:\n\n: <math>R_b=\\frac{\\sin(\\delta) \\sin(\\phi-\\beta)+ \\cos(\\delta)\\cos(h) \\cos(\\phi-\\beta)}{\\sin(\\delta) \\sin(\\phi)+ \\cos(\\delta)\\cos(h) \\cos(\\phi)}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b4'' is the [[solar declination]], ''\u03a6'' is the latitude, ''\u03b2'' is an angle from the horizontal and ''h'' is the solar [[hour angle]].\n\n''R<sub>d</sub>'' is given by:\n\n: <math>R_d=\\frac{1+\\cos(\\beta)}{2}</math>\n\nand ''R<sub>r</sub>'' by:\n\n: <math>R_r=\\frac{\\rho(1-\\cos(\\beta))}{2}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1'' is the [[reflectivity]] of the surface.\n\n==Agriculture and the eruption of Mt.
