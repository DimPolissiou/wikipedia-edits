Thus it crosses the conventional boundary between the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] bands at 3.0&nbsp;GHz. The S band is used by [[airport surveillance radar]] for [[air traffic control]], [[weather radar]], surface ship [[radar]], and some [[communications satellite]]s, especially those used by [[NASA]] to communicate with the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]]. The 10&nbsp;cm [[radar]] short-band ranges roughly from 1.55 to 5.2&nbsp;GHz.  The S band also contains the 2.4\u20132.483&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]], widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as [[cordless phone]]s, wireless headphones ([[Bluetooth]]), [[wireless networking]] (WiFi), [[garage door opener]]s, [[keyless entry|keyless vehicle locks]], [[baby monitor]]s as well as for medical [[diathermy]] machines and [[microwave oven]]s (typically at 2.495&nbsp;GHz). India's regional satellite navigation network ([[IRNSS]]) broadcasts on 2.483778 to 2.500278&nbsp;GHz.<ref>https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/irnss_sps_icd_version1.1-2017.pdf</ref>\n\n==Satellite communications==\nIn the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] approved satellite-based [[Digital Audio Radio Service]] (DARS) [[Radio broadcasting|broadcasting]] in the S band from 2.31 to 2.36&nbsp;GHz in 1995 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/misc-1/today-in-radio-history|title= Today in Radio History |author=|date=|website=radioworld.com|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>, currently used by [[Sirius XM Radio]]. More recently, it has approved for portions of the S band between 2.0 and 2.2&nbsp;GHz the creation of Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) networks in connection with Ancillary Terrestrial Components (ATC). There are presently a number of companies attempting to deploy such networks, including [[ICO Satellite Management]] and [[TerreStar]].\n\nThe 2.6&nbsp;GHz range is used for [[China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting]], a [[satellite radio]] and [[mobile TV]] standard which, as with [[Property|proprietary]] systems in the U.S., is [[:wikt:incompatible|incompatible]] with the [[open standard]]s used in the rest of the world.\n\nIn May 2009, [[Inmarsat]] and [[Solaris Mobile]] (a joint venture between [[Eutelsat Communications|Eutelsat]] and [[SES S.A.|SES]], now [[EchoStar Mobile]]) were awarded each a 2\u00d715&nbsp;MHz portion of the S band by the [[European Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/770|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - European Commission paves the way for European mobile satellite services|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> The two companies are allowed two years to start providing pan-European MSS services for 18 years. Allocated frequencies are 1.98 to 2.01&nbsp;GHz for Earth to space communications, and from 2.17 to 2.2&nbsp;GHz for space to Earth communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erodocdb.dk/docs/doc98/Official/Pdf/6262008EC.pdf|title=Decision No 626/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2008 on the selection and authorisation of systems providing mobile satellite services (MSS)|author=|date=|website=erodocdb.dk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\nEutelsat [[W series (satellites)|W2A]] satellite launched in April, 2009 and located at 10\u00b0 East is currently the unique satellite in Europe operating on S band frequencies.\n\nIn some countries, S band is used for [[Direct broadcast satellite|Direct-to-Home satellite]] television (unlike similar services in most countries, which use [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub> band]]). The frequency typically allocated for this service is 2.5 to 2.7&nbsp;GHz (LOF 1.570&nbsp;GHz).\n\n[[IndoStar-1]] was the world's first commercial communications satellite to use S-band frequencies for broadcast (pioneered by van der Heyden), which efficiently penetrate the atmosphere and provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80&nbsp;cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. Similar performance is not economically feasible with comparable Ku- or C-band DTH satellite systems since more power is required in these bands to penetrate the moist atmosphere.\n\n==Other uses==\n{{main|Citizens Broadband Radio Service}}\n[[Wireless network]] equipment compatible with [[IEEE]] [[802.11b]] and [[802.11g]] standards use the 2.4&nbsp;GHz section of the S band. Some digital cordless telephones operate in this band too. [[Microwave oven]]s operate at 2495 or 2450&nbsp;MHz.  [[IEEE 802.16]]a and 802.16e standards use a part of the frequency range of S band; under [[WiMAX]] standards most vendors are now manufacturing equipment in the range of 3.5&nbsp;GHz.

Thus it crosses the conventional boundary between the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] bands at 3.0&nbsp;GHz. The S band is used by [[airport surveillance radar]] for [[air traffic control]], [[weather radar]], surface ship [[radar]], and some [[communications satellite]]s, especially those used by [[NASA]] to communicate with the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]]. The 10&nbsp;cm [[radar]] short-band ranges roughly from 1.55 to 5.2&nbsp;GHz.  The S band also contains the 2.4\u20132.483&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]], widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as [[cordless phone]]s, wireless headphones ([[Bluetooth]]), [[wireless networking]] (WiFi), [[garage door opener]]s, [[keyless entry|keyless vehicle locks]], [[baby monitor]]s as well as for medical [[diathermy]] machines and [[microwave oven]]s (typically at 2.495&nbsp;GHz).

More recently, it has approved for portions of the S band between 2.0 and 2.2&nbsp;GHz the creation of Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) networks in connection with Ancillary Terrestrial Components (ATC). There are presently a number of companies attempting to deploy such networks, including [[ICO Satellite Management]] and [[TerreStar]].\n\nThe 2.6&nbsp;GHz range is used for [[China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting]], a [[satellite radio]] and [[mobile TV]] standard which, as with [[Property|proprietary]] systems in the U.S., is [[:wikt:incompatible|incompatible]] with the [[open standard]]s used in the rest of the world.\n\nIn May 2009, [[Inmarsat]] and [[Solaris Mobile]] (a joint venture between [[Eutelsat Communications|Eutelsat]] and [[SES S.A.|SES]], now [[EchoStar Mobile]]) were awarded each a 2\u00d715&nbsp;MHz portion of the S band by the [[European Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/770|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - European Commission paves the way for European mobile satellite services|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> The two companies are allowed two years to start providing pan-European MSS services for 18 years.

The frequency typically allocated for this service is 2.5 to 2.7&nbsp;GHz (LOF 1.570&nbsp;GHz).\n\n[[IndoStar-1]] was the world's first commercial communications satellite to use S-band frequencies for broadcast (pioneered by van der Heyden), which efficiently penetrate the atmosphere and provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80&nbsp;cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. Similar performance is not economically feasible with comparable Ku- or C-band DTH satellite systems since more power is required in these bands to penetrate the moist atmosphere.\n\n==Other uses==\n{{main|Citizens Broadband Radio Service}}\n[[Wireless network]] equipment compatible with [[IEEE]] [[802.11b]] and [[802.11g]] standards use the 2.4&nbsp;GHz section of the S band. Some digital cordless telephones operate in this band too. [[Microwave oven]]s operate at 2495 or 2450&nbsp;MHz.  [[IEEE 802.16]]a and 802.16e standards use a part of the frequency range of S band; under [[WiMAX]] standards most vendors are now manufacturing equipment in the range of 3.5&nbsp;GHz.

He betrays and plays the gangs against one another in order to make money. Then he uses his cunning and exceptional weapons skill to assist a family threatened by both gangs. His treachery is exposed and he is severely beaten, but in the end, he defeats the remaining gang. The interaction in this story between cunning and irony (the tricks, deceits, unexpected actions and sarcasm of the hero) on the one hand, and pathos (terror and brutality against defenseless people and against the hero after his double-cross has been revealed) on the other, was aspired to and sometimes attained by the imitations that soon flooded the cinemas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=This seems to be a summary of a specific film and shows us nothing about how it's a common element to spaghetti westerns}}\n\nItalian cinema often borrowed from other films without regard for infringement, and Leone famously borrowed the plot for ''A Fistful of Dollars'', receiving a letter from Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]] congratulating him on making \"...a very fine film.

The genre most identifiably American, the Western, seemed to be evolving into a new, rougher form. For many critics, [[Sergio Leone]]'s films were part of the problem. Leone's ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (1964\u20131966) was not the beginning of the \"Spaghetti Western\" cycle in Italy, but for some Americans Leone's films represented the true beginning of the Italian invasion of an American genre.\n\n[[Christopher Frayling]], in his noted book on the Italian Western, describes American critical reception of the Spaghetti Western cycle as, to \"a large extent, confined to a sterile debate about the 'cultural roots' of the American/Hollywood Western.\"<ref>Frayling (2006) pp. 121\u2013137</ref> He remarks that few critics dared admit that they were, in fact, \"bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre.\"\n\n[[Pauline Kael]], he notes, was willing to acknowledge this critical ennui and thus appreciate how a film such as [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961) \"could exploit the conventions of the Western genre, while debunking its morality.\" Frayling and other film scholars such as Bondanella argue that this revisionism was the key to Leone's success and, to some degree, to that of the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole.<ref>Frayling (2006) pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\n==Rise and fall==\n\n===European Westerns from the beginning===\nEuropean Westerns are as old as filmmaking itself.

An Italian critic has compared these comedies to American [[Bob Hope]] vehicles.<ref>Mario Molinari, ''Prima che arrivassero gli \u2019spaghetti\u2019'' Segnocinema 22 (March 1986), Vicenza</ref>\n\nThe first American-British western filmed in Spain was ''[[The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw]]'' (1958), directed by [[Raoul Walsh]]. It was followed in 1961 by ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|Savage Guns]]'', a British-Spanish western, again filmed in Spain. This marked the beginning of Spain as a suitable film shooting location for any kind of European western.\n\nIn 1963, three non-comedy Italo-Spanish westerns were produced: ''[[Gunfight at Red Sands]]'', ''[[Implacable Three]]'' and ''[[Gunfight at High Noon]]''. In 1961 an Italian company co-produced the French ''Taste of Violence'', with a Mexican Revolution theme.\n\nIn 1965, [[Bruno Bozzetto]] released his [[Traditional animation|traditionally animated]] feature film ''[[West and Soda]]'', a Western [[parody]] with a marked Spaghetti Western-theme; despite having been released a year after Sergio Leone's seminal Spaghetti Western ''A Fistful of Dollars'', development of ''West and Soda'' actually began a year earlier than ''Fistful'''s and lasted longer, mainly because of the use of more time-demanding animation over regular acting. For this reason, Bozzetto himself claims to have invented the Spaghetti Western genre.<ref>{{cite news |last=Iondini |first=Massimo |date=3 October 2015 |title=Bozzetto: \u00abCos\u00ec ho inventato lo spaghetti western\u00bb |trans-title=Bozzetto: \u00abSo I invented spaghetti western\u00bb |url=https://www.avvenire.it/agora/pagine/bozzetto-intervista |language=Italian |work=[[Avvenire]] |location=Milan |access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line between Spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns (or other Westerns in general) one cannot say which one of the films mentioned so far was the first Spaghetti Western. However, 1964 saw the breakthrough of this genre, with more than twenty productions or co-productions from Italian companies, and more than half a dozen Westerns by Spanish or Spanish/American companies. Furthermore, by far the most commercially successful of this lot was Sergio Leone's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' whose innovations in cinematic style, music, acting and story decided the future for the genre.\n\n===Impact of ''A Fistful of Dollars''===\nThe Spaghetti Western was born, flourished and faded in a highly commercial production environment. The Italian \"low\" popular film production was usually low-budget and low-profit, and the easiest way to success was imitating a proven success.<ref>Frayling (2006) pp. 68\u2013102</ref> When the typically low-budget production ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' turned into a remarkable box office success, the industry eagerly lapped up its innovations. Most succeeding Spaghetti Westerns tried to get a ragged, laconic hero with superhuman weapon skill, preferably one who looked like [[Clint Eastwood]]: [[Franco Nero]], [[Giuliano Gemma]], [[Gianni Garko|John Garko]] and [[Terence Hill]] started out that way; [[Anthony Steffen]] and others stayed that way all their Spaghetti Western career.\n\nWhoever the hero was, he would join an outlaw gang to further his own secret agenda, like in ''[[A Pistol for Ringo]]'', ''[[Blood for a Silver Dollar]]'', ''[[Vengeance Is a Dish Served Cold]]'', ''[[Renegade Riders]]'' and others, while ''[[Beyond the Law (1968 Italian film)|Beyond the Law]]'' instead has a bandit infiltrate society and become a sheriff. There would be a flamboyant Mexican bandit ([[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] from ''A Fistful of Dollars'', otherwise [[Tomas Milian]] or most often [[Fernando Sancho]]) and a grumpy old man \u2013 more often than not an undertaker, to serve as sidekick for the hero. For love interest, rancher's daughters, schoolmarms and barroom maidens were overshadowed by young Latin women desired by dangerous men, where actresses like [[Nicoletta Machiavelli]] or [[Rosalba Neri]] carried on [[Marianne Koch]]'s role of Marisol in the Leone film. The terror of the villains against their defenseless victims became just as ruthless as in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', or more, and their brutalization of the hero when his treachery is disclosed became just as merciless, or more \u2013 just like the cunning used to secure the latter's retribution.\n\nIn the beginning some films mixed some of these new devices with the borrowed US Western devices typical for most of the 1963\u201364 Spaghetti Westerns. For example, in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Minnesota Clay]]'' (1964) that appeared two months after ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', an American style \"tragic gunfighter\" hero confronts two evil gangs, one Mexican and one Anglo, and (just as in ''A Fistful of Dollars'') the leader of the latter is the town sheriff.\n[[File:SERGIO LEONE.jpg|thumb|[[Sergio Leone]], one of the most representative directors of the genre. ]]\nIn the same director's ''[[Johnny Oro]]'' (1966) a traditional Western sheriff and a half-breed bounty killer are forced into an uneasy alliance when Mexican bandits and Native Americans together assault the town. In ''A Pistol for Ringo'' a traditional sheriff commissions a money-oriented hero played by [[Giuliano Gemma]] (with more pleasing manners than Eastwood's character) to infiltrate a gang of Mexican bandits whose leader is played typically by [[Fernando Sancho]].\n\n===''For a Few Dollars More'' and its followers===\nAfter 1965 when Leone's second Western ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' brought a larger box office success, the profession of bounty hunter became the choice of occupation of Spaghetti Western heroes in films like ''[[Arizona Colt]]'', ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1968 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'', ''[[Ten Thousand Dollars for a Massacre]]'', ''[[The Ugly Ones]]'', ''[[Dead Men Don't Count]]'' and ''[[Any Gun Can Play]]''. In ''[[The Great Silence]]'' and ''[[A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die (film)|A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die]]'', the heroes instead fight bounty killers. This was also the time when every other hero or villain in Spaghetti Westerns started carrying a musical watch, after its ingenious use in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.\n\nSpaghetti Westerns also began featuring a pair of different heroes.  In Leone's film Eastwood's character is an unshaven bounty hunter, dressed similarly to his character in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', who enters an unstable partnership with Colonel Mortimer ([[Lee Van Cleef]]), an older bounty killer who uses more sophisticated weaponry and wears a suit, and in the end turns out to also be an avenger. In the following years there was a deluge of Spaghetti Westerns with a pair of heroes with (most often) conflicting motives. Examples include: a lawman and an outlaw (''[[And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave]]''), an army officer and an outlaw (''[[Bury Them Deep]]''), an avenger and a (covert) army officer (''[[The Hills Run Red (1966 film)|The Hills Run Red]]''), an avenger and a (covert) guilty party (''Viva! Django'' aka ''[[W Django!]]''), an avenger and a con-man (''[[The Dirty Outlaws]]''), an outlaw posing as a sheriff and a bounty hunter (''Man With the Golden Pistol'' aka ''[[Doc, Hands of Steel]]'') and an outlaw posing as his twin and a bounty hunter posing as a sheriff (''[[A Few Dollars for Django]]'').\n\nThe theme of age in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', where the younger bounty killer learns valuable lessons from his more experienced colleague and eventually becomes his equal, is taken up in ''[[Day of Anger]]'' and ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]''. In both cases Lee Van Cleef carries on as the older hero versus Giuliano Gemma and John Phillip Law, respectively.\n\n===Zapata Westerns===\nOne variant of the hero pair was a revolutionary Mexican bandit and a mostly money-oriented American from the United States frontier. These films are sometimes called Zapata Westerns.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gaberscek |first=Carlo |title=Zapata Westerns: The Short Life of a Subgerne (1966\u20131972) |journal=Bilingual Review |volume=29 |issue=2/3 |year=2008 |pages=45\u201358 }} Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 25 April 2011.</ref> The first was [[Damiano Damiani]]'s ''[[A Bullet for the General]]'' and then followed [[Sergio Sollima]]'s trilogy: ''[[The Big Gundown]]'', ''[[Face to Face (1967 film)|Face to Face]]'' and ''[[Run, Man, Run]]''.\n\n[[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[The Mercenary (film)|The Mercenary]]'' and ''[[Compa\u00f1eros]]'' also belong here, as does ''[[Tepepa]]'' by [[Giulio Petroni]] \u2013 among others. Many of these films enjoyed both good takes at the box office and attention from critics. They are often interpreted as a leftist critique of the typical Hollywood handling of Mexican revolutions, and of imperialism in general.<ref>Frayling (2006) pp. 217\u201344, Fridlund (2006) pp.173\u201399</ref>\n\n===Betrayal stories===\n[[File:Gianni Garko and Cris Huerta - Uomo avvisato mezzo ammazzato... parola di Spirito Santo.png|thumb|right|200px|Gianni Garko and Cris Huerta in ''Uomo avvisato mezzo ammazzato... parola di Spirito Santo'' (1972)]]\nIn Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' there is still the scheme of a pair of heroes vs. a villain but it is somewhat relaxed, as here all three parties were driven by a money motive. In subsequent films like ''[[Any Gun Can Play]]'', ''[[One Dollar Too Many]]'' and ''[[Kill Them All and Come Back Alone]]'' several main characters repeatedly form alliances and betray each other for monetary gain.\n\n''[[Sabata (film)|Sabata]]'' and ''[[If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death]]'', directed by [[Gianfranco Parolini]], introduce into similar betrayal environments a kind of hero molded on the Mortimer character from ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', only without any vengeance motive and with more outrageous trick weapons. Fittingly enough Sabata is portrayed by [[Lee Van Cleef]] himself, while [[Gianni Garko|John Garko]] plays the very similar [[Sartana]] protagonist. Parolini made some more Sabata movies while [[Giuliano Carnimeo]] made a whole series of Sartana films with Garko.\n\n===''Django'' and the tragic heroes===\n\nBeside the first three Spaghetti Westerns by Leone, a most influential film was [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'' starring [[Franco Nero]]. The titular character is torn between several motives \u2013 money or revenge \u2013 and his choices bring misery to him and to a woman close to him. Indicative of this film's influence on the Spaghetti Western style, Django is the hero's name in a plenitude of subsequent westerns.<ref>Frayling (2006) pp.82 finds over thirty Django films, with renaming in French versions included. Fridlund (2006) pp. 98\u2013100 finds only 47 German titles containing the word \"Django\".</ref>\n\nEven though his character is not named Django, Franco Nero brings a similar ambience to ''[[Texas, Adios]]'' and ''[[Massacre Time]]'' where the hero must confront surprising and dangerous family relations. Similar \"prodigal son\"<ref>The term is used by Fridlund (2006) pp. 101\u201309</ref> stories followed, including ''[[Chuck Moll]]'', ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'', ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'', ''[[The Forgotten Pistolero]]'', ''[[One Thousand Dollars on the Black]]'', ''[[Johnny Hamlet]]'' and also ''[[Seven Dollars on the Red]]''.\n\nAnother type of wronged hero is set up and must clear himself from accusations. [[Giuliano Gemma]] starred in a series of successful films carrying this theme \u2013 ''[[Adi\u00f3s gringo]]'', ''[[For a Few Extra Dollars]]'', ''[[Long Days of Vengeance]]'', ''[[Wanted (1967 film)|Wanted]]'', and to some extent ''[[Blood for a Silver Dollar]]'' \u2013 where most often his character is called \"Gary\".\n\nThe wronged hero who becomes an avenger appears in many Spaghetti Westerns. Among the more commercially successful films with a hero dedicated to vengeance \u2013 ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', ''[[Today We Kill... Tomorrow We Die!]]'', ''[[A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die]]'', ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]'', ''[[Django, Prepare a Coffin]]'', ''[[The Deserter (1971 film)]]'', ''[[Hate for Hate]]'', ''[[Halleluja for Django]]'' \u2013 those with whom he cooperates typically have conflicting motivations.\n\n===Comedy Westerns===\n[[File:Lo chiamavano Trinit\u00e0.png|thumb|[[Bud Spencer]] and [[Terence Hill]] in ''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'' (1970)]]\nIn 1968, the wave of Spaghetti Westerns reached its crest, comprising one-third of the Italian film production, only to collapse to one-tenth in 1969. However, the considerable box office success of [[Enzo Barboni]]'s ''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'' and the pyramidal one of its follow-up ''[[Trinity Is Still My Name]]'' gave Italian filmmakers a new model to emulate. The main characters were played by [[Terence Hill]] and [[Bud Spencer]], who had already cooperated as hero pair in the \"old style\" Spaghetti Westerns ''[[God Forgives... I Don't!]]'', ''[[Boot Hill (film)|Boot Hill]]'' and ''[[Ace High (1968 film)|Ace High]]'' directed by [[Giuseppe Colizzi]]. The humor started in those movies already, with scenes with comedic fighting, but the Barboni films became burlesque comedies. They feature the quick but lazy Trinity (Hill) and his big, strong and irritable brother Bambino (Spencer).\n\nThe stories make fun of U.S. Western-style diligent farmers and Spaghetti Western-style bounty hunters. There was a wave of Trinity-inspired films with quick and strong heroes, the former kind often called Trinity or perhaps coming from \"a place called Trinity\", and with no or few killings. Because the two model stories contained religious pacifists to account for the absence of gunplay, all the successors contained religious groups or at least priests, sometimes as one of the heroes.<ref>Fridlund (2006) p.238-40</ref>\n\nThe music for the two Trinity westerns (composed by [[Franco Micalizzi]] and [[Guido & Maurizio De Angelis]], respectively) also reflected the change into a lighter and more sentimental mood. The Trinity-inspired films also adopted this style.<ref>Fridlund (2006) p.237,245</ref>\n\nSome critics deplore these post-Trinity films as a degeneration of the \"real\" Spaghetti Westerns, and that Hill's and Spencer's skilful use of body language was a hard act to follow. It is significant that the most successful of the post-Trinity films featured Hill (''[[Man of the East]]'', ''[[A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe]]''), Spencer (''[[It Can Be Done Amigo]]'') and a pair of Hill/Spencer look-alikes in ''Carambola''. Spaghetti Western old hand [[Franco Nero]] also worked in this subgenre with ''[[Cipolla Colt]]'' and [[Tomas Milian]] plays an outrageous \"quick\" bounty hunter modeled on [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s Little Tramp in ''[[Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?|Sometimes Life Is Hard \u2013 Right Providence?]]'' and ''Here We Go Again, Eh, Providence?''<ref>Fridlund (2006) p.237,248-51</ref>\n\n===Other notable films===\nSome movies that were not very successful at the box office<ref>''Catalogo Bolaffi del cinema italiano'', (Turin: Giulio Bolaffi Editore, 1967); Poppi, Roberto/Pecorari, Mario, ''Dizonario del Cinema Italiano, I Film del 1960 al 1969'', .'' I Film del 1970 al 1979'', (Gremese Editore 1992 and 1996 respectively); Associazione Generalo Italiana Dello Spettacolo (A.G.I.S.), ''Catalogo generale dei film italiani dal 1965 al 1978'', (Rome V edizione 1978).</ref> still earn a \"cult\" status in some segment of the audience because of certain exceptional features in story and/or presentation. One \"cult\" Spaghetti Western that also has drawn attention from critics is [[Giulio Questi]]'s ''[[Django Kill]]''. Other \"cult\" items are [[Cesare Canevari]]'s ''[[Matalo!]]'', [[Tony Anthony (actor)|Tony Anthony]]'s ''[[Blindman]]'' and [[Joaqu\u00edn Luis Romero Marchent]]'s ''Cut-Throats Nine'' (the latter among [[splatter film|gore film]] audiences).\n\nSpecial interest audiences might also nurture a cult of the \"Worst\", as exemplified in the interest for a director like [[Ed Wood]]. His Spaghetti Western equivalent would be the Western \u0153uvre of [[Demofilo Fidani]]. [[The Stranger (1995 film)|''The Stranger'' (1995)]] is essentially, the Woman with No Name, with a motorcycle instead of a horse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1064256-stranger |title=The Stranger |website=Rotten Tomatoes |date=2008-07-13 |accessdate=2014-01-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111000727/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1064256-stranger/ |archivedate=2014-01-11 }}</ref>\n\nThe few Spaghetti Westerns containing historical characters like [[Buffalo Bill]], [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Billy the Kid]] etc. mainly appear before ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' had put its mark on the genre. Likewise, and in contrast to the contemporary German Westerns, few films feature [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. When they appear they are more often portrayed as victims of discrimination than as dangerous foes. The only fairly successful Spaghetti Western with an Indian main character (played by [[Burt Reynolds]] in his only European Western outing) is [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Navajo Joe]]'', where the Indian village is wiped out by bandits during the first minutes, and the avenger hero spends the rest of the film dealing mostly with Anglos and Mexicans until the final showdown at an Indian burial ground.\n\nSeveral Spaghetti Westerns are inspired by classical myths and dramas. Titles like ''Fedra West'' (also called ''[[Ballad of a Bounty Hunter]]'') and ''[[Johnny Hamlet]]'' signify the connection to the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] and possibly the plays by [[Hippolytus (play)|Euripides]] and [[Ph\u00e8dre|Racine]] and the [[Hamlet|play]] by [[William Shakespeare]], respectively. The latter also inspired ''Dust in the Sun (1972)'', which follows its original more closely than Johnny Hamlet, where the hero survives. ''[[The Forgotten Pistolero]]'' is based on the vengeance of [[Orestes]]. There are similarities between the story of ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' and the last canto of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. ''[[Fury of Johnny Kid]]'' follows Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', but (again) with a different ending \u2013 the loving couple leave together while their families annihilate each other.\n\nThe story of ''A Fistful of Dollars'' was closely based on [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Kurosawa in fact sued Sergio Leone for plagiarism, and was compensated with the exclusive distribution rights to the movie in Japan, where its hero, Clint Eastwood, was already a huge star due to the popularity of the TV series ''Rawhide'': Leone would have done far better financially by obtaining Kurosawa's advance permission to use ''Yojimbo'''s script.<ref>Clint: The Life and Legend. Patrick McGilligan. OR Books (2015). {{ISBN|978-1939293961}}.</ref><ref>An agreement was signed to compensate the authors of ''Yojimbo'' for the resemblance. See Frayling (2000) pp. 148\u201349.</ref> ''[[Requiem for a Gringo]]'' shows many traces from another well-known Japanese film, [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s ''[[Harakiri (1962 film)|Harakiri]]''. When Asian [[martial arts film]]s started to draw crowds in European cinema houses, the producers of Spaghetti Westerns tried to hang on, this time not by adapting story-lines but rather by directly including martial arts in the films, performed by Eastern actors \u2013 for example Chen Lee in ''[[My Name Is Shanghai Joe]]'' or [[Lo Lieh]] teaming up with [[Lee Van Cleef]] in ''[[The Stranger and the Gunfighter]]''.\n\nSome Italian Western films were made as vehicles for musical stars, like [[Ferdinando Baldi]]'s ''Rita of the West'' featuring [[Rita Pavone]] and [[Terence Hill]]. In non-singing roles were [[Ringo Starr]] as a villain in ''[[Blindman]]'' and French rock 'n' roll veteran [[Johnny Hallyday]] as the gunfighter/avenger hero in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Gli specialisti|The Specialists]]''.\n\nA celebrity from another sphere of culture is Italian author/film director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], who plays a revolutionary man of the church in ''[[Requiescant]]''. This film concerns oppression of poor Mexicans by rich Anglos and ends on a call for arms but it does not fit easily as a [[Zapata Western]]. The same can be said for ''[[The Price of Power]]'', a political allegory where an American president is assassinated in Dallas by a conspiracy of Southern racists who frame an innocent Afro-American. They are opposed by an unstable partnership between a whistle-blower ([[Giuliano Gemma]]) and a political aide.\n\nThough the Spaghetti Westerns from ''A Fistful of Dollars'' and on featured more violence and killings than earlier American Western films, they generally shared the parental genre's restrictive attitude toward explicit sexuality. However, in response to the growing commercial success of various shades of sex films, there was a greater exposure of naked skin in some Spaghetti Westerns, among others ''[[Dead Men Ride]]'' and ''[[Heads or Tails (1969 film)]]''. In the former and partly the latter, the sex scenes feature coercion and violence against women.\n\nEven though it is hinted at in some films, like ''[[Django Kill]]'' and ''[[Requiescant]]'', open homosexuality plays a marginal part in Spaghetti Westerns. The exception is [[Giorgio Capitani]]'s ''[[The Ruthless Four]]'' \u2013 in effect a gay version of [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' \u2013 where the explicit homosexual relation between two of its male main characters and some gay cueing scenes are embedded with other forms of man-to-man relations through the story.<ref>Fridlund (2006) pp. 216-17</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nSpaghetti Westerns have left their mark on popular culture, strongly influencing numerous works produced outside of Italy.\n\nIn later years there were \"return of stories\", ''[[Django 2]]'' with [[Franco Nero]] and ''[[Troublemakers (1994 film)|Troublemakers]]'' with [[Terence Hill]] and [[Bud Spencer]].\n\nClint Eastwood's first American Western film, ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968), incorporates elements of Spaghetti Westerns.\n\nThe [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) was often referred to as a \"[[Curry]] Western\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/689776/weekly-classics-bollywoods-ultimate-curry-western|title=Weekly Classics: Bollywood\u2019s Curry Western|publisher=dawn.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605053244/http://www.dawn.com/news/689776/weekly-classics-bollywoods-ultimate-curry-western|archivedate=2014-06-05}}</ref> A more accurate genre label for the film is the \"[[Dacoit Western]]\", as it combined the conventions of Indian [[dacoit film]]s such as ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957) and ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' (1961) with that of Spaghetti Westerns.

He betrays and plays the gangs against one another in order to make money. Then he uses his cunning and exceptional weapons skill to assist a family threatened by both gangs. His treachery is exposed and he is severely beaten, but in the end, he defeats the remaining gang. The interaction in this story between cunning and irony (the tricks, deceits, unexpected actions and sarcasm of the hero) on the one hand, and pathos (terror and brutality against defenseless people and against the hero after his double-cross has been revealed) on the other, was aspired to and sometimes attained by the imitations that soon flooded the cinemas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=This seems to be a summary of a specific film and shows us nothing about how it's a common element to spaghetti westerns}}\n\nItalian cinema often borrowed from other films without regard for infringement, and Leone famously borrowed the plot for ''A Fistful of Dollars'', receiving a letter from Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]] congratulating him on making \"...a very fine film.

In the years following, the use of cunning and irony became more prominent. This was seen in Leone's next two Westerns, with their emphasis on unstable partnerships.{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=This is about a specific director and pair of films and fails to show how this applies to spaghetti westerns as a genre}} In the last phase of the Spaghetti Western, with the Trinity films, the Leone legacy had been transformed almost beyond recognition, as terror and deadly violence gave way to harmless brawling and low comedy.\n\n==Filming locations==\nMost Spaghetti Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low budgets and shot at [[Cinecitt\u00e0|Cinecitt\u00e0 studios]] and various locations around southern Italy and Spain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moliterno|first1=Gino|title=Historical Dictionaries of Literature and the Arts 28|date=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=338\u2013339|chapter=Western All'Italiana}}</ref> Many of the stories take place in the dry landscapes of the [[American Southwest]] and Northern Mexico, hence common filming locations were the [[Tabernas Desert]] and the [[Cabo de Gata-N\u00edjar Natural Park]], an area of volcanic origin known for its wide sandy beaches, both of which are in the [[Province of Almer\u00eda]] in southeastern [[Spain]].

The genre most identifiably American, the Western, seemed to be evolving into a new, rougher form. For many critics, [[Sergio Leone]]'s films were part of the problem. Leone's ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (1964\u20131966) was not the beginning of the \"Spaghetti Western\" cycle in Italy, but for some Americans Leone's films represented the true beginning of the Italian invasion of an American genre.\n\n[[Christopher Frayling]], in his noted book on the Italian Western, describes American critical reception of the Spaghetti Western cycle as, to \"a large extent, confined to a sterile debate about the 'cultural roots' of the American/Hollywood Western.\"<ref>Frayling (2006) pp. 121\u2013137</ref> He remarks that few critics dared admit that they were, in fact, \"bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre.\"\n\n[[Pauline Kael]], he notes, was willing to acknowledge this critical ennui and thus appreciate how a film such as [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961) \"could exploit the conventions of the Western genre, while debunking its morality.\" Frayling and other film scholars such as Bondanella argue that this revisionism was the key to Leone's success and, to some degree, to that of the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole.<ref>Frayling (2006) pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\n==Rise and fall==\n\n===European Westerns from the beginning===\nEuropean Westerns are as old as filmmaking itself. The [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] made their first public screening of films in 1895 and already in 1896 Gabriel Veyre shot ''Repas d'Indien'' (\"Indian Banquet\") for them.

An Italian critic has compared these comedies to American [[Bob Hope]] vehicles.<ref>Mario Molinari, ''Prima che arrivassero gli \u2019spaghetti\u2019'' Segnocinema 22 (March 1986), Vicenza</ref>\n\nThe first American-British western filmed in Spain was ''[[The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw]]'' (1958), directed by [[Raoul Walsh]]. It was followed in 1961 by ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|Savage Guns]]'', a British-Spanish western, again filmed in Spain. This marked the beginning of Spain as a suitable film shooting location for any kind of European western.\n\nIn 1963, three non-comedy Italo-Spanish westerns were produced: ''[[Gunfight at Red Sands]]'', ''[[Implacable Three]]'' and ''[[Gunfight at High Noon]]''. In 1961 an Italian company co-produced the French ''Taste of Violence'', with a Mexican Revolution theme.\n\nIn 1965, [[Bruno Bozzetto]] released his [[Traditional animation|traditionally animated]] feature film ''[[West and Soda]]'', a Western [[parody]] with a marked Spaghetti Western-theme; despite having been released a year after Sergio Leone's seminal Spaghetti Western ''A Fistful of Dollars'', development of ''West and Soda'' actually began a year earlier than ''Fistful'''s and lasted longer, mainly because of the use of more time-demanding animation over regular acting. For this reason, Bozzetto himself claims to have invented the Spaghetti Western genre.<ref>{{cite news |last=Iondini |first=Massimo |date=3 October 2015 |title=Bozzetto: \u00abCos\u00ec ho inventato lo spaghetti western\u00bb |trans-title=Bozzetto: \u00abSo I invented spaghetti western\u00bb |url=https://www.avvenire.it/agora/pagine/bozzetto-intervista |language=Italian |work=[[Avvenire]] |location=Milan |access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line between Spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns (or other Westerns in general) one cannot say which one of the films mentioned so far was the first Spaghetti Western. However, 1964 saw the breakthrough of this genre, with more than twenty productions or co-productions from Italian companies, and more than half a dozen Westerns by Spanish or Spanish/American companies. Furthermore, by far the most commercially successful of this lot was Sergio Leone's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' whose innovations in cinematic style, music, acting and story decided the future for the genre.\n\n===Impact of ''A Fistful of Dollars''===\nThe Spaghetti Western was born, flourished and faded in a highly commercial production environment. The Italian \"low\" popular film production was usually low-budget and low-profit, and the easiest way to success was imitating a proven success.<ref>Frayling (2006) pp. 68\u2013102</ref> When the typically low-budget production ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' turned into a remarkable box office success, the industry eagerly lapped up its innovations. Most succeeding Spaghetti Westerns tried to get a ragged, laconic hero with superhuman weapon skill, preferably one who looked like [[Clint Eastwood]]: [[Franco Nero]], [[Giuliano Gemma]], [[Gianni Garko|John Garko]] and [[Terence Hill]] started out that way; [[Anthony Steffen]] and others stayed that way all their Spaghetti Western career.\n\nWhoever the hero was, he would join an outlaw gang to further his own secret agenda, like in ''[[A Pistol for Ringo]]'', ''[[Blood for a Silver Dollar]]'', ''[[Vengeance Is a Dish Served Cold]]'', ''[[Renegade Riders]]'' and others, while ''[[Beyond the Law (1968 Italian film)|Beyond the Law]]'' instead has a bandit infiltrate society and become a sheriff. There would be a flamboyant Mexican bandit ([[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] from ''A Fistful of Dollars'', otherwise [[Tomas Milian]] or most often [[Fernando Sancho]]) and a grumpy old man \u2013 more often than not an undertaker, to serve as sidekick for the hero. For love interest, rancher's daughters, schoolmarms and barroom maidens were overshadowed by young Latin women desired by dangerous men, where actresses like [[Nicoletta Machiavelli]] or [[Rosalba Neri]] carried on [[Marianne Koch]]'s role of Marisol in the Leone film. The terror of the villains against their defenseless victims became just as ruthless as in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', or more, and their brutalization of the hero when his treachery is disclosed became just as merciless, or more \u2013 just like the cunning used to secure the latter's retribution.\n\nIn the beginning some films mixed some of these new devices with the borrowed US Western devices typical for most of the 1963\u201364 Spaghetti Westerns. For example, in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Minnesota Clay]]'' (1964) that appeared two months after ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', an American style \"tragic gunfighter\" hero confronts two evil gangs, one Mexican and one Anglo, and (just as in ''A Fistful of Dollars'') the leader of the latter is the town sheriff.\n[[File:SERGIO LEONE.jpg|thumb|[[Sergio Leone]], one of the most representative directors of the genre. ]]\nIn the same director's ''[[Johnny Oro]]'' (1966) a traditional Western sheriff and a half-breed bounty killer are forced into an uneasy alliance when Mexican bandits and Native Americans together assault the town. In ''A Pistol for Ringo'' a traditional sheriff commissions a money-oriented hero played by [[Giuliano Gemma]] (with more pleasing manners than Eastwood's character) to infiltrate a gang of Mexican bandits whose leader is played typically by [[Fernando Sancho]].\n\n===''For a Few Dollars More'' and its followers===\nAfter 1965 when Leone's second Western ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' brought a larger box office success, the profession of bounty hunter became the choice of occupation of Spaghetti Western heroes in films like ''[[Arizona Colt]]'', ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1968 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'', ''[[Ten Thousand Dollars for a Massacre]]'', ''[[The Ugly Ones]]'', ''[[Dead Men Don't Count]]'' and ''[[Any Gun Can Play]]''. In ''[[The Great Silence]]'' and ''[[A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die (film)|A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die]]'', the heroes instead fight bounty killers. This was also the time when every other hero or villain in Spaghetti Westerns started carrying a musical watch, after its ingenious use in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.\n\nSpaghetti Westerns also began featuring a pair of different heroes.  In Leone's film Eastwood's character is an unshaven bounty hunter, dressed similarly to his character in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', who enters an unstable partnership with Colonel Mortimer ([[Lee Van Cleef]]), an older bounty killer who uses more sophisticated weaponry and wears a suit, and in the end turns out to also be an avenger. In the following years there was a deluge of Spaghetti Westerns with a pair of heroes with (most often) conflicting motives. Examples include: a lawman and an outlaw (''[[And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave]]''), an army officer and an outlaw (''[[Bury Them Deep]]''), an avenger and a (covert) army officer (''[[The Hills Run Red (1966 film)|The Hills Run Red]]''), an avenger and a (covert) guilty party (''Viva! Django'' aka ''[[W Django!]]''), an avenger and a con-man (''[[The Dirty Outlaws]]''), an outlaw posing as a sheriff and a bounty hunter (''Man With the Golden Pistol'' aka ''[[Doc, Hands of Steel]]'') and an outlaw posing as his twin and a bounty hunter posing as a sheriff (''[[A Few Dollars for Django]]'').\n\nThe theme of age in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', where the younger bounty killer learns valuable lessons from his more experienced colleague and eventually becomes his equal, is taken up in ''[[Day of Anger]]'' and ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]''. In both cases Lee Van Cleef carries on as the older hero versus Giuliano Gemma and John Phillip Law, respectively.\n\n===Zapata Westerns===\nOne variant of the hero pair was a revolutionary Mexican bandit and a mostly money-oriented American from the United States frontier. These films are sometimes called Zapata Westerns.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gaberscek |first=Carlo |title=Zapata Westerns: The Short Life of a Subgerne (1966\u20131972) |journal=Bilingual Review |volume=29 |issue=2/3 |year=2008 |pages=45\u201358 }} Academic Search Premier.

Many of these films enjoyed both good takes at the box office and attention from critics. They are often interpreted as a leftist critique of the typical Hollywood handling of Mexican revolutions, and of imperialism in general.<ref>Frayling (2006) pp. 217\u201344, Fridlund (2006) pp.173\u201399</ref>\n\n===Betrayal stories===\n[[File:Gianni Garko and Cris Huerta - Uomo avvisato mezzo ammazzato... parola di Spirito Santo.png|thumb|right|200px|Gianni Garko and Cris Huerta in ''Uomo avvisato mezzo ammazzato... parola di Spirito Santo'' (1972)]]\nIn Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' there is still the scheme of a pair of heroes vs. a villain but it is somewhat relaxed, as here all three parties were driven by a money motive. In subsequent films like ''[[Any Gun Can Play]]'', ''[[One Dollar Too Many]]'' and ''[[Kill Them All and Come Back Alone]]'' several main characters repeatedly form alliances and betray each other for monetary gain.\n\n''[[Sabata (film)|Sabata]]'' and ''[[If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death]]'', directed by [[Gianfranco Parolini]], introduce into similar betrayal environments a kind of hero molded on the Mortimer character from ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', only without any vengeance motive and with more outrageous trick weapons. Fittingly enough Sabata is portrayed by [[Lee Van Cleef]] himself, while [[Gianni Garko|John Garko]] plays the very similar [[Sartana]] protagonist. Parolini made some more Sabata movies while [[Giuliano Carnimeo]] made a whole series of Sartana films with Garko.\n\n===''Django'' and the tragic heroes===\n\nBeside the first three Spaghetti Westerns by Leone, a most influential film was [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'' starring [[Franco Nero]]. The titular character is torn between several motives \u2013 money or revenge \u2013 and his choices bring misery to him and to a woman close to him. Indicative of this film's influence on the Spaghetti Western style, Django is the hero's name in a plenitude of subsequent westerns.<ref>Frayling (2006) pp.82 finds over thirty Django films, with renaming in French versions included. Fridlund (2006) pp. 98\u2013100 finds only 47 German titles containing the word \"Django\".</ref>\n\nEven though his character is not named Django, Franco Nero brings a similar ambience to ''[[Texas, Adios]]'' and ''[[Massacre Time]]'' where the hero must confront surprising and dangerous family relations. Similar \"prodigal son\"<ref>The term is used by Fridlund (2006) pp. 101\u201309</ref> stories followed, including ''[[Chuck Moll]]'', ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'', ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'', ''[[The Forgotten Pistolero]]'', ''[[One Thousand Dollars on the Black]]'', ''[[Johnny Hamlet]]'' and also ''[[Seven Dollars on the Red]]''.\n\nAnother type of wronged hero is set up and must clear himself from accusations. [[Giuliano Gemma]] starred in a series of successful films carrying this theme \u2013 ''[[Adi\u00f3s gringo]]'', ''[[For a Few Extra Dollars]]'', ''[[Long Days of Vengeance]]'', ''[[Wanted (1967 film)|Wanted]]'', and to some extent ''[[Blood for a Silver Dollar]]'' \u2013 where most often his character is called \"Gary\".\n\nThe wronged hero who becomes an avenger appears in many Spaghetti Westerns. Among the more commercially successful films with a hero dedicated to vengeance \u2013 ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', ''[[Today We Kill... Tomorrow We Die!]]'', ''[[A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die]]'', ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]'', ''[[Django, Prepare a Coffin]]'', ''[[The Deserter (1971 film)]]'', ''[[Hate for Hate]]'', ''[[Halleluja for Django]]'' \u2013 those with whom he cooperates typically have conflicting motivations.\n\n===Comedy Westerns===\n[[File:Lo chiamavano Trinit\u00e0.png|thumb|[[Bud Spencer]] and [[Terence Hill]] in ''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'' (1970)]]\nIn 1968, the wave of Spaghetti Westerns reached its crest, comprising one-third of the Italian film production, only to collapse to one-tenth in 1969. However, the considerable box office success of [[Enzo Barboni]]'s ''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'' and the pyramidal one of its follow-up ''[[Trinity Is Still My Name]]'' gave Italian filmmakers a new model to emulate. The main characters were played by [[Terence Hill]] and [[Bud Spencer]], who had already cooperated as hero pair in the \"old style\" Spaghetti Westerns ''[[God Forgives... I Don't!]]'', ''[[Boot Hill (film)|Boot Hill]]'' and ''[[Ace High (1968 film)|Ace High]]'' directed by [[Giuseppe Colizzi]]. The humor started in those movies already, with scenes with comedic fighting, but the Barboni films became burlesque comedies. They feature the quick but lazy Trinity (Hill) and his big, strong and irritable brother Bambino (Spencer).\n\nThe stories make fun of U.S. Western-style diligent farmers and Spaghetti Western-style bounty hunters. There was a wave of Trinity-inspired films with quick and strong heroes, the former kind often called Trinity or perhaps coming from \"a place called Trinity\", and with no or few killings. Because the two model stories contained religious pacifists to account for the absence of gunplay, all the successors contained religious groups or at least priests, sometimes as one of the heroes.<ref>Fridlund (2006) p.238-40</ref>\n\nThe music for the two Trinity westerns (composed by [[Franco Micalizzi]] and [[Guido & Maurizio De Angelis]], respectively) also reflected the change into a lighter and more sentimental mood. The Trinity-inspired films also adopted this style.<ref>Fridlund (2006) p.237,245</ref>\n\nSome critics deplore these post-Trinity films as a degeneration of the \"real\" Spaghetti Westerns, and that Hill's and Spencer's skilful use of body language was a hard act to follow. It is significant that the most successful of the post-Trinity films featured Hill (''[[Man of the East]]'', ''[[A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe]]''), Spencer (''[[It Can Be Done Amigo]]'') and a pair of Hill/Spencer look-alikes in ''Carambola''. Spaghetti Western old hand [[Franco Nero]] also worked in this subgenre with ''[[Cipolla Colt]]'' and [[Tomas Milian]] plays an outrageous \"quick\" bounty hunter modeled on [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s Little Tramp in ''[[Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?|Sometimes Life Is Hard \u2013 Right Providence?]]'' and ''Here We Go Again, Eh, Providence?''<ref>Fridlund (2006) p.237,248-51</ref>\n\n===Other notable films===\nSome movies that were not very successful at the box office<ref>''Catalogo Bolaffi del cinema italiano'', (Turin: Giulio Bolaffi Editore, 1967); Poppi, Roberto/Pecorari, Mario, ''Dizonario del Cinema Italiano, I Film del 1960 al 1969'', .'' I Film del 1970 al 1979'', (Gremese Editore 1992 and 1996 respectively); Associazione Generalo Italiana Dello Spettacolo (A.G.I.S.), ''Catalogo generale dei film italiani dal 1965 al 1978'', (Rome V edizione 1978).</ref> still earn a \"cult\" status in some segment of the audience because of certain exceptional features in story and/or presentation. One \"cult\" Spaghetti Western that also has drawn attention from critics is [[Giulio Questi]]'s ''[[Django Kill]]''. Other \"cult\" items are [[Cesare Canevari]]'s ''[[Matalo!]]'', [[Tony Anthony (actor)|Tony Anthony]]'s ''[[Blindman]]'' and [[Joaqu\u00edn Luis Romero Marchent]]'s ''Cut-Throats Nine'' (the latter among [[splatter film|gore film]] audiences).\n\nSpecial interest audiences might also nurture a cult of the \"Worst\", as exemplified in the interest for a director like [[Ed Wood]]. His Spaghetti Western equivalent would be the Western \u0153uvre of [[Demofilo Fidani]]. [[The Stranger (1995 film)|''The Stranger'' (1995)]] is essentially, the Woman with No Name, with a motorcycle instead of a horse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1064256-stranger |title=The Stranger |website=Rotten Tomatoes |date=2008-07-13 |accessdate=2014-01-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111000727/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1064256-stranger/ |archivedate=2014-01-11 }}</ref>\n\nThe few Spaghetti Westerns containing historical characters like [[Buffalo Bill]], [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Billy the Kid]] etc. mainly appear before ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' had put its mark on the genre. Likewise, and in contrast to the contemporary German Westerns, few films feature [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. When they appear they are more often portrayed as victims of discrimination than as dangerous foes. The only fairly successful Spaghetti Western with an Indian main character (played by [[Burt Reynolds]] in his only European Western outing) is [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Navajo Joe]]'', where the Indian village is wiped out by bandits during the first minutes, and the avenger hero spends the rest of the film dealing mostly with Anglos and Mexicans until the final showdown at an Indian burial ground.\n\nSeveral Spaghetti Westerns are inspired by classical myths and dramas. Titles like ''Fedra West'' (also called ''[[Ballad of a Bounty Hunter]]'') and ''[[Johnny Hamlet]]'' signify the connection to the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] and possibly the plays by [[Hippolytus (play)|Euripides]] and [[Ph\u00e8dre|Racine]] and the [[Hamlet|play]] by [[William Shakespeare]], respectively. The latter also inspired ''Dust in the Sun (1972)'', which follows its original more closely than Johnny Hamlet, where the hero survives. ''[[The Forgotten Pistolero]]'' is based on the vengeance of [[Orestes]]. There are similarities between the story of ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' and the last canto of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. ''[[Fury of Johnny Kid]]'' follows Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', but (again) with a different ending \u2013 the loving couple leave together while their families annihilate each other.\n\nThe story of ''A Fistful of Dollars'' was closely based on [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Kurosawa in fact sued Sergio Leone for plagiarism, and was compensated with the exclusive distribution rights to the movie in Japan, where its hero, Clint Eastwood, was already a huge star due to the popularity of the TV series ''Rawhide'': Leone would have done far better financially by obtaining Kurosawa's advance permission to use ''Yojimbo'''s script.<ref>Clint: The Life and Legend. Patrick McGilligan. OR Books (2015). {{ISBN|978-1939293961}}.</ref><ref>An agreement was signed to compensate the authors of ''Yojimbo'' for the resemblance. See Frayling (2000) pp. 148\u201349.</ref> ''[[Requiem for a Gringo]]'' shows many traces from another well-known Japanese film, [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s ''[[Harakiri (1962 film)|Harakiri]]''. When Asian [[martial arts film]]s started to draw crowds in European cinema houses, the producers of Spaghetti Westerns tried to hang on, this time not by adapting story-lines but rather by directly including martial arts in the films, performed by Eastern actors \u2013 for example Chen Lee in ''[[My Name Is Shanghai Joe]]'' or [[Lo Lieh]] teaming up with [[Lee Van Cleef]] in ''[[The Stranger and the Gunfighter]]''.\n\nSome Italian Western films were made as vehicles for musical stars, like [[Ferdinando Baldi]]'s ''Rita of the West'' featuring [[Rita Pavone]] and [[Terence Hill]]. In non-singing roles were [[Ringo Starr]] as a villain in ''[[Blindman]]'' and French rock 'n' roll veteran [[Johnny Hallyday]] as the gunfighter/avenger hero in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Gli specialisti|The Specialists]]''.\n\nA celebrity from another sphere of culture is Italian author/film director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], who plays a revolutionary man of the church in ''[[Requiescant]]''. This film concerns oppression of poor Mexicans by rich Anglos and ends on a call for arms but it does not fit easily as a [[Zapata Western]]. The same can be said for ''[[The Price of Power]]'', a political allegory where an American president is assassinated in Dallas by a conspiracy of Southern racists who frame an innocent Afro-American. They are opposed by an unstable partnership between a whistle-blower ([[Giuliano Gemma]]) and a political aide.\n\nThough the Spaghetti Westerns from ''A Fistful of Dollars'' and on featured more violence and killings than earlier American Western films, they generally shared the parental genre's restrictive attitude toward explicit sexuality. However, in response to the growing commercial success of various shades of sex films, there was a greater exposure of naked skin in some Spaghetti Westerns, among others ''[[Dead Men Ride]]'' and ''[[Heads or Tails (1969 film)]]''. In the former and partly the latter, the sex scenes feature coercion and violence against women.\n\nEven though it is hinted at in some films, like ''[[Django Kill]]'' and ''[[Requiescant]]'', open homosexuality plays a marginal part in Spaghetti Westerns. The exception is [[Giorgio Capitani]]'s ''[[The Ruthless Four]]'' \u2013 in effect a gay version of [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' \u2013 where the explicit homosexual relation between two of its male main characters and some gay cueing scenes are embedded with other forms of man-to-man relations through the story.<ref>Fridlund (2006) pp. 216-17</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nSpaghetti Westerns have left their mark on popular culture, strongly influencing numerous works produced outside of Italy.\n\nIn later years there were \"return of stories\", ''[[Django 2]]'' with [[Franco Nero]] and ''[[Troublemakers (1994 film)|Troublemakers]]'' with [[Terence Hill]] and [[Bud Spencer]].\n\nClint Eastwood's first American Western film, ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968), incorporates elements of Spaghetti Westerns.\n\nThe [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) was often referred to as a \"[[Curry]] Western\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/689776/weekly-classics-bollywoods-ultimate-curry-western|title=Weekly Classics: Bollywood\u2019s Curry Western|publisher=dawn.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605053244/http://www.dawn.com/news/689776/weekly-classics-bollywoods-ultimate-curry-western|archivedate=2014-06-05}}</ref> A more accurate genre label for the film is the \"[[Dacoit Western]]\", as it combined the conventions of Indian [[dacoit film]]s such as ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957) and ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' (1961) with that of Spaghetti Westerns.
