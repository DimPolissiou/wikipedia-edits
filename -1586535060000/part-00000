The interior of Coup\u00e9 models featured a then unusual central tachometer placement &mdash; by itself, directly in front of the driver.\n\nThe ''Alfetta'' name, which means \"little Alfa\" in Italian, derived from the nickname of the [[Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta|Alfa Romeo Tipo 159 Alfetta]], a successful [[Formula One car]] which in its last (1951) iteration paired a [[transaxle]] layout to [[De Dion tube]] rear suspension &mdash; like its modern namesake.<ref name=\"autocar 1974\">{{cite journal |title=Auto test\u2014Alfa Romeo Alfetta |magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |date=20 April 1974 |pages=20\u201325}}</ref><ref name=\"motor sport 1974\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/june-1974/50/road-test-alfa-romeo-alfetta |title=The Alfa Romeo Alfetta |author=C.

Clutch and transmission were housed at the rear of the car, together with the differential for a more balanced weight distribution, as used on the Alfetta 158/159 Grand Prix cars. The suspension relied on [[double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]]s and [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bar]]s at the front and a [[De Dion tube]] at the rear. When leaving the factory all Alfettas were originally fitted with [[Pirelli Cinturato]] 165HR14 tyres (CA67).\n\nThe rear de Dion transaxle found on the Alfetta and derivatives- GTV, 90 and 75- provided these cars with excellent weight distribution. The handling advantages were noted in [http://driventowrite.com/2013/11/02/1973-alfa-romeo-alfetta-review/ contemporary reviews].<ref>Cars and Vehicle Magazine, May 1973</ref> The transaxle design, in combination with a Watt's parallelogram linkage, inboard rear brakes and a well-located [[De Dion tube|de Dion]] rear suspension, resulted in balanced traction and handling. The front suspension design was unusual in that it incorporated independent longitudinal torsion bar springs acting directly onto the lower wishbones and with separate dampers.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

The 1600 model, with single headlamps as in Europe, arrived to complement the 1800 and 2000 in mid-1976. Beginning in October 1982, the Quadrifoglio Oro model was marketed as the '''Alfa Romeo 159i''', with the fuel injected two liter engine.<ref name=\"TAM85\">{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor-last=Mastrostefano |editor-first=Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=34 |language=IT |location=Milan |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n====North American market====\nThe four-door Alfetta was sold in the United States from 1975 through 1977 under the name \"'''Alfetta Sedan'''\".

Introduced in 1974, similarly to the [[saloon (car)|saloon]] it was initially available only with the 1.8-litre (1,779&nbsp;cc) version of the Alfa DOHC four.<ref name=\"carsfromitaly.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.carsfromitaly.net/alfaromeo/index.html |title=Alfa Romeo Alfetta & GTV |website=carsfromitaly.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731140300/http://carsfromitaly.net/alfaromeo/index.html |archivedate=31 July 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> These engines featured a chain driven 8-valve twin overhead cam cylinder head of cross-flow design. For 1976, with the final phasing out of the earlier [[Alfa Romeo 105/115 Series Coup\u00e9s|105 Series]] (GT&nbsp;1300 Junior and GT&nbsp;1600 Junior and 2000&nbsp;GTV), the Alfetta GT became a range; the 1.8 was discontinued in favour of the 1.6-litre (1,570&nbsp;cc) '''Alfetta GT&nbsp;1.6''' and 2.0-litre (1,962&nbsp;cc) '''Alfetta GTV&nbsp;2.0'''. At the same time some updates were introduced, such as a new front [[Grille (car)|grille]] with horizontal slats and two series of vents beneath it. The GTV was distinguished from the 1.6 version by twin chrome whiskers in the grille and GTV scripts carved in the ventilation vents on the [[C-pillar]].\n\nIn 1979, some minor revisions, including a revised engine with new camshaft profiles and a change to mechanical-and-vacuum ignition advance, saw the 2.0-litre redesignated the Alfetta GTV&nbsp;2000L. [[Autodelta]] also introduced a limited edition 2.0-litre [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] model, named '''Turbodelta''', of which 400 were made for [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] [[homologation]]. This version used a [[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] turbocharger which pushed power up to {{Convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The car also received a modified suspension layout. This was the first Italian petrol production car with a turbocharger.\nThe styling of the GTV, while distinctive, can be seen to share many design features derived from the [[Alfa Romeo Montreal|Montreal]] supercar, as translated down to a simpler and thus more marketable vehicle. Examples of this are the bonnet line, which while briefer, still has 'scallops' for the headlights, and the tail light clusters which resemble those of the Montreal. The door shape is similar, and in a sharing of parts, both vehicles employ the same door handles.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Alfa Romeo (3757437527).jpg|Alfetta GTV 2.0\nFile:Alfa Romeo GTV Coup\u00e9 rear 20070516.jpg|Rear view of an Alfetta GT 1.6\nFile:Alfa GTV IMG 8262.jpg|Alfetta GTV C-pillar logo\n</gallery>\n\n===GTV 2.0 and GTV6===\nIn 1980, the GT received a restyling. Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, C-pillar vents and side skirts; all bright stainless steel save for the Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as '''Alfa Romeo GTV&nbsp;2.0'''; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coup\u00e9 retained its type designation of 11636 for left-hand drive and 11637 for right-hand drive. 15-inch disc-shaped [[alloy wheel]]s were now standard, as opposed to the earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy units.\n\nLater in the same year, the '''GTV&nbsp;6 2.5''', a version of the GTV with the SOHC [[V6 engine|V6]] 2.5&nbsp;L engine from the [[Alfa Romeo Alfa 6]] luxury saloon, was released. As a result, the hood received a bulge to clear the top of the intake and became its most pronounced feature. With Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection instead of the six downdraught [[Dell'Orto]] carburettors in the early Alfa 6 installation, the V6 was much easier to start and retained its state of tune much better. The fuel injected engine was also able to meet the strict emissions standards introduced in Switzerland (shared with Sweden) for 1983.<ref name=TV218244>{{cite magazine | title = Alfa med ny sp\u00e4nst | trans-title = Alfa with new vitality | ref = TVn21 | language = Swedish | magazine = [[Teknikens V\u00e4rld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 44 | date = 1982-10-06 | issue = 21 | volume = 34 | first = Dag E. | last = Hogsten }}</ref> The V6 received rave reviews from the motoring press, which had previously lambasted the same engine in the Alfa 6 because of the carburettor problems. It found its true home in the GTV&nbsp;6's gran turismo body where it could stretch its legs better than in the less sporting Alfa 6 saloon. The fuel injection installation eventually made it into the second series of the Alfa 6 as well. The GTV went through a number of revisions, including new [[gear ratio]]s and an updated interior in 1984.\n\nThe GTV&nbsp;6 was also a fairly successful racing car; the 116 type chassis developed for racing since its first outing in the 1974 San Martino di Castrozza rallye. The racing successes included winning the [[European Touring Car Championship]] an unprecedented four years in succession (1982\u201385),<ref name=\"petrolicious.com\">[https://petrolicious.com/articles/the-alfa-romeo-gtv6-is-pornography-for-engineers Why The Alfa Romeo GTV6 Is Pornography For Engineers] ''Petrolicious'', accessdate: 25 October 2018</ref> the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in 1983 driven by [[Andy Rouse]], as well as many other racing and rallying competitions in national championships as France and Italy.<ref name=\"petrolicious.com\"/> A Group A GTV&nbsp;6 driven by French driver Yves Loubet won its class four years in succession from 1983 to 1986 in the Tour de Corse round of the World Rally Championship.<ref name=\"petrolicious.com\"/>\n\nThe GTV&nbsp;6 Grand-Prix was introduced in 1985 in some European markets (most notably Switzerland and Germany).

The GTV6 2.5 arrived in 1982; while Brits was gearing up to assemble them 100 fully built-up cars were brought in from Italy. These received a numbered plaque on the front fender, just ahead of the door. South Africa was one of two markets to have a turbocharged GTV&nbsp;6, with a [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] turbocharger and a NACA intake. An estimated 750 were assembled before all production ceased in 1986. The South African market also introduced the 3.0&nbsp;L GTV-6, predating the international debut of the factory's 3.0&nbsp;L engine in 1987. 212 were built in South Africa for racing homologation.

The Balocco was available only in red with sunroof and black interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel and red piping on the seats. There were also two green Quadrifoglio badges fixed on the rear quarter trim pieces above a badge with the \"Balocco SE\" designation. A plaque inset in the glove box door designated the number of the car out of the series of 350 (XXX of 350). Later there was the GTV&nbsp;6 2.5 Maratona, of which only 150 were built. The Maratona model included a more aggressive aerodynamic trim package, lightweight Speedline wheels, clear engine view port, sunroof, wood steering wheel and shift knob, rear louvers and Carello fog lamps. All 150 cars were available only painted silver and with a black leather interior; and came with \"Maratona\" badging on the rear decklid, front fenders and glove box door.

Despite such results, Autodelta's efforts with the Group 2 Alfetta were desultory and ended prematurely, due to Alfa's budgetary constraints and heavy commitments to Formula One and the [[World Championship for Sports Cars]].\n\nAt the end of the 1975 season, Autodelta also rallied an '''Alfetta GTV''' with a 3.0-litre V8 engine, derived from the 2.6-litre V8 of the [[Alfa Romeo Montreal]] coup\u00e9 and sharing the same mechanical fuel injection by [[SPICA]]. This version was driven by Ballestrieri in the relatively minor Valli Piacentine Rally, but development of the V8 Alfetta as a competition machine was not pursued when the plan to produce 400 roadgoing units of this model for homologation was abandoned. Around twenty 2.6-litre V8-engined Alfetta GTVs were built by Autodelta at the request of the German Alfa importer in 1977, where they were sold for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]50,000, considerably more than the DM20,990 charged for an Alfetta GTV2000.<ref>{{cite web |author=Taylor, Bruce |title=Montreal GTV |publisher=The Alfa Romeo Montreal Website |url=http://www.alfamontreal.info/<!--links to sub-pages not allowed--> |accessdate=15 December 2010}} (click \"Montreal GTV\" in the Index)</ref>\n\nIn 1980 the '''Alfetta GTV Turbodelta''' was already homologated in FIA [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]], since the required number of production engines had been built and fitted to Alfetta Turbodelta Stradale and Nuova Giulietta Turbodelta models. A racing version was campaigned in rallies and developed during 1979 and 1980 seasons: entries backed by [[Jolly Club]] were driven by Pregliasco, Ormezzano and Verini. The last development of the Gp.4 Turbodelta featured wide arches, 15x11 [[Campagnolo]] rims shod with massive {{Convert|290|mm|in|abbr=on}} tyres, big brakes, light body and huge engine bonnet covering induction to intercooler and turbo system.\n\nDespite scoring a win at the Danube Rally, development of the Gp.4 Alfetta Turbodelta was not pursued as Carlo Chitti, Autodelta chief engineer, had more interest in SportsCars and F1. Other consideration were the introduction of the [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (116)|Giulietta Turbo]] and the GTV&nbsp;6 being imminent and the competition department being engaged in preparing to adapt to the 1981/82 change in FIA homologation categories for production-based cars from Group 2 and 4 to Group N and Group A. In the cases of the Group N and A GTV&nbsp;6, events would prove that Alfa was very well prepared.\n\nIn 1986 Alfa Romeo GTV&nbsp;6 was one of the fastest [[Group A]] rally cars.<ref name=\"rallye-info.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rallye-info.com/carspecs.asp?car=159 |title=Alfa Romeo GTV 6 Specifications & History |website=rallye-info.com |accessdate=28 May 2007}}</ref> In 1986 production of the GTV&nbsp;6 ceased and Alfa Romeo turned its Group A racing and rallying efforts to the 75/Milano saloons, which were based on the same rear transaxle chassis. However, 1986 also saw the GTV&nbsp;6 post one of its finest rallying victories when [[Yves Loubet]]'s example won the Group A in the tragic 1986 [[Tour de Corse]] and placed 3rd overall among the monstrously powerful four-wheel-drive Group B cars.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Alfa Romeo Alfetta}}\n* [http://www.alfetta1800.altervista.org/  Alfetta Italian site\u2014many interesting photos]\n* [http://www.alfagtv6.com AlfaGtv6.com (USA)\u2014Technical info]\n* [http://www.alfaromeogtv6.com AlfaRomeoGtv6.com (France)\u2014Technical info]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060424070706/http://www.alfetta-gtv.ch/ Swiss Alfetta GTV site, including racing versions]\n* [http://www.rallybase.nl/ rallybase.nl]\n* [http://www.italianautoclub.com/ Italian Auto Club]\n* [http://www.italianautoclub.com/gtv6gptt.htm GTV 6 Twin Turbo]\n\n{{Alfa Romeo}}\n{{Alfa Romeo timeline 1950-1979}}\n{{Alfa Romeo timeline 1980 to date}}\n\n[[Category:Alfa Romeo vehicles|Alfetta]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Executive cars]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Sports sedans]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Grand tourers]]\n[[Category:Group 4 cars]]\n[[Category:Police vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1972]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Alfetta|the racing car|Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Alfa Romeo Alfetta\n| image        = File:1978 Alfa Romeo Alfetta GTV (7254572400).jpg\n| caption      = \n| manufacturer = [[Alfa Romeo]]\n| production   = 1972\u20131987\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list |Italy: [[Arese]] [[Alfa Romeo Arese Plant|Plant]], [[Lombardy]]|South Africa: [[Rosslyn, Gauteng]]{{indent|14}}[[Brits, North West]]}}\n| body_style   = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| related      = [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (116)]]<br />[[Alfa Romeo Alfa 6]]<br />[[F\u00e1brica Nacional de Motores|FNM]]-[[Alfa Romeo 2300]]\n| platform     = \n| engine       = ''[[Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine|Twin Cam]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (gasoline)<br />''[[Alfa Romeo V6 engine|''Alfa Romeo'' V6]] (gasoline)<br />''[[VM Motori]]'' I4 (turbodiesel)\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2510|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (Berlina)<br />{{convert|2400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (GT)\n| predecessor  = [[Alfa Romeo 1750 Berlina|Alfa Romeo 1750 and 2000]] (Sedan) <br> [[Alfa Romeo 105/115 Series Coup\u00e9s]]\n| successor    = [[Alfa Romeo 90]] (Sedan) <br> [[Alfa Romeo GTV (916)]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Alfa Romeo Alfetta''' (''Tipo 116'', or \"Type 116\") is a front-engine, five-passenger [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and [[fastback]] [[coup\u00e9]] manufactured and marketed by [[Alfa Romeo]] from 1972-1987  with a production total over 400,000.\n\nThe Alfetta was noted for the rear position of its [[transaxle]] (clutch and transmission) and its [[De Dion tube]] rear suspension &mdash; an arrangement designed to optimize handling by balancing front/rear weight distribution, as well as maintaining a low polar moment of inertia and low center of gravity. The interior of Coup\u00e9 models featured a then unusual central tachometer placement &mdash; by itself, directly in front of the driver.\n\nThe ''Alfetta'' name, which means \"little Alfa\" in Italian, derived from the nickname of the [[Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta|Alfa Romeo Tipo 159 Alfetta]], a successful [[Formula One car]] which in its last (1951) iteration paired a [[transaxle]] layout to [[De Dion tube]] rear suspension &mdash; like its modern namesake.<ref name=\"autocar 1974\">{{cite journal |title=Auto test\u2014Alfa Romeo Alfetta |magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |date=20 April 1974 |pages=20\u201325}}</ref><ref name=\"motor sport 1974\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/june-1974/50/road-test-alfa-romeo-alfetta |title=The Alfa Romeo Alfetta |author=C.

Clutch and transmission were housed at the rear of the car, together with the differential for a more balanced weight distribution, as used on the Alfetta 158/159 Grand Prix cars. The suspension relied on [[double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]]s and [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bar]]s at the front and a [[De Dion tube]] at the rear. When leaving the factory all Alfettas were originally fitted with [[Pirelli Cinturato]] 165HR14 tyres (CA67).\n\nThe rear de Dion transaxle found on the Alfetta and derivatives- GTV, 90 and 75- provided these cars with excellent weight distribution. The handling advantages were noted in [http://driventowrite.com/2013/11/02/1973-alfa-romeo-alfetta-review/ contemporary reviews].<ref>Cars and Vehicle Magazine, May 1973</ref> The transaxle design, in combination with a Watt's parallelogram linkage, inboard rear brakes and a well-located [[De Dion tube|de Dion]] rear suspension, resulted in balanced traction and handling. The front suspension design was unusual in that it incorporated independent longitudinal torsion bar springs acting directly onto the lower wishbones and with separate dampers.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

For 1976, with the final phasing out of the earlier [[Alfa Romeo 105/115 Series Coup\u00e9s|105 Series]] (GT&nbsp;1300 Junior and GT&nbsp;1600 Junior and 2000&nbsp;GTV), the Alfetta GT became a range; the 1.8 was discontinued in favour of the 1.6-litre (1,570&nbsp;cc) '''Alfetta GT&nbsp;1.6''' and 2.0-litre (1,962&nbsp;cc) '''Alfetta GTV&nbsp;2.0'''. At the same time some updates were introduced, such as a new front [[Grille (car)|grille]] with horizontal slats and two series of vents beneath it. The GTV was distinguished from the 1.6 version by twin chrome whiskers in the grille and GTV scripts carved in the ventilation vents on the [[C-pillar]].\n\nIn 1979, some minor revisions, including a revised engine with new camshaft profiles and a change to mechanical-and-vacuum ignition advance, saw the 2.0-litre redesignated the Alfetta GTV&nbsp;2000L. [[Autodelta]] also introduced a limited edition 2.0-litre [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] model, named '''Turbodelta''', of which 400 were made for [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] [[homologation]]. This version used a [[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] turbocharger which pushed power up to {{Convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The car also received a modified suspension layout. This was the first Italian petrol production car with a turbocharger.\nThe styling of the GTV, while distinctive, can be seen to share many design features derived from the [[Alfa Romeo Montreal|Montreal]] supercar, as translated down to a simpler and thus more marketable vehicle. Examples of this are the bonnet line, which while briefer, still has 'scallops' for the headlights, and the tail light clusters which resemble those of the Montreal. The door shape is similar, and in a sharing of parts, both vehicles employ the same door handles.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Alfa Romeo (3757437527).jpg|Alfetta GTV 2.0\nFile:Alfa Romeo GTV Coup\u00e9 rear 20070516.jpg|Rear view of an Alfetta GT 1.6\nFile:Alfa GTV IMG 8262.jpg|Alfetta GTV C-pillar logo\n</gallery>\n\n===GTV 2.0 and GTV6===\nIn 1980, the GT received a restyling. Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, C-pillar vents and side skirts; all bright stainless steel save for the Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as '''Alfa Romeo GTV&nbsp;2.0'''; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coup\u00e9 retained its type designation of 11636 for left-hand drive and 11637 for right-hand drive. 15-inch disc-shaped [[alloy wheel]]s were now standard, as opposed to the earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy units.\n\nLater in the same year, the '''GTV&nbsp;6 2.5''', a version of the GTV with the SOHC [[V6 engine|V6]] 2.5&nbsp;L engine from the [[Alfa Romeo Alfa 6]] luxury saloon, was released. As a result, the hood received a bulge to clear the top of the intake and became its most pronounced feature. With Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection instead of the six downdraught [[Dell'Orto]] carburettors in the early Alfa 6 installation, the V6 was much easier to start and retained its state of tune much better. The fuel injected engine was also able to meet the strict emissions standards introduced in Switzerland (shared with Sweden) for 1983.<ref name=TV218244>{{cite magazine | title = Alfa med ny sp\u00e4nst | trans-title = Alfa with new vitality | ref = TVn21 | language = Swedish | magazine = [[Teknikens V\u00e4rld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 44 | date = 1982-10-06 | issue = 21 | volume = 34 | first = Dag E. | last = Hogsten }}</ref> The V6 received rave reviews from the motoring press, which had previously lambasted the same engine in the Alfa 6 because of the carburettor problems. It found its true home in the GTV&nbsp;6's gran turismo body where it could stretch its legs better than in the less sporting Alfa 6 saloon. The fuel injection installation eventually made it into the second series of the Alfa 6 as well. The GTV went through a number of revisions, including new [[gear ratio]]s and an updated interior in 1984.\n\nThe GTV&nbsp;6 was also a fairly successful racing car; the 116 type chassis developed for racing since its first outing in the 1974 San Martino di Castrozza rallye. The racing successes included winning the [[European Touring Car Championship]] an unprecedented four years in succession (1982\u201385),<ref name=\"petrolicious.com\">[https://petrolicious.com/articles/the-alfa-romeo-gtv6-is-pornography-for-engineers Why The Alfa Romeo GTV6 Is Pornography For Engineers] ''Petrolicious'', accessdate: 25 October 2018</ref> the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in 1983 driven by [[Andy Rouse]], as well as many other racing and rallying competitions in national championships as France and Italy.<ref name=\"petrolicious.com\"/> A Group A GTV&nbsp;6 driven by French driver Yves Loubet won its class four years in succession from 1983 to 1986 in the Tour de Corse round of the World Rally Championship.<ref name=\"petrolicious.com\"/>\n\nThe GTV&nbsp;6 Grand-Prix was introduced in 1985 in some European markets (most notably Switzerland and Germany).

South Africa was one of two markets to have a turbocharged GTV&nbsp;6, with a [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] turbocharger and a NACA intake. An estimated 750 were assembled before all production ceased in 1986. The South African market also introduced the 3.0&nbsp;L GTV-6, predating the international debut of the factory's 3.0&nbsp;L engine in 1987. 212 were built in South Africa for racing homologation.

The Balocco was available only in red with sunroof and black interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel and red piping on the seats. There were also two green Quadrifoglio badges fixed on the rear quarter trim pieces above a badge with the \"Balocco SE\" designation. A plaque inset in the glove box door designated the number of the car out of the series of 350 (XXX of 350). Later there was the GTV&nbsp;6 2.5 Maratona, of which only 150 were built. The Maratona model included a more aggressive aerodynamic trim package, lightweight Speedline wheels, clear engine view port, sunroof, wood steering wheel and shift knob, rear louvers and Carello fog lamps. All 150 cars were available only painted silver and with a black leather interior; and came with \"Maratona\" badging on the rear decklid, front fenders and glove box door.

Despite such results, Autodelta's efforts with the Group 2 Alfetta were desultory and ended prematurely, due to Alfa's budgetary constraints and heavy commitments to Formula One and the [[World Championship for Sports Cars]].\n\nAt the end of the 1975 season, Autodelta also rallied an '''Alfetta GTV''' with a 3.0-litre V8 engine, derived from the 2.6-litre V8 of the [[Alfa Romeo Montreal]] coup\u00e9 and sharing the same mechanical fuel injection by [[SPICA]]. This version was driven by Ballestrieri in the relatively minor Valli Piacentine Rally, but development of the V8 Alfetta as a competition machine was not pursued when the plan to produce 400 roadgoing units of this model for homologation was abandoned. Around twenty 2.6-litre V8-engined Alfetta GTVs were built by Autodelta at the request of the German Alfa importer in 1977, where they were sold for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]50,000, considerably more than the DM20,990 charged for an Alfetta GTV2000.<ref>{{cite web |author=Taylor, Bruce |title=Montreal GTV |publisher=The Alfa Romeo Montreal Website |url=http://www.alfamontreal.info/<!--links to sub-pages not allowed--> |accessdate=15 December 2010}} (click \"Montreal GTV\" in the Index)</ref>\n\nIn 1980 the '''Alfetta GTV Turbodelta''' was already homologated in FIA [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]], since the required number of production engines had been built and fitted to Alfetta Turbodelta Stradale and Nuova Giulietta Turbodelta models. A racing version was campaigned in rallies and developed during 1979 and 1980 seasons: entries backed by [[Jolly Club]] were driven by Pregliasco, Ormezzano and Verini. The last development of the Gp.4 Turbodelta featured wide arches, 15x11 [[Campagnolo]] rims shod with massive {{Convert|290|mm|in|abbr=on}} tyres, big brakes, light body and huge engine bonnet covering induction to intercooler and turbo system.\n\nDespite scoring a win at the Danube Rally, development of the Gp.4 Alfetta Turbodelta was not pursued as Carlo Chitti, Autodelta chief engineer, had more interest in SportsCars and F1. Other consideration were the introduction of the [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (116)|Giulietta Turbo]] and the GTV&nbsp;6 being imminent and the competition department being engaged in preparing to adapt to the 1981/82 change in FIA homologation categories for production-based cars from Group 2 and 4 to Group N and Group A. In the cases of the Group N and A GTV&nbsp;6, events would prove that Alfa was very well prepared.\n\nIn 1986 Alfa Romeo GTV&nbsp;6 was one of the fastest [[Group A]] rally cars.<ref name=\"rallye-info.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rallye-info.com/carspecs.asp?car=159 |title=Alfa Romeo GTV 6 Specifications & History |website=rallye-info.com |accessdate=28 May 2007}}</ref> In 1986 production of the GTV&nbsp;6 ceased and Alfa Romeo turned its Group A racing and rallying efforts to the 75/Milano saloons, which were based on the same rear transaxle chassis. However, 1986 also saw the GTV&nbsp;6 post one of its finest rallying victories when [[Yves Loubet]]'s example won the Group A in the tragic 1986 [[Tour de Corse]] and placed 3rd overall among the monstrously powerful four-wheel-drive Group B cars.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Alfa Romeo Alfetta}}\n* [http://www.alfetta1800.altervista.org/  Alfetta Italian site\u2014many interesting photos]\n* [http://www.alfagtv6.com AlfaGtv6.com (USA)\u2014Technical info]\n* [http://www.alfaromeogtv6.com AlfaRomeoGtv6.com (France)\u2014Technical info]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060424070706/http://www.alfetta-gtv.ch/ Swiss Alfetta GTV site, including racing versions]\n* [http://www.rallybase.nl/ rallybase.nl]\n* [http://www.italianautoclub.com/ Italian Auto Club]\n* [http://www.italianautoclub.com/gtv6gptt.htm GTV 6 Twin Turbo]\n\n{{Alfa Romeo}}\n{{Alfa Romeo timeline 1950-1979}}\n{{Alfa Romeo timeline 1980 to date}}\n\n[[Category:Alfa Romeo vehicles|Alfetta]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Executive cars]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Sports sedans]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Grand tourers]]\n[[Category:Group 4 cars]]\n[[Category:Police vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1972]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1972-1987 \u2192 1972\u20131987", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_Alfetta"}

When folded, the bikes can be more easily carried into buildings, on public transportation (facilitating [[mixed-mode commuting]] and [[bicycle commuting]]), and more easily stored in compact living quarters or aboard a car, boat or plane.\n\nFolding mechanisms vary, with each offering a distinct combination of folding speed, folding ease, compactness, ride, weight, durability, and price. Distinguished by the complexities of their folding mechanism, more demanding structural requirements, greater number of parts, and more specialized market appeal, folding bikes may be more expensive than comparable non-folding models. The choice of model, apart from cost considerations, is a matter of resolving the various practical requirements: a quick, easy fold, a compact folded size, or a faster but less compact model.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/06/24/style/20090625-physical-slideshow_index.html | work=The New York Times | title=Physical Culture \u2013 Gear Test, Folding Bikes | date=24 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nThere are also bicycles that provide similar advantages by separating into pieces rather than folding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moultonbicycles.co.uk/models.html | website=Moulton Bicycle Company |title=Separable-frame bicycles}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:BicycleBersaglieri2.jpg|thumb|right|Italian [[Bersaglieri]] during World War I with folding bicycles strapped to their backs. 1917.]]\n[[File:1982 Hon Convertible folding bicycle.JPG|thumb|right|1982 Hon Convertible folding bicycle]]\n\nMilitary interest in bicycles arose in the 1890s, and the French army and others deployed folding bikes for [[bicycle infantry]] use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foldingcyclist.com/folding-bike-history.html|title=Folding Bike History|website=Folding Cyclist}}</ref>  In 1900, [[Mikael Pedersen]] developed for the British army a folding version of his [[Pedersen bicycle]] that weighed 15 pounds and had 24&nbsp;inch wheels. It included a rifle rack and was used in the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719174954/http://www.dursley-pedersen.net/originals/various.html?frame=%2Foriginals%2Fvarious_pages%2Ffolding.html | archivedate = 19 July 2011 | url = http://www.dursley-pedersen.net/originals/various.html?frame=/originals/various_pages/folding.html | website = Dursley Pedersen Cycle | title = Various Pedersen Models | publisher = Mads Rasmussen | accessdate = 2009-09-22 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1941, during the [[Second World War]], the British [[War Office]] called for a machine that weighed less than 23&nbsp;lb (this was not achieved - the final weight was about 32 pounds) and would withstand being dropped by parachute. In response, the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] (BSA) developed a folding bicycle small enough to be taken in small gliders or on parachute jumps from aircraft.\n\nThis British WWII Airborne BSA folding bicycle was rigged so that, when parachuted, the handlebars and seat were the first parts to hit the ground (as bent wheels would disable the bike).  BSA abandoned the traditional diamond bicycle design as too weak for the shock and instead made an elliptical frame of twin parallel tubes, one forming the top tube and seat stays, and the other the chainstay and down tube.<ref>The Bicycle, UK, 13 September 1944</ref> The hinges were in front of the bottom bracket and in the corresponding position in front of the saddle, fastened by wing nuts. The peg pedals could be pushed in to avoid snagging and further reduce the space occupied during transit.\n\nFrom 1942\u20131945, the British WWII Airborne BSA folding bicycle was used by British & Commonwealth airborne troops, Commandos, and some infantry regiments; some were also used as run-abouts on military bases. The bicycle was used by British paratroopers, Commandos, and second-wave infantry units on the [[D-Day landings]] and at the [[Battle of Arnhem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldbike.wordpress.com/1939-1945-ww2-bsa-airborne-folding-paratroopers-bike/|title=1939-1945 WW2 BSA \u2018Airborne Bicycle\u2019 Folding Paratroopers Para Bike}}</ref>\n\nThe 1970s saw increased interest in the folding bike, and the popular [[Raleigh Twenty]] and [[Bickerton (bicycle)|Bickerton Portable]] have become the iconic folders of their decade. It was, however, the early 1980s that can be said to have marked the birth of the modern, compact folding bicycle, with competing tiny-footprint models from [[Brompton Bicycle|Brompton]] and [[Dahon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foldingcyclist.com/folding-bike-history.html|title=The History of the Folding Bike|publisher=The Folding Cyclist|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> Founded in 1982, by inventor and physicist [[David T.

However, seatposts and handlebar stems on folders extend as much as four times higher than conventional bikes, and still longer after-market posts and stems provide an even greater range of adjustment.\n\nWhile folders are usually smaller in overall size than conventional bicycles, the distances among the center of [[bottom bracket]], the top of the saddle, and the handlebars - the primary factors in determining whether or not a bicycle fits its rider - are usually similar to those of conventional bikes. The [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry|wheelbase]] of many folding designs is also very similar to that of conventional, non-folding, bicycles.\n\nSome manufacturers are producing folding bikes designed around folding systems that allow them to use 26\" wheels, e.g., [[Dahon]], [[KHS Bicycles|KHS]], [[Montague Bicycles|Montague]], and [[Tern Bicycles]]. Advantages of smaller wheels include potential for more speed, quicker acceleration, greater maneuverability, and easier storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/142026-the-advantages-small-wheels-bicycle/|title=The Advantages of Small Wheels on a Bicycle|website=Livestrong.com|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref> For example, the [[A-bike]] is similar to the [[Strida]] but has tiny wheels and folds a bit smaller.  Bikes with smaller than 16\" wheels are often called [[portable bicycle]]s.  These forgo the performance and easy ride benefits of their larger counterparts, acquiring characteristics similar to those of an adult folding [[kick scooter]].  Nonetheless, regardless of how each bike folds, the result is easier to transport and store than a traditional bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transalt.org/resources/foldingbikes|title=The Folding Bike Solution|website=Transportation Alternatives|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref>\n\n== Folding methods ==\n[[File:Paris folding bike-2.jpg|thumb|1960s European folding bicycle, showing hinged frame and quick release handlebar stem allowing the bars to turn parallel to the frame when folded.]]\n[[File:Tern Verge closed jeh.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tern (company)|Tern]] Verge X10 is an example of a half-fold bike.]]\n[[File:DAHON EEZZ Vertical Folding Bicycle.jpg|thumb|Dahon EEZZ, a vertical folding bike.]]\n[[File:1960s folded bike Bootie folding bicycle bootiebike com.JPG|thumb|Small but not light: the 1960s [[Bootie (bicycle)|Bootie Folding Cycle]] is tiny but weighs 18kg.]]\n\nFolding mechanisms are highly variable.\n\n;Half- or mid-fold\nMany folding frames follow the classic frame pattern of the [[safety bicycle]]'s diamond frame, but feature a hinge point (with single or double hinges) allowing the bicycle to fold approximately in half.  Quick-release clamps enable raising or lowering steering and seat columns.  A similar swing hinge may be combined with a folding steering column.  Fold designs may use larger wheels, even the same size as in non-folders, for users prioritizing ride over fold compactness. Bikes that use this kind of fold include, [[Dahon]], and [[Montague Bikes|Montague]], and [[Tern (company)|Tern]].\n\n;Vertical Fold\nInstead of folding horizontally, this style of bike has one or two hinges along the main tube and/or chain and seat stays that allow the bike to fold vertically. The result leaves the two wheels side by side but is often more compact than a horizontally hinged design. The [[Brompton Bicycle|Brompton]] and [[Dahon|Dahon Qix D8]] both feature vertical folding.\n\n;Triangle hinge\nA hinge in the frame may allow the rear triangle and wheel to be folded down and flipped forward, under the main frame tube, as in the [[Bike Friday]], [[Brompton Bicycle|Brompton]] Mezzo Folder, and [[Swift Folder]].  Such a flip hinge may be combined with a folding front fork, as in the [[Birdy (bicycle)|Birdy]]. Swing and flip hinges may be combined on the same frame, as in the Brompton Mezzo Folder and [[Dahon]], which use a folding steering column. Folding mechanisms typically involve latches and quick releases, which affect the speed of the fold/unfold. Bike Friday offers a model, the [[Tikit]], featuring a cable-activated folding mechanism requiring no quick releases or latches, for increased folding speed.\n\n;Magnet folding and suspension system\nA magnet combined with a rear shock absorber forms the folding mechanism. The magnet connects and locks the back wheel section to the frame. To fold the bike in half, the magnet disconnects with one movement and in a second, and without having to use one's hands, the rear wheel rotates forward, and the bike folds vertically. This mechanism also enables one to roll the half-folded bike on its rear wheel.<ref>Dezeen: [http://www.dezeen.com/2014/10/07/vello-folding-bike-valentin-vodev-vienna-design-week/ ''Valentin Vodev\u2019s Vello bike folds with \u201ca simple kick\u201d thanks to one big magnet''], 7.10.2014</ref>\n\n;Break away and other styles\nBikes may partly fold and partly disassemble for packing into a standard or custom sized suitcase for air travel (e.g., Airnimal and Bike Friday). Other variations include: [[Bicycle Torque Coupling]], a proprietary connector system that can be retrofitted to a standard frame; the Gekko, which folds from the seat tube like an upside down umbrella; the Giatex, which folds and retracts, adjusting to the size of the rider; the iXi, which literally breaks into two halves; and the [[Strida]], which has a triangular frame and folds to resemble a unicycle.\n\nFolding mechanisms may incur more cost and weight, allow folding smaller, and they tend to use smaller wheels. 24&nbsp;inch wheels are the largest for which flip hinges are generally used, but smaller wheels, typically 16 or 20&nbsp;inches, are more common.\n\nSmaller size does not mean lighter weight, as most of these designs forgo the bracing benefits of the diamond frame and must compensate as a [[step-through frame]] does, with thicker metal. The step-through design is a boon to a wider range of rider size, age, and physical ability.\n\nAnother system found on folders, such as [[Montague Bikes]], utilizes the seat tube as a pivot point for the frame to fold. This system uses a tube within a tube design to give the bike more torsional stiffness. It allows the user to fold the bike without \"breaking\" any vital tubes down, thus preserving the structural integrity of the [[diamond frame]]. This system is operated by a single quick release found along the top tube of the bike.\n\n== Portability ==\nThe primary purpose of folding a bike is to increase its portability. This is so that it may be more easily transported and stored, and thus allow greater flexibility in getting from A to B.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.atob.org.uk/folding-bikes/folding-bike-why-choose/|title=Why choose a folding bike?|magazine=A to B Magazine|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> Many public transportation systems ban or restrict unfolded bicycles, but allow folded bikes all or some of the time.

When folded, the bikes can be more easily carried into buildings, on public transportation (facilitating [[mixed-mode commuting]] and [[bicycle commuting]]), and more easily stored in compact living quarters or aboard a car, boat or plane.\n\nFolding mechanisms vary, with each offering a distinct combination of folding speed, folding ease, compactness, ride, weight, durability, and price. Distinguished by the complexities of their folding mechanism, more demanding structural requirements, greater number of parts, and more specialized market appeal, folding bikes may be more expensive than comparable non-folding models. The choice of model, apart from cost considerations, is a matter of resolving the various practical requirements: a quick, easy fold, a compact folded size, or a faster but less compact model.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/06/24/style/20090625-physical-slideshow_index.html | work=The New York Times | title=Physical Culture \u2013 Gear Test, Folding Bikes | date=24 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nThere are also bicycles that provide similar advantages by separating into pieces rather than folding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moultonbicycles.co.uk/models.html | website=Moulton Bicycle Company |title=Separable-frame bicycles}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:BicycleBersaglieri2.jpg|thumb|right|Italian [[Bersaglieri]] during World War I with folding bicycles strapped to their backs. 1917.]]\n[[File:1982 Hon Convertible folding bicycle.JPG|thumb|right|1982 Hon Convertible folding bicycle]]\n\nMilitary interest in bicycles arose in the 1890s, and the French army and others deployed folding bikes for [[bicycle infantry]] use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foldingcyclist.com/folding-bike-history.html|title=Folding Bike History|website=Folding Cyclist}}</ref>  In 1900, [[Mikael Pedersen]] developed for the British army a folding version of his [[Pedersen bicycle]] that weighed 15 pounds and had 24&nbsp;inch wheels. It included a rifle rack and was used in the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719174954/http://www.dursley-pedersen.net/originals/various.html?frame=%2Foriginals%2Fvarious_pages%2Ffolding.html | archivedate = 19 July 2011 | url = http://www.dursley-pedersen.net/originals/various.html?frame=/originals/various_pages/folding.html | website = Dursley Pedersen Cycle | title = Various Pedersen Models | publisher = Mads Rasmussen | accessdate = 2009-09-22 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1941, during the [[Second World War]], the British [[War Office]] called for a machine that weighed less than 23&nbsp;lb (this was not achieved - the final weight was about 32 pounds) and would withstand being dropped by parachute. In response, the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] (BSA) developed a folding bicycle small enough to be taken in small gliders or on parachute jumps from aircraft.\n\nThis British WWII Airborne BSA folding bicycle was rigged so that, when parachuted, the handlebars and seat were the first parts to hit the ground (as bent wheels would disable the bike).  BSA abandoned the traditional diamond bicycle design as too weak for the shock and instead made an elliptical frame of twin parallel tubes, one forming the top tube and seat stays, and the other the chainstay and down tube.<ref>The Bicycle, UK, 13 September 1944</ref> The hinges were in front of the bottom bracket and in the corresponding position in front of the saddle, fastened by wing nuts. The peg pedals could be pushed in to avoid snagging and further reduce the space occupied during transit.\n\nFrom 1942-1945, the British WWII Airborne BSA folding bicycle was used by British & Commonwealth airborne troops, Commandos, and some infantry regiments; some were also used as run-abouts on military bases. The bicycle was used by British paratroopers, Commandos, and second-wave infantry units on the [[D-Day landings]] and at the [[Battle of Arnhem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldbike.wordpress.com/1939-1945-ww2-bsa-airborne-folding-paratroopers-bike/|title=1939-1945 WW2 BSA \u2018Airborne Bicycle\u2019 Folding Paratroopers Para Bike}}</ref>\n\nThe 1970s saw increased interest in the folding bike, and the popular [[Raleigh Twenty]] and [[Bickerton (bicycle)|Bickerton Portable]] have become the iconic folders of their decade. It was, however, the early 1980s that can be said to have marked the birth of the modern, compact folding bicycle, with competing tiny-footprint models from [[Brompton Bicycle|Brompton]] and [[Dahon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foldingcyclist.com/folding-bike-history.html|title=The History of the Folding Bike|publisher=The Folding Cyclist|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> Founded in 1982, by inventor and physicist [[David T.

However, seatposts and handlebar stems on folders extend as much as four times higher than conventional bikes, and still longer after-market posts and stems provide an even greater range of adjustment.\n\nWhile folders are usually smaller in overall size than conventional bicycles, the distances among the center of [[bottom bracket]], the top of the saddle, and the handlebars - the primary factors in determining whether or not a bicycle fits its rider - are usually similar to those of conventional bikes. The [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry|wheelbase]] of many folding designs is also very similar to that of conventional, non-folding, bicycles.\n\nSome manufacturers are producing folding bikes designed around folding systems that allow them to use 26\" wheels, e.g., [[Dahon]], [[KHS Bicycles|KHS]], [[Montague Bicycles|Montague]], and [[Tern Bicycles]]. Advantages of smaller wheels include potential for more speed, quicker acceleration, greater maneuverability, and easier storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/142026-the-advantages-small-wheels-bicycle/|title=The Advantages of Small Wheels on a Bicycle|website=Livestrong.com|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref> For example, the [[A-bike]] is similar to the [[Strida]] but has tiny wheels and folds a bit smaller.  Bikes with smaller than 16\" wheels are often called [[portable bicycle]]s.  These forgo the performance and easy ride benefits of their larger counterparts, acquiring characteristics similar to those of an adult folding [[kick scooter]].  Nonetheless, regardless of how each bike folds, the result is easier to transport and store than a traditional bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transalt.org/resources/foldingbikes|title=The Folding Bike Solution|website=Transportation Alternatives|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref>\n\n== Folding methods ==\n[[File:Paris folding bike-2.jpg|thumb|1960s European folding bicycle, showing hinged frame and quick release handlebar stem allowing the bars to turn parallel to the frame when folded.]]\n[[File:Tern Verge closed jeh.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tern (company)|Tern]] Verge X10 is an example of a half-fold bike.]]\n[[File:DAHON EEZZ Vertical Folding Bicycle.jpg|thumb|Dahon EEZZ, a vertical folding bike.]]\n[[File:1960s folded bike Bootie folding bicycle bootiebike com.JPG|thumb|Small but not light: the 1960s [[Bootie (bicycle)|Bootie Folding Cycle]] is tiny but weighs 18kg.]]\n\nFolding mechanisms are highly variable.\n\n;Half- or mid-fold\nMany folding frames follow the classic frame pattern of the [[safety bicycle]]'s diamond frame, but feature a hinge point (with single or double hinges) allowing the bicycle to fold approximately in half.  Quick-release clamps enable raising or lowering steering and seat columns.  A similar swing hinge may be combined with a folding steering column.  Fold designs may use larger wheels, even the same size as in non-folders, for users prioritizing ride over fold compactness. Bikes that use this kind of fold include, [[Dahon]], and [[Montague Bikes|Montague]], and [[Tern (company)|Tern]].\n\n;Vertical Fold\nInstead of folding horizontally, this style of bike has one or two hinges along the main tube and/or chain and seat stays that allow the bike to fold vertically. The result leaves the two wheels side by side but is often more compact than a horizontally hinged design. The [[Brompton Bicycle|Brompton]] and [[Dahon|Dahon Qix D8]] both feature vertical folding.\n\n;Triangle hinge\nA hinge in the frame may allow the rear triangle and wheel to be folded down and flipped forward, under the main frame tube, as in the [[Bike Friday]], [[Brompton Bicycle|Brompton]] Mezzo Folder, and [[Swift Folder]].  Such a flip hinge may be combined with a folding front fork, as in the [[Birdy (bicycle)|Birdy]]. Swing and flip hinges may be combined on the same frame, as in the Brompton Mezzo Folder and [[Dahon]], which use a folding steering column. Folding mechanisms typically involve latches and quick releases, which affect the speed of the fold/unfold. Bike Friday offers a model, the [[Tikit]], featuring a cable-activated folding mechanism requiring no quick releases or latches, for increased folding speed.\n\n;Magnet folding and suspension system\nA magnet combined with a rear shock absorber forms the folding mechanism. The magnet connects and locks the back wheel section to the frame. To fold the bike in half, the magnet disconnects with one movement and in a second, and without having to use one's hands, the rear wheel rotates forward, and the bike folds vertically. This mechanism also enables one to roll the half-folded bike on its rear wheel.<ref>Dezeen: [http://www.dezeen.com/2014/10/07/vello-folding-bike-valentin-vodev-vienna-design-week/ ''Valentin Vodev\u2019s Vello bike folds with \u201ca simple kick\u201d thanks to one big magnet''], 7.10.2014</ref>\n\n;Break away and other styles\nBikes may partly fold and partly disassemble for packing into a standard or custom sized suitcase for air travel (e.g., Airnimal and Bike Friday). Other variations include: [[Bicycle Torque Coupling]], a proprietary connector system that can be retrofitted to a standard frame; the Gekko, which folds from the seat tube like an upside down umbrella; the Giatex, which folds and retracts, adjusting to the size of the rider; the iXi, which literally breaks into two halves; and the [[Strida]], which has a triangular frame and folds to resemble a unicycle.\n\nFolding mechanisms may incur more cost and weight, allow folding smaller, and they tend to use smaller wheels. 24&nbsp;inch wheels are the largest for which flip hinges are generally used, but smaller wheels, typically 16 or 20&nbsp;inches, are more common.\n\nSmaller size does not mean lighter weight, as most of these designs forgo the bracing benefits of the diamond frame and must compensate as a [[step-through frame]] does, with thicker metal. The step-through design is a boon to a wider range of rider size, age, and physical ability.\n\nAnother system found on folders, such as [[Montague Bikes]], utilizes the seat tube as a pivot point for the frame to fold. This system uses a tube within a tube design to give the bike more torsional stiffness. It allows the user to fold the bike without \"breaking\" any vital tubes down, thus preserving the structural integrity of the [[diamond frame]]. This system is operated by a single quick release found along the top tube of the bike.\n\n== Portability ==\nThe primary purpose of folding a bike is to increase its portability. This is so that it may be more easily transported and stored, and thus allow greater flexibility in getting from A to B.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.atob.org.uk/folding-bikes/folding-bike-why-choose/|title=Why choose a folding bike?|magazine=A to B Magazine|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> Many public transportation systems ban or restrict unfolded bicycles, but allow folded bikes all or some of the time. For example, [[Transport for London]] allows folding bikes at all times on the [[London Underground|Underground]], but on buses it is down to the driver's discretion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/11701.aspx|title=Bikes on Public Transport|website=Transport for London|accessdate=2013-06-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527140218/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/11701.aspx|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some transport operators only allow folding bicycles if they are enclosed in a bag or cover.

Wadapally  comes under the assembly constituency of Miryalaguda, this town is 24&nbsp;km from Miryalaguda town.\n\nWadapally is major producer of Cement in  Nalgonda district due to the availability of limestone across the borders of Nalgonda district and neighboring [[Guntur]] district of [[Andhra Pradesh]].\n\nWadapally is famous for [[Shiva]] and is situated on the [[sangamam]] of River Krishna and Musi. It is accessible through bus and train from different places throughout [[Telangana]] such as [[Nalgonda]], [[Suryapet]], [[Miryalaguda]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and from [[Andhra Pradesh]] such as [[Guntur]], [[Nellore]], [[Secunderabad]], [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupathi]], [[Dachepalle]]. The two temples located in Wadapally are the Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara [[swami]] [[temple]] and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple.\n\nThis town is located at the confluence of the [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Musi River, India|Musi river]]s. The place is known for the temple of Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara Swamy which was constructed by the [[Kakatiya]] rulers in the 12th century.\n\nThe significance of the temple is that there is a crevice on top of the [[Shivalinga]] which is always full of water. Even if some water is removed the original level of the water is maintained. There is no logical reason that can explain this phenomenon especially since the Shivalinga is situated about 120 metres above the water level in the river.\n\nSri Narasimha Swamy is believed to bless the devotees with health and prosperity who pray to him soulfully. The sacred river Krishna has a very prominent place in the history of our country.\n\nWadapally is the place where river Krishna and Musi River meet and jointly flow. Wadapally is near [[Vishnupuram]] of Nalgonda District in [[Dameracherla]] mandal and in between [[Bibinagar]] and [[Nadikudi]] Railway Stations. The coming together of these two rivers in the shape of \"L\" attract irresistibly the viewers.\n\nAt the confluence of these rivers, there is a very old temple of Sri Narasimha Swamy. According to the [[Puranas]], [[Vyasa]] [[Bhagavan]] knowing the piousness of the place, meditated for a long time for the manifestation of Sri Narasimha Swamy. Commiserating at the continued penance of Vyasa Bhagavan Lord Maha Vishnu again transfigured as [[Narasimha Swamy]] and appeared to the former, with ferocious looks of a [[lion]]. Vyasa Bhagavan experienced Lord Narasimha, who was taking breath with uncontrolled anger, coming to him just after killing [[Hiranyakasipu]]. He, therefore, entreated Sri Narasimha Swamy to manifest at Wadapally in that form only. Accordingly, Sri Narasimha Swamy manifested there to bless the devotees and to alleviate their difficulties. It is believed that even now the idol breathes in and out. The temple authorities have arranged two lamps. One of the lights of the lamp used for showing the face of the Lord will be quivering to testify the fact that the Lord is taking breath and letting it out. The light of the other lamp, which is kept below remain resolutely.\n\nThere are a two mosques in vazeerabad which has historical importance. One is Masjid-E-Sara-E-Meer-Alam and second one is  Qutub shahi mosque.\n\nThere are many polish mills, cement and power plants are there in wadapally Surroundings.\nAlso wadapally has \nPost office, \nPolice Station, Gowri Shankar Kiranam and General Stores and\nState Bank of Hyderabad.\n\n[[India Cements]] has a [[Cement plant]] at Vishnupuram under Wadapally village limits.

Wadapally  comes under the assembly constituency of Miryalaguda, this town is 24&nbsp;km from Miryalaguda town.\n\nWadapally is major producer of Cement in  Nalgonda district due to the availability of limestone across the borders of Nalgonda district and neighboring [[Guntur]] district of [[Andhra Pradesh]].\n\nWadapally is famous for [[Lord Shiva]] and is situated on the [[sangamam]] of River Krishna and Musi. It is accessible through bus and train from different places throughout [[Telangana]] such as [[Nalgonda]], [[Suryapet]], [[Miryalaguda]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and from [[Andhra Pradesh]] such as [[Guntur]], [[Nellore]], [[Secunderabad]], [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupathi]], [[Dachepalle]]. The two temples located in Wadapally are the Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara [[swami]] [[temple]] and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple.\n\nThis town is located at the confluence of the [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Musi River, India|Musi river]]s. The place is known for the temple of Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara Swamy which was constructed by the [[Kakatiya]] rulers in the 12th century.\n\nThe significance of the temple is that there is a crevice on top of the [[Shivalinga]] which is always full of water. Even if some water is removed the original level of the water is maintained. There is no logical reason that can explain this phenomenon especially since the Shivalinga is situated about 120 metres above the water level in the river.\n\nSri Narasimha Swamy is believed to bless the devotees with health and prosperity who pray to him soulfully. The sacred river Krishna has a very prominent place in the history of our country.\n\nWadapally is the place where river Krishna and Musi River meet and jointly flow. Wadapally is near [[Vishnupuram]] of Nalgonda District in [[Dameracherla]] mandal and in between [[Bibinagar]] and [[Nadikudi]] Railway Stations. The coming together of these two rivers in the shape of \"L\" attract irresistibly the viewers.\n\nAt the confluence of these rivers, there is a very old temple of Sri Narasimha Swamy. According to the [[Puranas]], [[Vyasa]] [[Bhagavan]] knowing the piousness of the place, meditated for a long time for the manifestation of Sri Narasimha Swamy. Commiserating at the continued penance of Vyasa Bhagavan Lord Maha Vishnu again transfigured as [[Narasimha Swamy]] and appeared to the former, with ferocious looks of a [[lion]]. Vyasa Bhagavan experienced Lord Narasimha, who was taking breath with uncontrolled anger, coming to him just after killing [[Hiranyakasipu]]. He, therefore, entreated Sri Narasimha Swamy to manifest at Wadapally in that form only. Accordingly, Sri Narasimha Swamy manifested there to bless the devotees and to alleviate their difficulties. It is believed that even now the idol breathes in and out. The temple authorities have arranged two lamps. One of the lights of the lamp used for showing the face of the Lord will be quivering to testify the fact that the Lord is taking breath and letting it out. The light of the other lamp, which is kept below remain resolutely.\n\nThere are a two mosques in vazeerabad which has historical importance. One is Masjid-E-Sara-E-Meer-Alam and second one is  Qutub shahi mosque.\n\nThere are many polish mills, cement and power plants are there in wadapally Surroundings.\nAlso wadapally has \nPost office, \nPolice Station, Gowri Shankar Kiranam and General Stores and\nState Bank of Hyderabad.\n\n[[India Cements]] has a [[Cement plant]] at Vishnupuram under Wadapally village limits. It is under expansion with an expenditure of Rs. 700 million.<ref>[http://cement.industry-focus.net/index.php/andhra-pradesh-cement-projects/112-india-cements-to-expand-its-cement-capacity-at-vishnupuram.html India cements to expand its cement capacity at Vishnupuram]</ref>\n\n==How to Reach ==\nWadapally is situated at a distance of 25&nbsp;km from Miryalaguda.
