American Heritage Dictionary|Bruttium|accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref> is a [[Regions of Italy|region]] in [[Southern Italy]].\n\nThe capital city of Calabria is [[Catanzaro]]. The [[Regional Council of Calabria]] is based at the [[Palazzo Campanella]] in the city of [[Reggio Calabria]]. The region is bordered to the north by the [[Basilicata]] Region, to the west by the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], and to the east by the [[Ionian Sea]]. The [[Strait of Messina]] separates it from the island of [[Sicily]]. The region covers {{convert|15080|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and has a population of just under 2&nbsp;million. The [[demonym]] of Calabria is ''calabrese'' in Italian and ''Calabrian'' in English.\n\nIn antiquity the name Calabria referred, not as in modern times to the toe, but to the heel tip of Italy, from Tarentum southwards,<ref>[http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#Calabria Lewis and Short Latin Dictionary, entry \"Calabria\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904071133/http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#Calabria |date=4 September 2018 }}.</ref> a region nowadays known as [[Salento]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nStarting in the third century BC, the name ''Calabria'' was originally given to the Adriatic coast of the [[Salento]] peninsula in modern [[Apulia]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Carpenter |editor1-first=T.

The whole region of Apulia received the name ''Regio II Apulia et Calabria''. By this time modern Calabria was still known as ''Bruttium'', after the [[Bruttians]] who inhabited the region. Later in the seventh century AD, the [[Byzantine Empire]] created the Duchy of Calabria from the Salento and the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] part of Bruttium. Even though the Calabrian part of the duchy was conquered by the [[Longobards]] during the eighth and ninth centuries AD, the Byzantines continued to use the name ''Calabria'' for their remaining territory in Bruttium.<ref>{{cite book | last=Colafemmina | first=Cesare | title=The Jews in Calabria | date=2012 | publisher=Brill | location=Leiden, The Netherlands | isbn=9789004234123 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSYyAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 1]}}</ref>\n\nThe modern name ''Italy'' derives from ''Italia'', which was first used as a name for the southern part of modern Calabria.<ref>{{cite book | author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus | authorlink=Dionysius of Halicarnassus | title=Roman Antiquities | year=1937 | publisher=Harvard University Press | chapter=1.35 | chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html#35}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Strabo | authorlink=Strabo | year=1924 | editor-last=Jones | editor-first=H.

Some 42% of Calabria's area, corresponding to 15,080&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, is mountainous, 49% is hilly, while plains occupy only 9% of the region's territory. It is surrounded by the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] and [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas. It is separated from [[Sicily]] by the [[Strait of Messina]], where the narrowest point between [[Capo Peloro]] in [[Sicily]] and [[Punta Pezzo]] in Calabria is only {{convert|3.2|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThree mountain ranges are present: [[Pollino]], [[La Sila]] and [[Aspromonte]]. All three mountain ranges are unique with their own flora and fauna. The [[Pollino Mountains]] in the north of the region are rugged and form a natural barrier separating Calabria from the rest of Italy. Parts of the area are heavily wooded, while others are vast, wind-swept plateaus with little vegetation. These mountains are home to a rare [[Bosnian Pine]] variety and are included in the [[Pollino National Park]]. The Pollino National Park also has the distinction of being the largest national park in Italy and covers about 1,925.65 square kilometres.\n\n[[La Sila]], which has been referred to as the \"Great Wood of Italy\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.praiaartresort.com/en/journeys/|title=Journeys|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702124802/https://www.praiaartresort.com/en/journeys/|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com/the-calabria--national-park.php|title=The Calabria National Park, sila Grande and Sila Piccola|website=www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.costatiziana.it/pages/eng/attivita_montagna.php|title=attivita_montagna \u2013 Costa Tiziana|access-date=28 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065125/http://www.costatiziana.it/pages/eng/attivita_montagna.php|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> is a vast mountainous plateau about {{convert|1200|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and stretches for nearly {{convert|2000|km2|abbr=off}} along the central part of Calabria. The highest point is [[Botte Donato]], which reaches {{convert|1928|m|abbr=off}}. The area boasts numerous lakes and dense coniferous forests.

This unique mountainous structure reaches its highest point at Montalto, at {{convert|1,995|m|abbr=off}}, and is full of wide, man-made terraces that slope down towards the sea.\n\nIn general, most of the lower terrain in Calabria has been agricultural for centuries, and exhibits indigenous scrubland as well as introduced plants such as the [[prickly pear cactus]]. The lowest slopes are rich in vineyards and citrus fruit orchards. The [[Diamante citron]] is one of the citrus fruits. Moving upwards, olives and chestnut trees appear while in the higher regions there are often dense forests of oak, pine, beech and fir trees.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nCalabria's climate is influenced by the sea and mountains. The Mediterranean climate is typical of the coastal areas with considerable differences in temperature and rainfall between the seasons, with an average low of {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0}} during the winter months and an average high of {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0}} during the summer months. Mountain areas have a typical mountainous climate with frequent snow during winter. Erratic behavior of the Tyrrhenian Sea can bring heavy rainfall on the western slopes of the region, while hot air from Africa makes the east coast of Calabria dry and warm. The mountains that run along the region also influence the climate and temperature of the region. The east coast is much warmer and has wider temperature ranges than the west coast. The geography of the region causes more rain to fall along the west coast than that of the east coast, which occurs mainly during winter and autumn and less during the summer months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italyaround.com/en/calabria-climate-when-to-go-to-calabria/|title=Calabria climate: when to go to Calabria \u2013 Italy: travel, recipes, family and health|date=17 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nBelow are the two extremes of climate present in Calabria, both the warm mediterranean subtype on the coastline and the highland climate of Monte Scuro.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|location=Reggio Calabria (1971\u20132000 normals)\n|collapsed = Yes\n<!-- Record high temperatures -->\n<!-- Note that record temperatures should be used sparingly in main city articles, and should only be used when the data period is of the greatest length possible. -->\n|Jan record high C=24.6\n|Feb record high C=25.2\n|Mar record high C=27.0\n|Apr record high C=30.4\n|May record high C=35.2\n|Jun record high C=42.0\n|Jul record high C=44.2\n|Aug record high C=42.4\n|Sep record high C=37.6\n|Oct record high C=34.4\n|Nov record high C=29.9\n|Dec record high C=26.0\n<!-- Average high temperatures -->\n|Jan high C=15.3\n|Feb high C=15.6\n|Mar high C=17.1\n|Apr high C=19.3\n|May high C=23.8\n|Jun high C=27.9\n|Jul high C=31.1\n|Aug high C=31.3\n|Sep high C=28.2\n|Oct high C=23.9\n|Nov high C=19.7\n|Dec high C=16.6\n<!-- Mean daily temperature -->\n|Jan mean C=11.8\n|Feb mean C=11.8\n|Mar mean C=13.0\n|Apr mean C=15.1\n|May mean C=19.2\n|Jun mean C=23.2\n|Jul mean C=26.4\n|Aug mean C=26.7\n|Sep mean C=23.7\n|Oct mean C=19.8\n|Nov mean C=15.9\n|Dec mean C=13.1\n<!-- Average low temperatures -->\n|Jan low C=8.2\n|Feb low C=7.9\n|Mar low C=9.0\n|Apr low C=10.9\n|May low C=14.7\n|Jun low C=18.6\n|Jul low C=21.6\n|Aug low C=22.1\n|Sep low C=19.3\n|Oct low C=15.7\n|Nov low C=12.1\n|Dec low C=9.6\n<!-- Record low temperatures -->\n<!-- Note that record temperatures should be used sparingly in main city articles, and should only be used when the data period is of the greatest length possible. -->\n|Jan record low C=1.0\n|Feb record low C=-0.0\n|Mar record low C=0.0\n|Apr record low C=4.6\n|May record low C=7.8\n|Jun record low C=10.8\n|Jul record low C=14.6\n|Aug record low C=14.4\n|Sep record low C=11.2\n|Oct record low C=6.6\n|Nov record low C=4.4\n|Dec record low C=2.6\n<!-- Total precipitation, this should include rain and snow. -->\n|precipitation colour=green <!-- Enter \"green\" for green precipitation colours, \"none\" for no colours, remove this line for blue colouring. -->\n<!-- IMPORTANT: use mm or cm but NOT both! -->\n|Jan precipitation mm=69.6\n|Feb precipitation mm=61.5\n|Mar precipitation mm=50.7\n|Apr precipitation mm=40.4\n|May precipitation mm=19.8\n|Jun precipitation mm=10.9\n|Jul precipitation mm=7.0\n|Aug precipitation mm=11.9\n|Sep precipitation mm=47.5\n|Oct precipitation mm=72.5\n|Nov precipitation mm=81.7\n|Dec precipitation mm=73.3\n<!-- Average daily % humidity -->\n<!-- If entering the average daily % humidity, then the humidex table should be used.

From van Dijk (1992)<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/>]]\n\nWhen describing the geology of Calabria, it is commonly considered as part of the \"Calabrian Arc\", an arc-shaped geographic domain extending from the southern part of the [[Basilicata]] Region to the northeast of [[Sicily]], and including the [[Peloritani|Peloritano Mountains]] (although some authors extend this domain from [[Naples]] in the north to [[Palermo]] in the southwest). The Calabrian area shows basement (crystalline and metamorphic rocks) of [[Paleozoic]] and younger ages, covered by (mostly Upper) [[Neogene]] sediments. Studies have revealed that these rocks comprise the upper Unit of a pile of thrust sheets which dominate the [[Apennines]] and the Sicilian [[Maghrebides]].<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'>van Dijk, J.P., Bello, M., Brancaleoni, G.P., Cantarella, G., Costa, V., Frixa, A., Golfetto, F., Merlini, S., Riva, M., Toricelli, S., Toscano, C., and Zerilli, A. (2000, a); A new structural model for the northern sector of the Calabrian Arc. Tectonophysics, 324, 267\u2013320.</ref>\n\nThe [[Neogene]] evolution of the Central Mediterranean system is dominated by the migration of the Calabrian Arc to the southeast, overriding the African Plate and its promontories (Argand, 1922;<ref name ='Argand_1922'>Argand, E.

The main tectonic elements of the Calabrian Arc are the Southern Apennines fold-and-thrust belt, the \"Calabria-Peloritani\", or simply Calabrian block and the Sicilian Maghrebides fold-and-thrust belt. The foreland area is formed by the [[Apulia]] Platform, which is part of the [[Adriatic]] Plate, and the [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]] or [[Iblean]] Platform, which is an extension of the African Plate. These platforms are separated by the [[Ionian Basin]]. The [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] oceanized basin is regarded as the [[back-arc basin]]. This [[subduction]] system therefore shows the southern plates of African affinity subducting below the northern plates of European affinity.<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/>\n\nThe geology of Calabria has been studied for more than a century.

Later came the Bruttii from Lucania. These occupied Calabria and called it Bruttium. The Bruttii were very advanced culturally. The Greek cities of Calabria came under the pressure from these [[Lucanians]], an [[Oscan]] people who lived in the present day region of [[Basilicata]]. They conquered the north of Calabria and pushed further south, taking over part of the interior, probably after they defeated the Thurians near Laus in 390 BC. A few decades later Calabria came under pressure from the [[Bruttii]]. They were Lucanian slaves and other fugitives who were seeking refuge on the steep mountains of Calabria. Their name was Lucanian and meant rebels. They took advantage of the weakening of the Greek cites caused by wars between them. They took over Hipponium, Terina and Thurii. They helped the Lucanians to fight [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander of Epirus]] (334\u201332 BC), who had come to the aid of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (in [[Apulia]]), which was also pressured by the Lucanians. After this, [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] ravaged the coast of Calabria with his fleet, took Hipponium and forced the Bruttii into unfavourable peace terms. However, they soon seized Hipponium again. After Agathloces' death in 289 BC the Lucanians and Bruttii pushed into the territory of Thurii and ravaged it. The city sent envoys to Rome to ask for help in 285 BC  and 282 BC. On the second occasion, the Romans sent forces to garrison the city. This was part of the episode which sparked the Pyrrhic war.\n\nDuring the Pyrrhic War (280\u2013275 BC) the Lucanians and Bruttii sided with Pyrrhus and provided contingents which fought with his army. When Pyrrhus landed in Italy the people of Rhegion were worried about their safety and asked Rome for protection. The Romans sent soldiers from [[Campania]] to garrison the city. Coveting the wealth of the city, the soldiers killed its prominent men, sent away the rest and seized their property. The Romans could not do much about it because they were engaged in the war. A few years after the end of the war, in 271 BC, the Romans retook the city, arrested the soldiers and took them to Rome, where they were executed.<ref>Polybius, The Histories, 1.7\u201310</ref> After Pyrrhus was defeated, to avoid Roman revenge, the Bruttii submitted willingly and gave up half of the Sila, a mountainous plateau which was valuable for its pitch and timber. The timber here was sold all over Italy and the resin of the area was of the highest quality.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Histories, 20.5\u20136</ref>\n\nDuring the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC) the Bruttii allied with [[Hannibal]], who sent [[Hanno, son of Bomilcar|Hanno]], one of his commanders, to Calabria. Hanno marched towards [[Capua]] (in Campania) with Bruttian soldiers to take them to Hannibal's headquarters there twice, but he was defeated on both occasions. When his campaign in Italy came to a dead end, Hannibal took refuge in Calabria, whose steep mountains provided protection against the Roman legions.

Many Calabrian cities surrendered.<ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 30.19</ref> Calabria was put under a military commander. Nearly a decade after the war, the Romans set up colonies in Calabria: at Tempsa and Kroton (Croto in Latin) in 194 BC, Copiae in the territory of Thurii (Thurium in Latin) in 193 BC, and Vibo Valentia in the territory of Hipponion in 192 BC.<ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 34.45, 53; 35.40</ref> The Romans called Calabria Bruttium.

He contracted malaria and died in Cosentia ([[Cosenza]]), probably of fever. Legend has it that he along with the treasure of Rome were buried under the bed of the River Busento.<ref>Erik Durschmied, From Armageddon to the Fall of Rome, Ch. 17</ref> With the fall of the western part of the Roman Empire in 476, Italy was taken over by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer and later became part of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in 489. The Ostrogothic kings ruled officially as Magistri Militum of the Byzantine Emperors and all government and administrative positions were held by the Romans while all primary laws were legislated by the Byzantine Emperor. Therefore, during the sixth century, under the Ostrogoths' rule, Romans could still be at the center of government and cultural life, such as the Roman [[Cassiodorus]] who, like Boethius and Symmachus, emerged as one of the most prominent men of his time. He was an administrator, politician, scholar and historian who was born in Scylletium (near Catanzaro). He spent most of his career trying to bridge the divides of East and West, Greek and Latin cultures, Romans and Goths, and official Christianity and [[Arian Christianity]], which was the form of Christianity of the Ostrogoths and which had earlier been banned. He set up his [[Vivarium (monastery)]] in Scylletium. He oversaw the collation of three editions of the Bible in Latin. Seeing the practicality of uniting all the books of the Bible in one volume, he was the first who produced Latin Bibles in single volumes.<ref>Peter Brown, The World of Late Antiquity: AD 150\u2013750.</ref> The most well-known of them was the [[Codex Grandior]] which was the ancestor of all modern western Bibles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xn8i8cLNDM|title=Testament The Bible And History episode 6 Power And Glory part one (1 of 2)|last=TheGreatMysteries|date=3 April 2011|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=204|title=The Scriptorium and Library at the Vivarium : HistoryofInformation.com|website=www.historyofinformation.com}}</ref><ref name=\"faculty.georgetown.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html|title=Cassiodorus, Chapter 6: Vivarium|website=faculty.georgetown.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"faculty.georgetown.edu\"/>\n\nCassiodorus was at the heart of the administration of the Ostrogothic kingdom. Theodoric made him quaestor sacri palatii (quaestor of the sacred palace, the senior legal authority) in 507, governor of Lucania and Bruttium, consul in 514 and magister officiorum (master of offices, one of the most senior administrative officials) in 523. He was praetorian prefect (chief minister) under the successors of Theodoric: under Athalaric (Theodoric's grandson, reigned 526\u201334) in 533 and, between 535 and 537, under Theodahad (Theodoric's nephew, reigned 534\u201336) and Witiges (Theodoric's grandson-in-law, reigned, 536\u201340).<ref>Cassiodorus, Variae, 9.24\u201354, 38\u201339</ref> The major works of Cassiodorus, besides the mentioned bibles, were the Historia Gothorum, a history of the Goths, the Variae and account of his administrative career and the Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum, an introduction to the study of the sacred scriptures and the liberal arts which was very influential in the Middle Ages.\n\n[[Byzantine]] (Eastern Roman) Emperor Justinian I, retook Italy from the Ostrogoths between 535 and 556. They soon lost much of Italy to the [[Lombards]] between 568 and 590, but retained the south for around 500 years until 1059\u20131071, where they thrived and where the Greek language was the official and vernacular language. In Calabria and towns such as [[Stilo]] and [[Rossano]] achieved great religious status.  From the 7th Century many monasteries were built in the Amendolea and Stilaro Valleys and Stilo was the destination of hermits and Basilian monks.  Many Byzantine churches are still seen in the region. The 10th-century church in Rossano is considered one of the best preserved Byzantine churches in Italy. It was built by St. [[Nilus the Younger]] as a retreat for the monks who lived in the tufa grottos underneath.  The present name of Calabria comes from the duchy of Calabria.\n\nAround the year 800, [[Saracen]]s began invading the shores of Calabria, attempting to wrest control of the area from the Byzantines.  This group of Arabs had already been successful [[Emirate of Sicily|in Sicily]] and knew that Calabria was another key spot. The people of Calabria retreated into the mountains for safety. Although the Arabs never really got a stronghold on the whole of Calabria, they did control some villages while enhancing trade relations with the eastern world.<ref name=\"bleedingespresso.com\">{{cite web|url=http://bleedingespresso.com/calabria/history-of-calabria|title=Bleeding Espresso|author=metatags generator|publisher=bleedingespresso.com|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref> In 918, Saracens captured [[Reggio di Calabria|Reggio]] (which was renamed ''Riv\u00e0'') and sold the majority of its population in the slave markets of Sicily and North Africa.<ref>''The Italian Cities and the Arabs before 1095'', Hilmar C.

Of note is that the Normans established their presence here, in southern Italy (namely Calabria), 6 years prior to their conquest of England, (see [[The Battle of Hastings]]).  The purpose of this strategic presence in Calabria was to lay the foundations for the Crusades 30 years later, and for the creation of two Kingdoms: the Kingship of Jerusalem, and the Kingdom of Sicily.  Ships would sail from Calabria to the Holy Land. This made Calabria one of the richest regions in Europe as princes from the noble families of England, France and other regions, constructed secondary residences and palaces here, on their way to the Holy Land. Guiscard's son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], who was born in [[San Marco Argentano]], would be one of the leaders in the first crusade. Of particular note is the [[Via Francigena]], an ancient pilgrim route that goes from Canterbury to Rome and southern Italy, reaching Calabria, Basilicata and Apulia, where the crusaders lived, prayed and trained, respectively.\n\nAt the beginning of the tenth century (circa 903),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.initalytoday.com/calabria/catanzaro/ |title=Catanzaro Italy: Catanzaro guide, city of Catanzaro, Calabria Italy |publisher=Initalytoday.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Calabria was occupied by the Muslim [[Saracens]], who founded an [[emirate]] and took the Arab name of \u0642\u0637\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u2013 QaTanS\u00e1ar. An Arab presence is evidenced by findings at an eighth-century necropolis which had items with Arabic inscriptions.\n\nIn 1098, [[Roger I of Sicily]] was named the equivalent of an apostolic legate by Pope [[Urban II]] and later his son [[Roger II of Sicily]] became the first [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]] and formed what would become the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] which lasted nearly 700 years. Under the Normans Southern Italy was united as one region and started a feudal system of land ownership in which the Normans were made lords of the land while peasants performed all the work on the land.\n\nIn 1194 the Swabians took control under [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. He created a kingdom that blended cultures, philosophy and customs and would build several castles while fortifying existing ones which the Normans previously constructed. After the death of Frederick II in 1250, Calabria was controlled by the French once more, the Angevins, under the rule of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles d\u2019Anjou]] after being granted the crown by Pope Clement IV. Under Charles d\u2019Anjou the Kingdom of Sicily was changed to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] in 1282 after he lost Sicily due to the rebellion of the [[Sicilian Vespers]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> During the 14th century, would emerge [[Barlaam of Seminara]] who would be [[Petrarch]]'s Greek teacher and his disciple [[Leonzio Pilato]], who would translate Homer's works for [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].\n\n===Early modern period===\nIn 1442 the Aragonese took control under [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] who became ruler under the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In 1501 Calabria came under the control of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] who is famed for sponsoring the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492.

This Greek Diaspora allowed the ancient Greek dialects to continue in Southern Italy, much in the same way that the Italian Diaspora allowed long-lost dialects from Italy to thrive in countries where Italians emigrated to. Greek texts were also valued in monasteries and places of learning.  However it was [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century, who made Latin the 'official' language of study and communication for Europe.   For the sake of uniformity, he supplanted much of the Greek spoken, read or taught in Europe. It was through language (Latin) and education (Latin texts) that Charlemagne united Europe.\n\nDuring the 13th century a French chronicler who traveled through Calabria stated that \"the peasants of Calabria spoke nothing but Greek\" given he had traveled to areas where Greek was still available.  But the educated classes spoke Italian. Indeed, formal Italian has been taught in schools throughout Italy for nearly two centuries, causing the ancient languages and dialects to continually disappear, much to the chagrin of the cultural community. These lost dialects continue to thrive to this day in North America and Australia, places where Italians emigrated to, on account of the [[Diaspora]].\n\n== Economy ==\nCalabria enjoys a diversified economy comparable to western nations in various categories, as shown in these statistics: the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Calabria is subdivided as follows: service industry (28.94%), financial activities and real estate (21.09%), trade, tourism, transportation and communication (19.39%), taxation (11.49%), manufacturing (8.77%), construction (6.19%) and agriculture (4.13%). It is one of the least (resort) developed regions in Italy. Its economy is hampered by corruption, tax evasion and organized crime which is mainly run by the [['Ndrangheta]] (the local [[Mafia]] syndicate); the latter has deep connections with some of the local authorities.<ref name=\"newyorktimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/world/europe/in-italy-calabria-is-drained-by-corruption.html |title=In Italy, Calabria is drained by corruption |newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=7 October 2012 |last1=Donadio |first1=Rachel }}</ref>\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nFood and textile industries are the most developed and vibrant. Within the industrial sector, manufacturing contributes to a gross value added of 7.2%. In the manufacturing sector the main branches are foodstuff, beverage and tobacco with a contribution to the sector very close to the national average.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\nOver the recent decades have emerged some petrochemical, engineering and chemical industries, within the areas of [[Crotone]], [[Vibo Valentia]] and [[Reggio Calabria]].\n\n=== Tourism ===\n[[File:Pista Azzurra Gambarie.jpg|thumb|Ski trails near [[Gambarie]] overlooking  the [[Strait of Messina]]]]\nCalabria attracts year-round tourism, offering both summer and winter activities, in addition to its cultural, historical, artistic heritage, it has an abundance of protected natural habitats and 'green' zones.  The {{convert|485|mi|abbr=off}} of its coast make Calabria a tourist destination during the summer. The low industrial development and the lack of major cities in much of its territory have allowed the maintenance of indigenous marine life.\n\nThe most sought-after seaside destinations are: [[Tropea]], [[Pizzo, Calabria|Pizzo Calabro]], [[Capo Vaticano]], [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Soverato]], [[Scilla, Calabria|Scilla,]] [[Scalea]], [[Sellia Marina]], [[Montepaone]], [[Montauro]], Copanello (comune of [[Staletti]]), [[Palmi|Tonnara di Palmi]], [[Diamante, Calabria|Diamante]], [[Paola, Calabria|Paola]], [[Fiumefreddo Bruzio]], [[Amantea]], [[Praia a Mare]], [[Belvedere Marittimo]], [[Roseto Capo Spulico]], [[Corigliano Calabro]], [[Cir\u00f2 Marina]], [[Amendolara]], [[Roccella Ionica]], [[Bagnara Calabra]], [[Nicotera]], [[Cariati]], [[Zambrone]], [[Isola di Capo Rizzuto]], Caminia (comune of [[Staletti]]), [[Siderno]], [[Parghelia]], [[Ricadi]] and [[San Nicola Arcella]].\n\nIn addition to the coastal tourist destinations, the interior of Calabria is rich in history, traditions, art and culture. Cosenza is among the most important cultural cities of Calabria, with a rich historical and artistic patrimony. Medieval castles, towers, churches, monasteries and other French castles and structures from the Norman to the Aragonese periods are common elements in both the interior and coastline of Calabria.\n\nThe mountains offer skiing and other winter activities: [[Sila National Park|Sila]], [[Pollino National Park|Pollino]] and [[Aspromonte]] are three national parks that offer facilities for winter sports, especially in the towns of Camigliatello (comune of [[Spezzano della Sila]]), Lorica (comune of [[San Giovanni in Fiore]]), [[Gambarie]] and Monte Sant'Elia (comune of [[Palmi]]).\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Kalabrien-Olivenernte.JPG|thumb|left|Calabrian olive tree plantations]]\n\nA typical feature is agricultural richness in Calabria.

The Calabrian language is a direct derivative of the Latin language, and is closer to the words spoken in Latin than the standard Italian. Most linguists divide the various [[dialects of Calabria|dialects]] into two different language groups. In the northern one-third of the region, the Calabrian dialects are considered part of the [[Neapolitan language]] (or Southern Italian) and are grouped as Northern Calabrian or ''Cosentino''. In the southern two-thirds of the region, the Calabrian dialects are often grouped as Central and Southern Calabrian. In many respects, the Calabrian dialect is considered very similar to the Puglian/Salentine dialects spoken in Salento, the region situated on the \"heel\" of Italy.\nHowever, in isolated pockets, as well as some quarters of Reggio Calabria a variety of [[Occitan]] can also be found in certain communities and [[French language|French]] has had an influence on many Calabrian words and phrases. In addition, since Calabria was once ruled by the Spanish, some Calabrian dialects exhibit [[Spanish language|Spanish]] derivatives.\nAnother important linguistic minority is present in the nine towns of [[Bovesia|Boves\u00eca]], in the province of [[Reggio Calabria]]. It is a derivative of [[ancient Greek]] with influences of [[Calabrian dialect]], belonging to the ancient [[Byzantine Empire|Bizantine]] dominations.<ref>https://eu.greekreporter.com/2019/12/10/calabrian-greek-a-language-on-the-brink-of-extinction/</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Calabria}}\n[[File:Reggio calabria duomo.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of Reggio Calabria]]\nThe majority of Calabrians are [[Roman Catholic]].

Calabria also has another patron saint called Saint [[Bruno of Cologne]] who was the founder of the [[Carthusian]] Order. Saint Bruno would build the charterhouse of [[Serra San Bruno]], a town which bears his name, in 1095 and later die there in 1101.\n\nEven though it is currently a very small community, there has been a long history of the presence of [[Jews]] in Calabria. The Jews have had a presence in the region for at least 1600 years and possibly as much as 2300 years. Calabrian Jews have had notably influence on many areas of Jewish life and culture. Although virtually identical to the Jews of Sicily, the Jews of Calabria are considered a distinct Jewish population due to historical and geographic considerations. There is a small community of Italian [[Anusim]] who have resumed the [[Jewish]] faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishroots.it/|title=Center for the Study of Jewry in Calabria and Sicily|accessdate=11 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612053046/http://www.jewishroots.it/|archivedate=12 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIt is important to highlight the presence of Calabrians in [[Renaissance humanism]] and in the [[Renaissance]]. Indeed, the Hellenistics in this period frequently came from Calabria maybe because of the Greek influence. The rediscovery of Ancient Greek was very difficult because this language had been almost forgotten. In this period the presence of Calabrian humanists or refugees from Constantinople was fundamental. The study of Ancient Greek, in this period, was mainly a work of two monks of the monastery of [[Seminara]]: [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]], [[bishop of Gerace]], and his disciple, [[Leonzio Pilato]]. [[Leonzio Pilato]], in particular, was a Calabrian born near [[Reggio Calabria]]. He was an important teacher of Ancient Greek and translator, and he helped [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in the translations of [[Homer]]'s works.\n\n== Cuisine ==\n{{See also|Calabrian wine}}\n[[File:'Nduja.JPG|thumb|''[['Nduja]]'']]\nThe cuisine is a typical southern Italian [[Mediterranean cuisine]] with a balance between meat-based dishes (pork, lamb, goat), vegetables (especially [[eggplant]]), and fish. Pasta (as in Central Italy and the rest of Southern Italy) is also very important in Calabria. In contrast to most other Italian regions, Calabrians have traditionally placed an emphasis on the preservation of their food and packing vegetables and meats in [[olive oil]]. Also making sausages and cold cuts ([[Sopressata]], [['Nduja]], [[Capicola|Capocollo]]), along the coast curing fish \u2013 especially [[swordfish]], [[sardine]]s (''sardelle rosamarina'') and [[cod]] ([[Baccal\u00e0]]). Local desserts are typically fried, honey-sweetened pastries ''Cudduraci'', Nacatole, ''Scalille'' or ''scalidde'' or baked [[biscotti]]-type treats (such as '''nzudda'').\n\nSome local specialties include [[Caciocavallo]] Cheese, ''[[Cipolla rossa di Tropea]]'' (red onion), ''[[Fr\u00ecttuli]]'' and ''[[Curc\u00f9ci]]'' (fried pork), [[Liquorice]] (''liquirizia''), ''[[Lagane e Cicciari]]'' (a pasta dish with [[chickpea]]s), [[Pecorino Crotonese]] (Cheese of Sheep), and [[Pignolata]].\n\nIn ancient times Calabria was referred to as ''Enotria'' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u039f\u1f30\u03bd\u03c9\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}}, ''{{transl|grc|[[Oenotria]]}}'', \"land of wine\").

The [[Regional Council of Calabria]] is based at the [[Palazzo Campanella]] in the city of [[Reggio Calabria]]. The region is bordered to the north by the [[Basilicata]] Region, to the west by the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], and to the east by the [[Ionian Sea]]. The [[Strait  of Messina]] separates it from the island of [[Sicily]]. The region covers {{convert|15080|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and has a population of just under 2&nbsp;million. The [[demonym]] of Calabria is ''calabrese'' in Italian and ''Calabrian'' in English.\n\nIn antiquity the name Calabria referred, not as in modern times to the toe, but to the heel tip of Italy, from Tarentum southwards,<ref>[http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#Calabria Lewis and Short Latin Dictionary, entry \"Calabria\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904071133/http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#Calabria |date=4 September 2018 }}.</ref> a region nowadays known as [[Salento]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nStarting in the third century BC, the name ''Calabria'' was originally given to the Adriatic coast of the [[Salento]] peninsula in modern [[Apulia]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Carpenter |editor1-first=T.

The whole region of Apulia received the name ''Regio II Apulia et Calabria''. By this time modern Calabria was still known as ''Bruttium'', after the [[Bruttians]] who inhabited the region. Later in the seventh century AD, the [[Byzantine Empire]] created the Duchy of Calabria from the Salento and the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] part of Bruttium. Even though the Calabrian part of the duchy was conquered by the [[Longobards]] during the eighth and ninth centuries AD, the Byzantines continued to use the name ''Calabria'' for their remaining territory in Bruttium.<ref>{{cite book | last=Colafemmina | first=Cesare | title=The Jews in Calabria | date=2012 | publisher=Brill | location=Leiden, The Netherlands | isbn=9789004234123 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSYyAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 1]}}</ref>\n\nThe modern name ''Italy'' derives from ''Italia'', which was first used as a name for the southern part of modern Calabria.<ref>{{cite book | author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus | authorlink=Dionysius of Halicarnassus | title=Roman Antiquities | year=1937 | publisher=Harvard University Press | chapter=1.35 | chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html#35}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Strabo | authorlink=Strabo | year=1924 | editor-last=Jones | editor-first=H.

Some 42% of Calabria's area, corresponding to 15,080&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, is mountainous, 49% is hilly, while plains occupy only 9% of the region's territory. It is surrounded by the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] and [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas. It is separated from [[Sicily]] by the [[Strait of Messina]], where the narrowest point between [[Capo Peloro]] in [[Sicily]] and [[Punta Pezzo]] in Calabria is only {{convert|3.2|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThree mountain ranges are present: [[Pollino]], [[La Sila]] and [[Aspromonte]]. All three mountain ranges are unique with their own flora and fauna. The [[Pollino Mountains]] in the north of the region are rugged and form a natural barrier separating Calabria from the rest of Italy. Parts of the area are heavily wooded, while others are vast, wind-swept plateaus with little vegetation. These mountains are home to a rare [[Bosnian Pine]] variety and are included in the [[Pollino National Park]]. The Pollino National Park also has the distinction of being the largest national park in Italy and covers about 1,925.65 square kilometres.\n\n[[La Sila]], which has been referred to as the \"Great Wood of Italy\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.praiaartresort.com/en/journeys/|title=Journeys|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702124802/https://www.praiaartresort.com/en/journeys/|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com/the-calabria--national-park.php|title=The Calabria National Park, sila Grande and Sila Piccola|website=www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.costatiziana.it/pages/eng/attivita_montagna.php|title=attivita_montagna \u2013 Costa Tiziana|access-date=28 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065125/http://www.costatiziana.it/pages/eng/attivita_montagna.php|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> is a vast mountainous plateau about {{convert|1200|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and stretches for nearly {{convert|2000|km2|abbr=off}} along the central part of Calabria.

This unique mountainous structure reaches its highest point at Montalto, at {{convert|1,995|m|abbr=off}}, and is full of wide, man-made terraces that slope down towards the sea.\n\nIn general, most of the lower terrain in Calabria has been agricultural for centuries, and exhibits indigenous scrubland as well as introduced plants such as the [[prickly pear cactus]]. The lowest slopes are rich in vineyards and citrus fruit orchards. The [[Diamante citron]] is one of the citrus fruits. Moving upwards, olives and chestnut trees appear while in the higher regions there are often dense forests of oak, pine, beech and fir trees.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nCalabria's climate is influenced by the sea and mountains. The Mediterranean climate is typical of the coastal areas with considerable differences in temperature and rainfall between the seasons, with an average low of {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0}} during the winter months and an average high of {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0}} during the summer months. Mountain areas have a typical mountainous climate with frequent snow during winter. Erratic behavior of the Tyrrhenian Sea can bring heavy rainfall on the western slopes of the region, while hot air from Africa makes the east coast of Calabria dry and warm. The mountains that run along the region also influence the climate and temperature of the region. The east coast is much warmer and has wider temperature ranges than the west coast. The geography of the region causes more rain to fall along the west coast than that of the east coast, which occurs mainly during winter and autumn and less during the summer months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italyaround.com/en/calabria-climate-when-to-go-to-calabria/|title=Calabria climate: when to go to Calabria \u2013 Italy: travel, recipes, family and health|date=17 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nBelow are the two extremes of climate present in Calabria, both the warm mediterranean subtype on the coastline and the highland climate of Monte Scuro.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|location=Reggio Calabria (1971\u20132000 normals)\n|collapsed = Yes\n<!-- Record high temperatures -->\n<!-- Note that record temperatures should be used sparingly in main city articles, and should only be used when the data period is of the greatest length possible. -->\n|Jan record high C=24.6\n|Feb record high C=25.2\n|Mar record high C=27.0\n|Apr record high C=30.4\n|May record high C=35.2\n|Jun record high C=42.0\n|Jul record high C=44.2\n|Aug record high C=42.4\n|Sep record high C=37.6\n|Oct record high C=34.4\n|Nov record high C=29.9\n|Dec record high C=26.0\n<!-- Average high temperatures -->\n|Jan high C=15.3\n|Feb high C=15.6\n|Mar high C=17.1\n|Apr high C=19.3\n|May high C=23.8\n|Jun high C=27.9\n|Jul high C=31.1\n|Aug high C=31.3\n|Sep high C=28.2\n|Oct high C=23.9\n|Nov high C=19.7\n|Dec high C=16.6\n<!-- Mean daily temperature -->\n|Jan mean C=11.8\n|Feb mean C=11.8\n|Mar mean C=13.0\n|Apr mean C=15.1\n|May mean C=19.2\n|Jun mean C=23.2\n|Jul mean C=26.4\n|Aug mean C=26.7\n|Sep mean C=23.7\n|Oct mean C=19.8\n|Nov mean C=15.9\n|Dec mean C=13.1\n<!-- Average low temperatures -->\n|Jan low C=8.2\n|Feb low C=7.9\n|Mar low C=9.0\n|Apr low C=10.9\n|May low C=14.7\n|Jun low C=18.6\n|Jul low C=21.6\n|Aug low C=22.1\n|Sep low C=19.3\n|Oct low C=15.7\n|Nov low C=12.1\n|Dec low C=9.6\n<!-- Record low temperatures -->\n<!-- Note that record temperatures should be used sparingly in main city articles, and should only be used when the data period is of the greatest length possible. -->\n|Jan record low C=1.0\n|Feb record low C=-0.0\n|Mar record low C=0.0\n|Apr record low C=4.6\n|May record low C=7.8\n|Jun record low C=10.8\n|Jul record low C=14.6\n|Aug record low C=14.4\n|Sep record low C=11.2\n|Oct record low C=6.6\n|Nov record low C=4.4\n|Dec record low C=2.6\n<!-- Total precipitation, this should include rain and snow. -->\n|precipitation colour=green <!-- Enter \"green\" for green precipitation colours, \"none\" for no colours, remove this line for blue colouring. -->\n<!-- IMPORTANT: use mm or cm but NOT both! -->\n|Jan precipitation mm=69.6\n|Feb precipitation mm=61.5\n|Mar precipitation mm=50.7\n|Apr precipitation mm=40.4\n|May precipitation mm=19.8\n|Jun precipitation mm=10.9\n|Jul precipitation mm=7.0\n|Aug precipitation mm=11.9\n|Sep precipitation mm=47.5\n|Oct precipitation mm=72.5\n|Nov precipitation mm=81.7\n|Dec precipitation mm=73.3\n<!-- Average daily % humidity -->\n<!-- If entering the average daily % humidity, then the humidex table should be used.

From van Dijk (1992)<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/>]]\n\nWhen describing the geology of Calabria, it is commonly considered as part of the \"Calabrian Arc\", an arc-shaped geographic domain extending from the southern part of the [[Basilicata]] Region to the northeast of [[Sicily]], and including the [[Peloritani|Peloritano Mountains]] (although some authors extend this domain from [[Naples]] in the north to [[Palermo]] in the southwest). The Calabrian area shows basement (crystalline and metamorphic rocks) of [[Paleozoic]] and younger ages, covered by (mostly Upper) [[Neogene]] sediments. Studies have revealed that these rocks comprise the upper Unit of a pile of thrust sheets which dominate the [[Apennines]] and the Sicilian [[Maghrebides]].<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'>van Dijk, J.P., Bello, M., Brancaleoni, G.P., Cantarella, G., Costa, V., Frixa, A., Golfetto, F., Merlini, S., Riva, M., Toricelli, S., Toscano, C., and Zerilli, A. (2000, a); A new structural model for the northern sector of the Calabrian Arc. Tectonophysics, 324, 267\u2013320.</ref>\n\nThe [[Neogene]] evolution of the Central Mediterranean system is dominated by the migration of the Calabrian Arc to the southeast, overriding the African Plate and its promontories (Argand, 1922;<ref name ='Argand_1922'>Argand, E.

The main tectonic elements of the Calabrian Arc are the Southern Apennines fold-and-thrust belt, the \"Calabria-Peloritani\", or simply Calabrian block and the Sicilian Maghrebides fold-and-thrust belt. The foreland area is formed by the [[Apulia]] Platform, which is part of the [[Adriatic]] Plate, and the [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]] or [[Iblean]] Platform, which is an extension of the African Plate. These platforms are separated by the [[Ionian Basin]]. The [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] oceanized basin is regarded as the [[back-arc basin]]. This [[subduction]] system therefore shows the southern plates of African affinity subducting below the northern plates of European affinity.<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/>\n\nThe geology of Calabria has been studied for more than a century.

Later came the Bruttii from Lucania. These occupied Calabria and called it Bruttium. The Bruttii were very advanced culturally. The Greek cities of Calabria came under the pressure from these [[Lucanians]], an [[Oscan]] people who lived in the present day region of [[Basilicata]]. They conquered the north of Calabria and pushed further south, taking over part of the interior, probably after they defeated the Thurians near Laus in 390 BC. A few decades later Calabria came under pressure from the [[Bruttii]]. They were Lucanian slaves and other fugitives who were seeking refuge on the steep mountains of Calabria. Their name was Lucanian and meant rebels. They took advantage of the weakening of the Greek cites caused by wars between them. They took over Hipponium, Terina and Thurii. They helped the Lucanians to fight [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander of Epirus]] (334\u201332 BC), who had come to the aid of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (in [[Apulia]]), which was also pressured by the Lucanians. After this, [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] ravaged the coast of Calabria with his fleet, took Hipponium and forced the Bruttii into unfavourable peace terms. However, they soon seized Hipponium again. After Agathloces' death in 289 BC the Lucanians and Bruttii pushed into the territory of Thurii and ravaged it. The city sent envoys to Rome to ask for help in 285 BC  and 282 BC. On the second occasion, the Romans sent forces to garrison the city. This was part of the episode which sparked the Pyrrhic war.\n\nDuring the Pyrrhic War (280\u2013275 BC) the Lucanians and Bruttii sided with Pyrrhus and provided contingents which fought with his army. When Pyrrhus landed in Italy the people of Rhegion were worried about their safety and asked Rome for protection. The Romans sent soldiers from [[Campania]] to garrison the city. Coveting the wealth of the city, the soldiers killed its prominent men, sent away the rest and seized their property. The Romans could not do much about it because they were engaged in the war. A few years after the end of the war, in 271 BC, the Romans retook the city, arrested the soldiers and took them to Rome, where they were executed.<ref>Polybius, The Histories, 1.7\u201310</ref> After Pyrrhus was defeated, to avoid Roman revenge, the Bruttii submitted willingly and gave up half of the Sila, a mountainous plateau which was valuable for its pitch and timber. The timber here was sold all over Italy and the resin of the area was of the highest quality.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Histories, 20.5\u20136</ref>\n\nDuring the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC) the Bruttii allied with [[Hannibal]], who sent [[Hanno, son of Bomilcar|Hanno]], one of his commanders, to Calabria. Hanno marched towards [[Capua]] (in Campania) with Bruttian soldiers to take them to Hannibal's headquarters there twice, but he was defeated on both occasions. When his campaign in Italy came to a dead end, Hannibal took refuge in Calabria, whose steep mountains provided protection against the Roman legions.

Many Calabrian cities surrendered.<ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 30.19</ref> Calabria was put under a military commander. Nearly a decade after the war, the Romans set up colonies in Calabria: at Tempsa and Kroton (Croto in Latin) in 194 BC, Copiae in the territory of Thurii (Thurium in Latin) in 193 BC, and Vibo Valentia in the territory of Hipponion in 192 BC.<ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 34.45, 53; 35.40</ref> The Romans called Calabria Bruttium.

He contracted malaria and died in Cosentia ([[Cosenza]]), probably of fever. Legend has it that he along with the treasure of Rome were buried under the bed of the River Busento.<ref>Erik Durschmied, From Armageddon to the Fall of Rome, Ch. 17</ref> With the fall of the western part of the Roman Empire in 476, Italy was taken over by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer and later became part of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in 489. The Ostrogothic kings ruled officially as Magistri Militum of the Byzantine Emperors and all government and administrative positions were held by the Romans while all primary laws were legislated by the Byzantine Emperor. Therefore, during the sixth century, under the Ostrogoths' rule, Romans could still be at the center of government and cultural life, such as the Roman [[Cassiodorus]] who, like Boethius and Symmachus, emerged as one of the most prominent men of his time. He was an administrator, politician, scholar and historian who was born in Scylletium (near Catanzaro). He spent most of his career trying to bridge the divides of East and West, Greek and Latin cultures, Romans and Goths, and official Christianity and [[Arian Christianity]], which was the form of Christianity of the Ostrogoths and which had earlier been banned. He set up his [[Vivarium (monastery)]] in Scylletium. He oversaw the collation of three editions of the Bible in Latin. Seeing the practicality of uniting all the books of the Bible in one volume, he was the first who produced Latin Bibles in single volumes.<ref>Peter Brown, The World of Late Antiquity: AD 150\u2013750.</ref> The most well-known of them was the [[Codex Grandior]] which was the ancestor of all modern western Bibles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xn8i8cLNDM|title=Testament The Bible And History episode 6 Power And Glory part one (1 of 2)|last=TheGreatMysteries|date=3 April 2011|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=204|title=The Scriptorium and Library at the Vivarium : HistoryofInformation.com|website=www.historyofinformation.com}}</ref><ref name=\"faculty.georgetown.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html|title=Cassiodorus, Chapter 6: Vivarium|website=faculty.georgetown.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"faculty.georgetown.edu\"/>\n\nCassiodorus was at the heart of the administration of the Ostrogothic kingdom. Theodoric made him quaestor sacri palatii (quaestor of the sacred palace, the senior legal authority) in 507, governor of Lucania and Bruttium, consul in 514 and magister officiorum (master of offices, one of the most senior administrative officials) in 523. He was praetorian prefect (chief minister) under the successors of Theodoric: under Athalaric (Theodoric's grandson, reigned 526\u201334) in 533 and, between 535 and 537, under Theodahad (Theodoric's nephew, reigned 534\u201336) and Witiges (Theodoric's grandson-in-law, reigned, 536\u201340).<ref>Cassiodorus, Variae, 9.24\u201354, 38\u201339</ref> The major works of Cassiodorus, besides the mentioned bibles, were the Historia Gothorum, a history of the Goths, the Variae and account of his administrative career and the Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum, an introduction to the study of the sacred scriptures and the liberal arts which was very influential in the Middle Ages.\n\n[[Byzantine]] (Eastern Roman) Emperor Justinian I, retook Italy from the Ostrogoths between 535 and 556. They soon lost much of Italy to the [[Lombards]] between 568 and 590, but retained the south for around 500 years until 1059\u20131071, where they thrived and where the Greek language was the official and vernacular language. In Calabria and towns such as [[Stilo]] and [[Rossano]] achieved great religious status.  From the 7th Century many monasteries were built in the Amendolea and Stilaro Valleys and Stilo was the destination of hermits and Basilian monks.  Many Byzantine churches are still seen in the region. The 10th-century church in Rossano is considered one of the best preserved Byzantine churches in Italy. It was built by St. [[Nilus the Younger]] as a retreat for the monks who lived in the tufa grottos underneath.  The present name of Calabria comes from the duchy of Calabria.\n\nAround the year 800, [[Saracen]]s began invading the shores of Calabria, attempting to wrest control of the area from the Byzantines.  This group of Arabs had already been successful [[Emirate of Sicily|in Sicily]] and knew that Calabria was another key spot. The people of Calabria retreated into the mountains for safety. Although the Arabs never really got a stronghold on the whole of Calabria, they did control some villages while enhancing trade relations with the eastern world.<ref name=\"bleedingespresso.com\">{{cite web|url=http://bleedingespresso.com/calabria/history-of-calabria|title=Bleeding Espresso|author=metatags generator|publisher=bleedingespresso.com|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref> In 918, Saracens captured [[Reggio di Calabria|Reggio]] (which was renamed ''Riv\u00e0'') and sold the majority of its population in the slave markets of Sicily and North Africa.<ref>''The Italian Cities and the Arabs before 1095'', Hilmar C.

Of note is that the Normans established their presence here, in southern Italy (namely Calabria), 6 years prior to their conquest of England, (see [[The Battle of Hastings]]).  The purpose of this strategic presence in Calabria was to lay the foundations for the Crusades 30 years later, and for the creation of two Kingdoms: the Kingship of Jerusalem, and the Kingdom of Sicily.  Ships would sail from Calabria to the Holy Land. This made Calabria one of the richest regions in Europe as princes from the noble families of England, France and other regions, constructed secondary residences and palaces here, on their way to the Holy Land. Guiscard's son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], who was born in [[San Marco Argentano]], would be one of the leaders in the first crusade. Of particular note is the [[Via Francigena]], an ancient pilgrim route that goes from Canterbury to Rome and southern Italy, reaching Calabria, Basilicata and Apulia, where the crusaders lived, prayed and trained, respectively.\n\nAt the beginning of the tenth century (circa 903),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.initalytoday.com/calabria/catanzaro/ |title=Catanzaro Italy: Catanzaro guide, city of Catanzaro, Calabria Italy |publisher=Initalytoday.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Calabria was occupied by the Muslim [[Saracens]], who founded an [[emirate]] and took the Arab name of \u0642\u0637\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u2013 QaTanS\u00e1ar. An Arab presence is evidenced by findings at an eighth-century necropolis which had items with Arabic inscriptions.\n\nIn 1098, [[Roger I of Sicily]] was named the equivalent of an apostolic legate by Pope [[Urban II]] and later his son [[Roger II of Sicily]] became the first [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]] and formed what would become the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] which lasted nearly 700 years. Under the Normans Southern Italy was united as one region and started a feudal system of land ownership in which the Normans were made lords of the land while peasants performed all the work on the land.\n\nIn 1194 the Swabians took control under [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. He created a kingdom that blended cultures, philosophy and customs and would build several castles while fortifying existing ones which the Normans previously constructed. After the death of Frederick II in 1250, Calabria was controlled by the French once more, the Angevins, under the rule of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles d\u2019Anjou]] after being granted the crown by Pope Clement IV. Under Charles d\u2019Anjou the Kingdom of Sicily was changed to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] in 1282 after he lost Sicily due to the rebellion of the [[Sicilian Vespers]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> During the 14th century, would emerge [[Barlaam of Seminara]] who would be [[Petrarch]]'s Greek teacher and his disciple [[Leonzio Pilato]], who would translate Homer's works for [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].\n\n===Early modern period===\nIn 1442 the Aragonese took control under [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] who became ruler under the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In 1501 Calabria came under the control of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] who is famed for sponsoring the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492.

This Greek Diaspora allowed the ancient Greek dialects to continue in Southern Italy, much in the same way that the Italian Diaspora allowed long-lost dialects from Italy to thrive in countries where Italians emigrated to. Greek texts were also valued in monasteries and places of learning.  However it was [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century, who made Latin the 'official' language of study and communication for Europe.   For the sake of uniformity, he supplanted much of the Greek spoken, read or taught in Europe. It was through language (Latin) and education (Latin texts) that Charlemagne united Europe.\n\nDuring the 13th century a French chronicler who traveled through Calabria stated that \"the peasants of Calabria spoke nothing but Greek\" given he had traveled to areas where Greek was still available.  But the educated classes spoke Italian. Indeed, formal Italian has been taught in schools throughout Italy for nearly two centuries, causing the ancient languages and dialects to continually disappear, much to the chagrin of the cultural community. These lost dialects continue to thrive to this day in North America and Australia, places where Italians emigrated to, on account of the [[Diaspora]].\n\n== Economy ==\nCalabria enjoys a diversified economy comparable to western nations in various categories, as shown in these statistics: the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Calabria is subdivided as follows: service industry (28.94%), financial activities and real estate (21.09%), trade, tourism, transportation and communication (19.39%), taxation (11.49%), manufacturing (8.77%), construction (6.19%) and agriculture (4.13%). It is one of the least (resort) developed regions in Italy. Its economy is hampered by corruption, tax evasion and organized crime which is mainly run by the [['Ndrangheta]] (the local [[Mafia]] syndicate); the latter has deep connections with some of the local authorities.<ref name=\"newyorktimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/world/europe/in-italy-calabria-is-drained-by-corruption.html |title=In Italy, Calabria is drained by corruption |newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=7 October 2012 |last1=Donadio |first1=Rachel }}</ref>\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nFood and textile industries are the most developed and vibrant. Within the industrial sector, manufacturing contributes to a gross value added of 7.2%. In the manufacturing sector the main branches are foodstuff, beverage and tobacco with a contribution to the sector very close to the national average.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\nOver the recent decades have emerged some petrochemical, engineering and chemical industries, within the areas of [[Crotone]], [[Vibo Valentia]] and [[Reggio Calabria]].\n\n=== Tourism ===\n[[File:Pista Azzurra Gambarie.jpg|thumb|Ski trails near [[Gambarie]] overlooking  the [[Strait of Messina]]]]\nCalabria attracts year-round tourism, offering both summer and winter activities, in addition to its cultural, historical, artistic heritage, it has an abundance of protected natural habitats and 'green' zones.  The {{convert|485|mi|abbr=off}} of its coast make Calabria a tourist destination during the summer. The low industrial development and the lack of major cities in much of its territory have allowed the maintenance of indigenous marine life.\n\nThe most sought-after seaside destinations are: [[Tropea]], [[Pizzo, Calabria|Pizzo Calabro]], [[Capo Vaticano]], [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Soverato]], [[Scilla, Calabria|Scilla,]] [[Scalea]], [[Sellia Marina]], [[Montepaone]], [[Montauro]], Copanello (comune of [[Staletti]]), [[Palmi|Tonnara di Palmi]], [[Diamante, Calabria|Diamante]], [[Paola, Calabria|Paola]], [[Fiumefreddo Bruzio]], [[Amantea]], [[Praia a Mare]], [[Belvedere Marittimo]], [[Roseto Capo Spulico]], [[Corigliano Calabro]], [[Cir\u00f2 Marina]], [[Amendolara]], [[Roccella Ionica]], [[Bagnara Calabra]], [[Nicotera]], [[Cariati]], [[Zambrone]], [[Isola di Capo Rizzuto]], Caminia (comune of [[Staletti]]), [[Siderno]], [[Parghelia]], [[Ricadi]] and [[San Nicola Arcella]].\n\nIn addition to the coastal tourist destinations, the interior of Calabria is rich in history, traditions, art and culture. Cosenza is among the most important cultural cities of Calabria, with a rich historical and artistic patrimony. Medieval castles, towers, churches, monasteries and other French castles and structures from the Norman to the Aragonese periods are common elements in both the interior and coastline of Calabria.\n\nThe mountains offer skiing and other winter activities: [[Sila National Park|Sila]], [[Pollino National Park|Pollino]] and [[Aspromonte]] are three national parks that offer facilities for winter sports, especially in the towns of Camigliatello (comune of [[Spezzano della Sila]]), Lorica (comune of [[San Giovanni in Fiore]]), [[Gambarie]] and Monte Sant'Elia (comune of [[Palmi]]).\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Kalabrien-Olivenernte.JPG|thumb|left|Calabrian olive tree plantations]]\n\nA typical feature is agricultural richness in Calabria.

The Calabrian language is a direct derivative of the Latin language, and is closer to the words spoken in Latin than the standard Italian. Most linguists divide the various [[dialects of Calabria|dialects]] into two different language groups. In the northern one-third of the region, the Calabrian dialects are considered part of the [[Neapolitan language]] (or Southern Italian) and are grouped as Northern Calabrian or ''Cosentino''. In the southern two-thirds of the region, the Calabrian dialects are often grouped as Central and Southern Calabrian. In many respects, the Calabrian dialect is considered very similar to the Puglian/Salentine dialects spoken in Salento, the region situated on the \"heel\" of Italy.\nHowever, in isolated pockets, as well as some quarters of Reggio Calabria a variety of [[Occitan]] can also be found in certain communities and [[French language|French]] has had an influence on many Calabrian words and phrases. In addition, since Calabria was once ruled by the Spanish, some Calabrian dialects exhibit [[Spanish language|Spanish]] derivatives.\nAnother important linguistic minority is present in the nine towns of [[Bovesia|Boves\u00eca]], in the province of [[Reggio Calabria]]. It is a derivative of [[Ancient Greek|ancient Greek]] with influences of [[Calabrian dialect]], belonging to the ancient [[Byzantine Empire|Bizantine]] dominations<ref>https://eu.greekreporter.com/2019/12/10/calabrian-greek-a-language-on-the-brink-of-extinction/</ref>.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Calabria}}\n[[File:Reggio calabria duomo.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of Reggio Calabria]]\nThe majority of Calabrians are [[Roman Catholic]].

Calabria also has another patron saint called Saint [[Bruno of Cologne]] who was the founder of the [[Carthusian]] Order. Saint Bruno would build the charterhouse of [[Serra San Bruno]], a town which bears his name, in 1095 and later die there in 1101.\n\nEven though it is currently a very small community, there has been a long history of the presence of [[Jews]] in Calabria. The Jews have had a presence in the region for at least 1600 years and possibly as much as 2300 years. Calabrian Jews have had notably influence on many areas of Jewish life and culture. Although virtually identical to the Jews of Sicily, the Jews of Calabria are considered a distinct Jewish population due to historical and geographic considerations. There is a small community of Italian [[Anusim]] who have resumed the [[Jewish]] faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishroots.it/|title=Center for the Study of Jewry in Calabria and Sicily|accessdate=11 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612053046/http://www.jewishroots.it/|archivedate=12 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIt is important to highlight the presence of Calabrians in [[Renaissance humanism]] and in the [[Renaissance]]. Indeed, the Hellenistics in this period frequently came from Calabria maybe because of the Greek influence. The rediscovery of Ancient Greek was very difficult because this language had been almost forgotten. In this period the presence of Calabrian humanists or refugees from Constantinople was fundamental. The study of Ancient Greek, in this period, was mainly a work of two monks of the monastery of [[Seminara]]: [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]], [[bishop of Gerace]], and his disciple, [[Leonzio Pilato]]. [[Leonzio Pilato]], in particular, was a Calabrian born near [[Reggio Calabria]]. He was an important teacher of Ancient Greek and translator, and he helped [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in the translations of [[Homer]]'s works.\n\n== Cuisine ==\n{{See also|Calabrian wine}}\n[[File:'Nduja.JPG|thumb|''[['Nduja]]'']]\nThe cuisine is a typical southern Italian [[Mediterranean cuisine]] with a balance between meat-based dishes (pork, lamb, goat), vegetables (especially [[eggplant]]), and fish. Pasta (as in Central Italy and the rest of Southern Italy) is also very important in Calabria. In contrast to most other Italian regions, Calabrians have traditionally placed an emphasis on the preservation of their food and packing vegetables and meats in [[olive oil]]. Also making sausages and cold cuts ([[Sopressata]], [['Nduja]], [[Capicola|Capocollo]]), along the coast curing fish \u2013 especially [[swordfish]], [[sardine]]s (''sardelle rosamarina'') and [[cod]] ([[Baccal\u00e0]]). Local desserts are typically fried, honey-sweetened pastries ''Cudduraci'', Nacatole, ''Scalille'' or ''scalidde'' or baked [[biscotti]]-type treats (such as '''nzudda'').\n\nSome local specialties include [[Caciocavallo]] Cheese, ''[[Cipolla rossa di Tropea]]'' (red onion), ''[[Fr\u00ecttuli]]'' and ''[[Curc\u00f9ci]]'' (fried pork), [[Liquorice]] (''liquirizia''), ''[[Lagane e Cicciari]]'' (a pasta dish with [[chickpea]]s), [[Pecorino Crotonese]] (Cheese of Sheep), and [[Pignolata]].\n\nIn ancient times Calabria was referred to as ''Enotria'' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u039f\u1f30\u03bd\u03c9\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}}, ''{{transl|grc|[[Oenotria]]}}'', \"land of wine\").

The announcement of the winner has coincided with the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] weekend, with an award ceremony the following Wednesday which was hosted by the Detroit Rotary Club at the [[Detroit Athletic Club]] through 2013.<ref name=\"The Award Selection Process\"/> Beginning with the 2014 award to Odyssey Sims of Baylor University, the Nancy Lieberman Award has been presented by the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Final Four proceedings, and is now presented at the annual convention of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA).\n\nThe 2017\u201318 season started a new era for the award. Since that season, the WBCA has partnered with the Naismith Hall in the presentation of the award. The two bodies also incorporated the Lieberman Award into a new set of awards known as the \"Naismith Starting Five\", presented at the WBCA convention (except in 2020, when the convention was not held due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]) to players at each of the five traditional basketball positions. These awards parallel a previously existing set of men's basketball positional awards also presented by the Hall. The other four are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wbca.org/recognize/player-awards/naismith-starting-5 |title=Naismith Starting 5 |publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association |accessdate=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Ann Meyers Drysdale Award|Ann Meyers Drysdale Shooting Guard Award]]\n* [[Cheryl Miller Award|Cheryl Miller Small Forward Award]]\n* [[Katrina McClain Award|Katrina McClain Power Forward Award]]\n* [[Lisa Leslie Award|Lisa Leslie Center Award]]\n\nThe voting body for the Lieberman Award also changed upon its incorporation into the Naismith Starting Five. Each of the Starting Five awards is now determined by a selection committee consisting of Hall of Famers, WBCA coaching members, and media, and headed by the award's namesake. Fan voting through the Hall's website is also incorporated into the selection process.\n\n[[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]] is the only program that has produced more than one Lieberman Award recipient, having had four players combine for a total of eight awards (Bird, [[Diana Taurasi]], [[Renee Montgomery]], and [[Moriah Jefferson]]). The only other programs with more than one award, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball|Notre Dame]] and [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]], have each had a single player win all of that program's awards, respectively [[Skylar Diggins-Smith|Skylar Diggins]] (twice) and Ionescu (three times).\n\n==Key==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |*\n|Awarded, in addition, a national Player of the Year award: <br>the [[Naismith College Player of the Year]], [[Wade Trophy]] or the [[John R.

The announcement of the winner has coincided with the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] weekend, with an award ceremony the following Wednesday which was hosted by the Detroit Rotary Club at the [[Detroit Athletic Club]] through 2013.<ref name=\"The Award Selection Process\"/> Beginning with the 2014 award to Odyssey Sims of Baylor University, the Nancy Lieberman Award has been presented by the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Final Four proceedings, and is now presented at the annual convention of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA).\n\nThe 2017\u201318 season started a new era for the award. Since that season, the WBCA has partnered with the Naismith Hall in the presentation of the award. The two bodies also incorporated the Lieberman Award into a new set of awards known as the \"Naismith Starting Five\", presented at the WBCA convention (except in 2020, when the convention was not held due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]) to players at each of the five traditional basketball positions. These awards parallel a previously existing set of men's basketball positional awards also presented by the Hall. The other four are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wbca.org/recognize/player-awards/naismith-starting-5 |title=Naismith Starting 5 |publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association |accessdate=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Ann Meyers Drysdale Award|Ann Meyers Drysdale Shooting Guard Award]]\n* [[Cheryl Miller Award|Cheryl Miller Small Forward Award]]\n* [[Katrina McClain Award|Katrina McClain Power Forward Award]]\n* [[Lisa Leslie Award|Lisa Leslie Center Award]]\n\nThe voting body for the Lieberman Award also changed upon its incorporation into the Naismith Starting 5. Each of the Starting 5 awards is now determined by a selection committee consisting of Hall of Famers, WBCA coaching members, and media, and headed by the award's namesake. Fan voting through the Hall's website is also incorporated into the selection process.\n\n[[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]] is the only program that has produced more than one Lieberman Award recipient, having had four players combine for a total of eight awards (Bird, [[Diana Taurasi]], [[Renee Montgomery]], and [[Moriah Jefferson]]). The only other programs with more than one award, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball|Notre Dame]] and [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]], have each had a single player win all of that program's awards, respectively [[Skylar Diggins-Smith|Skylar Diggins]] (twice) and Ionescu (three times).\n\n==Key==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |*\n|Awarded, in addition, a national Player of the Year award: <br>the [[Naismith College Player of the Year]], [[Wade Trophy]] or the [[John R.

It is the third polytechnic established in the country. As an industry-focused alternative to a broader based [[Junior college (Singapore)|junior college]]/ pre-university education, polytechnic graduates in Singapore are sought after for work or well-prepared to complete [[university]] degrees. In contrast to polytechnics in the United States and the UK, polytechnics in Singapore admit the majority of their students after [[secondary school]], normally at the age of 16-17(before receiving high school education), which is after ten years of formal education. A diploma in a specialised area of study, for example Law & Management, is awarded after completing three years of academic studies and industry internship.\n\nEstablished on April 6, 1990, the campus of the institute sits on a 30 hectare plot near the [[Bedok Reservoir]] in the eastern part of Singapore. Temasek Polytechnic features 37 full-time and > 40 part-time diploma courses, spread over 6 academic schools. Currently Temasek Polytechnic has approx. 14,000 full-time students and more than 1,200 academic and administrative staff.\n\n==History==\n\n===1989-1995===\nIn June 1989, [[Tony Tan (Singaporean president)|Dr Tony Tan]], then the Minister of Education, announced that a third polytechnic is being considered and in April, 1990, Temasek Polytechnic was established with an initial enrolment of 735 students. The institute originally set up at Baharuddin Vocational Institute's premises at Stirling Road and the vacated premises of Raffles Institution at Grange Road. Due to increased enrolment and the introduction of new courses, three more campuses at Kim Seng, Bukit Merah and Portsdown Road were acquired to house the institutes' student population.\n\n===1995: Moving to a permanent location===\nIn September, 1995, the permanent campus for Temasek Polytechnic was completed and it moved to its current location in the town of [[Tampines]].\n\n===2012-present: Logo redesign, construction of foyer===\nTemasek Polytechnic underwent a logo redesign, sporting a fresh new look to reflect the vibrancy of the school. The TP Auditorium Foyer began construction in 2010 and was completed in 2013. McDonald's, Subway, and Cheers are available to both staff and the general public.\n\n==Academic==\n===Academic Schools===\n*School of Applied Science\n*School of Business\n*School of Design\n*School of Engineering\n*School of Humanities & Social Sciences\n*School of Informatics & IT\n\nTemasek Polytechnic offers 37 full-time diploma courses in the areas of applied sciences, business, design, engineering, humanities & social sciences, and informatics & IT.\n\n===The TP Student Profile and the TP Fundamentals Curriculum===\nIn 2017, TP adopted the TP Student Profile (TSP) that comprises nine desired attributes which together spell out how TP endeavours to develop each student into a Lifelong Learner, Future-oriented Creator and Values-Centred Leader. A set of subjects, collectively known as the TP Fundamentals (TPFun) curriculum was created concurrently to instil these TSP attributes in all our students and prepare them for the New Economy. TPFun focuses on imparting key skills including leadership, communication, critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurship, which industries in this economy require. In addition, students will develop a more global mindset, build resilience through learning and playing a sport, and even gain knowledge and skills for healthy living.\n\n===Global Exposure===\nIn today's highly globalised economy, it is one of TP's main priorities to arm our graduates with the necessary skills to help them turn into world-savvy individuals. We are the only polytechnic in Singapore to have a Centre for TransCultural Studies, which works to create opportunities for our students to have cross-cultural experiences, both locally and overseas. Opportunities to acquire international experiences via learning trips, overseas internships and exchanges, as well as community involvement programmes are theirs for the taking.\n\n===Internships===\nInternships give our students real-world work experience, and is a cornerstone of the polytechnic teaching system. Generally ranging between 12 and 26 weeks, TP's internship programme exposes our students to the ins and outs of the very industry they will be a part of after they graduate. Our extensive industry networks give our students access to a wide range of businesses and academic institutions, both in Singapore and abroad. Some of them have enjoyed once-in-a-lifetime internship experiences working with world-renowned companies, such as Airbus in France, Disney World in the US and the Four Seasons Safari Lodge in Tanzania, while others have been involved with leading researchers at prestigious universities and research institutions around the world.\n\n===Advanced Standing===\nUniversities that recognise the TP diploma may grant advanced standing to you, depending on your academic achievements, sometimes for up to two years. This means that with a TP diploma, you spend a shorter time pursuing your degree at a university. Some of our students with a two-year advanced standing only need two years to complete a four-year honours degree course. Our graduates have done very well at local and overseas universities, with many getting good honours degrees in their fields. Many have also gone on to pursue their Masters and PhD programmes. More than half of our graduates go on to pursue a university degree immediately after graduation, or after National Service. Many more do so following some work experience.\n\n===SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes===\nOur graduates can sign-up for Earn and Learn Programmes (ELP) \u2013 a work-study programme designed to give Singapore Citizens or PRs, who are fresh polytechnic or ITE graduates, a head-start in careers related to their discipline of studies. The ELP supports the participants\u2019 transition into the workforce by allowing them to secure full-time employment with industry leaders. It is also an opportunity for these graduates to build on the skills and knowledge within their respective specialisations after graduating from TP.\n\n==Campus Facilities==\n===Training Facilities===\nGetting trained at cutting-edge facilities, such as the TP-Nvidia Technology Centre, TP-Autodesk Serious Games Hub, Agilent Partner Laboratory @ TP, Interactive Digital Centre Asia and TP-Lufthansa Technical Training Centre Singapore, is an advantage students can look forward to when they join TP. Developed in partnership with various industry sectors, these facilities keep our students up-to-date with the most current operations platforms and the latest developments and practices.\n\n===State-of-the-art learning enterprises===\nIn addition to these facilities, our campus also has a range of Learning Enterprises that mimic actual business working environments. The TP-IBM IT Service Management Centre, the TP-Thomson Reuters Financial Risk Management Centre, TopTable (a fine-dining restaurant), Kelly Services Career Centre and the TP Animal Clinic, amongst others, provide our students with the opportunity to put to practice what they have learned through interacting with and servicing real customers.\n\n==Campus features==\n[[File:Temasek Polytechnic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Main entrance of Temasek Polytechnic]]\nTemasek Polytechnic's campus was designed by architect [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]]. The campus has 61 lecture theaters, a convention centre, canteens, auditoria, an amphitheatre, laboratories and training facilities, a large library, sporting facilities, and 13 food outlets including three caf\u00e9s, three F&B outlets and an air-conditioned food court.\n\nThe Temasek Aviation Academy was opened in 2014 in the School of Engineering . The 6000 square metre facility houses a [[Hawker 700]] private jet, specialised laboratories, and specialized training equipment for the aerospace diploma courses.<ref>https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools/bus/stop-press/news/more-new-buildings-on-campus</ref>\n\n==Former lecturer convicted of fraud==\nOn 30 May 2017, American Mikhy K. Farrera-Brochez was sentenced to 28 months jail for cheating, lying to a public servant, possessing drugs and using forged educational certificates to gain employment as a [[lecturer]] in early childhood and psychology for Temasek Polytechnic. Farrera-Brochez, who is [[HIV-positive]], moved to Singapore in 2008 and successfully applied for an employment pass in 2009 by faking his HIV blood test result with the aid from his boyfriend Ler Teck Siang who was on duty as a [[general practitioner]] at the clinic. Investigations further revealed his educational certificates, including a [[doctorate degree]] in [[psychology]] and education from the [[University of Paris]], were forged.<ref>http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/us-lecturer-jailed-28-months-spore-lying-about-hiv-status-qualifications</ref> In an interview with [[The New Paper]] in 2010, he claimed to be well-versed in Hebrew, English and Spanish and that he entered [[Princeton University]] at 13 before transferring to [[Vanderbilt University]] as the latter was better in [[linguistic]] courses.<ref>https://sg.news.yahoo.com/everything-must-know-low-life-103606966.html</ref> He also claimed that his mother, Teresa King, a renowned professor of child and adolescent psychology, child neurology and gifted science and mathematics education in the UK was responsible for his success. This claim was later proven to be false by UK mainstream media, [[The Independent]].<ref>{{cite news |title=HIV data leak: 'Mikhy Brochez' Facebook account removed for violating user policies |url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/hiv-data-leak-mikhy-brochez-facebook-account-removed-violating-user-policies-141005120.html |work=sg.news.yahoo.com |date=14 February 2019 |language=en-SG}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 January 2019, after being deported back to the United States, Farrera-Brochez released confidential information of 14,200 individuals diagnosed with the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] in Singapore that he had obtained from Ler when he was the head of the National Public Health Unit in the [[Ministry of Health]].<ref>http://redwiretimes.com/singapore-in-brief/health-ministry-records-of-14200-hiv-patients-illegally-obtained-in-2016-leaked-online/</ref><ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47027867\n</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\n* In 2018, students designed and built a [[Proton Exchange Membrane]]-power unit, successfully powering both an [[UAV]] and an electric bicycle using the same unit, thought to be a world-first.<ref>http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/polys-fuel-cell-bet-pays-off</ref>\n* The School of Design is a three-time winner of the Crowbar Awards 'Institution of the Year' and 'Best of Show' for the year 2017, 2018 and most recently 2019.

It is the third polytechnic established in the country. As an industry-focused alternative to a broader based [[Junior college (Singapore)|junior college]]/ pre-university education, polytechnic graduates in Singapore are sought after for work or well-prepared to complete [[university]] degrees. In contrast to polytechnics in the United States and the UK, polytechnics in Singapore admit the majority of their students after [[secondary school]], normally at the age of 16-17(before receiving high school education), which is after ten years of formal education. A diploma in a specialised area of study, for example Law & Management, is awarded after completing three years of academic studies and industry internship.\n\nEstablished on April 6, 1990, the campus of the institute sits on a 30 hectare plot near the [[Bedok Reservoir]] in the eastern part of Singapore. Temasek Polytechnic features 37 full-time and > 40 part-time diploma courses, spread over 6 academic schools. Currently Temasek Polytechnic has approx. 14,000 full-time students and more than 1,200 academic and administrative staff.\n\n==History==\n\n===1989-1995===\nIn June 1989, [[Tony Tan (Singaporean president)|Dr Tony Tan]], then the Minister of Education, announced that a third polytechnic is being considered and in April, 1990, Temasek Polytechnic was established with an initial enrolment of 735 students. The institute originally set up at Baharuddin Vocational Institute's premises at Stirling Road and the vacated premises of Raffles Institution at Grange Road. Due to increased enrolment and the introduction of new courses, three more campuses at Kim Seng, Bukit Merah and Portsdown Road were acquired to house the institutes' student population.\n\n===1995: Moving to a permanent location===\nIn September, 1995, the permanent campus for Temasek Polytechnic was completed and it moved to its current location in the town of [[Tampines]].\n\n===2012-present: Logo redesign, construction of foyer===\nTemasek Polytechnic underwent a logo redesign, sporting a fresh new look to reflect the vibrancy of the school. The TP Auditorium Foyer began construction in 2010 and was completed in 2013. McDonald's, Subway, and Cheers are available to both staff and the general public.\n\n==Academic==\n===Academic Schools===\n*School of Applied Science\n*School of Business\n*School of Design\n*School of Engineering\n*School of Humanities & Social Sciences\n*School of Informatics & IT\n*Temasek Tourism Academy (TTA)\n\nTemasek Polytechnic offers 37 full-time diploma courses in the areas of applied sciences, business, design, engineering, humanities & social sciences, and informatics & IT.\n\n===Polytechnic Foundation Programme===\nThe Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) was introduced in 2011 for students in the Normal Academic stream to be offered an opportunity to gain direct entry into Polytechnic diploma programmes with their 'N' level certifications starting from 2012 onwards. Top students of the cohort each year would be offered the programme to skip their 'O' level studies and instead enrol into a polytechnic of their choice to complete a foundation year before embarking on their respective diploma programmes. During the foundation year, students would take introductory modules that would expose them to their courses of studies so that they would cope better in their first year. There is no GPA requirement to advance to Year 1, as long as students pass all of their modules during Year 0. Although they would also be graded in Year 0, the GPA will not count towards their cumulative GPA when Year 1 commences.\n\nThe Centre for Foundation Studies (CFS) in Temasek Polytechnic was established in 2011 for students admitted into their PFP studies (Year 0).\n\n==Courses offered==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School of Applied Science\n!School of Business\n!School of Design\n!School of Engineering\n!School of Humanities & Social Sciences\n!School of Informatics & IT\n!School of Temasek Tourism Academy\n|-\n| Chemical Engineering || Accountancy & Finance || Apparel Design & Merchandising || Aerospace Electronics || Early Childhood Development & Education || Big Data & Analytics || Hospitality & Tourism Management\n|-\n| Food, Nutrition & Culinary Science || Business Studies || Communication Design || Aerospace Engineering || Psychology Studies || Common ICT Programme || Leisure & Events Management\n|-\n| Medical Biotechnology || Common Business Programme || Digital Film & Television || Aviation Management || Social Sciences in Gerontology || Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics || \n|-\n| Pharmaceutical Science || Communications & Media Management || Interior Architecture & Design || Biomedical Engineering ||  || Financial Business Informatics || \n|-\n| Veterinary Technology || Law & Management || Product & Industrial Design || Business Process & Systems Engineering ||  || Game Design & Development || \n|-\n|  || Logistics & Operations Management ||  || Clean Energy ||  || Information Technology || \n|-\n|  || Marketing ||  || Common Engineering Programme ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  || Culinary & Catering Management ||  || Computer Engineering ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Electronics Engineering ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Green Building & Sustainability ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Integrated Facility Management ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Mechatronics ||  ||  || \n|}\n\n===The TP Student Profile and the TP Fundamentals Curriculum===\nIn 2017, TP adopted the TP Student Profile (TSP) that comprises nine desired attributes which together spell out how TP endeavours to develop each student into a Lifelong Learner, Future-oriented Creator and Values-Centred Leader. A set of subjects, collectively known as the TP Fundamentals (TPFun) curriculum was created concurrently to instil these TSP attributes in all our students and prepare them for the New Economy. TPFun focuses on imparting key skills including leadership, communication, critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurship, which industries in this economy require. In addition, students will develop a more global mindset, build resilience through learning and playing a sport, and even gain knowledge and skills for healthy living.\n\n===Global Exposure===\nIn today's highly globalised economy, it is one of TP's main priorities to arm our graduates with the necessary skills to help them turn into world-savvy individuals. We are the only polytechnic in Singapore to have a Centre for TransCultural Studies, which works to create opportunities for our students to have cross-cultural experiences, both locally and overseas. Opportunities to acquire international experiences via learning trips, overseas internships and exchanges, as well as community involvement programmes are theirs for the taking.\n\n===Internships===\nInternships give our students real-world work experience, and is a cornerstone of the polytechnic teaching system. Generally ranging between 12 and 26 weeks, TP's internship programme exposes our students to the ins and outs of the very industry they will be a part of after they graduate. Our extensive industry networks give our students access to a wide range of businesses and academic institutions, both in Singapore and abroad. Some of them have enjoyed once-in-a-lifetime internship experiences working with world-renowned companies, such as Airbus in France, Disney World in the US and the Four Seasons Safari Lodge in Tanzania, while others have been involved with leading researchers at prestigious universities and research institutions around the world.\n\n===Advanced Standing===\nUniversities that recognise the TP diploma may grant advanced standing to you, depending on your academic achievements, sometimes for up to two years. This means that with a TP diploma, you spend a shorter time pursuing your degree at a university. Some of our students with a two-year advanced standing only need two years to complete a four-year honours degree course. Our graduates have done very well at local and overseas universities, with many getting good honours degrees in their fields. Many have also gone on to pursue their Masters and PhD programmes. More than half of our graduates go on to pursue a university degree immediately after graduation, or after National Service. Many more do so following some work experience.\n\n===SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes===\nOur graduates can sign-up for Earn and Learn Programmes (ELP) \u2013 a work-study programme designed to give Singapore Citizens or PRs, who are fresh polytechnic or ITE graduates, a head-start in careers related to their discipline of studies. The ELP supports the participants\u2019 transition into the workforce by allowing them to secure full-time employment with industry leaders. It is also an opportunity for these graduates to build on the skills and knowledge within their respective specialisations after graduating from TP.\n\n==Campus Facilities==\n===Training Facilities===\nGetting trained at cutting-edge facilities, such as the TP-Nvidia Technology Centre, TP-Autodesk Serious Games Hub, Agilent Partner Laboratory @ TP, Interactive Digital Centre Asia and TP-Lufthansa Technical Training Centre Singapore, is an advantage students can look forward to when they join TP. Developed in partnership with various industry sectors, these facilities keep our students up-to-date with the most current operations platforms and the latest developments and practices.\n\n===State-of-the-art learning enterprises===\nIn addition to these facilities, our campus also has a range of Learning Enterprises that mimic actual business working environments. The TP-IBM IT Service Management Centre, the TP-Thomson Reuters Financial Risk Management Centre, TopTable (a fine-dining restaurant), Kelly Services Career Centre and the TP Animal Clinic, amongst others, provide our students with the opportunity to put to practice what they have learned through interacting with and servicing real customers.\n\n==Campus features==\n[[File:Temasek Polytechnic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Main entrance of Temasek Polytechnic]]\nTemasek Polytechnic's campus was designed by architect [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]]. The campus has 61 lecture theaters, a convention centre, canteens, auditoria, an amphitheatre, laboratories and training facilities, a large library, sporting facilities, and 13 food outlets including three caf\u00e9s, three F&B outlets and an air-conditioned food court.\n\nThe Temasek Aviation Academy was opened in 2014 in the School of Engineering . The 6000 square metre facility houses a [[Hawker 700]] private jet, specialised laboratories, and specialized training equipment for the aerospace diploma courses.<ref>https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools/bus/stop-press/news/more-new-buildings-on-campus</ref>\n\n==Former lecturer convicted of fraud==\nOn 30 May 2017, American Mikhy K. Farrera-Brochez was sentenced to 28 months jail for cheating, lying to a public servant, possessing drugs and using forged educational certificates to gain employment as a [[lecturer]] in early childhood and psychology for Temasek Polytechnic. Farrera-Brochez, who is [[HIV-positive]], moved to Singapore in 2008 and successfully applied for an employment pass in 2009 by faking his HIV blood test result with the aid from his boyfriend Ler Teck Siang who was on duty as a [[general practitioner]] at the clinic. Investigations further revealed his educational certificates, including a [[doctorate degree]] in [[psychology]] and education from the [[University of Paris]], were forged.<ref>http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/us-lecturer-jailed-28-months-spore-lying-about-hiv-status-qualifications</ref> In an interview with [[The New Paper]] in 2010, he claimed to be well-versed in Hebrew, English and Spanish and that he entered [[Princeton University]] at 13 before transferring to [[Vanderbilt University]] as the latter was better in [[linguistic]] courses.<ref>https://sg.news.yahoo.com/everything-must-know-low-life-103606966.html</ref> He also claimed that his mother, Teresa King, a renowned professor of child and adolescent psychology, child neurology and gifted science and mathematics education in the UK was responsible for his success.

The Golden Set winner is the team that first obtains 15 points, provided that the points difference between the two teams is at least 2 points (thus, the Golden Set is similar to a tiebreak set in a normal match).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cev.lu/Competition-Area/Competition.aspx?ID=741&PID=-1|title=2015 CEV Volleyball Challenge Cup - Women - Format|website=[[European Volleyball Confederation|CEV]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922020315/http://www.cev.lu/Competition-Area/competition.aspx?ID=741&PID=-1|archive-date=22 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cev.lu/Competition-Area/CompetitionNews.aspx?ID=741&NewsID=17659&TagType=0&TagContent=0&NewsType=0&Paging=3&Sd=1/1/1900&Ed=1/1/1900|title=European Cups DOL sets stage for exciting season ahead|website=[[European Volleyball Confederation|CEV]]|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n;Round composition\n* 1st Round: 6 teams\n* 2nd Round: 1st Round winners (3 teams) + 29 teams\n* 16th Final: 2nd Round winners (16 teams) + 14 teams from [[2014\u201315 Women's CEV Cup#16th Final|CEV Cup]]\n* 8th Final onwards: winners\n\n==Participating teams==\n*A total of 49 teams participated, 35 were allocated direct places and 14 joined from the [[2014\u201315 Women's CEV Cup|Women's CEV Cup]] entering at the 'Main phase'.<ref name=DOL/> \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!rowspan=2|Country\n!colspan=3|No. teams\n!rowspan=2|Teams\n|-\n!{{Tooltip|Vac|Qualified via vacancies allocation}}\n!{{Tooltip|Cev|Qualified via CEV Cup}}\n!Total\n|-\n|{{AUT}}||align=\"center\"|3||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|5|| [[ASK\u00d6 Linz-Steg]]{{ref|1|1}} <br /> [[ATSC Sparkasse Klagenfurt]]{{ref|1|1}} <br /> [[SVS Post Schwechat]] <br /> [[Ti Meraner Volley Innsbruck]] <br /> [[UVC Holding Graz]]\n|-\n|{{SUI}}||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|4|| [[Kanti Schaffhausen]] <br /> [[Neuch\u00e2tel Universit\u00e9 Club Volleyball|Sagres Neuch\u00e2tel UC]]{{ref|1|1}} <br /> [[TSV D\u00fcdingen]] <br /> [[Volley K\u00f6niz]]{{ref|1|1}}\n|-\n|{{HUN}}||align=\"center\"|3||align=\"center\"|-||align=\"center\"|3|| [[Linamar B\u00e9k\u00e9scsabai RSE]] <br /> [[Teva G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u00f5]] <br /> [[Vasas SC|Vasas Obuda Budapest]]\n|-\n|{{NED}}||align=\"center\"|3||align=\"center\"|-||align=\"center\"|3|| [[Alterno|Alterno Apeldoorn]] <br /> [[Sliedrecht Sport]] <br /> [[VC Sneek]]\n|-\n|{{BEL}}||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|1||align=\"center\"|3|| [[Asterix Kieldrecht]] <br /> [[VC Oudegem]] <br /> [[VDK Gent Dames]]{{ref|1|1}}\n|-\n|{{ROU}}||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|1||align=\"center\"|3|| [[CSM Bucure\u0219ti (women's volleyball)|C.S.M.

Each team played a home and an away match with result points awarded for each leg (3 points for 3\u20130 or 3\u20131 wins, 2 points for 3\u20132 win, 1 point for 2\u20133 loss). After two legs, the team with the most result points advanced to the next round. In case the teams were tied after two legs, a {{em|Golden Set}} was played immediately at the completion of the second leg. The Golden Set winner is the team that first obtains 15 points, provided that the points difference between the two teams is at least 2 points (thus, the Golden Set is similar to a tiebreak set in a normal match).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cev.lu/Competition-Area/Competition.aspx?ID=741&PID=-1|title=2015 CEV Volleyball Challenge Cup - Women - Format|website=[[European Volleyball Confederation|CEV]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922020315/http://www.cev.lu/Competition-Area/competition.aspx?ID=741&PID=-1|archive-date=22 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cev.lu/Competition-Area/CompetitionNews.aspx?ID=741&NewsID=17659&TagType=0&TagContent=0&NewsType=0&Paging=3&Sd=1/1/1900&Ed=1/1/1900|title=European Cups DOL sets stage for exciting season ahead|website=[[European Volleyball Confederation|CEV]]|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n;Round composition\n* 1st Round: 6 teams\n* 2nd Round: 1st Round winners (3 teams) + 29 teams\n* 16th Final: 2nd Round winners (16 teams) + 14 teams from [[2014\u201315 Women's CEV Cup#16th Final|CEV Cup]]\n* 8th Final onwards: winners\n\n==Participating teams==\n*A total of 49 teams participated, 35 were allocated direct places and 14 joined from the [[2014\u201315 Women's CEV Cup|Women's CEV Cup]] entering at the 'Main phase'.<ref name=DOL/> \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!rowspan=2|Country\n!colspan=3|No. teams\n!rowspan=2|Teams\n|-\n!{{Tooltip|Vac|Qualified via vacancies allocation}}\n!{{Tooltip|Cev|Qualified via CEV Cup}}\n!Total\n|-\n|{{AUT}}||align=\"center\"|3||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|5|| [[ASK\u00d6 Linz-Steg]]{{ref|1|1}} <br /> [[ATSC Sparkasse Klagenfurt]]{{ref|1|1}} <br /> [[SVS Post Schwechat]] <br /> [[Ti Meraner Volley Innsbruck]] <br /> [[UVC Holding Graz]]\n|-\n|{{SUI}}||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|4|| [[Kanti Schaffhausen]] <br /> [[Neuch\u00e2tel Universit\u00e9 Club Volleyball|Sagres Neuch\u00e2tel UC]]{{ref|1|1}} <br /> [[TSV D\u00fcdingen]] <br /> [[Volley K\u00f6niz]]{{ref|1|1}}\n|-\n|{{HUN}}||align=\"center\"|3||align=\"center\"|-||align=\"center\"|3|| [[Linamar B\u00e9k\u00e9scsabai RSE]] <br /> [[Teva G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u00f5]] <br /> [[Vasas SC|Vasas Obuda Budapest]]\n|-\n|{{NED}}||align=\"center\"|3||align=\"center\"|-||align=\"center\"|3|| [[Alterno|Alterno Apeldoorn]] <br /> [[Sliedrecht Sport]] <br /> [[VC Sneek]]\n|-\n|{{BEL}}||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|1||align=\"center\"|3|| [[Asterix Kieldrecht]] <br /> [[VC Oudegem]] <br /> [[VDK Gent Dames]]{{ref|1|1}}\n|-\n|{{ROU}}||align=\"center\"|2||align=\"center\"|1||align=\"center\"|3|| [[CSM Bucure\u0219ti (women's volleyball)|C.S.M.

A demo of the song, sung by a background singer, impressed director [[Tony Scott]] and producers [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Don Simpson]], who decided to film more romantic scenes between [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Kelly McGillis]] to feature the song.<ref name=80s>{{cite web |url=http://oldschool.tblog.com/post/1971245511 |title=Back to the 80s: Interview with Tom Whitlock, co-writer of 'Take My Breath Away' & more |website=Kickin' it Old School |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702143922/http://oldschool.tblog.com/post/1971245511 |archivedate=July 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe song was first offered to [[The Motels]], who much later released their original demo, which is fairly similar to Berlin's released version, on their compilation album ''[[Anthologyland]]'' (2001).<ref>{{cite web|title=Liner notes of Martha Davis and The Motels: Anthologyland|url=http://themotels.com/2013/06/05/take-my-breath-away-demo/|access-date=2014-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125225439/http://themotels.com/2013/06/05/take-my-breath-away-demo/|archive-date=2016-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Columbia Records]] suggested some of their signed artists, but eventually Moroder thought of the band [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], whose song \"[[No More Words (Berlin song)|No More Words]]\" he had produced.
