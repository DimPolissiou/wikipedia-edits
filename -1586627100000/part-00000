(See [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|here]] for other de Soto contactees) In the 18th century, the French arrived on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and built a fort at what became [[Mobile, Alabama]].\n\nThe ''Alibamu'' and ''Koasati'' tribes were part of the [[Creek Confederacy]]. They had less contact with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] settlers than other [[Creek people|Creek tribes]] did.  They were the first to leave when British settlers swarmed into the area by the middle of the 18th century, after the land was ceded by the French following the British victory in the [[French and Indian War]].  Under pressure as well by Native American enemies, the Alabama and Coushatta tribes wanted to avoid the powerful [[Choctaw]] in present-day [[Mississippi]]. They moved into territories of future states, first into [[Louisiana]] and then into [[Texas]].\n\nIn 1795, the Coushatta arrived in the Big Thicket area of East Texas. In 1805, nearly 1,000 Alabama came to [[Tyler County, Texas|Tyler County]]'s Peach Tree Village in East Texas. The two tribes developed a strong friendship as they roamed and hunted their new land together. In the early 19th century, the Texas Congress granted each tribe two strips of land along the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]]. Their land was soon taken over by European-American settlers, leaving them homeless.  [[Sam Houston]], the governor of Texas, recommended that the state purchase {{convert|1280|acre|km2}} for the Alabamas.  Although money was appropriated to buy {{convert|640|acre|km2}} for the Coushatta, the land was never bought. Either through marriage or special permission, many Coushatta went to live on the land given to the Alabama.  Other Coushatta had stayed in an area in southern Louisiana near the Red River. Many of their descendants are enrolled members of the federally recognized Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana.\n\nAlabama and Coushatta towns were divided into \"red\" and \"white\" towns.  The \"white\" towns were responsible for keeping the peace and for providing refuge, while the \"red\" towns were responsible for conducting military campaigns. Though they had \"red\" and \"white\" towns, the Alabama-Coushatta thought of themselves as a peace-loving people.<ref name=\"Indians\">Hook, Jonathan. ''The Alabama-Coushatta Indians.''

It was titled \"On the possibility of the occurrence of trypanosomiasis in India.\" On 17 June 1903 Donovan found the parasites (by then known as \"Leishman bodies\") from the spleen tissue and in the blood of an infected young boy who was admitted to the Government General Hospital.

In 1896 J.H. Conyers and C.W. Daniels reported the same disease as \"lupoid form of the so-called groin ulceration\" in [[New Guinea]]. In 1897 similar symptom was described by J. Galloway as \"ulcerating granuloma of the pudendum\" from one infected person in London. This became a commonly used medical term. Even after twenty years the nature of the causative agent was elusive. In 1905 Charles Donovan prepared tissue smears from the ulcerative mouth of a ward boy in Madras hospital. Under the microscope he found intracellular bodies as the cause of the lesion. He described these bodies as like \"gagantic bacilli with rounded ends.\" Even though he regarded them as parasitic protozoans, the nature of these bodies was a matter of dispute.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sexually Transmitted Diseases : a Guide for Clinicians|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4612-8142-9|pages=105\u2013120|author=Sehgal, Virendra N. |chapter=Granuloma Inguinale|editor=L.C.

Carter demonstrated  a large number of the pathogens in large [[monocytes]] and he noted their resemblance to protozoans such as ''[[Crithidia|Crithidium]]'' and ''Herpetomonas''. The description was similar to Donovan's bodies, hence, they were considered to be members of [[Sporozoa]], and the scientific name ''Donovania granulomatis'' was introduced. In 1913 H.D.

He was a dedicated doctor and inspirational leader that even the sweepers at Madras hospital were able to prepare excellent [[microscopic slide]]s. He created his self-funded Madras Medical College Athletic Association and invited all the staff to join. He took classes wearing his [[Academic dress|convocation gown]].\n\nAfter his retirement in 1919 he returned to UK and settled in a small village, [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], at 'Camp House'. His wife died in 1940, and he lived with his two daughters; while his son studied engineering at [[Cambridge University]]. He died in 1951 in Moor Cottage Hospital in Bourton.

He gave the popular name \"Leishman-Donovan bodies\", and subsequently the valid [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''Leishmania donovani'', thereby equally crediting the two rivals.<ref>{{cite book|title=From Physiology and Chemistry to Biochemistry|year=2011|publisher=Longman|location=Delhi|isbn=9788131732205|pages=36\u201337|author=Chakravorty, Maharani}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor=Pati, Biswamoy|title=The Social History of Health and Medicine in Colonial India|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203886984|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YsYAyd1Xs4C&pg|edition=Reprinted.}}</ref><ref name=pearson>{{cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Clinical Parasitology|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470851722|pages=287\u2013290|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BcNvch0jhAC&pg|chapter=Leishmaniasis|author=Richard D.

Donovan's continued works on the biology of ''L. donovani'' however established him as the leading authority on ''kala-azar''.<ref name=thakaram2/>\n\n===Discovery of ''Klebsiella granulomatis''===\n\nIn 1881 a Scottish professor of surgery, Kenneth MacLeod described lesions of [[ulcer (dermatology)|dermal ulcer]] in Madras as \"serpiginous ulcer\". In 1896 J.H. Conyers and C.W. Daniels reported the same disease as \"lupoid form of the so-called groin ulceration\" in [[New Guinea]]. In 1897 similar symptom was described by J. Galloway as \"ulcerating granuloma of the pudendum\" from one infected person in London. This became a commonly used medical term. Even after twenty years the nature of the causative agent was elusive. In 1905 Charles Donovan prepared tissue smears from the ulcerative mouth of a ward boy in Madras hospital. Under the microscope he found intracellular bodies as the cause of the lesion. He described these bodies as like \"gagantic bacilli with rounded ends.\" Even though he regarded them as parasitic protozoans, the nature of these bodies was a matter of dispute.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sexually Transmitted Diseases : a Guide for Clinicians|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4612-8142-9|pages=105\u2013120|author=Sehgal, Virendra N. |chapter=Granuloma Inguinale|editors=L.C.

Carter demonstrated  a large number of the pathogens in large [[monocytes]] and he noted their resemblance to protozoans such as ''[[Crithidia|Crithidium]]'' and ''Herpetomonas''. The description was similar to Donovan's bodies, hence, they were considered to be members of [[Sporozoa]], and the scientific name ''Donovania granulomatis'' was introduced. In 1913 H.D. Arag\u00e3o and G. Vianna gave the binomial ''Calymmatobacterium granulomatis'' noting their similarities to [[bacteria]] from their (rather dubious) [[cell culture]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Clinical Bacteriology.|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470035320|page=387|author=Richens, John |edition=2nd|chapter=Donovanosis and ''Klebsiella'' spp.|editors=Stephen Gillespie, Peter M.

They had two daughters Helen and Amy, and a son Reagh. He was a dedicated doctor and inspirational leader that even the sweepers at Madras hospital were able to prepare excellent [[microscopic slide]]s. He created his self-funded Madras Medical College Athletic Association and invited all the staff to join. He took classes wearing his [[Academic dress|convocation gown]].\n\nAfter his retirement in 1919 he returned to UK and settled in a small village, [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], at 'Camp House'. His wife died in 1940, and he lived with his two daughters; while his son studied engineering at [[Cambridge University]]. He died in 1951 in Moor Cottage Hospital in Bourton.
