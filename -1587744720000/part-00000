The witness is hospitalised and all police officers are killed \u2013 with the exception of Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton, who organised the operation, and only informed DCC Mike Dryden. Superintendent Ted Hastings asks DS Steve Arnott and DC Kate Fleming to investigate Denton, but Fleming asks not to take part. She explains that she trained together with DS Jayne Akers, one of the dead officers, but she has also been having an affair with Akers' husband, Richard.

Fleming visits Denton, who knows about Fleming's affair with Akers' husband, which Cottan also suspects. Denton's accusations cause friction between Hastings and Arnott.

AC-12 face a further problem when the Major Violent Crimes team bring in Richard Akers, before they can do so, as Arnott mistakenly assumed that Akers was unaware of his wife's corruption and decided he was not a priority. When they do get to interview Akers, he reveals that Jayne kept recordings of Hunter as leverage and stored them at a [[PO Box]]. The recordings show Hunter threatening to inform on various parties, including corrupt police officers \"from the two-faced bastard right down to The Caddy\", unless they ensure his witness protection and immunity are maintained. A recording of Dryden publicly criticising the immunity Hunter and others like him receive suggest he is the corrupt officer in question, and AC-12 begin seeking the identity of 'The Caddy'.\n\nDenton is granted permission to visit her dying mother at her nursing home, but on the return journey, Denton's prison van is run off the road. Fleeing for her life, Denton finds herself confronted by two corrupt police officers, DS Manish Prasad and Trotman's killer, DC Jeremy Cole.\n}}\n{{Episode list|Line of Duty (series 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title = Last Words\n |DirectedBy = Daniel Nettheim\n |Aux4 = 3.73\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|12|df=y}}\n |LineColor = 32CD32\n |ShortSummary = Prasad and Cole torture Denton in a parking garage to find out what she has told investigators, and she reveals only that Dryden set her up. Prasad kills Cole for reasons unknown before she manages to escape from her kidnappers. Using the car, she pins Prasad to the wall and forces him to record a confession from Prasad implicating Dryden before calling Steve. She escapes on foot and goes to her mother's bedside, where Steve allows her some quiet time before she is returned to custody. AC-12 find themselves forced to decide where their loyalties lie between Denton and Dryden. With the evidence mounting against the latter, the discovery of pictures showing Dryden and Kirk in a compromising situation is the final nail in the coffin, resulting in Arnott and Fleming finally arresting the DCC. However, when presented with AC-12's evidence, Dryden still strongly maintains he is being set up. Meanwhile, Cottan approaches DC Nigel Morton from his old team. Morton is the officer who sold the story about Dryden's driving offence to the papers, and Cottan blackmails him into falsely saying Cole, the deceased kidnapper, was nicknamed 'The Caddy' by fellow officers.\n}}\n{{Episode list|Line of Duty (series 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title = The Caddy\n |DirectedBy = Daniel Nettheim\n |Aux4 = 4.12\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|19|df=y}}\n |LineColor = 32CD32\n |ShortSummary = Dryden claims that Denton was at the car park when he was photographed in the car with Carly Kirk. Arnott gets closer to Denton and tells Fleming that he is, as she was earlier, undercover. Arnott finds the pay-off money hidden among the possessions Denton took from her mother's room.\n\nIn [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], events prior to the ambush:<br />Denton follows Dryden to the reception, where Kirk meets and attempts to seduce him. Denton has a brief conversation with her in the ladies' cloakroom and then follows Kirk and Dryden to the car park, where she sees Kirk fellate Dryden and that she is working for Hunter. Some days later, Denton approaches Hunter but is surprised to find him accompanied by DS Akers. Akers visits Denton at her home to request help in handing Hunter over to his criminal associates, who want to kill him out of fear he will inform on them in witness protection. With a pay-off, and appealing to Denton's desire to protect Kirk from her pimp and abuser, Akers persuades her to assist in the handover. Cottan is also involved in the set up. Two corrupt officers ambush the convoy, who follow it using a tracker placed on Denton's vehicle. Akers and Hunter are both killed to protect Cottan's identity, Denton is left alive to take the blame.\n\nIn the epilogue, the buried body is not Kirk's, who has fled the country unknown to the authorities and criminal parties. Prasad, who carried out the ambush and kidnapped Denton, gives evidence against her in return for reduced sentencing. Morton is not suspected of any wrongdoing and will retire, in a year, on full pension; he continues to sell confidential information to the press. Dryden is given a suspended sentence for perverting the course of justice regarding his wife's speeding ticket and resigns from the police force. Denton is convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and given a life sentence. Cottan is asked to remain in AC-12. Major Violent Crimes continue to investigate who organised Hunter's murder, but no police officers beyond Denton are suspected.\n}}\n|}</onlyinclude>\n\n== Reception ==\nSeries two received even better reviews than its predecessor,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Michael|title=Line of Duty review|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10663329/Line-of-Duty-series-two-episode-three-BBC-Two-review.html|date=26 February 2014}}</ref> despite lower viewing figures,<ref>{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Patrick|title=Ratings:BBC2's Line of Duty Remains Steady|work=TV Wise|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2014/02/ratings-bbc-twos-line-duty-remains-steady-2-2-million-viewers/|date=27 February 2014}}</ref> and was ranked the best television drama of 2014 by ''[[The Observer]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ferguson|first=Euan|title=The best British TV Dramas of 2014|work=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/07/euan-ferguson-the-best-british-tv-dramas-of-2014|date=7 December 2014}}</ref> Alessandra Stanley of [[The New York Times]] praised the series as \"original and surprising\", whilst also citing an improvement on the first season, describing it as \"more brutal and thrilling.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|title=Cops and Crime Versus Crumpets: Two Shows Reveal Two Britains|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/arts/television/line-of-duty-compared-with-downton-abbey.html|date=1 January 2015|accessdate=10 January 2020}}</ref> Sarah Hughes of [[The Guardian]] praised the series finale stating \"Well done to Jed Mercurio and co for a powerful, satisfying and, best of all, believable conclusion that, while quieter than the end to series one, resonated far more.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Sarah|title=Line of Duty recap \u2013 season two, episode finale|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/mar/19/line-of-duty-recap-season-two-episode-finale|date=19 March 2014|accessdate=10 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nKeeley Hawes received a [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actress|Leading Actress]] nomination for her role as D.I.

AC-12 face a further problem when the Major Violent Crimes team bring in Richard Akers, before they can do so, as Arnott mistakenly assumed that Akers was unaware of his wife's corruption and decided he was not a priority. When they do get to interview Akers, he reveals that Jayne kept recordings of Hunter as leverage and stored them at a [[PO Box]]. The recordings show Hunter threatening to inform on various parties, including corrupt police officers \"from the two-faced bastard right down to The Caddy\", unless they ensure his witness protection and immunity are maintained. A recording of Dryden publicly criticising the immunity Hunter and others like him receive suggest he is the corrupt officer in question, and AC-12 begin seeking the identity of 'The Caddy'.\n\nDenton is granted permission to visit her dying mother at her nursing home, but on the return journey, Denton's prison van is run off the road. Fleeing for her life, Denton finds herself confronted by two corrupt police officers, DS Manish Prasad and Trotman's killer, DC Jeremy Cole.\n}}\n{{Episode list|Line of Duty (series 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title = Last Words\n |DirectedBy = Daniel Nettheim\n |Aux4 = 3.73\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|12|df=y}}\n |LineColor = 32CD32\n |ShortSummary = Prasad and Cole torture Denton in a parking garage to find out what she has told investigators, and she reveals only that Dryden set her up. Prasad kills Cole for reasons unknown before she manages to escape from her kidnappers. Using the car, she pins Prasad to the wall and forces him to record a confession from Prasad implicating Dryden before calling Steve. She escapes on foot and goes to her mother's bedside, where Steve allows her some quiet time before she is returned to custody. AC-12 find themselves forced to decide where their loyalties lie between Denton and Dryden. With the evidence mounting against the latter, the discovery of pictures showing Dryden and Kirk in a compromising situation is the final nail in the coffin, resulting in Arnott and Fleming finally arresting the DCC. However, when presented with AC-12's evidence, Dryden still strongly maintains he is being set up. Meanwhile, Cottan approaches DC Nigel Morton from his old team. Morton is the officer who sold the story about Dryden's driving offence to the papers, and Cottan blackmails him into falsely saying Cole, the deceased kidnapper, was nicknamed 'The Caddy' by fellow officers.\n}}\n{{Episode list|Line of Duty (series 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title = The Caddy\n |DirectedBy = Daniel Nettheim\n |Aux4 = 4.12\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|19|df=y}}\n |LineColor = 32CD32\n |ShortSummary = Dryden claims that Denton was at the car park when he was photographed in the car with Carly Kirk. Arnott gets closer to Denton and tells Fleming that he is, as she was earlier, undercover. Arnott finds the pay-off money hidden among the possessions Denton took from her mother's room.\n\nIn [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], events prior to the ambush:<br />Denton follows Dryden to the reception, where Kirk meets and attempts to seduce him. Denton has a brief conversation with her in the ladies' cloakroom and then follows Kirk and Dryden to the car park, where she sees Kirk fellate Dryden and that she is working for Hunter. Some days later, Denton approaches Hunter but is surprised to find him accompanied by DS Akers. Akers visits Denton at her home to request help in handing Hunter over to his criminal associates, who want to kill him out of fear he will inform on them in witness protection. With a pay-off, and appealing to Denton's desire to protect Kirk from her pimp and abuser, Akers persuades her to assist in the handover. Cottan is also involved in the set up. Two corrupt officers ambush the convoy, who follow it using a tracker placed on Denton's vehicle. Akers and Hunter are both killed to protect Cottan's identity, Denton is left alive to take the blame.\n\nIn the epilogue, the buried body is not Kirk's, who has fled the country unknown to the authorities and criminal parties. Prasad, who carried out the ambush and kidnapped Denton, gives evidence against her in return for reduced sentencing. Morton is not suspected of any wrongdoing and will retire, in a year, on full pension; he continues to sell confidential information to the press. Dryden is given a suspended sentence for perverting the course of justice regarding his wife's speeding ticket and resigns from the police force. Denton is convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and given a life sentence. Cottan is asked to remain in AC-12. Major Violent Crimes continue to investigate who organised Hunter's murder, but no police officers beyond Denton are suspected.\n}}\n|}</onlyinclude>\n\n== Reception ==\nSeries two received even better reviews than its predecessor,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Michael|title=Line of Duty review|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10663329/Line-of-Duty-series-two-episode-three-BBC-Two-review.html|date=26 February 2014}}</ref> despite lower viewing figures,<ref>{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Patrick|title=Ratings:BBC2's Line of Duty Remains Steady|work=TV Wise|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2014/02/ratings-bbc-twos-line-duty-remains-steady-2-2-million-viewers/|date=27 February 2014}}</ref> and was ranked the best television drama of 2014 by ''[[The Observer]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ferguson|first=Euan|title=The best British TV Dramas of 2014|work=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/07/euan-ferguson-the-best-british-tv-dramas-of-2014|date=7 December 2014}}</ref> Alessandra Stanley of [[The New York Times]] praised the series as \"original and surprising\", whilst also citing an improvement on the first season, describing it as \"more brutal and thrilling.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|title=Cops and Crime Versus Crumpets: Two Shows Reveal Two Britains|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/arts/television/line-of-duty-compared-with-downton-abbey.html|date=1 January 2015|accessdate=10 January 2020}}</ref> Sarah Hughes of [[The Guardian]] praised the series finale stating \"Well done to Jed Mercurio and co for a powerful, satisfying and, best of all, believable conclusion that, while quieter than the end to series one, resonated far more.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Sarah|title=Line of Duty recap \u2013 season two, episode finale|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/mar/19/line-of-duty-recap-season-two-episode-finale|date=19 March 2014|accessdate=10 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nKeeley Hawes received a [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actress|Leading Actress]] nomination for her role as D.I.

Several of these rule changes de-emphasised the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of [[joint lock]]s application. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules, and this divergence gave BJJ a distinct identity as a grappling art,<ref name=rules>[http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf \"IBJJF rules\"] ([[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]]), accessed April 3, 2008</ref> although it's still recognizably related to judo. Other factors that have contributed towards the stylistic divergence of BJJ from the sport judo include the Gracies' contribution to the art, including emphasis on full-contact fighting.\n\nBJJ permits the same techniques that judo allows when taking combat to the ground. These include judo's scoring [[throw (grappling)|throws]] as well as judo's non-scoring techniques that it refers to as \"skillful takedowns\" (such as the [[flying armbar]]). BJJ also allows any and all takedowns used in wrestling, sambo, or any other grappling arts including direct attempts to take down by touching the legs.

Sport BJJ tournaments continue to grow in popularity and have given rise to no-gi [[submission grappling]] tournaments, such as the [[ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship]] and NAGA, the North American Grappling Association. Sport BJJ has also become a popular method of fitness around the world in recent years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pridegym.ca/classes-item/brazilian-jiu-jitsu/|title=Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|website=Pride Gym Martial Arts|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://championscreed.ca/wiki/BrazilianJiuJitsu/BrazilianJiuJitsuTrial|title=Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Trial|website=championscreed.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref>\n\n== Style of fighting ==\n{{see also|List of Brazilian jiu-jitsu techniques}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\n\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu focuses on getting an opponent to the ground in order to neutralize possible strength or size advantages through [[ground fighting]] techniques and [[submission holds]] involving [[joint-locks]] and [[chokehold]]s. On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.\n\nBJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as \"[[Guard (grappling)#Pulling Guard|pulling guard]]\", which is not used in other combat sports such as Judo or Wrestling. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the [[Guard (grappling)|guard]] position to defend oneself from bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with [[side control]], [[Mount (grappling)|mount]], and [[back mount]] positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/ex-navy-seal-commander-heres-why-so-many-smart-people-practicebrazilian-jiu-jitsu.html|title=Ex-Navy SEAL commander: Here's why so many smart people practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu|first=Zameena|last=Mejia|date=5 December 2018|website=Cnbc.com}}</ref> A submission hold in BJJ is often assimilated to the equivalent of \"checkmate\", where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be injured, or choked.\n\n[[Renzo Gracie]] wrote in his book ''Mastering JUJITSU'':\n\n{{quote|\"The classical jujutsu of old Japan appeared to have no common strategy to guide a combatant over the course of a fight. Indeed, this was one of Kano's most fundamental and perceptive criticisms of the classical program.\" Maeda not only taught the art of judo to [[Carlos Gracie]], but also taught a particular philosophy about the nature of combat developed by Kano, and further refined by Maeda based on his worldwide travels competing against fighters skilled in a wide variety of martial arts.<ref name=\"renzog1\">{{cite book\n| last = Gracie\n| first = Renzo\n| authorlink =\n| title = Mastering Jiu-jitsu\n| publisher = Human Kinetics\n| year = 2003\n| pages = 1\u2013233\n| isbn = 0-7360-4404-3\n}}</ref>}}\n\nThe book details Maeda's theory as arguing that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases, such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, etc. Thus, it was a smart fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat best suited to his own strengths. Renzo Gracie stated that this was a fundamental influence of the Gracie approach to combat. These strategies were further developed over time by the Gracies and others, and became prominent in contemporary MMA.\n\n=== Ground fighting ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Demonstration.ogv|thumb|right|A demonstration of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu during a class at Standard BJJ in Rockville, MD.]]\nBJJ is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater emphasis on ground fighting. Commonly, striking-based martial arts place little to no emphasis on groundwork. BJJ also places little emphasis on standing techniques, such as [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[Throw (grappling)|throws]], although it employs some basic [[Takedown (grappling)|takedowns]], such as [[Single leg takedown|single]] and [[double leg takedown]]s, and some BJJ clubs and practitioners [[cross-training|cross train]] with [[wrestling]], judo, and [[Sambo (martial art)|sambo]].\n\n=== Training methods ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu strengthens camaraderie, build trust at Camp Lemonnier 140727-F-SJ695-033.jpg|thumb|A Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructor gently demonstrates how to tackle an opponent.]]\nBJJ focuses on submissions without the use of [[Strike (attack)|strikes]], while training allows practitioners to practice at full speed and with full strength, resembling the effort used in competition. Training methods include technique drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting partner; isolation sparring (commonly referred to as positional drilling) where only a certain technique or sets of techniques are used; and full sparring where each practitioner tries to submit their opponent through technique. Physical conditioning is also an important aspect of training.\n\nThe [[Gracie family]] lineage descended from Helio Gracie focuses on practical applications of BJJ that apply primarily to self-defense.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxlW9dmsPJs Carlos Sr. vs Helio: The Truth About the Gracie Family History and Politics ] Kama Jiu-Jitsu, August 14, 2017</ref> They will often run development drills in which a person is surrounded by a circle of other students who will attempt to attack the defending student, who in turn must defend themselves using techniques. The student will often be unable to see the aggressor to simulate an attack that they weren't expecting.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Primary ground positions ==\n{{Main|Grappling position}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2009}}\n\nOnce on the ground, the BJJ practitioner strives to take a dominant or controlling position from where to apply submissions. These positions provide different submission or transition options.\n\n=== Side control ===\n{{Main|Side control}}\n[[File:Udegarami.JPG|thumb|An \"americana\" or \"paintbrush\" submission from traditional [[side control]]]]\n\nIn side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defence. Variants of the side control include Twister Side Control (popularized by [[Eddie Bravo]]), Brazilian Crossbody, [[kesa gatame]], \"Wrestler Pin\", knee mount, and other positions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Know Your Cross-Body Pins|url=http://nwfighting.com/know-your-jiu-jitsu-positions-cross-body-pins.html/|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Full mount ===\n{{Main|Mount (grappling)}}\n[[File:Andrea Galvao.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount (grappling)|Full Mount]] is considered one of the most dominant [[grappling position]]s.]]\n\nIn the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.\n\n=== Back mount ===\n{{Main|Back mount}}\n[[File:Back mount.jpg|thumb|Back mount, also considered one of the most dominant positions in BJJ]]\n\nWhen taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as the ''back grab'' or ''attacking the back''), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with their heel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf |title=International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation \u2013 Rule Book |work =Official IFBJJ rules, see Article 5 \u2013 Fighting Conclusions, The order of the referee, subsection \u2013 E |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply [[chokeholds]], as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength advantage.\n\n=== North South position ===\nThe North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as ''deadweight''. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South [[Kimura lock|kimura]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bjj-world.com/bjj-north-south-position-attacks/|title=Versatile Attacks From The BJJ North-South Position|first=Ognen|last=Dzabirski|date=26 March 2018|website=Bjj-world.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Guards ===\n{{Main|Guard (grappling)}}\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-jitsu-Closed guard.jpg|thumb|left|The Jiu-Jitsu practitioner in blue is demonstrating a type of closed [[Guard (grappling)|guard]]]]\n\nWhen in the \"Guard\" position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.\n\nThe three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.\n\nIn closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.\n\nThere are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard (made popular by [[Keenan Cornelius]]) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs. Although Calvin Whitney is a follower of Keenan, he has a lot of difficulty in passing any guards himself. \n\nIn the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions.  There is also a variant of half guard called \"50/50 guard\", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.\n\nAnother variation of the half guard position is the \"deep half guard\", which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, [[Jeff Glover]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wbbjj.com/uncle-richard-guard/|title=Having Problems Understanding Deep Half Guard? Jeff Glover Presents \"Uncle Richard Guard\".|date=2017-04-13|work=White Belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Submissions ==\n\n{{For|a list of list of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques|List of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques}}\n\nThe majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: [[joint lock]]s and [[chokehold|chokes]]. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position, which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion.<ref name=\"mma\"/> Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by [[Submission (combat sport)|tapping]]. A choke hold can disrupt the blood supply to the brain and cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not tap when required.\n\n=== Compression locks ===\n\n''See also'' [[Compression lock]]\n\nA less common type of submission hold is a [[compression lock]], where the muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This type of lock also often hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart. Some compression locks include the [[Compression lock#Achilles lock|Achilles lock]], [[Compression lock#Biceps slicer|Bicep slicer]], and [[Compression lock#Leg slicer|Leg slicer]] (or Calf slicer).\n\n=== Joint locks ===\n[[File:In-guard armbar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A practitioner attempting an [[armbar]] submission]]\n\nWhile many joint locks are permitted in BJJ, most competitions ban or restrict some or all joint locks that involve the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly the same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a twisting motion of the knee (such as heel hooks or knee bars) are usually banned in competitions because successfully completing the move can frequently result in permanent damage, often requiring surgery. Similarly, [[Neck Crank|joint manipulations of the spine]] are typically barred due to the inherent danger of crushing or misaligning [[cervical vertebrae]]. Leglocks are allowed in varying degrees depending on skill level, with the most prominent BJJ tournaments typically allowing only the straight ankle lock and muscle stretching submissions such as the \"banana split\" from white through purple belt, with the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions being permitted at brown and black belt. Most competitions do not allow [[heel hooks]], which are considered to be exceptionally dangerous.<ref name=USGR/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Pearch |url=http://www.couch2cage.com/taboo-techniques-the-heel-hook-in-bjj-and-mma/ |title=Taboo techniques |website=Couch2cage.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref> However, most joint locks involving the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks are usually safe.\n\nJoint locks include armbars, kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, omoplata, marceloplata, banana split (or electric chair), twister, wrist lock, heel hook, toehold, kneebar, straight ankle lock, and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjjtech.com/tech/tech-list.asp?id=3&sub=y&name=Submissions|title=BJJ Technique Catalog: Category: Submissions|work=bjjtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Chokes ===\n[[File:MCMAP Rear choke - Defense Visual Information Center 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[rear naked choke]], as demonstrated by a [[MCMAP]] instructor]]\n[[Chokehold|Chokes]] are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put pressure on the [[carotid]] arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve [[baroreceptor]]s in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3\u20135 seconds. In contrast, an air choke (involving constriction of the [[windpipe]]) can take up to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious damage to the throat.\n\nChokes include [[rear-naked choke]], [[Sankaku-jime|triangle]], [[Okuri eri jime|bow and arrow choke]], [[Sode guruma jime|sleeve choke]] (or Ezekiel choke), guillotine, cross collar choke (or X choke), [[Kata juji jime#variants|baseball choke]], D'Arce, clock choke, [[Arm triangle choke]], north\u2013south choke, crucifix choke, anaconda choke, [[Gogoplata]], loop choke, and others.\n\n== Uniform ==\n{{Main|Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner's uniform (commonly referred to using the Japanese terms ''[[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi|gi]]'' or ''[[kimono]]'') is similar to a [[judogi]], but often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate, although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|promoted]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the wearing of the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the growing popularity of \"no-gi\" Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the practice of giving out belts to no gi practitioners (e.g., [[Rolles Gracie]] awarding [[Rashad Evans]] a black belt) has become more common.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Grading ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Black belt grades<br />(19 and over)\n|-\n|| Black 0\u20136 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ BlackBelt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Black/Red 7 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ black red belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red/White 8 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ red white belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red 9\u201310 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Red Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Senior belt colors<br />(16 and over)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"brackground:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Blue || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Blue Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Purple || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Purple Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Brown || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Brown Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Junior belt colours<br />(16 and under)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Grey || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Grey Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Yellow || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Yellow Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Orange || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Orange Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Green || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Green Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{{Main|Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|Gracie jiu-jitsu ranking system}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different colored belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system's structure shares its origins with the [[Judo#Rank and grading|judo ranking system]] and the origins of all colored belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\">\n{{cite web |author=Camargo, Bruno |title= IBJJF Graduation system|url=http://www.ibjjf.org/graduation.htm |accessdate=October 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gracie1\">{{cite book| last = Gracie| first = Renzo | authorlink =Renzo Gracie | last2 =Gracie | first2 =Royler | author2-link =Royler Gracie| title = Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Technique| publisher = Invisible Cities Press Llc| year = 2001\n| page = 304| isbn =1-931229-08-2 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion holds true.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\"/><ref name=\"Gracie1\"/> Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children's programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.\n\nUnlike in some martial arts such as [[taekwondo]] and [[karate]], a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any intermediate rank.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/16-jiu-jitsu-practitioners-that-were-promoted-straight-to-black-belt/ | title =16 Jiu-Jitsu Practitioners That Were Promoted Straight to Black Belt | date = 2015-10-14 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Others have achieved the rank in relatively short timeframes.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/top-10-fastest-black-belt-promotions-in-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-history/ |last=Guillaume| first=Huni| title =Top 10 Fastest Black Belt Promotions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu History | date = 2015-09-10 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Outside of exceptions such as these, the average timeframe is around 10 years with a consistent training schedule.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[F\u00e1bio Santos (fighter)|F\u00e1bio Santos]] | title =Passion makes him a champion | medium = | publisher = | location = | date =| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFnnoBncArw&t=42s}}</ref> However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders [[H\u00e9lio Gracie|H\u00e9lio]] and [[Carlos Gracie]]) has stated that the average of 10\u201312 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the [[ego (Freudian)|ego]] of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take 7 years.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =Ryron Gracie | title =Ryron Gracie of the legendary Gracie Clan | medium = | publisher =plugonetwo.com | location =[[Beverly Hills, California]] | date =March 2014| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYQcRfhLCw&t=22m10s}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Federations ==\nSince its inception in Brazil, Jiu-Jitsu has had different registered federations and tournaments (some organizations illegitimately calling themselves federations). The first Jiu-Jitsu Federation was the [[Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Guanabara]], which has remained a regional federation of Rio de Janeiro, while many others were founded. Among the most prestigious of the many federations are the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a nonprofit organization with federations and tournaments around the globe with the mission of making Jiu-Jitsu an [[Olympic sport]], and the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]], a profit organization that hosts a number of tournaments.<ref name=ibjjf>{{Cite web |url=https://ibjjf.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115181958/https://ibjjf.com/ |archive-date=2019-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Tournaments ==\nWhile there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by private individuals and academies, there are two major entities in Jiu-Jitsu circles.  First, is the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments.  Second, is the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], a for-profit company that hosts a number of major tournaments worldwide. These include the [[Pan-American Championship (jiu-jitsu)|Pan American Championship]], [[European Championship (Brazilian jiu-jitsu)|European Championship]], and the [[Mundials]]. [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]] are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently.  Other promotions within [[North America]], such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and [[North American Grappling Association]] (NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.\n\nAnother tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals or Gracie Worlds. Founded in 2007 by Rose Gracie, daughter of [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] creator and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grandmaster [[Rorion Gracie]]. Gracie Nationals/Worlds followed the guidelines of other major tournaments of the time, implementing a points systems\n\nIn 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing certain judging systems that many interpreted as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke about this change when she said, \"Today's tournaments aren't what my grandfather [Helio Gracie] envisioned. There's so many rules that it takes away from the actual art of Jiu-Jitsu. We don't see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a referee. We need to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution.\" Cheating in Jiu-Jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. \"[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold for the entire match so they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start,\" Rose said. \"That's not Jiu-Jitsu. That's cheating.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/loretta_hunt/01/25/rose-gracie/ |title=Rose Gracie honors MMA roots with overhaul of Gracie U.S. Nationals \u2013 Loretta Hunt \u2013 SI.com |website=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref>\n\nThis discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout the Jiu-Jitsu community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. At these events, the winner of a match is determined only by submission, and these tournaments at times have no time limit, or are timed with a result of double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This form of tournament have yet to become widespread. [[Metamoris]], a grappling competition event run by Rose's brother [[Ralek Gracie]], has helped advocate this tournament form. Another notable example of a submission-only format is the EBI ([[Eddie Bravo Invitational]]), which was the first televised event of its kind, and is now being featured on [[UFC Fight Pass]]. Other submission-only events have cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational and Polaris Pro, and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.attacktheback.com/polaris-3-the-aftermath/ |title=Polaris Pro - The Aftermath - Attack The Back |website=Attacktheback.com |date= 2016-04-03|accessdate=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt tournaments, especially those hosted by the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], some athletes engage in a practice called \"closing out.\"<ref name=\"graciemag.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.graciemag.com/en/2012/04/09/a-measure-for-quashing-closing-out-jiu-jitsu-finals/ |title = A measure for quashing closing out Jiu-Jitsu finals? &#124; Graciemag}}</ref> This occurs when two athletes, usually friends or members of the same team, meet in a match but refuse to fight. Tournament organizers can minimize the chance of close-outs by placing athletes from the same team on opposite sides of the bracket, a practice which makes the finals the only match in which they could possibly meet (assuming each team has no more than two competitors in a given bracket). When two athletes close out a match, they agree which one of them will technically forfeit to the other. As this most often occurs in the final matches of tournaments, this usually means deciding which of the two will win the gold medal and which will win the silver. Notable examples of closing out include Marcus \"Buchecha\" Almeida forfeiting the finals of the Absolute division at the 2018 IBJJF World Championship to his friend Leandro Lo, who had suffered a shoulder injury during a previous match,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bjjee.com/articles/buchecha-surrenders-title-leandro-lo-plus-results-worlds-2018/ | title=Buchecha Surrenders Title to Leandro Lo - Plus More Results from WORLDS 2018| date=2018-06-04}}</ref> and frequent close outs between the brothers Paulo and Joao Miyao, who often compete in the same weight division.<ref>https://www.flograppling.com/articles/5050610-how-the-miyao-brothers-embraced-the-bjj-lifestyle</ref> \nProponents of close-outs claim it fosters team unity and allows competitors to train as hard and as freely as they can with their teammates. They say that facing a teammate in a competition would make them hold back in training. Critics of the practice say it diminishes audience enjoyment of tournaments where it is allowed,<ref name=\"graciemag.com\"/> and some tournaments, notably the ADCC, ban it.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWuBHBAVJJ/</ref>\n\n== Health considerations ==\n=== Safety ===\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts for practitioners. Its injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scoggin|first1=James F.|last2=Brusovanik|first2=Georgiy|last3=Izuka|first3=Byron H.|last4=Zandee van Rilland|first4=Eddy|last5=Geling|first5=Olga|last6=Tokumura|first6=Seren|title=Assessment of Injuries During Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Competition|journal=Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine|date=February 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=232596711452218|doi=10.1177/2325967114522184|pmid=26535299|pmc=4555620}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kreiswirth|first1=Ethan M.|last2=Myer|first2=Gregory D.|last3=Rauh|first3=Mitchell J.|title=Incidence of Injury Among Male Brazilian Jiujitsu Fighters at the World Jiu-Jitsu No-Gi Championship 2009|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|date=January 2014|volume=49|issue=1|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-49.1.11|pmc=3917302|pmid=24377959}}</ref> This is lower than in [[mixed martial arts]] (236-286 per 1000), [[boxing]] (210-420 per 1000), [[judo]] (25.3-130.6) and [[taekwondo]] (20.5-139.5). It is similar to [[wrestling]], which also uses grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners suffer from are [[ACL tear]]s in the knees, [[rotator cuff]] tears in the shoulders and [[spinal disc hernia]]tions, most commonly in the neck region. Many are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist [[tendonitis]], due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.\n\n=== Skin health ===\nBesides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners (along with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary mat conditions.  They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |title=BJJ Safety |website=Uiowa.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108182804/http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}</ref>  Several commonly contracted skin diseases include [[Dermatophytosis|ringworm]], [[impetigo]], [[herpes gladiatorum]], and [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplersquest.com/blogs/briancimins/grappling-tournament-health-warning-advisory-dirty-mats-nearly-caused-amputation-2 |title=Grappling Tournament Health Warning Advisory \u2013 Dirty Mats nearly caused AMPUTATION in 2009!!! |publisher=Grapplers Quest |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>  Proper hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with [[soap]], disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]]/[[rashguard]]/[[Wrestling headgear|headgear]] used before the next class, not sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a [[barrier cream]] greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.\n\n=== Cauliflower ear ===\n[[File:Dom Cruz 2.png|thumb|Dominick Cruz's cauliflower ears]]\n\nDue to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in Jiu-Jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell.  Without immediate medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the [[perichondrium]] that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed ([[cauliflower ear]]). [[Wrestling headgear]] is sometimes used for prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining the hematoma or surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplearts.com/Cauliflower-Ears-In-Brazilian-jiu-jitsu.html |title=Cauliflower ears in Grappling |website=Grapplearts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===\nThe practice of taking [[performance-enhancing drugs]], including [[Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|anabolic steroids]], is believed to be relatively commonplace among competitors in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments and has sparked letters and public statements by some of Jiu-Jitsu's top competitors, including [[Rodrigo Medeiros|Comprido]] and [[Caio Terra]].<ref>{{cite web |author=: Equipe Brasa : : Brasa team : Brazilian Jiu Jitu |url=http://brasa.brazilianblackbelt.com/2011/05/comprido-felipe-costa-and-caio-terra-united-against-steroids-in-bjj/ |title=Black belts united against steroids in BJJ.

BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in [[self-defense]] situations.<ref name=\"mma\" /> [[Sparring]] (commonly referred to as \"rolling\" within the BJJ community) and [[Aliveness (martial arts)|live]] drilling play a major role in training and the practitioner's development.

Some of these rule changes sought to enhance it as a spectator sport, and others aimed to improve safety. Several of these rule changes de-emphasised the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of [[joint lock]]s application. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules, and this divergence gave BJJ a distinct identity as a grappling art,<ref name=rules>[http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf \"IBJJF rules\"] ([[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]]), accessed April 3, 2008</ref> although it's still recognizably related to judo. Other factors that have contributed towards the stylistic divergence of BJJ from the sport judo include the Gracies' contribution to the art, including emphasis on full-contact fighting.\n\nBJJ permits the same techniques that judo allows when taking combat to the ground. These include judo's scoring [[throw (grappling)|throws]] as well as judo's non-scoring techniques that it refers to as \"skillful takedowns\" (such as the [[flying armbar]]).

On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.\n\nBJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as \"[[Guard (grappling)#Pulling Guard|pulling guard]]\", which is not used in other combat sports such as Judo or Wrestling. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the [[Guard (grappling)|guard]] position to defend oneself from bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with [[side control]], [[Mount (grappling)|mount]], and [[back mount]] positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/ex-navy-seal-commander-heres-why-so-many-smart-people-practicebrazilian-jiu-jitsu.html|title=Ex-Navy SEAL commander: Here's why so many smart people practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu|first=Zameena|last=Mejia|date=5 December 2018|website=Cnbc.com}}</ref> A submission hold in BJJ is often assimilated to the equivalent of \"checkmate\", where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be injured, or choked.\n\n[[Renzo Gracie]] wrote in his book ''Mastering JUJITSU'':\n\n{{quote|\"The classical jujutsu of old Japan appeared to have no common strategy to guide a combatant over the course of a fight.

Renzo Gracie stated that this was a fundamental influence of the Gracie approach to combat. These strategies were further developed over time by the Gracies and others, and became prominent in contemporary MMA.\n\n=== Ground fighting ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Demonstration.ogv|thumb|right|A demonstration of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu during a class at Standard BJJ in Rockville, MD.]]\nBJJ is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater emphasis on ground fighting. Commonly, striking-based martial arts place little to no emphasis on groundwork. BJJ also places little emphasis on standing techniques, such as [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[Throw (grappling)|throws]], although it employs some basic [[Takedown (grappling)|takedowns]], such as [[Single leg takedown|single]] and [[double leg takedown]]s, and some BJJ clubs and practitioners [[cross-training|cross train]] with [[wrestling]], judo, and [[Sambo (martial art)|sambo]].\n\n=== Training methods ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu strengthens camaraderie, build trust at Camp Lemonnier 140727-F-SJ695-033.jpg|thumb|A Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructor gently demonstrates how to tackle an opponent.]]\nBJJ focuses on submissions without the use of [[Strike (attack)|strikes]], while training allows practitioners to practice at full speed and with full strength, resembling the effort used in competition. Training methods include technique drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting partner; isolation sparring (commonly referred to as positional drilling) where only a certain technique or sets of techniques are used; and full sparring where each practitioner tries to submit their opponent through technique. Physical conditioning is also an important aspect of training.\n\nThe [[Gracie family]] lineage descended from Helio Gracie focuses on practical applications of BJJ that apply primarily to self-defense.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxlW9dmsPJs Carlos Sr. vs Helio: The Truth About the Gracie Family History and Politics ] Kama Jiu-Jitsu, August 14, 2017</ref> They will often run development drills in which a person is surrounded by a circle of other students who will attempt to attack the defending student, who in turn must defend themselves using techniques.

These positions provide different submission or transition options.\n\n=== Side control ===\n{{Main|Side control}}\n[[File:Udegarami.JPG|thumb|An \"americana\" or \"paintbrush\" submission from traditional [[side control]]]]\n\nIn side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defence. Variants of the side control include Twister Side Control (popularized by [[Eddie Bravo]]), Brazilian Crossbody, [[kesa gatame]], \"Wrestler Pin\", knee mount, and other positions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Know Your Cross-Body Pins|url=http://nwfighting.com/know-your-jiu-jitsu-positions-cross-body-pins.html/|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Full mount ===\n{{Main|Mount (grappling)}}\n[[File:Andrea Galvao.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount (grappling)|Full Mount]] is considered one of the most dominant [[grappling position]]s.]]\n\nIn the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.\n\n=== Back mount ===\n{{Main|Back mount}}\n[[File:Back mount.jpg|thumb|Back mount, also considered one of the most dominant positions in BJJ]]\n\nWhen taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as the ''back grab'' or ''attacking the back''), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with their heel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf |title=International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation \u2013 Rule Book |work =Official IFBJJ rules, see Article 5 \u2013 Fighting Conclusions, The order of the referee, subsection \u2013 E |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply [[chokeholds]], as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength advantage.\n\n=== North South position ===\nThe North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as ''deadweight''. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South [[Kimura lock|kimura]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bjj-world.com/bjj-north-south-position-attacks/|title=Versatile Attacks From The BJJ North-South Position|first=Ognen|last=Dzabirski|date=26 March 2018|website=Bjj-world.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Guards ===\n{{Main|Guard (grappling)}}\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-jitsu-Closed guard.jpg|thumb|left|The Jiu-Jitsu practitioner in blue is demonstrating a type of closed [[Guard (grappling)|guard]]]]\n\nWhen in the \"Guard\" position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.\n\nThe three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.\n\nIn closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.\n\nThere are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard (made popular by [[Keenan Cornelius]]) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs. Although Calvin Whitney is a follow of Keenan, he has a lot of difficulty in passing any guards himself. \n\nIn the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions.  There is also a variant of half guard called \"50/50 guard\", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.\n\nAnother variation of the half guard position is the \"deep half guard\", which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, [[Jeff Glover]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wbbjj.com/uncle-richard-guard/|title=Having Problems Understanding Deep Half Guard? Jeff Glover Presents \"Uncle Richard Guard\".|date=2017-04-13|work=White Belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Submissions ==\n\n{{For|a list of list of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques|List of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques}}\n\nThe majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: [[joint lock]]s and [[chokehold|chokes]]. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position, which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion.<ref name=\"mma\"/> Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by [[Submission (combat sport)|tapping]]. A choke hold can disrupt the blood supply to the brain and cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not tap when required.\n\n=== Compression locks ===\n\n''See also'' [[Compression lock]]\n\nA less common type of submission hold is a [[compression lock]], where the muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This type of lock also often hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart. Some compression locks include the [[Compression lock#Achilles lock|Achilles lock]], [[Compression lock#Biceps slicer|Bicep slicer]], and [[Compression lock#Leg slicer|Leg slicer]] (or Calf slicer).\n\n=== Joint locks ===\n[[File:In-guard armbar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A practitioner attempting an [[armbar]] submission]]\n\nWhile many joint locks are permitted in BJJ, most competitions ban or restrict some or all joint locks that involve the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly the same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a twisting motion of the knee (such as heel hooks or knee bars) are usually banned in competitions because successfully completing the move can frequently result in permanent damage, often requiring surgery. Similarly, [[Neck Crank|joint manipulations of the spine]] are typically barred due to the inherent danger of crushing or misaligning [[cervical vertebrae]]. Leglocks are allowed in varying degrees depending on skill level, with the most prominent BJJ tournaments typically allowing only the straight ankle lock and muscle stretching submissions such as the \"banana split\" from white through purple belt, with the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions being permitted at brown and black belt. Most competitions do not allow [[heel hooks]], which are considered to be exceptionally dangerous.<ref name=USGR/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Pearch |url=http://www.couch2cage.com/taboo-techniques-the-heel-hook-in-bjj-and-mma/ |title=Taboo techniques |website=Couch2cage.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref> However, most joint locks involving the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks are usually safe.\n\nJoint locks include armbars, kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, omoplata, marceloplata, banana split (or electric chair), twister, wrist lock, heel hook, toehold, kneebar, straight ankle lock, and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjjtech.com/tech/tech-list.asp?id=3&sub=y&name=Submissions|title=BJJ Technique Catalog: Category: Submissions|work=bjjtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Chokes ===\n[[File:MCMAP Rear choke - Defense Visual Information Center 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[rear naked choke]], as demonstrated by a [[MCMAP]] instructor]]\n[[Chokehold|Chokes]] are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put pressure on the [[carotid]] arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve [[baroreceptor]]s in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3\u20135 seconds. In contrast, an air choke (involving constriction of the [[windpipe]]) can take up to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious damage to the throat.\n\nChokes include [[rear-naked choke]], [[Sankaku-jime|triangle]], [[Okuri eri jime|bow and arrow choke]], [[Sode guruma jime|sleeve choke]] (or Ezekiel choke), guillotine, cross collar choke (or X choke), [[Kata juji jime#variants|baseball choke]], D'Arce, clock choke, [[Arm triangle choke]], north\u2013south choke, crucifix choke, anaconda choke, [[Gogoplata]], loop choke, and others.\n\n== Uniform ==\n{{Main|Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner's uniform (commonly referred to using the Japanese terms ''[[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi|gi]]'' or ''[[kimono]]'') is similar to a [[judogi]], but often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate, although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|promoted]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the wearing of the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the growing popularity of \"no-gi\" Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the practice of giving out belts to no gi practitioners (e.g., [[Rolles Gracie]] awarding [[Rashad Evans]] a black belt) has become more common.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Grading ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Black belt grades<br />(19 and over)\n|-\n|| Black 0\u20136 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ BlackBelt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Black/Red 7 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ black red belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red/White 8 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ red white belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red 9\u201310 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Red Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Senior belt colors<br />(16 and over)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"brackground:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Blue || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Blue Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Purple || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Purple Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Brown || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Brown Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Junior belt colours<br />(16 and under)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Grey || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Grey Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Yellow || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Yellow Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Orange || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Orange Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Green || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Green Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{{Main|Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|Gracie jiu-jitsu ranking system}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different colored belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system's structure shares its origins with the [[Judo#Rank and grading|judo ranking system]] and the origins of all colored belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\">\n{{cite web |author=Camargo, Bruno |title= IBJJF Graduation system|url=http://www.ibjjf.org/graduation.htm |accessdate=October 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gracie1\">{{cite book| last = Gracie| first = Renzo | authorlink =Renzo Gracie | last2 =Gracie | first2 =Royler | author2-link =Royler Gracie| title = Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Technique| publisher = Invisible Cities Press Llc| year = 2001\n| page = 304| isbn =1-931229-08-2 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion holds true.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\"/><ref name=\"Gracie1\"/> Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children's programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.\n\nUnlike in some martial arts such as [[taekwondo]] and [[karate]], a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any intermediate rank.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/16-jiu-jitsu-practitioners-that-were-promoted-straight-to-black-belt/ | title =16 Jiu-Jitsu Practitioners That Were Promoted Straight to Black Belt | date = 2015-10-14 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Others have achieved the rank in relatively short timeframes.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/top-10-fastest-black-belt-promotions-in-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-history/ |last=Guillaume| first=Huni| title =Top 10 Fastest Black Belt Promotions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu History | date = 2015-09-10 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Outside of exceptions such as these, the average timeframe is around 10 years with a consistent training schedule.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[F\u00e1bio Santos (fighter)|F\u00e1bio Santos]] | title =Passion makes him a champion | medium = | publisher = | location = | date =| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFnnoBncArw&t=42s}}</ref> However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders [[H\u00e9lio Gracie|H\u00e9lio]] and [[Carlos Gracie]]) has stated that the average of 10\u201312 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the [[ego (Freudian)|ego]] of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take 7 years.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =Ryron Gracie | title =Ryron Gracie of the legendary Gracie Clan | medium = | publisher =plugonetwo.com | location =[[Beverly Hills, California]] | date =March 2014| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYQcRfhLCw&t=22m10s}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Federations ==\nSince its inception in Brazil, Jiu-Jitsu has had different registered federations and tournaments (some organizations illegitimately calling themselves federations). The first Jiu-Jitsu Federation was the [[Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Guanabara]], which has remained a regional federation of Rio de Janeiro, while many others were founded. Among the most prestigious of the many federations are the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a nonprofit organization with federations and tournaments around the globe with the mission of making Jiu-Jitsu an [[Olympic sport]], and the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]], a profit organization that hosts a number of tournaments.<ref name=ibjjf>{{Cite web |url=https://ibjjf.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115181958/https://ibjjf.com/ |archive-date=2019-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Tournaments ==\nWhile there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by private individuals and academies, there are two major entities in Jiu-Jitsu circles.  First, is the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments.  Second, is the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], a for-profit company that hosts a number of major tournaments worldwide. These include the [[Pan-American Championship (jiu-jitsu)|Pan American Championship]], [[European Championship (Brazilian jiu-jitsu)|European Championship]], and the [[Mundials]]. [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]] are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently.  Other promotions within [[North America]], such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and [[North American Grappling Association]] (NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.\n\nAnother tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals or Gracie Worlds. Founded in 2007 by Rose Gracie, daughter of [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] creator and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grandmaster [[Rorion Gracie]]. Gracie Nationals/Worlds followed the guidelines of other major tournaments of the time, implementing a points systems\n\nIn 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing certain judging systems that many interpreted as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke about this change when she said, \"Today's tournaments aren't what my grandfather [Helio Gracie] envisioned. There's so many rules that it takes away from the actual art of Jiu-Jitsu. We don't see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a referee. We need to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution.\" Cheating in Jiu-Jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. \"[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold for the entire match so they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start,\" Rose said. \"That's not Jiu-Jitsu. That's cheating.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/loretta_hunt/01/25/rose-gracie/ |title=Rose Gracie honors MMA roots with overhaul of Gracie U.S. Nationals \u2013 Loretta Hunt \u2013 SI.com |website=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref>\n\nThis discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout the Jiu-Jitsu community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. At these events, the winner of a match is determined only by submission, and these tournaments at times have no time limit, or are timed with a result of double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This form of tournament have yet to become widespread. [[Metamoris]], a grappling competition event run by Rose's brother [[Ralek Gracie]], has helped advocate this tournament form. Another notable example of a submission-only format is the EBI ([[Eddie Bravo Invitational]]), which was the first televised event of its kind, and is now being featured on [[UFC Fight Pass]]. Other submission-only events have cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational and Polaris Pro, and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.attacktheback.com/polaris-3-the-aftermath/ |title=Polaris Pro - The Aftermath - Attack The Back |website=Attacktheback.com |date= 2016-04-03|accessdate=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt tournaments, especially those hosted by the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], some athletes engage in a practice called \"closing out.\"<ref name=\"graciemag.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.graciemag.com/en/2012/04/09/a-measure-for-quashing-closing-out-jiu-jitsu-finals/ |title = A measure for quashing closing out Jiu-Jitsu finals? &#124; Graciemag}}</ref> This occurs when two athletes, usually friends or members of the same team, meet in a match but refuse to fight. Tournament organizers can minimize the chance of close-outs by placing athletes from the same team on opposite sides of the bracket, a practice which makes the finals the only match in which they could possibly meet (assuming each team has no more than two competitors in a given bracket). When two athletes close out a match, they agree which one of them will technically forfeit to the other. As this most often occurs in the final matches of tournaments, this usually means deciding which of the two will win the gold medal and which will win the silver. Notable examples of closing out include Marcus \"Buchecha\" Almeida forfeiting the finals of the Absolute division at the 2018 IBJJF World Championship to his friend Leandro Lo, who had suffered a shoulder injury during a previous match,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bjjee.com/articles/buchecha-surrenders-title-leandro-lo-plus-results-worlds-2018/ | title=Buchecha Surrenders Title to Leandro Lo - Plus More Results from WORLDS 2018| date=2018-06-04}}</ref> and frequent close outs between the brothers Paulo and Joao Miyao, who often compete in the same weight division.<ref>https://www.flograppling.com/articles/5050610-how-the-miyao-brothers-embraced-the-bjj-lifestyle</ref> \nProponents of close-outs claim it fosters team unity and allows competitors to train as hard and as freely as they can with their teammates. They say that facing a teammate in a competition would make them hold back in training. Critics of the practice say it diminishes audience enjoyment of tournaments where it is allowed,<ref name=\"graciemag.com\"/> and some tournaments, notably the ADCC, ban it.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWuBHBAVJJ/</ref>\n\n== Health considerations ==\n=== Safety ===\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts for practitioners. Its injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scoggin|first1=James F.|last2=Brusovanik|first2=Georgiy|last3=Izuka|first3=Byron H.|last4=Zandee van Rilland|first4=Eddy|last5=Geling|first5=Olga|last6=Tokumura|first6=Seren|title=Assessment of Injuries During Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Competition|journal=Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine|date=February 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=232596711452218|doi=10.1177/2325967114522184|pmid=26535299|pmc=4555620}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kreiswirth|first1=Ethan M.|last2=Myer|first2=Gregory D.|last3=Rauh|first3=Mitchell J.|title=Incidence of Injury Among Male Brazilian Jiujitsu Fighters at the World Jiu-Jitsu No-Gi Championship 2009|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|date=January 2014|volume=49|issue=1|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-49.1.11|pmc=3917302|pmid=24377959}}</ref> This is lower than in [[mixed martial arts]] (236-286 per 1000), [[boxing]] (210-420 per 1000), [[judo]] (25.3-130.6) and [[taekwondo]] (20.5-139.5). It is similar to [[wrestling]], which also uses grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners suffer from are [[ACL tear]]s in the knees, [[rotator cuff]] tears in the shoulders and [[spinal disc hernia]]tions, most commonly in the neck region. Many are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist [[tendonitis]], due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.\n\n=== Skin health ===\nBesides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners (along with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary mat conditions.  They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |title=BJJ Safety |website=Uiowa.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108182804/http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}</ref>  Several commonly contracted skin diseases include [[Dermatophytosis|ringworm]], [[impetigo]], [[herpes gladiatorum]], and [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplersquest.com/blogs/briancimins/grappling-tournament-health-warning-advisory-dirty-mats-nearly-caused-amputation-2 |title=Grappling Tournament Health Warning Advisory \u2013 Dirty Mats nearly caused AMPUTATION in 2009!!! |publisher=Grapplers Quest |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>  Proper hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with [[soap]], disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]]/[[rashguard]]/[[Wrestling headgear|headgear]] used before the next class, not sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a [[barrier cream]] greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.\n\n=== Cauliflower ear ===\n[[File:Dom Cruz 2.png|thumb|Dominick Cruz's cauliflower ears]]\n\nDue to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in Jiu-Jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell.  Without immediate medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the [[perichondrium]] that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed ([[cauliflower ear]]). [[Wrestling headgear]] is sometimes used for prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining the hematoma or surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplearts.com/Cauliflower-Ears-In-Brazilian-jiu-jitsu.html |title=Cauliflower ears in Grappling |website=Grapplearts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===\nThe practice of taking [[performance-enhancing drugs]], including [[Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|anabolic steroids]], is believed to be relatively commonplace among competitors in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments and has sparked letters and public statements by some of Jiu-Jitsu's top competitors, including [[Rodrigo Medeiros|Comprido]] and [[Caio Terra]].<ref>{{cite web |author=: Equipe Brasa : : Brasa team : Brazilian Jiu Jitu |url=http://brasa.brazilianblackbelt.com/2011/05/comprido-felipe-costa-and-caio-terra-united-against-steroids-in-bjj/ |title=Black belts united against steroids in BJJ.

His maternal grandfather was [[Hiram Harrison Lowry]], his mother was a musician, and his father taught [[zoology]] at an university.  He and his parents moved to [[San Francisco, California]] in 1927. His father accepted a teaching position at [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]] and taught there until the 1950s.  Dobson spent 23 years in a [[monastery]], after which he became more active in promoting astronomy.\n\n=== Time at the monastery ===\nAs a teen, Dobson became a \u201cbelligerent\u201d [[atheism|atheist]].  He said:  \u201cI could see that these two notions cannot arise in the same being: \u2018do unto others as you would that they do unto\u2019 and \u2018if you're not a good boy, it's into hell for keeps.\u2019... They must be spoofing us. So I became an atheist, a belligerent atheist. If anybody started a conversation about the subject, I was a belligerent atheist.\u201d<ref name=revolutionary>[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/dobson_astronomer_000507.html John Dobson: Amateur Astronomy's Revolutionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409214808/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/dobson_astronomer_000507.html |date=April 9, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOver time Dobson became interested in the [[universe]] and its workings. He earned a masters [[academic degree|degree]] in [[chemistry]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1943, working in [[E. O. Lawrence]]'s lab.  In 1944 he attended a lecture by a [[Vedanta]]n swami.  Dobson said the swami \u201crevealed to him a world he had never seen.\u201d<ref name=revolutionary/>  That same year Dobson  joined the [[Vedanta Society]] monastery in San Francisco, becoming a [[monk]] of the [[Ramakrishna]] [[Order (religious)|Order]].  \u201cOne of John's responsibilities at the monastery was to reconcile astronomy with the teachings of Vedanta. That job led him to build telescopes on the side. He took to wheeling them around outside the monastery, fascinating the neighbors who would congregate around him.\u201d<ref name=revolutionary/>\n\nDobson's interest in telescope building was in part to better understand the universe, and in part to inspire in others a curiosity about the cosmos. To this end, he often offered assistance and corresponded about his work with those outside the monastery. Telescope building was not part of the curriculum at the monastery, however, and much of his correspondence was written in [[code]] so as to attract less attention.  For instance, a telescope was referred to as a \"[[geranium]]\", which is a type of flower.  A \"potted geranium\" referred to a telescope in a tube and rocker, while a \"geranium in bloom\" referred to a telescope whose [[mirror]] was now aluminized.<ref name=mirrormirror>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCbTj74cgc4C&pg=PA342|title=Mirror, Mirror: A History Of The Human Love Affair With Reflection |first=Mark |last=Pendergrast |date=28 April 2009 |publisher=Basic Books |via=Google Books |page=342}}</ref>\n\nEventually Dobson was given the option of ceasing his telescope building or leaving the order.  He chose to stop building telescopes so that he could remain at the monastery.  But one day another monk wrongly accused him as missing and reported him to the head swami. Dobson was expelled in 1967.  However, he maintains that the accusation was not the true reason for his expulsion.  The true reason, he contends, was a result of a misunderstanding.  The head swami read a paper that was presumably written by Dobson that contradicted the reconciliation of science with Vedanta, and the swami thought Dobson had rejected the swami's teachings.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sidewalkastronomers.us/id32.html | title=John Dobson - A Brief Biography | accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n=== Amateur astronomy ===\nHaving left the order in 1967, Dobson in 1968 co-founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/index.php?page=the-sidewalk |publisher=San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers |title=The Sidewalk |website=www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org}}</ref> an [[amateur astronomy]] organization that aims to popularize astronomy among people on the street, along with Bruce Sams and Jeffery Roloff.

It was also at this time that Dobson's simple form of telescope \u2013 which came to be known as the [[Dobsonian telescope|Dobsonian]] \u2013 became well known after he started teaching classes to the public on how to make your own telescope.\n\nHe was later asked to speak at the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]] in [[Hollywood]], and continued to spend two months there each year teaching telescope and cosmology classes. He spent two more months at his home in San Francisco, and spent most of the rest of each year traveling as an invited guest for astronomical societies, where he spoke about telescope building, sidewalk astronomy, and his views of cosmology and the scientific establishment.\n\n===Amateur cosmology===\nDobson claimed the [[Big Bang model]] did not hold up to scrutiny,<ref>{{cite media |first=Jeffrey Fox |last=Jacobs |title=A Sidewalk Astronomer |medium=documentary film |year=2005 |publisher=Jacobs Entertainment Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://quanta-gaia.org/dobson/EquationsOfMaya.html |title=Equations of Maya |first=John |last=Dobson}}</ref> and instead advocated a [[non-standard cosmology]]; a \u201crecycling\u201d [[Steady State Theory|Steady State model]] of the universe, where matter in the universe is [[metric expansion of space|forever expanding outward]], but matter also \u201crecycles\u201d over time via [[quantum tunneling]].

This type of simplified altazimuth [[Telescope mount|mount]] is also commonly referred to in amateur astronomical circles as a \"Dobsonian mount\". Using this construction method makes the typical Dobsonian telescope large, portable, inexpensive, very stable, and easy to manufacture. The design revolutionized<ref>Jack Hitt, Bunch of Amateurs: A Search for the American Character, Crown/Archetype - 2012, pages 231-234</ref><ref>Antony Cooke, Visual Astronomy Under Dark Skies: A New Approach to Observing Deep Space, Springer Science & Business Media - 2006, page 156</ref><ref>Neil English, Classic Telescopes: A Guide to Collecting, Restoring, and Using Telescopes of Yesteryear, Springer Science & Business Media - 2012, page 127</ref> the sheer size of telescopes available to amateur astronomers with the optical diameters unheard of before their appearance.<ref>James Mullaney, A Buyer's and User's Guide to Astronomical Telescopes and Binocular, page 38</ref>\n\nThe design is named after Dobson because he is credited for being the first person to have combined all these construction techniques in a single telescope design. He was reluctant to take credit, however, pointing out that he built it that way because it was all he needed. In his own words, he jokes that he was \"too retarded\" to build a more sophisticated telescope with an [[equatorial mount|equatorial telescope mount]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cognitivelabs.com/2006/09/innovator-profile-john-dobson.html |title=Innovator Profile: John Dobson, Reprint of NY Times story |publisher=Cognitive Labs |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> With its simplicity of construction and use, the Dobsonian has become a very popular design today, particularly for large amateur telescopes.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzpoQRh9QEQC&pg=PA38 |first=James |last=Mullaney |title=A Buyer's And User's Guide to Astronomical Telescopes & Binoculars |publisher=Springer |year=2007 | page = 38}}</ref> The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, in Washington D.C., uses a Dobsonian telescope in the museum's public observatory alongside other solar telescopes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/museum-dc/things-do/phoebe-waterman-haas-public-observatory|website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Sidewalk astronomers ===\nDobson co-founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers in coordination with two other people, having cheaply constructed several telescopes that were easy to use, including a {{convert|24|in|mm|adj=on}} telescope that was built for approximately US$300. Rather than have regular meetings, the organization simply set up telescopes on the sidewalk during clear evenings, offering to show and explain the night sky to people passing by. The telescope which Dobson used most frequently on the streets of San Francisco, was a classic 9-inch aperture Dobsonian, with a typical porthole glass mirror of outstanding optical quality, made by one of his own students in a mirror making class. This telescope was portable enough that it could be taken by Dobson from his residence to many busy street corners in San Francisco, using the city's Muni public transportation. Appropriately nicknamed \"Tumbleweed\", since it traveled randomly about to numerous public observing locations, this 9-inch telescope is now shared among many astronomy clubs and organizations around the world, allowing people everywhere to observe the heavens with such an iconic instrument, just as Dobson would have wished.\n\nUnexpectedly, the Sidewalk Astronomers were invited to the Riverside Telescope Makers' meeting in 1969. The {{convert|24|in|mm|adj=on}} Dobsonian telescope brought by the Sidewalk Astronomers was unconventional, because most telescopes at such meetings tended to be smaller, on equatorial mounts, and designed for [[astrophotography]] rather than optical viewing. Surprisingly and controversially at the time, Dobson's telescope tied in first prize for best optics. It was also awarded the runner up prize for mechanics, despite the mechanics of the telescope and its mount being relatively simple.\n\nSidewalk Astronomers has since become a prominent organization, recognized for its taking of astronomy to the public via \"[[sidewalk astronomy]]\". The current organization has members throughout the world, and continues to promote public service astronomy by putting telescopes on street corners in urban areas. Members of the organization also visit national parks giving slide show presentations, providing telescope viewing, and explaining the universe.\n\n== Publications by John Dobson ==\n[[Image:HaWtBaUFST-cover.jpg|thumb|right|Dobson's first book was published with a unique [[plywood]] binding.]]\nDobson authored the 1991 book ''How and Why to Make a User-Friendly Sidewalk Telescope'' ({{ISBN|0-913399-64-7}}) with editor [[Norman Sperling]]. This book helped popularize what came to be known as the Dobsonian mount, and treats the \"why\" as importantly as the \"how\". It covers Dobson's background and his philosophy on astronomy and the universe, and his belief in the importance of popular access to astronomy for proper appreciation of the universe.  Dobson has also published ''Beyond Space and Time'' (2004) ({{ISBN|978-0972805193}}) and ''The Moon is New'' (2008) ({{ISBN|978-0981695204}}).\n\n== John Dobson in the media ==\nDobson's life and ideas are the subject of the 2005 documentary ''[[A Sidewalk Astronomer]]''.  He was also featured in the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''The Astronomers'', and appeared twice on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Dobson also appears as one of the speakers in ''Universe: The Cosmology Quest'', a documentary about non-standard cosmological theories.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0851217|The Universe: Cosmology Quest}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of astronomical instrument makers]]\n*[[18024 Dobson]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.sidewalkastronomers.us/ Sidewalk Astronomers] \u2013 This website includes John Dobson's official schedule.\n*{{IMDb name|2003766}}\n* [http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/ The San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers]\n* [http://quanta-gaia.org/dobson/ John Dobson of The Sidewalk Astronomers] \u2013 Papers and articles written by John Dobson\n* [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM5JA808BE_index_0.html Dobson Space Telescope]\n* [http://www.telescopepictures.com/ A Sidewalk Astronomer] A film about Astronomy, Cosmology and John Dobson\n* [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/35-who-made-a-difference-john-dobson-113799923/ \u201c35 Who Made a Difference: John Dobson\u201d] by Don Moser, Smithsonian (November 2005)\n* [http://www.telescopepictures.com/ \u201cJohn Lowery Dobson Oral History Interview\u201d] Crater Lake Institute, 2004\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150222183042/http://www.craterlakeinstitute.com/crater-lake-news/pied-piper-of-astronomy.htm John Dobson honored by Crater Lake Institute for public service]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mau5TAhx29Y John Dobson Memorial Video]\n* [https://archive.org/details/DobsonCosmology  John Dobson Cosmology Lectures Recorded in the mid 1990s available here on The Internet Archive]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dobson, John}}\n[[Category:1915 births]]\n[[Category:2014 deaths]]\n[[Category:American Hindus]]\n[[Category:Converts to Hinduism from atheism or agnosticism]]\n[[Category:Amateur astronomers]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{about-otherpeople|the amateur astronomer||John Dobson (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name        = John Dobson\n| image       = JohnDobson2002.jpg\n| alt         = \n| caption     = John Dobson in 2002.\n| birth_name  = John Lowry Dobson\n| birth_date  = {{Birth date|1915|09|14}}\n| birth_place = [[Beijing]], [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]]\n| death_date  = {{Death date and age|2014|01|15|1915|09|14}}\n| death_place = [[Burbank, California]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n| nationality = American\n| other_names = \n| known_for   = [[Dobsonian telescope]], [[sidewalk astronomy]]\n| occupation  = [[Vedanta|Vedantan monk]] (1944\u22121967), lecturer/popularizer of [[amateur astronomy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sidewalkastronomers.us/id32.html |title=John Dobson - A Brief Biography |publisher=The Sidewalk Astronomers |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''John Lowry Dobson''' (September 14, 1915 \u2013 January 15, 2014) was an [[amateur astronomer]] and is best known for the [[Dobsonian telescope]], a portable, low-cost [[Newtonian reflector|Newtonian reflector telescope]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">SB & F: Volume 43, Issues 5-6,  page 231, American Association for the Advancement of Science 2007</ref> He was also known for his efforts to promote awareness of astronomy (and his unorthodox views of [[physical cosmology]]) through public lectures including his performances of  \"[[sidewalk astronomy]].\"  Dobson was also  the co-founder of the amateur astronomical group, the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Biography ==\nDobson was born in [[Beijing]], [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]].  His maternal grandfather was [[Hiram Harrison Lowry]], his mother was a musician, and his father taught [[zoology]] at a university.  He and his parents moved to [[San Francisco, California]] in 1927. His father accepted a teaching position at [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]] and taught there until the 1950s.  Dobson spent 23 years in a [[monastery]], after which he became more active in promoting astronomy.\n\n=== Time at the monastery ===\nAs a teen, Dobson became a \u201cbelligerent\u201d [[atheism|atheist]].  He said:  \u201cI could see that these two notions cannot arise in the same being: \u2018do unto others as you would that they do unto\u2019 and \u2018if you're not a good boy, it's into hell for keeps.\u2019... They must be spoofing us. So I became an atheist, a belligerent atheist. If anybody started a conversation about the subject, I was a belligerent atheist.\u201d<ref name=revolutionary>[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/dobson_astronomer_000507.html John Dobson: Amateur Astronomy's Revolutionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409214808/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/dobson_astronomer_000507.html |date=April 9, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOver time Dobson became interested in the [[universe]] and its workings. He earned a masters [[academic degree|degree]] in [[chemistry]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1943, working in [[E. O. Lawrence]]'s lab.  In 1944 he attended a lecture by a [[Vedanta]]n swami.  Dobson said the swami \u201crevealed to him a world he had never seen.\u201d<ref name=revolutionary/>  That same year Dobson  joined the [[Vedanta Society]] monastery in San Francisco, becoming a [[monk]] of the [[Ramakrishna]] [[Order (religious)|Order]].  \u201cOne of John's responsibilities at the monastery was to reconcile astronomy with the teachings of Vedanta. That job led him to build telescopes on the side. He took to wheeling them around outside the monastery, fascinating the neighbors who would congregate around him.\u201d<ref name=revolutionary/>\n\nDobson's interest in telescope building was in part to better understand the universe, and in part to inspire in others a curiosity about the cosmos. To this end, he often offered assistance and corresponded about his work with those outside the monastery. Telescope building was not part of the curriculum at the monastery, however, and much of his correspondence was written in [[code]] so as to attract less attention.  For instance, a telescope was referred to as a \"[[geranium]]\", which is a type of flower.  A \"potted geranium\" referred to a telescope in a tube and rocker, while a \"geranium in bloom\" referred to a telescope whose [[mirror]] was now aluminized.<ref name=mirrormirror>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCbTj74cgc4C&pg=PA342|title=Mirror, Mirror: A History Of The Human Love Affair With Reflection |first=Mark |last=Pendergrast |date=28 April 2009 |publisher=Basic Books |via=Google Books |page=342}}</ref>\n\nEventually Dobson was given the option of ceasing his telescope building or leaving the order.  He chose to stop building telescopes so that he could remain at the monastery.  But one day another monk wrongly accused him as missing and reported him to the head swami. Dobson was expelled in 1967.  However, he maintains that the accusation was not the true reason for his expulsion.  The true reason, he contends, was a result of a misunderstanding.  The head swami read a paper that was presumably written by Dobson that contradicted the reconciliation of science with Vedanta, and the swami thought Dobson had rejected the swami's teachings.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sidewalkastronomers.us/id32.html | title=John Dobson - A Brief Biography | accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n=== Amateur astronomy ===\nHaving left the order in 1967, Dobson in 1968 co-founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/index.php?page=the-sidewalk |publisher=San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers |title=The Sidewalk |website=www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org}}</ref> an [[amateur astronomy]] organization that aims to popularize astronomy among people on the street, along with Bruce Sams and Jeffery Roloff. Sams had built a large telescope but because at the time he was only 12, he was not eligible for membership in the only local club \u2013 the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers \u2013 thus the \u201cSan Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers\u201d was began. It was also at this time that Dobson's simple form of telescope \u2013 which came to be known as the [[Dobsonian telescope|Dobsonian]] \u2013 became well known after he started teaching classes to the public on how to make your own telescope.\n\nHe was later asked to speak at the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]] in [[Hollywood]], and continued to spend two months there each year teaching telescope and cosmology classes. He spent two more months at his home in San Francisco, and spent most of the rest of each year traveling as an invited guest for astronomical societies, where he spoke about telescope building, sidewalk astronomy, and his views of cosmology and the scientific establishment.\n\n===Amateur cosmology===\nDobson claimed the [[Big Bang model]] did not hold up to scrutiny,<ref>{{cite media |first=Jeffrey Fox |last=Jacobs |title=A Sidewalk Astronomer |medium=documentary film |year=2005 |publisher=Jacobs Entertainment Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://quanta-gaia.org/dobson/EquationsOfMaya.html |title=Equations of Maya |first=John |last=Dobson}}</ref> and instead advocated a [[non-standard cosmology]]; a \u201crecycling\u201d [[Steady State Theory|Steady State model]] of the universe, where matter in the universe is [[metric expansion of space|forever expanding outward]], but matter also \u201crecycles\u201d over time via [[quantum tunneling]].

This type of simplified altazimuth [[Telescope mount|mount]] is also commonly referred to in amateur astronomical circles as a \"Dobsonian mount\". Using this construction method makes the typical Dobsonian telescope large, portable, inexpensive, very stable, and easy to manufacture.

He was reluctant to take credit, however, pointing out that he built it that way because it was all he needed. In his own words, he jokes that he was \"too retarded\" to build a more sophisticated telescope with an [[equatorial mount|equatorial telescope mount]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cognitivelabs.com/2006/09/innovator-profile-john-dobson.html |title=Innovator Profile: John Dobson, Reprint of NY Times story |publisher=Cognitive Labs |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> With its simplicity of construction and use, the Dobsonian has become a very popular design today, particularly for large amateur telescopes.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzpoQRh9QEQC&pg=PA38 |first=James |last=Mullaney |title=A Buyer's And User's Guide to Astronomical Telescopes & Binoculars |publisher=Springer |year=2007 | page = 38}}</ref> The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, in Washington D.C., uses a Dobsonian telescope in the museum's public observatory alongside other solar telescopes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/museum-dc/things-do/phoebe-waterman-haas-public-observatory|website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Sidewalk astronomers ===\nDobson co-founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers in coordination with two other people, having cheaply constructed several telescopes that were easy to use, including a {{convert|24|in|mm|adj=on}} telescope that was built for approximately US$300. Rather than have regular meetings, the organization simply set up telescopes on the sidewalk during clear evenings, offering to show and explain the night sky to people passing by. The telescope which Dobson used most frequently on the streets of San Francisco, was a classic 9-inch aperture Dobsonian, with a typical porthole glass mirror of outstanding optical quality, made by one of his own students in a mirror making class. This telescope was portable enough that it could be taken by Dobson from his residence to many busy street corners in San Francisco, using the city's Muni public transportation. Appropriately nicknamed \"Tumbleweed\", since it traveled randomly about to numerous public observing locations, this 9-inch telescope is now shared among many astronomy clubs and organizations around the world, allowing people everywhere to observe the heavens with such an iconic instrument, just as Dobson would have wished.\n\nUnexpectedly, the Sidewalk Astronomers were invited to the Riverside Telescope Makers' meeting in 1969.

Lightning Eleven Go}} is an anime based on the [[Inazuma Eleven GO (manga)]]. 10 years after the FFI, an unnoticed darkness lurks behind the country. Japan and what used to be soccer has changed during the 10 years that have passed. In this time, soccer is different from before and has become a reason for people to lose hope and stop playing for those who enjoy soccer. The new main protagonist, Matsukaze Tenma tries out for the Raimon soccer team and passes but in a match with another team, he soon realizes that soccer is much different from what he has expected it to be.\nNow, soccer in Japan is controlled by an organization called Fifth Sector and is led by the one known as the \u201cHoly Emperor\u201d, namely Ishido Shuuji (who is later revealed to be Gouenji Shuuya). Soccer in its current state is controlled and gives out commands whether the team loses purposely or wins the match. What used to be the \u201creal soccer\u201d is gone.\n\nMatsukaze Tenma, along with the members of the Raimon team, now aim to free soccer so that everyone can finally play soccer freely without being ordered how to do it.\n\nThe rebellion starts against Fifth Sector, in this dark midst of times, the Raimon team will not go alone in this rebellion. With some unexpected help from the Resistance organization that aims to replace the Holy Emperor and with some help from the previous main characters of the Inazuma Eleven anime.

When everyone was in the soccer club, the new members introduced themselves and the already soccer members introduced them too to the new members. After that, Otonashi gave Tenma and Shinsuke their soccer uniform in which Tenma said that those were the first team uniforms. Kirino Ranmaru answered that the whole second team left and some of the first team too, so there was no point of joining the second team.\nAfter that, they go and practice soccer in the field. Shindou got mad about Tsurugi's attitude and actions. Then, Megane received a phone call from Coach Kudou while he is playing on his computer. After, there was a team meeting in the club room. It is revealed that the phone call was a challenge from the team Eito, and the result of the match was fixed. Raimon has to lose by 3-0. Then when Shindou was heading home, a mother of one of the teammates of Eito called to him and gave him a ticket as a bribe and left. Shindou was holding the ticket angrily. The next day, the match begins, and Eito scores the first goal but Sangoku could have stopped it with his hissatsu. As the team was pretending to be not strong against Eito Gakuen.

Tenma has learned that his team might be disbanded if they don't listen to orders from Fifth Sector, and with everyone else seeming to be really bummed out, Tenma can't catch the ball. A while later, he has seemed to get back his spirit, and steal the ball from Eito. He passes it to Shindou, but no matter how many times he passes it, Shindou doesn't want to catch the ball from Tenma. Finally Shindou answers to Tenma's feelings towards soccer in this match and unconsciously shoots the ball scoring a goal. The match ends up with 1-3 score. After the match Tenma wasn't even bothered about consequences of his actions during the match. The school principal finds it enough to be the reason to fire Kudou. After leaving Raimon we can see Kudou making a call to Megane asking him to proceed as they planned. After the game, Shindou received a call from Sangoku that the coach was fired. Shindou ran coming to him. Kudou was leaving them as their coach. But before Kudou left, he asked what was the feeling Shindou felt when he scored to which Shindou just kept silent about, Kudou stated that he should not forget what was the feeling.

Raimon's opponent was leading in the second half by two goals. But thanks to Shindou and his Fortissimo shoot, Raimon scores a goal. The match ends with a score of 2-1. Kidokawa Seishuu wins this match and becomes the champion of the Nationals. It is shown that Tenma, Shinsuke, and Sorano were watching this match from the soccer club. Haruna came in and turned off the TV after seeing the game. A while later, Endou came in holding a poster -- a poster for Holy Road, a soccer tournament. He posted the poster in the club room. So then, a few moments later, the team practiced out on the field. Then, Endou was called into the principal's office where he was told to lose their first match in Holy Road tournament without making a single goal (an order from Fifth Sector). Endou pretended to agree with it. But after he closed the door and saw Haruna waiting for him outside, he told her that he has another point and is not going to tell the team about it.\nWhen Tenma discovered that Shindou was quitting the soccer team, he was tried to find Shindou. He was then called by Shinsuke to come up to the roof top about something Kirino, Shindou, and Sangoku were talking about. Shindou was talking about quitting the team. He told it to Endou. The whole team was talking about it, and when Seto heard that Hamano, Hayami and Kurama being negative about it, she got high tempered again. She almost punches Hayami but Akane stopped her in time, telling her not to use any violence. Tenma couldn't accept what was happening, so he tried to convince Shindou to come back and goes to Shindou's house. Tenma asked if Shindou wanted to train at the riverbank with him along with Shinsuke. At the riverbank, Shindou used Fortissimo and wanted to leave shortly after but Tenma said that he still wanted to play true soccer. That made Shindou mad and Shindou took the ball of Tenma. Shortly after Tenma revealed his new hissatsu, Soyokaze Step against Shindou, Endou was revealed to be watching. When Tenma said that he will use it in the Holy Road, Shindou was seen crying and said that he doesn't deserve to be the captain but Endou cheered Shindou up, telling him that tears made him a captain. Shindou finally agreed to return to the team and accept the captain mark. The next morning, Tsurugi warned him about the next match and Fifth Sector's order to lose it without scoring a single goal.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 09\n| Title               = The Curtain Rises At Last!

Both Kidou and Aphrodi think to find the way to attack. Apparently, Aphrodi found a way first. He told his team to use the hissatsu tactics, God Triangle. However, it didn't last long due to Kurumada's Dash Train. But Raimon didn't have the ball for much longer too. And Kariya didn't manage to steal it thanks to Illusion Ball.

He came to give Nishiki some motivation and brought him some onigiri, too. For the second half, Kidou changed the formation which Tsurugi is switched to be a midfielder, while Nishiki became a forward. Amagi is still upset that Kidou didn't use him in the match even after switching formations.During the second half, Tsurugi was used as a decoy so that he can pass the ball to Nishiki. Nishiki used his keshin, Sengoku Bunshin Musashi, which made Midori surprised. And he made the first goal for Raimon. Then, Kariya used Hunter's Net again to steal the ball from Taki and soon the ball gets to Nishiki. Nishiki used his keshin again and shoots. Even though Katayama used a keshin, he still can't block Nishiki's keshin shoot.

Amagi started to have many friends but he wasn't happy because Mahoro wouldn't talk to him anymore. Then, he met Mahoro.

Hikaru came to him with an umbrella. He told him that he will catch a cold if he get wet. They shade under a tree. Hikaru then told him that he had that experience before. He was a transfer student. But he's clumsy with words, so he had hard time saying what was on his mind. He didn't want people to dislike him, so he agreeded to everything, even when he didn't actually agree. The more he went on, the more he get along with everything. At the end, he made everyone angry. After that, he told everyone his honest feelings. He apologized to them.

He was then called by Shinsuke to come up to the roof top about something Kirino, Shindou, and Sangoku were talking about. Shindou was talking about quitting the team. He told it to Endou. The whole team was talking about it, and when Seto heard that Hamano, Hayami and Kurama being negative about it, she got high tempered again. She almost punches Hayami but Akane stopped her in time, telling her not to use any violence. Tenma couldn't accept what was happening, so he tried to convince Shindou to come back and goes to Shindou's house. Tenma asked if Shindou wanted to train at the riverbank with him along with Shinsuke. At the riverbank, Shindou used Fortissimo and wanted to leave shortly after but Tenma said that he still wanted to play true soccer. That made Shindou mad and Shindou took the ball of Tenma. Shortly after Tenma revealed his new hissatsu, Soyokaze Step against Shindou, Endou was revealed to be watching. When Tenma said that he will use it in the Holy Road, Shindou was seen crying and said that he doesn't deserve to be the captain but Endou cheered Shindou up, telling him that tears made him a captain. Shindou finally agreed to return to the team and accept the captain mark.

Apparently, Kidokawa Seishuu didn't know about this, due to Aphrodi rejecting to know information about the stadium from Ishido Shuuji, saying that he wants to fight with the same condition as Raimon. Then, it is revealed that Someoka just went back to Japan from Italy.\nBoth of the teams were still shocked about the pitch down, and Amagi on the other hand wasn't very satisfied because Kariya and Nishizono failed to stop Kishibe who was about to score.Both teams still surprised about the 'pitch downs' that are unpredictable about their timing to show up, so both of the teams can't attack fully. Both Kidou and Aphrodi think to find the way to attack. Apparently, Aphrodi found a way first. He told his team to use the hissatsu tactics, God Triangle. However, it didn't last long due to Kurumada's Dash Train. But Raimon didn't have the ball for much longer too. And Kariya didn't manage to steal it thanks to Illusion Ball. However, after seeing the 'pitch down' clearly, Kidou finally found a way to counterattack by using hissatsu tactics, Flying Route Pass.After Shindou and Tsurugi are blocked by Kidokawa Seishuu, Hamano used his hissatsu, Naminori Piero and was about to pass it, but it was cut by Taki. Then, Taki used his keshin and scored the first goal for Kidokawa Seishuu. After some time, the ball was in Nishiki's possession but it was stolen by Taki. Later Kariya used Hunter's Net to stop him, but it was stolen again. Then Kishibe, Izumi and Tobisawa used Triangle ZZ to score the second goal for Kidokawa Seishuu.It's half time and Someoka appeared. It seems that Tenma and Shinsuke recognized him. He came to give Nishiki some motivation and brought him some onigiri, too. For the second half, Kidou changed the formation which Tsurugi is switched to be a midfielder, while Nishiki became a forward. Amagi is still upset that Kidou didn't use him in the match even after switching formations.During the second half, Tsurugi was used as a decoy so that he can pass the ball to Nishiki. Nishiki used his keshin, Sengoku Bunshin Musashi, which made Midori surprised. And he made the first goal for Raimon. Then, Kariya used Hunter's Net again to steal the ball from Taki and soon the ball gets to Nishiki. Nishiki used his keshin again and shoots. Even though Katayama used a keshin, he still can't block Nishiki's keshin shoot. And with that, the score is 2 - 2 and it will continue in the next episode.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 31\n| Title               = Keshin!

But he's clumsy with words, so he had hard time saying what was on his mind. He didn't want people to dislike him, so he agreeded to everything, even when he didn't actually agree. The more he went on, the more he get along with everything. At the end, he made everyone angry. After that, he told everyone his honest feelings. He apologized to them.
