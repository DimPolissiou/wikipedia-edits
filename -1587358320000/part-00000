He was a strong proponent of German opera.

Wieland's goal was an \"interessante Art von Schauspielen\" (a more interesting form of plays) with a focus on \"R\u00fchrung\" (emotional [[Affect (psychology)|affect]]). Duchess [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Anna Amalie]] of Weimar wanted to establish a ''Nationalb\u00fchne'', a stage for plays and operas in German.<ref name=\"Lawrence\" /> Early pieces for such a theatre were the ''[[Singspiel]]e''  ''Die Jagd'' by [[Johann Adam Hiller]] and ''Die Dorfgala'' by Schweitzer. Wieland and Schweitzer wanted to create in ''Alceste'' a work that could compete internationally.<ref name=\"Betz\" /> The librettist reduced the number of characters to four, and employed no choir.<ref name=\"Plett\" /> The opera is regarded as a milestone of German opera.<ref name=\"Betz\" /><ref name=\"Schm\u00f6e\" />\n\n== Performance, reception, recording ==\n[[File:Weimar Hoftheater 1899.jpg|thumb|left|upright = 1.3|The [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Hoftheater Weimar]] on an 1899 postcard]]\n\nThe opera was premiered by the Seyler Company on 28 May 1773 at the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Hoftheater Weimar]], with [[Franziska Romana Koch]] in the title role, whose voice the composer had in mind when he wrote the opera.

''A Greek Grammar for Colleges''. \u00a71</ref> \nThe modern lowercase shape goes back to the [[uncial]] form [[File:Greek uncial Omega.svg|x14px]], a form that developed during the 3rd century BC in ancient handwriting on papyrus, from a flattened-out form of the letter ([[File:Greek Omega 08.svg|x16px]]) that had its edges curved even further upward.<ref>Edward M. Thompson (1912), ''Introduction to Greek and Latin paleography'', Oxford: Clarendon. p.144</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Greek alphabet, Omega was also adopted into the [[early Cyrillic alphabet]].

In the [[Greek numerals|Greek numeric system]]/[[Isopsephy]] ([[Gematria]]), it has a value of 800. The word literally means \"great&nbsp;O\" (''\u014d mega'', mega meaning \"great\"), as opposed to \u039f \u03bf [[omicron]], which means \"little&nbsp;O\" (''o mikron'', micron meaning \"little\").<ref>[http://www.quinapalus.com/gr0.1.html The Greek Alphabet]</ref> \n\nIn [[Phonetics|phonetic]] terms, the Ancient Greek \u03a9 is a [[vowel length|long]] [[open-mid back rounded vowel|open-mid ''o'']] {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}}, comparable to the vowel of [[British English]] ''raw''. In [[Modern Greek]], \u03a9 represents the [[mid<!-- not close-mid, see Arvanti (1999) - Illustrations of the IPA: Modern Greek. --> back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/o\u031e/}}, the same sound as [[omicron]]. The letter omega is [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] ''\u014d'' or simply ''o''.\n\nAs the last letter of the Greek alphabet, Omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a [[set theory|set]], in contrast to [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]], the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see [[Alpha and Omega]].\n\n==History==\n\u03a9 was not part of the early (8th  century BC) [[Archaic Greek alphabets|Greek alphabets]]. It was introduced in the late 7th century BC in the Ionian cities of Asia Minor to denote the long half-open [\u0254\u02d0]. It is a variant of omicron (\u039f),   broken up at the side ([[File:Greek Omega 09.svg|x16px]]), with the edges subsequently turned outward ({{GrGl|Omega 09}}, {{GrGl|Omega 05}}, {{GrGl|Omega 03}}, {{GrGl|Omega 07}}).<ref name=Jeffery37f>Anne Jeffery (1961), ''The local scripts of archaic Greece'', p.37\u201338.</ref>\nThe Dorian city of [[Knidos]] as well as a few Aegean islands, namely [[Paros]], [[Thasos]] and [[Melos]], chose the exact opposite innovation, using a broken-up circle for the short and a closed circle for the long /o/.<ref name=Jeffery37f/>\n\nThe name \u03a9\u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1 is [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine]]; in [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]], the letter was called ''\u014d'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f66}}), whereas the omicron was called ''ou'' ({{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f56}}).<ref>Herbert Weir Smyth. ''A Greek Grammar for Colleges''. \u00a71</ref> \nThe modern lowercase shape goes back to the [[uncial]] form [[File:Greek uncial Omega.svg|x14px]], a form that developed during the 3rd century BC in ancient handwriting on papyrus, from a flattened-out form of the letter ([[File:Greek Omega 08.svg|x16px]]) that had its edges curved even further upward.<ref>Edward M. Thompson (1912), ''Introduction to Greek and Latin paleography'', Oxford: Clarendon. p.144</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Greek alphabet, Omega was also adopted into the [[early Cyrillic alphabet]]. See [[omega (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic omega]] (\u0460, \u0461). A [[Raetic alphabet|Raetic]] variant is conjectured to be at the origin or parallel evolution of the [[Elder Futhark]] [[\u16df]]. \n\nOmega was also adopted into the Latin alphabet, as a letter of the 1982 revision to the [[African reference alphabet]]. It has had little use. See [[Latin omega]].\n\n== The symbol \u03a9 (uppercase letter) ==\n[[File:Letter omega 12.png|thumb|right|An alternate form of capital \u03a9 resembles an underlined superscript [[omicron]] or some forms of Latin [[Q]].

At that time, the [[Bengal]] state (covering the entire Eastern part of [[British India]]) was a mission area entrusted to the [[Belgian]] Jesuits. While teaching in the schools of [[Rengarih]] and [[Ranchi]] (1911\u201316), both important centres in the (now) [[Jharkhand]] state (India), Sevrin had his first contacts with the aboriginal population of the [[Chota Nagpur plateau]]. He then completed his Jesuit formation by doing [[Theology|theological studies]] in [[Kurseong]] ([[Darjeeling district]])<ref>The St Mary's Theologate of Kurseong was transferred to Delhi in 1971 and is known nowadays as the '[[Vidyajyoti College of Theology]]'.</ref> where he was ordained [[Catholic priest|priest]] on 1 July 1919.\n\n==Bishop of Ranchi (Jharkhand)==\nSevrin embarked on an educational career, first as a teacher in the [[St. John's High School, Ranchi|St. John's High School]] in Ranchi (1921\u201331) and later as inspector of the Catholic missions schools in the whole area (1923\u201324) when, to everybody\u2019s surprise, he was appointed [[bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ranchi|Ranchi]] (9 April 1934).

At that time, the [[Bengal]] state (covering the entire Eastern part of [[British India]]) was a mission area entrusted to the [[Belgian]] Jesuits. While teaching in the schools of [[Rengarih]] and [[Ranchi]] (1911\u201316), both important centres in the (now) [[Jharkhand]] state (India), Sevrin had his first contacts with the aboriginal population of the [[Chota Nagpur plateau]]. He then completed his Jesuit formation by doing [[Theology|theological studies]] in [[Kurseong]] ([[Darjeeling district]])<ref>The St Mary's Theologate of Kurseong was transferred to Delhi in 1971 and is known nowadays as the '[[Vidyajyoti College of Theology]]'.</ref> where he was ordained [[Catholic priest|priest]] on 1 July 1919.\n\n==Bishop of Ranchi (Jharkhand)==\nSevrin embarked on an educational career, first as a teacher in the [[St. John's High School, Ranchi|St. John's High School]] in Ranchi (1921\u201331) and later as inspector of the Catholic missions schools in the whole area (1923\u201324) when, to everybody\u2019s surprise, he was appointed [[bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ranchi|Ranchi]] (9 April 1934). The diocese had been created in 1927 and Sevrin was its second bishop.

It was also used in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], but was later replaced with the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[Th (digraph)|th]],'' except in [[Iceland]], where it survives. The letter originated from the [[runic alphabet|rune]] {{Runic|[[\u16a6]]}} in the [[Elder Fu\u00feark]] and was called ''thorn'' in the Anglo-Saxon and ''thorn'' or ''[[J\u00f6tunn|thurs]]'' in the Scandinavian [[rune poem]]s. <!-- UNSUPPORTED: Its reconstructed [[Proto-Germanic]] name is ''[[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]]''.--> It is similar in appearance to the archaic Greek letter [[Sho (letter)|sho (\u03f8)]], although the two are historically unrelated.\n\nIt is pronounced as either a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} or the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced counterpart of it]] {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}. However, in modern Icelandic, it is pronounced as a [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] [[voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b8\u0320]}},<ref name=\"P\u00e9tursson\">{{Harvcoltxt|P\u00e9tursson|1971|p=?}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=145}}</ref>{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=144\u2013145}} similar to ''th'' as in the [[English language|English]] word ''thick'', or a (usually [[Apical consonant|apical]]) [[voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative]] {{IPA|[\u00f0\u0320]}},<ref name=\"P\u00e9tursson\"/>{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=144\u2013145}} similar to ''th'' as in the English word ''the''. Modern Icelandic usage generally excludes the latter, which is instead represented with the letter [[eth]] {{angbr|\u00d0, \u00f0}}; however, {{IPA|[\u00f0\u0320]}} may occur as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/\u03b8\u0320/}}, and written {{angle bracket|\u00fe}}, when it appears in an unstressed pronoun or adverb after a voiced sound.<ref name=\"Einarsson 1949\">{{cite book|last=Einarsson|first=Stef\u00e1n|title=Icelandic: Grammar, Texts, Glossary|year=1949|publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press|location=Baltimore|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn [[typography]], the lowercase thorn [[glyph|character]] is unusual in that it has both an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] and a [[descender]] (other examples are lowercase [[Ef (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic \u0444]] and in some fonts, the Latin letter [[f]]).\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== English ===\n\n==== Old English ====\n\nThe letter thorn was used for writing [[Old English language|Old English]] very early on, as was [[\u00f0]]; unlike \u00f0, thorn remained in common use through most of the [[Middle English]] period. Both letters were used for the phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, sometimes by the same scribe. This sound was regularly realised in [[Old English#Phonology|Old English]] as the voiced fricative {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} between voiced sounds, but either letter could be used to write it; the modern use of {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic alphabets]] is not the same as the [[Old English#Orthography|Old English orthographic use]]. A thorn with the [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] crossed ([[Thorn with stroke|\ua764]]) was a popular abbreviation for the word ''[[that]]''.\n\n==== Middle and Early Modern English ====\n\nThe modern [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''th'' began to grow in popularity during the 14th century; at the same time, the shape of thorn grew less distinctive, with the letter losing its ascender (becoming similar in appearance to the old [[wynn]] ({{lang|ang|\u01f7, \u01bf}}), which had fallen out of use by 1300, and to ancient through modern ''P'', ''p''). In some hands, such as that of the scribe of the unique mid-15th-century manuscript of ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|The Boke of Margery Kempe]]'', it ultimately became indistinguishable from the letter Y. By this stage, ''th'' was predominant and the use of thorn was largely restricted to certain common words and abbreviations. In [[William Caxton]]'s pioneering printed English, it is rare except in an abbreviated ''the'', written with a thorn and a superscript E. This was the longest-lived use, though the substitution of Y for thorn soon became ubiquitous, leading to the common 'ye', as in '[[Ye Olde]] Curiositie Shoppe'. One major reason for this was that Y existed in the printer's type fonts that were imported from Germany or Italy, while thorn did not. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The word was never pronounced with a \"y\" sound, though, even when so written.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/ye-olde|title=ye-olde - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes {{!}} Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> The first printing of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] in 1611 used the Y form of thorn with a superscript E in places such as Job 1:9, John 15:1, and Romans 15:29. It also used a similar form with a superscript T, which was an abbreviated ''[[that]]'', in places such as 2 Corinthians 13:7. All were replaced in later printings by ''the'' or ''that'', respectively.\n\n===== Abbreviations =====\n\nThe following were abbreviations during Middle and Early Modern English using the letter thorn:\n* [[Image:Middle English the.svg|Middle English the.svg]] \u2013 (''\u00fe\u0364'') a Middle English abbreviation for the word ''the''\n* [[Image:Middle English that.svg|Middle English that.svg]] \u2013 (''\u00fe\u036d'') a Middle English abbreviation for the word ''that''\n* [[Image:Middle English thou.svg|Middle English thou.svg]] \u2013 (''\u00fe\u0367'') a rare Middle English abbreviation for the word ''[[thou]]'' (which was written early on as ''\u00feu'' or ''\u00feou'')\n* (''y\u1de4'') an Early Modern English abbreviation for the word ''this''\n* [[Image:EME ye.svg|EME ye.svg]] \u2013 (''y\u0364'') an Early Modern English abbreviation for the word ''the''\n* [[Image:EME that.svg|EME that.svg]] \u2013 (''y\u036d'') an Early Modern English abbreviation for the word ''that''\n\n==== Modern English ====\nThorn in the form of a \"Y\" survives in pseudo-archaic uses, particularly the [[stock phrase|stock prefix]] \"[[Ye olde]]\". The [[definite article]] spelt with \"Y\" for thorn is often jocularly or mistakenly pronounced {{IPA|/ji\u02d0/}} (\"yee\") or mistaken for the archaic [[nominative case]] of the second person plural pronoun, \"[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]\", as in \"hear ye!\". In fact, the y in the pronoun would have been spelled with a [[yogh]], ''\u021de'', rather than a ''y''.\n\n===Icelandic===\nThe [[Icelandic language]] is the only living language to retain the letter thorn (in Icelandic; ''\u00fe'', pronounced ''\u00feoddn'', {{IPA-is|\u03b8\u0320\u0254tn\u0325|}} or ''\u00feordn'' {{IPA-is|\u03b8\u0320\u0254rtn\u0325|}}). The letter is the 30th in the [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], modelled after [[Old Norse orthography|Old Norse alphabet]] in the 19th century; it is [[transliteration|transliterated]] to ''th'' when it cannot be reproduced<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/Romanization/Romanization_RomanScripts.pdf |format=PDF |title=ICELANDIC BGN/PCGN 1968 Agreement}}</ref> and never appears at the end of a word. For example, the name of [[Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson]] is [[anglicise]]d as Haf'''th'''or.\n\nIts pronunciation has not varied much, but before the introduction of the [[eth]] character, ''\u00fe'' was used to represent the sound {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}, as in the word \"''ver'''\u00fe'''a''\", which is spelt ''ver'''\u00f0'''a'' (meaning \"to become\") in modern Icelandic or normalized orthography.<ref name=\"Gordon 1927\">{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=E.V.|title=An Introduction to Old Norse|year=1927|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-811184-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontool00gord/page/268 268]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontool00gord/page/268}}</ref> \u00de was originally taken from the [[runic alphabet]] and is described in the [[First Grammatical Treatise]] from the 12th-century:\n{|class=wikitable\n|Staf \u00feann er flestir menn kalla ''\u00fe'', \u00feann kalla \u00e9g af \u00fev\u00ed heldur ''\u00fee'' a\u00f0 \u00fe\u00e1 er \u00fea\u00f0 atkv\u00e6\u00f0i hans \u00ed hverju m\u00e1li sem eftir lifir nafnsins er \u00far er tekinn raddarstafur \u00far nafni hans, sem alla hefi \u00e9g samhlj\u00f3\u00f0endur samda \u00ed \u00fea\u00f0 mark n\u00fa sem \u00e9g reit snemma \u00ed \u00feeirra umr\u00e6\u00f0u.

It was also used in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], but was later replaced with the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[Th (digraph)|th]],'' except in [[Iceland]], where it survives. The letter originated from the [[runic alphabet|rune]] {{Runic|[[\u16a6]]}} in the [[Elder Fu\u00feark]] and was called ''thorn'' in the Anglo-Saxon and ''thorn'' or ''[[J\u00f6tunn|thurs]]'' in the Scandinavian [[rune poem]]s. <!-- UNSUPPORTED: Its reconstructed [[Proto-Germanic]] name is ''[[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]]''.--> It is similar in appearance to the archaic Greek letter [[Sho (letter)|sho (\u03f8)]], although the two are historically unrelated.\n\nIt is pronounced as either a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} or the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced counterpart of it]] {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}. However, in modern Icelandic, it is pronounced as a [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] [[voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b8\u0320]}},<ref name=\"P\u00e9tursson\">{{Harvcoltxt|P\u00e9tursson|1971|p=?}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=145}}</ref>{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=144\u2013145}} similar to ''th'' as in the [[English language|English]] word ''thick'', or a (usually [[Apical consonant|apical]]) [[voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative]] {{IPA|[\u00f0\u0320]}},<ref name=\"P\u00e9tursson\"/>{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=144\u2013145}} similar to ''th'' as in the English word ''the''. Modern Icelandic usage generally excludes the latter, which is instead represented with the letter [[eth]] {{angbr|\u00d0, \u00f0}}; however, {{IPA|[\u00f0\u0320]}} may occur as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/\u03b8\u0320/}}, and written {{angle bracket|\u00fe}}, when it appears in an unstressed pronoun or adverb after a voiced sound.<ref name=\"Einarsson 1949\">{{cite book|last=Einarsson|first=Stef\u00e1n|title=Icelandic: Grammar, Texts, Glossary|year=1949|publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press|location=Baltimore|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn [[typography]], the lowercase thorn [[glyph|character]] is unusual in that it has both an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] and a [[descender]] (other examples are lowercase [[Ef (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic \u0444]] and in some fonts, the Latin letter [[f]]).\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== English ===\n\n==== Old English ====\n\nThe letter thorn was used for writing [[Old English language|Old English]] very early on, as was [[\u00f0]]; unlike \u00f0, thorn remained in common use through most of the [[Middle English]] period. Both letters were used for the phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, sometimes by the same scribe. This sound was regularly realised in [[Old English#Phonology|Old English]] as the voiced fricative {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} between voiced sounds, but either letter could be used to write it; the modern use of {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic alphabets]] is not the same as the [[Old English#Orthography|Old English orthographic use]]. A thorn with the [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] crossed ([[Thorn with stroke|\ua764]]) was a popular abbreviation for the word ''[[that]]''.\n\n==== Middle and Early Modern English ====\n\nThe modern [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''th'' began to grow in popularity during the 14th century; at the same time, the shape of thorn grew less distinctive, with the letter losing its ascender (becoming similar in appearance to the old [[wynn]] ({{lang|ang|\u01f7, \u01bf}}), which had fallen out of use by 1300, and to ancient through modern ''P'', ''p''). In some hands, such as that of the scribe of the unique mid-15th-century manuscript of ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|The Boke of Margery Kempe]]'', it ultimately became indistinguishable from the letter Y. By this stage, ''th'' was predominant and the use of thorn was largely restricted to certain common words and abbreviations. In [[William Caxton]]'s pioneering printed English, it is rare except in an abbreviated ''the'', written with a thorn and a superscript E. This was the longest-lived use, though the substitution of Y for thorn soon became ubiquitous, leading to the common 'ye', as in '[[Ye Olde]] Curiositie Shoppe'. One major reason for this was that Y existed in the printer's type fonts that were imported from Germany or Italy, while thorn did not. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The word was never pronounced with a \"y\" sound, though, even when so written.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/ye-olde|title=ye-olde - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes {{!}} Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> The first printing of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] in 1611 used the Y form of thorn with a superscript E in places such as Job 1:9, John 15:1, and Romans 15:29. It also used a similar form with a superscript T, which was an abbreviated ''[[that]]'', in places such as 2 Corinthians 13:7. All were replaced in later printings by ''the'' or ''that'', respectively.\n\n===== Abbreviations =====\n\nThe following were abbreviations during Middle and Early Modern English using the letter thorn:\n* [[Image:Middle English the.svg|Middle English the.svg]] \u2013 (''\u00fe\u0364'') a Middle English abbreviation for the word ''the''\n* [[Image:Middle English that.svg|Middle English that.svg]] \u2013 (''\u00fe\u036d'') a Middle English abbreviation for the word ''that''\n* [[Image:Middle English thou.svg|Middle English thou.svg]] \u2013 (''\u00fe\u0367'') a rare Middle English abbreviation for the word ''[[thou]]'' (which was written early on as ''\u00feu'' or ''\u00feou'')\n* (''y\u1de4'') an Early Modern English abbreviation for the word ''this''\n* [[Image:EME ye.svg|EME ye.svg]] \u2013 (''y\u0364'') an Early Modern English abbreviation for the word ''the''\n* [[Image:EME that.svg|EME that.svg]] \u2013 (''y\u036d'') an Early Modern English abbreviation for the word ''that''\n\n==== Modern English ====\nThorn in the form of a \"Y\" survives in pseudo-archaic uses, particularly the [[stock phrase|stock prefix]] \"[[Ye olde]]\". The [[definite article]] spelt with \"Y\" for thorn is often jocularly or mistakenly pronounced {{IPA|/ji\u02d0/}} (\"yee\") or mistaken for the archaic [[nominative case]] of the second person plural pronoun, \"[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]\", as in \"hear ye!\". In fact, the y in the pronoun would have been spelled with a [[yogh]], ''\u021de'', rather than a ''y''.\n\n===Icelandic===\nThe [[Icelandic language]] is the only living language to retain the letter thorn (in Icelandic; ''\u00fe'', pronounced ''\u00feoddn'', {{IPA-is|\u03b8\u0320\u0254tn\u0325|}} or ''\u00feordn'' {{IPA-is|\u03b8\u0320\u0254rtn\u0325|}}). The letter is the 30th in the [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], modelled after [[Old Norse orthography|Old Norse alphabet]] in the 19th century; it is [[transliteration|transliterated]] to ''th'' when it cannot be reproduced<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/Romanization/Romanization_RomanScripts.pdf |format=PDF |title=ICELANDIC BGN/PCGN 1968 Agreement}}</ref> and never appears at the end of a word. For example, the name of [[Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson]] is [[anglicise]]d as Haf'''th'''or.\n\nIts pronunciation has not varied much, but before the introduction of the [[eth]] character, ''\u00fe'' was used to represent the sound {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}, as in the word \"''ver'''\u00fe'''a''\", which is spelt ''ver'''\u00f0'''a'' (meaning \"to become\") in modern Icelandic or normalized orthography.<ref name=\"Gordon 1927\">{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=E.V.|title=An Introduction to Old Norse|year=1927|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-811184-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontool00gord/page/268 268]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontool00gord/page/268}}</ref> \u00de was originally taken from the [[runic alphabet]] and is described in the [[First Grammatical Treatise]] from the 12th-century:\n{|class=wikitable\n|Staf \u00feann er flestir menn kalla ''\u00fe'', \u00feann kalla \u00e9g af \u00fev\u00ed heldur ''\u00fee'' a\u00f0 \u00fe\u00e1 er \u00fea\u00f0 atkv\u00e6\u00f0i hans \u00ed hverju m\u00e1li sem eftir lifir nafnsins er \u00far er tekinn raddarstafur \u00far nafni hans, sem alla hefi \u00e9g samhlj\u00f3\u00f0endur samda \u00ed \u00fea\u00f0 mark n\u00fa sem \u00e9g reit snemma \u00ed \u00feeirra umr\u00e6\u00f0u.
