Despite the importance of the mother in the family structure as the bearer of the children, she had no legal control over her children.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|20}} Examples of mother-child relationships in ancient sources, if discussed at all, focus on describing her as the idealized ''Roman Matrona''. A ''Roman Matrona'' was a strong, virtuous woman dedicated to the political advancement of her family.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|20}} [[Marcus Aurelius]] provides a rare insight into the affectionate relationship between mother and son in a letter describing an afternoon spent with his mother playfully arguing and gossiping.<ref>Marcus Aurelius,''Fronto's Letters'', 4.6</ref> The lack of literary discussion may have resulted because so many children never knew their mothers, who often died in childbirth. It was also the case that young children often had more contact with their wet nurse or pedagogue than their mother.\n\n==Children==\n\n===Starting a Family===\nThe nuclear family of father, mother, and children was essential to the Ancient Roman family structure. Although mothers gave birth to many children, the size of a Roman family remained relatively small because of the high infant and child mortality rate. Twenty-five percent of infants died within their first year, while another 25% died before their tenth birthday.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|16}} Such a high rate meant women had to bear multiple children because many would not make it to adulthood. However, for couples who did not want to become pregnant, there were forms of contraception available to them, as well as abortion.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|26\u201327}}\n\n===Life Course===\nIn infancy, a new born was either accepted into the family by his/her father in a ritual called ''tollere liberos'' or the child was exposed by the father, often without the consent of the mother.<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|39}} Exposure differed from [[infanticide]] and the abandoned child was often taken and raised by someone else. A child was considered an infant until he/she was seven years old. At this time, boys would begin their education and be introduced to public life.<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|35\u201336}} Girls remained in the household to learn the skills they would need as wives and mothers. Legally, a girl was considered a child until she was twelve years old and a boy until he was fourteen years old. Young girls were often engaged at twelve years old and married at thirteen to a man chosen by her father.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|37}} Males transitioned to adulthood during the ''toga virilis'' ceremony when they received the white toga worn by adults.<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|67}} Childhood ended for women once they were married, but they were still considered childlike because of their weaker dispositions compared to men.<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|36}}\n\n[[File:Sarcophagus nuts Chiaramonti Inv1304.jpg|thumb|Sarcophagus depicting children at play]]\n\n===Wet Nurses and Pedagogues===\n{{main|Wet nurse|Pedagogy}}\n\nWithin the household, infants and children would have interacted with servants and household slaves. During infancy, babies were often nursed and cared for by wet nurses, or ''nutrix''. Nurses were used by families of every social level and were often employed when the mother had died from childbirth, was unable to produce milk, wanted to become pregnant again quickly or was ill.<ref name=\"Bradley1991\"/>{{rp|26}} <ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|41}} A nurse, besides having a moral character, was expected to speak properly because her close interaction with her charge was highly influential to the child's development.<ref>Quintilian, ''The Elements of Oratory'', 1.1.4-5</ref>\n\nPedagogues, or male tutors, were minders for both male and female children.<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|45}} He could be of servile or free status and was responsible for teaching the children proper etiquette and life skills.<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|45}} Pedagogues were also chaperons and tutors. Similarly to wet nurses, pedagogues were employed by families of all social classes.<ref name=\"Bradley1991\"/>{{rp|48}}\n\n===Adoption===\n{{main|Adoption in ancient Rome}}\n\nSince the mortality rate of children in Ancient Rome was so high, many parents needed to adopt. This was also common if parents were unable to have children.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|30}} Adoption normally occurred because of the need to have heirs to continue the family name. Most often a nephew or a grandson was adopted if the couple itself did not have a son.<ref name=\"Dixon1992\"/> This was particularly prominent among the Roman emperors. [[Julius Caesar]], for example, adopted his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (later known as Emperor [[Augustus]]) because he had no sons to succeed him. In some instances, masters would free their slave in order to officially adopt him into the family. By doing so, the slave could take on the family name and become an heir.\n\n==Elderly==\n[[File:Aineias Ankhises Louvre F122.jpg|thumb|Greek pottery showing [[Aeneas]] carrying his elderly father]]\n\nThe average life expectancy in Ancient Rome at birth was 27 years old.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|16}} Early deaths in women were common because of the dangers of childbirth and men often died on the battlefield. Those who lived to an elderly age expected their children to take care of them. In the second century AD, laws were passed stating a son should care for his elderly father, however there was no compulsory obligation.<ref name=\"Rawson1999\">Rawson, Beryl, and Paul Weaver, eds. ''The Roman Family in Italy: Status, Sentiment, Space''. Oxford: Clarendon, 1999.</ref>{{rp|132}} Children cared for their elderly parents because of their belief in ''pietas'', or a sense duty to their parents and the gods.<ref name=\"Rawson1999\"/>{{rp|132}} A mythological example of ''pietas'' comes from the story of [[Aeneas]], who carried his elderly father out of the burning city of Troy following the [[Trojan War]].<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\n==Slaves==\n{{main|Slavery in ancient Rome}}\n\nThe Ancient Roman definition of ''domus'' consisted of everyone living in the household, which included slaves. Slaves were a constant presence in a Roman family. A significant example were the wet nurses and pedagogues who cared for and raised the children. Upper class Roman families often included space for their slaves in the family burial site and in exchange the slaves ensured their master received proper burial rites when he died.<ref name=\"Dixon1992\"/> It was common for slaves to be manumitted, or freed, by their master and become his dependents as freedmen.\n\n==Freedpersons==\n\n[[File:9941 - Museo Archeologico di Milano - Lapide degli Asellii, sec. II d.C. - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 13 Mar 2012.jpg|thumb|Funerary stele for the freedman Marcus Asellius Clemens, his wife, and their freedman]]\nFreedpersons, or ''liberti'', were ex-slaves who were freed.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|186}} Although free, many ''liberti'' continued to work for their previous master. When freed, ''liberti'' took on the name of their master, thereby continuing the family name.<ref name=\"Rawson1999\"/> By taking their master's name, ''liberti'' were considered part of the ''familia'', not just the ''domus''. Like slaves, freedmen and freedwomen, with their families, were provided burial space with the ''familia''.<ref name=\"Rawson1999\"/>{{rp|216}}\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Roman marriage vows.jpg|thumb|Roman marriage vows]]\n{{main|Marriage in ancient Rome}}\n\nThe beginnings of a new Roman family began with marriage. Marriage was a means to provide sons to serve Rome.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|24}} Women were married young, normally to men much older than themselves. These girls in their late teens may have already been married once before.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|37}} Marriages were arranged by family members, normally the father, especially in the upper classes where marriages created political alliances.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|38}} Marriage, and even divorce, did not have to be ratified by the state <ref name=\"Treggiari1991\">Treggiari, Susan. ''Roman Marriage''. Oxford: Clarendon Press,1991.</ref> A simple agreement between both parties was the only necessity. A marriage, for the upper classes, consisted of  a wedding procession, where the woman was carried from her old home to the home of her new husband, accompanied by people singing wedding songs.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|94-40}} Once married, the wife became a part of her husband's family and gained the title of ''materfamilias'', or \"mother of a household\".<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/>{{rp|}} A wife held the same property rights as a daughter and, therefore, could not receive her husband's property until his death.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/> Once a wife, a woman would quickly also become a mother. Society taught women that their most valuable contribution to Rome was to give birth to many sons.\n\n===Divorce and Remarriage===\nDivorce and remarriage were common in Roman society. Since so many marriages were arranged, the couple did not necessarily expect romance, but did hope to live in harmony, or ''concordia''.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|44}} If a marriage did not work out, divorce was as easily obtained as the marriage had been because the state did not need to ratify either. However, it was common to consult advice from close family or friends before getting a divorce.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/> Both the man and the woman could request a divorce.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/>{{rp|443}} The divorce procedure usually contained a verbal formula, in which the parties announced the end of the marriage.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/>{{rp|446}} A father could force his child to get a divorce through his ''patria potestas'', even if the marriage was happy. Divorce became increasingly common in the upper classes by the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Imperial periods because so many marriages were based on politics.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|50}} If a man lost favor politically, a wife might divorce him to protect her family's reputation. In a divorce, the woman's family would usually ask the husband to return her dowry.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|50}} This was possible only if the wife was innocent of any offense. If her husband divorced her because of a transgression like adultery or failure to perform her duties in the home, a wife could not have her dowry returned.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/>{{rp|441}}\n\nRemarriages were a result not only of divorce, but also of the high mortality rate in Ancient Rome. A husband could remarry if his wife died in childbirth, a wife could remarry if her husband died at war, and either could remarry if the other died from disease, an accident, or old age.<ref name=\"Bradley1991\"/> Divorce and remarriage could greatly alter the family structure by creating blended families. Step parents and step siblings were often added to the family. When a man remarried his children lived in his new household and their mother, if still alive, would rarely see them again.<ref name=\"Bradley1991\"/>\n\n===Adultery===\nBoth men and women had affairs in Ancient Rome. The difference was it was socially acceptable for a husband to have an affair with a slave or a lower class woman.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|51}} It was never acceptable for a wife to have an affair with anyone. She was expected to remain faithful to her husband, even if she knew he was having an affair.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|54}} Although women had affairs, it is hard to determine how common the practice was. The only exception for a man was he was not supposed to have a relationship with another upper class, married woman.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|54}} However, during the Imperial period, it became more common for men to have affairs with upper class women. Some literature from Ancient Rome even gave advise on the best location to meet a mistress. In [[Ovid]]'s poem, ''The Art of Love'', he describes meeting women at a public location, like the circus or a horse race, to avoid detection.<ref>Ovid,''The Art of Love'', 1.135-163</ref> Because married couples had separate bedrooms, it was easy for a man to have an affair, but a woman was closely monitored by the household staff, which made having an affair within her own home almost impossible.<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|31}} If a cheating wife was caught by her husband with her lover, her husband had the legal right to kill the adulterer and immediately divorce his wife.<ref>''Acta Divi Augusti''(Rome, 1945),/</ref>\n\n==Kinship terms==\n{{expand section}}\nThe [[kinship]] terms in the [[Latin language]] follow the [[Sudanese kinship]] system.\nLatin has a word for every role in the system.\nThe terminology used by anthropologists when analyzing kinship in cultures is often derived from Latin (words like ''[[amitalocality]]'', ''[[patrilineal]]'').<ref name=\"Schwimmer\">{{cite web |last1=Schwimmer |first1=Brian |title=Latin Kin Terms |url=https://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/kinterms/latin.html |website=www.umanitoba.ca |publisher=University of Manitoba |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=August 2003}}</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[Ancient Rome]]\n*[[Family]]\n*[[Marriage]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Family in Ancient Rome\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n* Bradley, Keith. 1991. \"A Roman Family.\" In ''Discovering the Roman Family: Studies in Roman Social History.''

These girls in their late teens may have already been married once before.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|37}} Marriages were arranged by family members, normally the father, especially in the upper classes where marriages created political alliances.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|38}} Marriage, and even divorce, did not have to be ratified by the state <ref name=\"Treggiari1991\">Treggiari, Susan. ''Roman Marriage''. Oxford: Clarendon Press,1991.</ref> A simple agreement between both parties was the only necessity. A marriage, for the upper classes, consisted of  a wedding procession, where the woman was carried from her old home to the home of her new husband, accompanied by people singing wedding songs.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|94-40}} Once married, the wife became a part of her husband's family and gained the title of ''materfamilias'', or \"mother of a household\".<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/>{{rp|}} A wife held the same property rights as a daughter and, therefore, could not receive her husband's property until his death.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/> Once a wife, a woman would quickly also become a mother. Society taught women that their most valuable contribution to Rome was to give birth to many sons.\n\n===Divorce and Remarriage===\nDivorce and remarriage were common in Roman society. Since so many marriages were arranged, the couple did not necessarily expect romance, but did hope to live in harmony, or ''concordia''.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|44}} If a marriage did not work out, divorce was as easily obtained as the marriage had been because the state did not need to ratify either. However, it was common to consult advice from close family or friends before getting a divorce.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/> Both the man and the woman could request a divorce.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/>{{rp|443}} The divorce procedure usually contained a verbal formula, in which the parties announced the end of the marriage.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/>{{rp|446}} A father could force his child to get a divorce through his ''patria potestas'', even if the marriage was happy. Divorce became increasingly common in the upper classes by the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Imperial periods because so many marriages were based on politics.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|50}} If a man lost favor politically, a wife might divorce him to protect her family's reputation. In a divorce, the woman's family would usually ask the husband to return her dowry.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|50}} This was possible only if the wife was innocent of any offense. If her husband divorced her because of a transgression like adultery or failure to perform her duties in the home, a wife could not have her dowry returned.<ref name=\"Treggiari1991\"/>{{rp|441}}\n\nRemarriages were a result not only of divorce, but also of the high mortality rate in Ancient Rome. A husband could remarry if his wife died in childbirth, a wife could remarry if her husband died at war, and either could remarry if the other died from disease, an accident, or old age.<ref name=\"Bradley1991\"/> Divorce and remarriage could greatly alter the family structure by creating blended families. Step parents and step siblings were often added to the family. When a man remarried his children lived in his new household and their mother, if still alive, would rarely see them again.<ref name=\"Bradley1991\"/>\n\n===Adultery===\nBoth men and women had affairs in Ancient Rome. The difference was it was socially acceptable for a husband to have an affair with a slave or a lower class woman.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|51}} It was never acceptable for a wife to have an affair with anyone. She was expected to remain faithful to her husband, even if she knew he was having an affair.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|54}} Although women had affairs, it is hard to determine how common the practice was. The only exception for a man was he was not supposed to have a relationship with another upper class, married woman.<ref name=\"Shelton1998\"/>{{rp|54}} However, during the Imperial period, it became more common for men to have affairs with upper class women. Some literature from Ancient Rome even gave advise on the best location to meet a mistress. In [[Ovid]]'s poem, ''The Art of Love'', he describes meeting women at a public location, like the circus or a horse race, to avoid detection.<ref>Ovid,''The Art of Love'', 1.135-163</ref> Because married couples had separate bedrooms, it was easy for a man to have an affair, but a woman was closely monitored by the household staff, which made having an affair within her own home almost impossible.<ref name=\"Harlow2002\"/>{{rp|31}} If a cheating wife was caught by her husband with her lover, her husband had the legal right to kill the adulterer and immediately divorce his wife.<ref>''Acta Divi Augusti''(Rome, 1945),/</ref>\n\n==Kinship terms==\n{{expand section}}\nThe [[kinship]] terms in the [[Latin language]] follow the [[Sudanese kinship]] system.\nLatin has a word for every role in the system.\nThe terminology used by anthropologists when analyzing kinship in cultures is often derived from Latin (words like ''[[amitalocality]]'', ''[[patrilineal]]'').<ref name=\"Schwimmer\">{{cite web |last1=Schwimmer |first1=Brian |title=Latin Kin Terms |url=https://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/kinterms/latin.html |website=www.umanitoba.ca |publisher=University of Manitoba |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=August 2003}}</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[Ancient Rome]]\n*[[Family]]\n*[[Marriage]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Family in Ancient Rome\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n* Bradley, Keith. 1991. \"A Roman Family.\" In ''Discovering the Roman Family: Studies in Roman Social History.''

She gained a role as an [[extra (acting)|extra]] in ''[[Money on the Street]]'' (1930), and then a small speaking part in ''[[Storm in a Water Glass]]'' (1931).

She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.\n\nThe film became both celebrated and notorious for showing the actress's face in the throes of an orgasm.
