Indo-Aryan population movements into the region and Anatolia (ancient [[Mitanni]]) from [[Central Asia]] are generally considered to have started around 2000 BCE, as a slow diffusion during the [[Indus Valley Civilisation#Late Harappan|Late Harappan]] period, which led to a [[language shift]] in the northern Indian subcontinent. The Iranian languages were brought into Iran by the Iranians, who were closely related to the Indo-Aryans.\n\nThe [[Indo-Iranians|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] culture, which gave rise to the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] and Iranians, developed on the [[Eurasian Steppe#Central Steppe|Central Asian steppes]] north of the [[Caspian Sea]] as the [[Sintashta culture]] (2200<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/36191998/Parpola_Asko_2017._Finnish_vatsa_Skt_vats%C3%A1-_and_the_formation_of_Indo-Iranian_and_Uralic_languages._Journal_de_la_Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_Finno-Ougrienne_96_245-286 Parpola, Asko, (2017). \"Finnish vatsa - Sanskrit vatsh\u00e1 - and the formation of Indo-Iranian and Uralic languages\", p. 249,]</ref>\u20131800 BCE){{sfn|Witzel|1998}}{{sfn|Witzel|2003}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=408\u2013411}}{{sfn|Anthony|2009|pp=390 (fig. 15.9), 405\u2013411}}{{sfn|Kuz'mina|2007|p=222}}{{sfn|Parpola|2015}} in present-day Russia and Kazakhstan, and developed further as the [[Andronovo culture]] (2000\u2013900 BCE),<ref name=\"EOIC\">{{harvnb|Mallory|1997|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> around the [[Aral Sea]]. The proto-Indo-Iranians then migrated southwards to the [[Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]], from which they borrowed their distinctive religious beliefs and practices. The Indo-Aryans split off around 1800 BCE to 1600 BCE from the Iranians,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} whereafter the Indo-Aryans migrated into Anatolia and the northern part of the [[South Asia]] (modern [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Nepal]]), while the Iranians moved into Iran, both bringing with them the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].\n\nMigration by an [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European people]] was first hypothesized in the late 18th century, following the discovery of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]], when similarities between western and Indian languages had been noted. Given these similarities, a [[Proto-Indo-European language|single source or origin]] was proposed, which was diffused by migrations from some original homeland.\n\nThis linguistic argument is supported by archeological, anthropological, genetical, literary and ecological research. Genetic research reveals that those migrations form part of a complex genetic puzzle on the origin and spread of the various components of the Indian population. Literary research reveals similarities between various, geographically distinct, Indo-Aryan historical cultures. Ecological studies reveal that in the second millennium BCE widespread aridization lead to water shortages and ecological changes in both the Eurasian steppes and the [[Indian subcontinent]],<ref group=web name=\"Kochhar2017\"/> causing the collapse of sedentary urban cultures in south central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and India, and triggering large-scale migrations, resulting in the merger of migrating peoples with the post-urban cultures.<ref group=web name=\"Kochhar2017\"/>\n\nThe Indo-Aryan migrations started in approximately 1800 BCE, after the invention of the [[Chariot|war chariot]], and also brought Indo-Aryan languages into the [[Levant]] and possibly [[Inner Asia]]. It was part of the diffusion of [[Indo-European languages]] from the [[proto-Indo-European homeland]] at the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]], a large area of [[grassland]]s in far [[Eastern Europe]], which started in the 5th to 4th millennia BCE, and the [[Indo-European migrations]] out of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s, which started approximately in 2000 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=33}}{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}\n\nThe theory posits that these Indo-Aryan speaking people may have been a genetically diverse group of people who were united by shared cultural norms and language, referred to as ''ary\u0101'', \"noble\". Diffusion of this culture and language took place by patron-client systems, which allowed for the absorption and acculturation of other groups into this culture, and explains the strong influence on other cultures with which it interacted.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:IE expansion.png|thumb|Scheme of [[Indo-European migrations]], of which the Indo-Aryan migrations form a part, from ca. 4000 to 1000 BCE according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]:<br />* The magenta area corresponds to the assumed ''[[Proto-Indo-European homeland|Urheimat]]'' ([[Samara culture]], [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the subsequent [[Yamna culture]]).<br />* The red area corresponds to the area which may have been settled by Indo-European-speaking peoples up to ca. 2500 BCE.<br />* The orange area corresponds to 1000 BCE.<br /> Source: Christopher I. Beckwith (2009), ''Empires of the Silk Road'', Oxford University Press, p.30.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=30}}]]\n\nThe Indo-Aryan Migration theory is part of a larger theoretical framework. This framework explains the similarities between a wide range of contemporary and ancient languages. It combines linguistic, archaeological and anthropological research.{{sfn|Witzel|2005}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} This provides an overview of the development of Indo-European languages, and the spread of these Indo-European languages by migration and acculturation.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}\n\n===Linguistics: relationships between languages===\nThe linguistic part traces the connections between the various [[Indo-European languages]], and reconstructs the [[proto-Indo-European language]]. This is possible because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are especially important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus makes it possible to see great similarities between related languages which at first sight might seem very different.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}} Various characteristics of the Indo-European languages argue against an Indian origin of these languages, and point to a steppe origin of these languages.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}\n\n===Archaeology: migrations from the steppe Urheimat===\nThe archaeological part posits an [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|\"Urheimat\"]] on the Pontic steppes, which developed after the introduction of cattle on the steppes around 5,200 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} This introduction marked the change from foragist to pastoralist cultures, and the development of a hierarchical social system with chieftains, patron-client systems, and the exchange of goods and gifts.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} The oldest nucleus may have been the [[Samara culture]] (late 6th and early 5th millennium BCE), at a bend in the Volga.\n\nA wider \"horizon\" developed, called the [[Kurgan hypothesis|Kurgan culture]] by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in the 1950s. She included several cultures in this \"Kurgan Culture\", including the Samara culture and the Yamna culture, although the [[Yamna culture]] (36th\u201323rd centuries BCE), also called \"Pit Grave Culture\", may more aptly be called the \"nucleus\" of the proto-Indo-European language.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} From this area, which already included various subcultures, Indo-European languages spread west, south and east starting around 4,000 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=29}} These languages may have been carried by small groups of males, with patron-client systems which allowed for the inclusion of other groups into their cultural system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}\n\nEastward emerged the [[Sintashta culture]] (2200\u20131800 BCE), where common Indo-Iranian was spoken.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} Out of the Shintashta culture developed the [[Andronovo culture]] (2000\u2013900 BCE), which interacted with the [[Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]] (2400\u20131600 BCE). This interaction further shaped the Indo-Iranians, which split at c. 1800\u20131600 BCE into the Indo-Aryans and the Iranians.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} The Indo-Aryans migrated to the Levant, northern India, and possibly [[South Asia]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} The migration into northern India was not a large-scale immigration, but may have consisted of small groups{{sfn|Witzel|2005|pp=342\u2013343}}{{refn|group=note|Michael Witzel: \"Just one 'Afghan' IA tribe that did not return to the highlands but stayed in their Panjab winter quarters in spring was needed to set off a wave of acculturation in the plains, by transmitting its 'status kit' (Ehret) to its neighbors.\"{{sfn|Witzel|2005|pp=342\u2013343}}<br />Compare Max Muller: \"why should not one shepherd, with his servants and flocks, have transferred his peculiar dialect from one part of Asia or Europe to another?

Especially sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus makes it possible to see great similarities between languages which at first sight might seem very different.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}\n\nLinguistics use the '''comparative method''' to study the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages with common descent from a shared ancestor, as opposed to the method of [[internal reconstruction]], which analyses the internal development of a single language over time.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|pp=31 ff}}.</ref> Ordinarily both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages, to fill in gaps in the historical record of a language, to discover the development of phonological, morphological, and other linguistic systems, and to confirm or refute hypothesized relationships between languages.\n\nThe comparative method aims to prove that two or more historically [[attested language]]s are descended from a single [[proto-language]] by comparing lists of [[cognate]] terms. From them, regular sound correspondences between the languages are established, and a sequence of regular [[sound change]]s can then be postulated, which allows the proto-language to be [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]]. Relation is deemed certain only if at least a partial reconstruction of the common ancestor is feasible, and if regular sound correspondences can be established with chance similarities ruled out.\n\nThe comparative method was developed over the 19th century. Key contributions were made by the Danish scholars [[Rasmus Rask]] and [[Karl Verner]] and the German scholar [[Jacob Grimm]]. The first linguist to offer reconstructed forms from a [[proto-language]] was [[August Schleicher]], in his ''Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen'', originally published in 1861.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|p=26}}.</ref>\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n[[Proto-Indo-European]] ('''PIE''') is the [[linguistic reconstruction]] of the common ancestor of the [[Indo-European languages]]. PIE was the first proposed [[proto-language]] to be widely accepted by modern linguists. Far more work has gone into reconstructing it than any other proto-language, and it is by far the best understood of all proto-languages of its age. During the 19th century, the vast majority of linguistic work was devoted to reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European or its daughter proto-languages such as [[Proto-Germanic]], and most of the current techniques of [[linguistic reconstruction]] in [[historical linguistics]] (e.g., the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]) were developed as a result.\n\nScholars estimate that PIE may have been spoken as a single language (before divergence began) around 3500 BCE, though estimates by different authorities can vary by more than a millennium. A [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|number of hypotheses]] have been proposed for the origin and spread of the language, the most popular among linguists being the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], which postulates an origin in the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]] of Eastern Europe. Features of the culture of the speakers of PIE, known as [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]], have also been reconstructed based on the shared vocabulary of the early [[attested language|attested]] Indo-European languages.\n\nAs mentioned above, the existence of PIE was first postulated in the 18th century by Sir William Jones, who observed the similarities between [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Latin]]. By the early 20th century, well-defined descriptions of PIE had been developed that are still accepted{{By whom|date=June 2019}} today (with some refinements). The largest developments of the 20th century were the discovery of the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian languages]] and the acceptance of the [[laryngeal theory]]. The Anatolian languages have also spurred a major re-evaluation of theories concerning the development of various shared Indo-European language features and the extent to which these features were present in PIE itself. Relationships to other language families, including the [[Uralic languages]], have been proposed but remain controversial.\n\nPIE is thought to have had a complex system of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] that included [[inflection|inflectional suffixes]] as well as [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (vowel alterations, as preserved in English ''sing, sang, sung''). Nouns and verbs had complex systems of [[declension]] and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] respectively.\n\n===Arguments against an Indian origin of proto-Indo-European===\n\n====Diversity====\nAccording to the linguistic center of gravity principle, the most likely point of origin of a language family is in the area of its greatest diversity.{{sfn|Sapir|1949|p=455}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Gordon Latham|Latham]], as cited in {{harvnb|Mallory|1989|p=152}}}} By this criterion, Northern India, home to only a single branch of the Indo-European language family (i.e., [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]), is an exceedingly unlikely candidate for the Indo-European homeland, compared to Central-Eastern Europe, for example, which is home to the [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Venetic language|Venetic]], [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] branches of Indo-European.{{sfn|Mallory|1989|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nBoth mainstream [[Urheimat]] solutions locate the Proto-Indo-European homeland in the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Mallory|1989|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\n====Dialectal variation====\nIt has been recognized since the mid-19th century, beginning with [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Schmidt]] and [[Hugo Schuchardt|Schuchardt]], that a binary [[tree model]] cannot capture all linguistic alignments; certain [[areal feature]]s cut across language groups and are better explained through a model treating linguistic change like [[Wave model|waves]] rippling out through a pond. This is true of the [[Indo-European languages]] as well. Various features originated and spread while [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was still a [[dialect continuum]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hock|1991|p=454}}</ref> These features sometimes cut across sub-families: for instance, the [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Ablative case|ablative]] plurals in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] feature endings beginning with -m-, rather than the usual -*bh-, e.g. [[Gothic language|Gothic]] dative plural ''[[wikt:\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf43#Gothic|sunum]]'' 'to the sons' and [[Old Church Slavonic]] instrumental plural ''[[wikt:\u0441\u044a\u0456\u043d\u044a#Old Church Slavonic|syn\u044a-mi]]'' 'with sons',<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fortson|2004|p=106}}</ref> despite the fact that the Germanic languages are [[Centum and satem languages|centum]], while Balto-Slavic languages are [[Centum and satem languages|satem]].\n\nThe strong correspondence between the [[dialect|dialectal relationships]] of the Indo-European languages and their actual geographical arrangement in their earliest attested forms makes an [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] origin, as suggested by the [[Indigenous Aryans|Out of India Theory]], unlikely.<ref name=hock1999>Hock (1996), \"Out of India? The linguistic evidence\", in {{Harvtxt|Bronkhorst|Deshpande|1999}}.</ref>\n\n====Substrate influence====\n{{Main|Substratum in the Vedic language}}\n\nAlready in 1870s the Neogrammarians realised that the Greek/Latin vocalism couldn't be explained on the basis of the Sanskrit one, and therefore must be more original.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Indo-Iranian and Uralic languages influenced each other, with the Finno-Ugric languages containing Indo-European loan words. A telling example is the Finnish word ''vasara'', \"hammer\", which is related to ''[[vajra]]'', the weapon of [[Indra]]. Since the Finno-Ugric homeland was located in the northern forest zone in northern Europe, the contacts must have taken place \u2013 in line with the placement of the proto-Indo-European homeland at the Pontic-Caspian steppes \u2013 between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.<ref group=web name=\"Kochhar2017\"/>\n\nDravidian and other South Asian languages share with Indo-Aryan a number of [[syntactical]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] features that are alien to other Indo-European languages, including even its closest relative, [[Iranian languages#Old Iranian|Old Iranian]]. [[Phonology|Phonologically]], there is the introduction of [[Retroflex consonant|retroflexes]], which alternate with [[Dental consonant|dentals]] in Indo-Aryan; morphologically there are the [[gerund]]s; and syntactically there is the use of a [[quotative]] [[Marker (linguistics)|marker]] (''iti'').{{refn|group=note|Krishnamurti states: \"Besides, the {{IAST|\u1e5ag}} [[Vedas]] has used the gerund, not found in [[Avestan]], with the same grammatical function as in [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], as a non-finite verb for 'incomplete' action. {{IAST|\u1e5ag}} Vedic language also attests the use of it as a quotation clause complementary.

Driven from the Ili Valley shortly afterwards by the Wusun, the Yuezhi migrated to [[Sogdia]] and then [[Bactria]], where they are often identified with the ''T\u00f3kharoi'' (\u03a4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9) and ''[[Asii]]'' of Classical sources.

They were followed by the [[Scythians]], whom would dominate the area, at their height, from the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, to the eastern-most fringes of [[Central Asia]] in the east. For most of their existence, they were based in what is modern-day Ukraine and southern European [[Russia]]. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, of whom the best known are the [[Roxolani]] (Rhoxolani), [[Iazyges]] (Jazyges) and the [[Alans]], followed the Scythians westwards into Europe in the late centuries BCE and the 1st and 2nd centuries of the Common Era (The [[Migration Period]]). The populous Sarmatian tribe of the [[Massagetae]], dwelling near the Caspian Sea, were known to the early rulers of Persia in the Achaemenid Period. In the east, the Saka occupied several areas in Xinjiang, from Khotan to Tumshuq.\n\nThe [[Medes]], [[Parthia]]ns and [[Persian people|Persians]] begin to appear on the western [[Iranian Plateau]] from c. 800 BCE, after which they remained under [[Assyria]]n rule for several centuries, as it was with the rest of the peoples in the [[Near East]]. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] replaced Median rule from 559 BCE. Around the first millennium of the [[Common Era]] (AD), the [[Kambojas]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] began to settle on the eastern edge of the Iranian Plateau, on the mountainous frontier of northwestern and western [[Pakistan]], displacing the earlier [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] from the area.\n\nIn Central Asia, the [[Turkic languages]] have marginalized [[Iranian languages]] as a result of the [[Turkic migration]] of the early centuries CE. In Eastern Europe, [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples]] assimilated and absorbed the native Iranian languages (Scythian and Sarmatian) of the region. Extant major Iranian languages are [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Pashto]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and [[Balochi language|Balochi]], besides numerous smaller ones.\n\n==Anthropology: elite recruitment and language change==\n{{See also|Language shift}}\n\n===Elite dominance===\nSmall groups can change a larger cultural area,{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} and elite male dominance by small groups may have led to a language shift in northern India.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2003|p=2287}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=117\u2013118}}{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|pp=208\u2013215}}{{refn|group=note|Basu et al.

The Iranian languages were brought into Iran by the Iranians, who were closely related to the Indo-Aryans.\n\nThe [[Indo-Iranians|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] culture, which gave rise to the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] and Iranians, developed on the [[Eurasian Steppe#Central Steppe|Central Asian steppes]] north of the [[Caspian Sea]] as the [[Sintashta culture]] (2200<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/36191998/Parpola_Asko_2017._Finnish_vatsa_Skt_vats%C3%A1-_and_the_formation_of_Indo-Iranian_and_Uralic_languages._Journal_de_la_Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_Finno-Ougrienne_96_245-286 Parpola, Asko, (2017). \"Finnish vatsa - Sanskrit vatsh\u00e1 - and the formation of Indo-Iranian and Uralic languages\", p. 249,]</ref>\u20131800 BCE){{sfn|Witzel|1998}}{{sfn|Witzel|2003}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=408\u2013411}}{{sfn|Anthony|2009|pp=390 (fig. 15.9), 405\u2013411}}{{sfn|Kuz'mina|2007|p=222}}{{sfn|Parpola|2015}} in present-day Russia and Kazakhstan, and developed further as the [[Andronovo culture]] (2000\u2013900 BCE),<ref name=\"EOIC\">{{harvnb|Mallory|1997|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> around the [[Aral Sea]]. The proto-Indo-Iranians then migrated southwards to the [[Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]], from which they borrowed their distinctive religious beliefs and practices. The Indo-Aryans split off around 1800 BCE to 1600 BCE from the Iranians,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} whereafter the Indo-Aryans migrated into Anatolia and the northern part of the [[South Asia]] (modern [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Nepal]]), while the Iranians moved into Iran, both bringing with them the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].\n\nMigration by an [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European people]] was first hypothesized in the late 18th century, following the discovery of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]], when similarities between western and Indian languages had been noted. Given these similarities, a [[Proto-Indo-European language|single source or origin]] was proposed, which was diffused by migrations from some original homeland.\n\nThis linguistic argument is supported by archeological, anthropological, genetical, literary and ecological research. Genetic research reveals that those migrations form part of a complex genetic puzzle on the origin and spread of the various components of the Indian population. Literary research reveals similarities between various, geographically distinct, Indo-Aryan historical cultures. Ecological studies reveal that in the second millennium BCE widespread aridization lead to water shortages and ecological changes in both the Eurasian steppes and the [[Indian subcontinent]],<ref group=web name=\"Kochhar2017\"/> causing the collapse of sedentary urban cultures in south central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and India, and triggering large-scale migrations, resulting in the merger of migrating peoples with the post-urban cultures.<ref group=web name=\"Kochhar2017\"/>\n\nThe Indo-Aryan migrations started in approximately 1800 BCE, after the invention of the [[Chariot|war chariot]], and also brought Indo-Aryan languages into the [[Levant]] and possibly [[Inner Asia]]. It was part of the diffusion of [[Indo-European languages]] from the [[proto-Indo-European homeland]] at the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]], a large area of [[grassland]]s in far [[Eastern Europe]], which started in the 5th to 4th millennia BCE, and the [[Indo-European migrations]] out of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s, which started approximately in 2000 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=33}}{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}\n\nThe theory posits that these Indo-Aryan speaking people may have been a genetically diverse group of people who were united by shared cultural norms and language, referred to as ''ary\u0101'', \"noble\". Diffusion of this culture and language took place by patron-client systems, which allowed for the absorption and acculturation of other groups into this culture, and explains the strong influence on other cultures with which it interacted.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:IE expansion.png|thumb|Scheme of [[Indo-European migrations]], of which the Indo-Aryan migrations form a part, from ca. 4000 to 1000 BCE according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]:<br />* The magenta area corresponds to the assumed ''[[Proto-Indo-European homeland|Urheimat]]'' ([[Samara culture]], [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the subsequent [[Yamna culture]]).<br />* The red area corresponds to the area which may have been settled by Indo-European-speaking peoples up to ca. 2500 BCE.<br />* The orange area corresponds to 1000 BCE.<br /> Source: Christopher I. Beckwith (2009), ''Empires of the Silk Road'', Oxford University Press, p.30.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=30}}]]\n\nThe Indo-Aryan Migration theory is part of a larger theoretical framework. This framework explains the similarities between a wide range of contemporary and ancient languages. It combines linguistic, archaeological and anthropological research.{{sfn|Witzel|2005}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} This provides an overview of the development of Indo-European languages, and the spread of these Indo-European languages by migration and acculturation.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}\n\n===Linguistics: relationships between languages===\nThe linguistic part traces the connections between the various [[Indo-European languages]], and reconstructs the [[proto-Indo-European language]]. This is possible because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are especially important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus makes it possible to see great similarities between related languages which at first sight might seem very different.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}} Various characteristics of the Indo-European languages argue against an Indian origin of these languages, and point to a steppe origin of these languages.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}\n\n===Archaeology: migrations from the steppe Urheimat===\nThe archaeological part posits an [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|\"Urheimat\"]] on the Pontic steppes, which developed after the introduction of cattle on the steppes around 5,200 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} This introduction marked the change from foragist to pastoralist cultures, and the development of a hierarchical social system with chieftains, patron-client systems, and the exchange of goods and gifts.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} The oldest nucleus may have been the [[Samara culture]] (late 6th and early 5th millennium BCE), at a bend in the Volga.\n\nA wider \"horizon\" developed, called the [[Kurgan hypothesis|Kurgan culture]] by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in the 1950s. She included several cultures in this \"Kurgan Culture\", including the Samara culture and the Yamna culture, although the [[Yamna culture]] (36th\u201323rd centuries BCE), also called \"Pit Grave Culture\", may more aptly be called the \"nucleus\" of the proto-Indo-European language.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} From this area, which already included various subcultures, Indo-European languages spread west, south and east starting around 4,000 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=29}} These languages may have been carried by small groups of males, with patron-client systems which allowed for the inclusion of other groups into their cultural system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}\n\nEastward emerged the [[Sintashta culture]] (2200\u20131800 BCE), where common Indo-Iranian was spoken.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} Out of the Shintashta culture developed the [[Andronovo culture]] (2000\u2013900 BCE), which interacted with the [[Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]] (2400\u20131600 BCE). This interaction further shaped the Indo-Iranians, which split at c. 1800\u20131600 BCE into the Indo-Aryans and the Iranians.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} The Indo-Aryans migrated to the Levant, northern India, and possibly [[South Asia]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} The migration into northern India was not a large-scale immigration, but may have consisted of small groups{{sfn|Witzel|2005|pp=342\u2013343}}{{refn|group=note|Michael Witzel: \"Just one 'Afghan' IA tribe that did not return to the highlands but stayed in their Panjab winter quarters in spring was needed to set off a wave of acculturation in the plains, by transmitting its 'status kit' (Ehret) to its neighbors.\"{{sfn|Witzel|2005|pp=342\u2013343}}<br />Compare Max Muller: \"why should not one shepherd, with his servants and flocks, have transferred his peculiar dialect from one part of Asia or Europe to another? This may seem a very humble and modest view of what was formerly represented as the irresistible stream of mighty waves rolling forth from the Aryan centre and gradually overflowing the mountains and valleys of Asia and Europe, but it is, at all events, a possible view; nay, I should say a view far more in keeping with what we know of recent colonisation.\"{{sfn|Muller|1988|p=91}}}} which were genetically diverse.

This argument was proposed by the mid-20th century archaeologist [[Mortimer Wheeler]], who interpreted the presence of many unburied corpses found in the top levels of Mohenjo-daro as the victims of conquest wars, and who famously stated that the god \"[[Indra]] stands accused\" of the destruction of the Civilisation.<ref name=\"GLP\" />\n\nThis position was soon left by the scholarly community, noticing that no evidence was found, and that the skeletons were found to be hasty interments, not massacred victims.<ref name=\"GLP\">{{citation |title=The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective |author = Gregory L.

Especially sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus makes it possible to see great similarities between languages which at first sight might seem very different.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}\n\nLinguistics use the '''comparative method''' to study the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages with common descent from a shared ancestor, as opposed to the method of [[internal reconstruction]], which analyses the internal development of a single language over time.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|pp=31 ff}}.</ref> Ordinarily both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages, to fill in gaps in the historical record of a language, to discover the development of phonological, morphological, and other linguistic systems, and to confirm or refute hypothesized relationships between languages.\n\nThe comparative method aims to prove that two or more historically [[attested language]]s are descended from a single [[proto-language]] by comparing lists of [[cognate]] terms. From them, regular sound correspondences between the languages are established, and a sequence of regular [[sound change]]s can then be postulated, which allows the proto-language to be [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]]. Relation is deemed certain only if at least a partial reconstruction of the common ancestor is feasible, and if regular sound correspondences can be established with chance similarities ruled out.\n\nThe comparative method was developed over the 19th century. Key contributions were made by the Danish scholars [[Rasmus Rask]] and [[Karl Verner]] and the German scholar [[Jacob Grimm]]. The first linguist to offer reconstructed forms from a [[proto-language]] was [[August Schleicher]], in his ''Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen'', originally published in 1861.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|p=26}}.</ref>\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n[[Proto-Indo-European]] ('''PIE''') is the [[linguistic reconstruction]] of the common ancestor of the [[Indo-European languages]]. PIE was the first proposed [[proto-language]] to be widely accepted by modern linguists. Far more work has gone into reconstructing it than any other proto-language, and it is by far the best understood of all proto-languages of its age. During the 19th century, the vast majority of linguistic work was devoted to reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European or its daughter proto-languages such as [[Proto-Germanic]], and most of the current techniques of [[linguistic reconstruction]] in [[historical linguistics]] (e.g., the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]) were developed as a result.\n\nScholars estimate that PIE may have been spoken as a single language (before divergence began) around 3500 BCE, though estimates by different authorities can vary by more than a millennium. A [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|number of hypotheses]] have been proposed for the origin and spread of the language, the most popular among linguists being the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], which postulates an origin in the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]] of Eastern Europe. Features of the culture of the speakers of PIE, known as [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]], have also been reconstructed based on the shared vocabulary of the early [[attested language|attested]] Indo-European languages.\n\nAs mentioned above, the existence of PIE was first postulated in the 18th century by Sir William Jones, who observed the similarities between [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Latin]]. By the early 20th century, well-defined descriptions of PIE had been developed that are still accepted{{By whom|date=June 2019}} today (with some refinements). The largest developments of the 20th century were the discovery of the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian languages]] and the acceptance of the [[laryngeal theory]]. The Anatolian languages have also spurred a major re-evaluation of theories concerning the development of various shared Indo-European language features and the extent to which these features were present in PIE itself. Relationships to other language families, including the [[Uralic languages]], have been proposed but remain controversial.\n\nPIE is thought to have had a complex system of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] that included [[inflection|inflectional suffixes]] as well as [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (vowel alterations, as preserved in English ''sing, sang, sung''). Nouns and verbs had complex systems of [[declension]] and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] respectively.\n\n===Arguments against an Indian origin of proto-Indo-European===\n\n====Diversity====\nAccording to the linguistic center of gravity principle, the most likely point of origin of a language family is in the area of its greatest diversity.{{sfn|Sapir|1949|p=455}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Gordon Latham|Latham]], as cited in {{harvnb|Mallory|1989|p=152}}}} By this criterion, Northern India, home to only a single branch of the Indo-European language family (i.e., [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]), is an exceedingly unlikely candidate for the Indo-European homeland, compared to Central-Eastern Europe, for example, which is home to the [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Venetic language|Venetic]], [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] branches of Indo-European.{{sfn|Mallory|1989|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nBoth mainstream [[Urheimat]] solutions locate the Proto-Indo-European homeland in the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Mallory|1989|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\n====Dialectal variation====\nIt has been recognized since the mid-19th century, beginning with [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Schmidt]] and [[Hugo Schuchardt|Schuchardt]], that a binary [[tree model]] cannot capture all linguistic alignments; certain [[areal feature]]s cut across language groups and are better explained through a model treating linguistic change like [[Wave model|waves]] rippling out through a pond. This is true of the [[Indo-European languages]] as well. Various features originated and spread while [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was still a [[dialect continuum]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hock|1991|p=454}}</ref> These features sometimes cut across sub-families: for instance, the [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Ablative case|ablative]] plurals in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] feature endings beginning with -m-, rather than the usual -*bh-, e.g. [[Gothic language|Gothic]] dative plural ''[[wikt:\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf43#Gothic|sunum]]'' 'to the sons' and [[Old Church Slavonic]] instrumental plural ''[[wikt:\u0441\u044a\u0456\u043d\u044a#Old Church Slavonic|syn\u044a-mi]]'' 'with sons',<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fortson|2004|p=106}}</ref> despite the fact that the Germanic languages are [[Centum and satem languages|centum]], while Balto-Slavic languages are [[Centum and satem languages|satem]].\n\nThe strong correspondence between the [[dialect|dialectal relationships]] of the Indo-European languages and their actual geographical arrangement in their earliest attested forms makes an [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] origin, as suggested by the [[Indigenous Aryans|Out of India Theory]], unlikely.<ref name=hock1999>Hock (1996), \"Out of India? The linguistic evidence\", in {{Harvtxt|Bronkhorst|Deshpande|1999}}.</ref>\n\n====Substrate influence====\n{{Main|Substratum in the Vedic language}}\n\nAlready in 1870s the Neogrammarians realised that the Greek/Latin vocalism couldn't be explained on the basis of the Sanskrit one, and therefore must be more original.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Indo-Iranian and Uralic languages influenced each other, with the Finno-Ugric languages containing Indo-European loan words. A telling example is the Finnish word ''vasara'', \"hammer\", which is related to ''[[vajra]]'', the weapon of [[Indra]]. Since the Finno-Ugric homeland was located in the northern forest zone in northern Europe, the contacts must have taken place \u2013 in line with the placement of the proto-Indo-European homeland at the Pontic-Caspian steppes \u2013 between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.<ref group=web name=\"Kochhar2017\"/>\n\nDravidian and other South Asian languages share with Indo-Aryan a number of [[syntactical]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] features that are alien to other Indo-European languages, including even its closest relative, [[Iranian languages#Old Iranian|Old Iranian]]. [[Phonology|Phonologically]], there is the introduction of [[Retroflex consonant|retroflexes]], which alternate with [[Dental consonant|dentals]] in Indo-Aryan; morphologically there are the [[gerund]]s; and syntactically there is the use of a [[quotative]] [[Marker (linguistics)|marker]] (''iti'').{{refn|group=note|Krishnamurti states: \"Besides, the {{IAST|\u1e5ag}} [[Vedas]] has used the gerund, not found in [[Avestan]], with the same grammatical function as in [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], as a non-finite verb for 'incomplete' action. {{IAST|\u1e5ag}} Vedic language also attests the use of it as a quotation clause complementary.

The [[Gandhara grave culture]], which emerged c. 1600 BCE, and flourished from c. 1500 BCE to 500 BCE in Gandhara, modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, is thus the most likely locus of the earliest bearers of Rigvedic culture.\n\nBased on this Parpola postulates a first wave of immigration from as early as 1900 BCE, corresponding to the [[Cemetery H culture]], and an immigration to the Punjab ca. 1700\u20131400 BCE.{{sfn|Parpola|1998}}{{refn|group=note|However, this culture may also represent forerunners of the Indo-Iranians, similar to the [[Lullubi]] and Kassite invasion of Mesopotamia early in the second millennium BCE.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}}}\n\nAccording to Kochhar there were three waves of Indo-Aryan immigration that occurred after the mature Harappan phase:{{sfn|Kochhar|2000|pp=185\u2013186}}\n# the \"Murghamu\" ([[Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]]) related people who entered [[Balochistan]] at Pirak, Mehrgarh south cemetery, and other places, and later merged with the post-urban Harappans during the late Harappans Jhukar phase (2000\u20131800 BCE);\n# the Swat IV that co-founded the Harappan Cemetery H phase in Punjab (2000\u20131800 BCE);\n# and the Rigvedic Indo-Aryans of Swat V that later absorbed the Cemetery H people and gave rise to the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]] (PGW) (to 1400 BCE).\n\n=====Gandhara grave culture=====\n{{Main|Gandhara grave culture}}\nAbout 1800 BCE, there is a major cultural change in the [[Swat District|Swat Valley]] with the emergence of the [[Gandhara grave culture]].

They were followed by the [[Scythians]], whom would dominate the area, at their height, from the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, to the eastern-most fringes of [[Central Asia]] in the east. For most of their existence, they were based in what is modern-day Ukraine and southern European [[Russia]]. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, of whom the best known are the [[Roxolani]] (Rhoxolani), [[Iazyges]] (Jazyges) and the [[Alans]], followed the Scythians westwards into Europe in the late centuries BCE and the 1st and 2nd centuries of the Common Era (The [[Migration Period]]). The populous Sarmatian tribe of the [[Massagetae]], dwelling near the Caspian Sea, were known to the early rulers of Persia in the Achaemenid Period. In the east, the Saka occupied several areas in Xinjiang, from Khotan to Tumshuq.\n\nThe [[Medes]], [[Parthia]]ns and [[Persian people|Persians]] begin to appear on the western [[Iranian Plateau]] from c. 800 BCE, after which they remained under [[Assyria]]n rule for several centuries, as it was with the rest of the peoples in the [[Near East]]. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] replaced Median rule from 559 BCE. Around the first millennium of the [[Common Era]] (AD), the [[Kambojas]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] began to settle on the eastern edge of the Iranian Plateau, on the mountainous frontier of northwestern and western [[Pakistan]], displacing the earlier [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] from the area.\n\nIn Central Asia, the [[Turkic languages]] have marginalized [[Iranian languages]] as a result of the [[Turkic migration]] of the early centuries CE. In Eastern Europe, [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples]] assimilated and absorbed the native Iranian languages (Scythian and Sarmatian) of the region.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

It is bordered on the north by [[Sar\u0131yer]] and [[\u015ei\u015fli]], on the west by [[Ka\u011f\u0131thane]] and \u015ei\u015fli, on the south by [[Beyo\u011flu]], and on the east by the Bosphorus. Directly across the Bosphorus is the district of [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar]].\n\nThe district includes a number of important sites along the European shore of the Bosphorus, from [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in the south to the [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] area in the north. It is also home to many inland (and relatively expensive, upper-middle class) neighborhoods such as [[Levent]] and [[Etiler]]. Some of its other well-known neighborhoods include [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z]], Kuru\u00e7e\u015fme, [[Ortak\u00f6y]], and [[Arnavutk\u00f6y]].\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f' historic commercial centre is the '''{{Interlanguage link|Be\u015fikta\u015f, Be\u015fikta\u015f|tr||lt=Be\u015fikta\u015f|WD=}}''' quarter and [[\u00c7ar\u015f\u0131]] (literally, \"marketplace\"),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.besiktas.bel.tr/Sayfa/1217/besiktas-ilcesi|title=Be\u015fikta\u015f \u0130l\u00e7esi - Be\u015fikta\u015f Belediyesi|website=www.besiktas.bel.tr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022231843/http://www.besiktas.bel.tr/Sayfa/1217/besiktas-ilcesi|archive-date=2018-10-22|url-status=|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref> which adjoins the small Abbasa\u011fa Park.

[[B\u00fcy\u00fckdere Avenue]] also runs through the district.\n\nAlthough it is a relatively small district of Istanbul, both in terms of population and area, Be\u015fikta\u015f is one of the city's most important areas due to its business and shopping areas, historic sites, universities, scenic views of the Bosphorus strait, and feeder roads for the [[Bosphorus Bridge|Bosphorus]] and [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge|Fatih Sultan Mehmet]] bridges passing through it.

The church was built to honor a [[relic]], a stone reportedly taken from the [[stable]] in [[Bethlehem]] where [[Jesus]] was born.

The area is believed to have been settled by [[Constantine the Great]] during his reign (306-337 [[Common Era|CE]]).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.besiktas.bel.tr/section/about/|title=About Be\u015fikta\u015f: Heart of Istanbul|website=en.besiktas.bel.tr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429002541/http://en.besiktas.bel.tr/section/about/|archive-date=2018-04-29|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> This stretch of the Bosphorus shore is somewhat sheltered from the strong northeasterly winds that bring storms to Istanbul, and thus it forms an ideal mooring place for ships.\n\nIn Byzantine times, the area was called ''Diplokionion'', meaning \"double pillar\" in [[Greek language|Greek]], as it was the location of a set of twin pillars marking a key entry from the water into Constantinople. These columns would later provide the model for the twin pillars at the water's edge in [[Venice]].<ref>Fabio Barry, 'Disiecta Membra' in  Henry Maguire and Robert S. Nelson (eds.)'' San Marco, Byzantium, and the Myths of Venice'' (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 2010) p.11</ref>\n\nIn ancient times the villages on the Bosphorus shore were isolated communities in the forest that lined the water-side. The Bosphorus, however, was prominent in the history and mythology of the ancient Greeks, and villages like Be\u015fikta\u015f would have had their place in traditional tales such as ''[[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]''. In the [[Byzantine]], era churches and a monastery were built and the tradition of having a summer palace on the Bosphorus was begun by the Byzantines with their Ayios Mamas palace complex. \nThe Bosphorus settlements however, being outside the city walls, were vulnerable to raiders from the [[Black Sea]] coasts and little of this architecture or the statuary that would have decorated it so gloriously has survived.\n\nIn the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, once the emperors had established control of the Black Sea coasts, the Ottoman navy was docked in the Bosphorus and the Bosphorus villages became safe and attractive again. One man in particular, the legendary sailor [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin]], built his palace and mosque in Be\u015fikta\u015f, making it his home. By now Be\u015fikta\u015f was an established Bosphorus crossing for caravans trading across [[Anatolia]] and along the [[Silk Road]], and for the great Ottoman armies.\n\nAccording to Ottoman estimations of 1882, the district of Be\u015fikta\u015f had a total population of 28.777, consisting of 10.753 Muslims, 9.248 [[Ottoman Greeks|Greeks]], 4.897 [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]], 3.057 [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Jews]], 601 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], 203 [[Bulgarians]] and 18 [[Latins]].<ref>[[Kemal Karpat]] (1985), [https://kupdf.net/downloadFile/59e4a7b908bbc56144e653d7 Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics], [[The University of Wisconsin Press]], p. 204-205</ref>\n\nThis coast was very attractive to the Ottoman rulers, who built hunting lodges and then great palaces in the area, and the Be\u015fikta\u015f district today contains some of the most important and attractive Ottoman buildings. The area was thus the scene of great intrigues of the late Ottoman period such as the [[dethronement]] of [[Sultan]] [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] at [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in a coup in 1876, the announcement of the founding of the Ottoman parliament in 1908, and the deposing of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] at [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace]] in 1909.\n\nFollowing the foundation of the [[Turkish Republic]] in 1923, the Ottoman ruling family was deported and the palaces and mansions along the coast were emptied out. Some were given to new government ministries, some used as schools and other public buildings, others were demolished.\n\nToday, it is widely accepted by the residents of the area that the most significant resident of Be\u015fikta\u015f was [[Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m]], the mother of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who lived in the old quarter at the heart of Be\u015fikta\u015f, literally right next to the then headquarters of [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bjk.com.tr/en/haberler.php?h_no=1480 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205165651/http://www.bjk.com.tr/en/haberler.php?h_no=1480 |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBesides the more historic areas such as [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z]], [[Ortak\u00f6y]], [[Kuru\u00e7e\u015fme]], [[Arnavutk\u00f6y]], [[Bebek, Be\u015fikta\u015f|Bebek]], many residential areas in the district started to form around the 1950s.

It is bordered on the north by [[Sar\u0131yer]] and [[\u015ei\u015fli]], on the west by [[Ka\u011f\u0131thane]] and \u015ei\u015fli, on the south by [[Beyo\u011flu]], and on the east by the Bosphorus. Directly across the Bosphorus is the district of [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar]].\n\nThe district includes a number of important sites along the European shore of the Bosphorus, from [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in the south to the [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] area in the north. It is also home to many inland (and relatively expensive, upper-middle class) neighborhoods such as [[Levent]] and [[Etiler]]. Some of its other well-known neighborhoods include [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z]], Kuru\u00e7e\u015fme, [[Ortak\u00f6y]], and [[Arnavutk\u00f6y]].\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f' historic commercial centre is the '''{{Interlanguage link|Be\u015fikta\u015f, Be\u015fikta\u015f|tr||lt=Be\u015fikta\u015f|WD=}}''' quarter and [[\u00c7ar\u015f\u0131]] (literally, \"marketplace\"),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.besiktas.bel.tr/Sayfa/1217/besiktas-ilcesi|title=Be\u015fikta\u015f \u0130l\u00e7esi - Be\u015fikta\u015f Belediyesi|website=www.besiktas.bel.tr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022231843/http://www.besiktas.bel.tr/Sayfa/1217/besiktas-ilcesi|archive-date=2018-10-22|url-status=|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref> which adjoins the small Abbasa\u011fa Park.

[[B\u00fcy\u00fckdere Avenue]] also runs through the district.\n\nAlthough it is a relatively small district of Istanbul, both in terms of population and area, Be\u015fikta\u015f is one of the city's most important areas due to its business and shopping areas, historic sites, universities, scenic views of the Bosphorus strait, and feeder roads for the [[Bosphorus Bridge|Bosphorus]] and [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge|Fatih Sultan Mehmet]] bridges passing through it.

The church was built to honor a [[relic]], a stone reportedly taken from the [[stable]] in [[Bethlehem]] where [[Jesus]] was born.

The area is believed to have been settled by [[Constantine the Great]] during his reign (306-337 [[Common Era|CE]]).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.besiktas.bel.tr/section/about/|title=About Be\u015fikta\u015f: Heart of Istanbul|website=en.besiktas.bel.tr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429002541/http://en.besiktas.bel.tr/section/about/|archive-date=2018-04-29|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> This stretch of the Bosphorus shore is somewhat sheltered from the strong northeasterly winds that bring storms to Istanbul, and thus it forms an ideal mooring place for ships.\n\nIn Byzantine times, the area was called ''Diplokionion'', meaning \"double pillar\" in [[Greek language|Greek]], as it was the location of a set of twin pillars marking a key entry from the water into Constantinople. These columns would later provide the model for the twin pillars at the water's edge in [[Venice]].<ref>Fabio Barry, 'Disiecta Membra' in  Henry Maguire and Robert S. Nelson (eds.)'' San Marco, Byzantium, and the Myths of Venice'' (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 2010) p.11</ref>\n\nIn ancient times the villages on the Bosphorus shore were isolated communities in the forest that lined the water-side. The Bosphorus, however, was prominent in the history and mythology of the ancient Greeks, and villages like Be\u015fikta\u015f would have had their place in traditional tales such as ''[[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]''. In the [[Byzantine]], era churches and a monastery were built and the tradition of having a summer palace on the Bosphorus was begun by the Byzantines with their Ayios Mamas palace complex. \nThe Bosphorus settlements however, being outside the city walls, were vulnerable to raiders from the [[Black Sea]] coasts and little of this architecture or the statuary that would have decorated it so gloriously has survived.\n\nIn the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, once the emperors had established control of the Black Sea coasts, the Ottoman navy was docked in the Bosphorus and the Bosphorus villages became safe and attractive again. One man in particular, the legendary sailor [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin]], built his palace and mosque in Be\u015fikta\u015f, making it his home. By now Be\u015fikta\u015f was an established Bosphorus crossing for caravans trading across [[Anatolia]] and along the [[Silk Road]], and for the great Ottoman armies.\n\nAccording to Ottoman estimations of 1882, the district of Be\u015fikta\u015f had a total population of 28.777, consisting of 10.753 Muslims, 9.248 [[Ottoman Greeks|Greeks]], 4.897 [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]], 3.057 [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Jews]], 601 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], 203 [[Bulgarians]] and 18 [[Latins]].<ref>[[Kemal Karpat]] (1985), [https://kupdf.net/downloadFile/59e4a7b908bbc56144e653d7 Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics], [[The University of Wisconsin Press]], p. 204-205</ref>\n\nThis coast was very attractive to the Ottoman rulers, who built hunting lodges and then great palaces in the area, and the Be\u015fikta\u015f district today contains some of the most important and attractive Ottoman buildings. The area was thus the scene of great intrigues of the late Ottoman period such as the [[dethronement]] of [[Sultan]] [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] at [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in a coup in 1876, the announcement of the founding of the Ottoman parliament in 1908, and the deposing of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] at [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace]] in 1909.\n\nFollowing the foundation of the [[Turkish Republic]] in 1923, the Ottoman ruling family was deported and the palaces and mansions along the coast were emptied out. Some were given to new government ministries, some used as schools and other public buildings, others were demolished.\n\nToday, it is widely accepted by the residents of the area that the most significant resident of Be\u015fikta\u015f was [[Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m]], the mother of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who lived in the old quarter at the heart of Be\u015fikta\u015f, literally right next to the then headquarters of [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bjk.com.tr/en/haberler.php?h_no=1480 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205165651/http://www.bjk.com.tr/en/haberler.php?h_no=1480 |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBesides the more historic areas such as [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z]], [[Ortak\u00f6y]], [[Kuru\u00e7e\u015fme]], [[Arnavutk\u00f6y]], [[Bebek, Be\u015fikta\u015f|Bebek]], many residential areas in the district started to form around the 1950s.

The company has been a subsidiary of [[A.S. Watson Group]] since October 2002, itself part of the [[Hong Kong]] conglomerate [[CK Hutchison Holdings]].\n\nIt trades from nearly 900 shops across the United Kingdom and Ireland and also serves Sweden, Finland and Norway online. Superdrug employs over 14,000 people, ranging from minimum-wage jobs to some of the highest-paid within the industry. {{As of|2016||df=|since=}}, Superdrug was the United Kingdom's fastest growing health and beauty retailer, more than doubling its profit in 2015.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nBesides health and beauty products, the company also has pharmacies with consultation rooms in over 220 shops, and a further 19 contain nurse clinics, making it the fourth largest [[pharmacy|chemist]] chain in the United Kingdom. It maintains links with sister companies also owned by A.S. Watson Group: [[Savers Health & Beauty|Savers]] and [[The Perfume Shop]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and expansion===\n[[File:Superdrug, Horsefair Centre, Wetherby (1st February 2012).JPG|thumb|Superdrug in the Horsefair Centre, [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]\n[[File:Superdrug, Kings Mall, Hammersmith.jpg|thumbnail|Superdrug, Kings Mall, [[Hammersmith]], London (2016)]]\nIn 1964, Superdrug was incorporated under the name of Leading Supermarkets Limited by the Goldstein brothers in London, both of whom had experience working in the groceries retail industry. Later that year the business adopted the present name. The first Superdrug shop opened in [[Putney]], London on 26 April 1966.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nBy 1968, there were three shops trading in Putney, [[Croydon]] and Streatham. In the same year Superdrug acquired its first [[Distribution center|distribution centre]], in Wimbledon. The chain grew rapidly, and expanded to a chain of forty shops by the beginning of the 1970s. In 1971, The Rite Aid Corporation, an American chemist chain, acquired 49% of the business.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nBy 1981, there were three hundred Superdrug shops in the United Kingdom, and they opened their 11,148 m\u00b2 (120,000&nbsp;ft\u00b2) distribution centre and office complex at Beddington Lane in Croydon. This centre closed in July 2007, and the southern distribution operation moved to [[Dunstable]], although the head office remains in Croydon. The northern distribution operates from [[Pontefract]], West Yorkshire.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1983, the business was floated on London's [[Unlisted Securities Market]].<ref name= super>{{cite web|title = Superdrug History| url = http://www.superdrug.com/page/superdrughistory |accessdate = 1 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1987, Superdrug was sold to Woolworth Holdings (now known as [[Kingfisher plc]]) for \u00a357 million.<ref name =super/> The sale allowed accelerated growth of the brand through utilisation of Kingfisher's surplus high street property portfolio and substantial financial assets.\n\nIn January 1988, Superdrug acquired Tip-Top, a discount chemist chain which had a large presence in the north of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], and Share Drug Stores plc, a southern-based chain. These acquisitions and an aggressive expansion programme saw the chain grow to six hundred outlets throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nSuperdrug continued to grow over the next eight years, increasing profitability and market share. In 1995, the company began a rebranding programme, which saw it leave behind its discount heritage and move upmarket, with a new corporate identity \u2013 under the banner \"the real beauty is the price\" \u2013 and new larger shops in prime retail locations.\n\nThis led to a marked increase in prices in order to fund a higher cost base, and left the chain vulnerable to attack from new discount chains such as Savers and [[Wilkinson (retailer)|Wilkinson]], who were rapidly expanding at the time, and the supermarkets such as [[Tesco]] and [[Asda]], who were growing their presence in the high-margin non-food sector.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Acquisition===\nFacing increasing pressure from supermarkets and new discount chains, in July 2001, Superdrug was sold to [[Kruidvat]], a chemist operator from continental Europe, to allow Kingfisher to focus on its DIY and electrical chains. Kruidvat was subsequently sold to [[Watson's|AS Watson]], the retail and manufacturing business of the [[Hong Kong]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[CK Hutchison Holdings]], formally [[Hutchison Whampoa]], in November 2002.\n\nAS Watson is also the parent company of Savers, the United Kingdom's number three chemist chain. Subsequently, several of Superdrug's smaller shops were converted into Savers, and approximately three hundred Savers shops were converted into branches of Superdrug.\n\nIn April 2006, Superdrug entered the [[Republic of Ireland]], and began rolling out its \"next generation\" shops, the first of which opened in [[Uxbridge]]. These focused on cosmetics and fragrance above all else and used plasma screens throughout the shop. Superdrug announced their intention to create 150 more next generation shops in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://business.highbeam.com/4143/article-1G1-167030506/superdrug-rolls-out-next-generation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301191654/http://business.highbeam.com/4143/article-1G1-167030506/superdrug-rolls-out-next-generation |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-03-01 |title=Superdrug rolls out the next generation |author= |date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Recent years===\nIn February 2010, Superdrug became a [[BUAV]] approved retailer,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buav.org/a/2010/02/19/282 |title=Superdrug becomes BUAV approved |author=|date=19 February 2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref> joining several other high street chains in pledging its own brand products will be free from animal testing.

The company has been a subsidiary of [[A.S. Watson Group]] since October 2002, itself part of the [[Hong Kong]] conglomerate [[CK Hutchison Holdings]].\n\nIt trades from nearly 900 shops across the United Kingdom and Ireland and also serves Sweden, Finland and Norway online. Superdrug employs over 14,000 people, ranging from minimum-wage jobs to some of the highest-paid within the industry. {{As of|2016||df=|since=}}, Superdrug was the United Kingdom's fastest growing health and beauty retailer, more than doubling its profit in 2015.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nBesides health and beauty products, the company also has pharmacies with consultation rooms in over 220 shops, and a further 19 contain nurse clinics, making it the fourth largest [[pharmacy|chemist]] chain in the United Kingdom. It maintains links with sister companies also owned by A.S. Watson Group: [[Savers Health & Beauty|Savers]] and [[The Perfume Shop]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and expansion===\n[[File:Superdrug, Horsefair Centre, Wetherby (1st February 2012).JPG|thumb|Superdrug in the Horsefair Centre, [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]\n[[File:Superdrug, Kings Mall, Hammersmith.jpg|thumbnail|Superdrug, Kings Mall, [[Hammersmith]], London (2016)]]\nIn 1964, Superdrug was incorporated under the name of Leading Supermarkets Limited by the Goldstein brothers in London, both of whom had experience working in the groceries retail industry. Later that year the business adopted the present name. The first Superdrug shop opened in [[Putney]], London on 26 April 1966.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nBy 1968, there were three shops trading in Putney, [[Croydon]] and Streatham. In the same year Superdrug acquired its first [[Distribution center|distribution centre]], in Wimbledon. The chain grew rapidly, and expanded to a chain of forty shops by the beginning of the 1970s. In 1971, The Rite Aid Corporation, an American chemist chain, acquired 49% of the business.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nBy 1981, there were three hundred Superdrug shops in the United Kingdom, and they opened their 11,148 m\u00b2 (120,000&nbsp;ft\u00b2) distribution centre and office complex at Beddington Lane in Croydon. This centre closed in July 2007, and the southern distribution operation moved to [[Dunstable]], although the head office remains in Croydon. The northern distribution operates from [[Pontefract]], West Yorkshire.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1983, the business was floated on London's [[Unlisted Securities Market]].<ref name= super>{{cite web|title = Superdrug History| url = http://www.superdrug.com/page/superdrughistory |accessdate = 1 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1987, Superdrug was sold to Woolworth Holdings (now known as [[Kingfisher plc]]) for \u00a357 million.<ref name =super/> The sale allowed accelerated growth of the brand through utilisation of Kingfisher's surplus high street property portfolio and substantial financial assets.\n\nIn January 1988, Superdrug acquired Tip-Top, a discount chemist chain which had a large presence in the north of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], and Share Drug Stores plc, a southern-based chain. These acquisitions and an aggressive expansion programme saw the chain grow to six hundred outlets throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nSuperdrug continued to grow over the next eight years, increasing profitability and market share. In 1995, the company began a rebranding programme, which saw it leave behind its discount heritage and move upmarket, with a new corporate identity \u2013 under the banner \"the real beauty is the price\" \u2013 and new larger shops in prime retail locations.\n\nThis led to a marked increase in prices in order to fund a higher cost base, and left the chain vulnerable to attack from new discount chains such as Savers and [[Wilkinson (retailer)|Wilkinson]], who were rapidly expanding at the time, and the supermarkets such as [[Tesco]] and [[Asda]], who were growing their presence in the high-margin non-food sector.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Acquisition===\nFacing increasing pressure from supermarkets and new discount chains, in July 2001, Superdrug was sold to [[Kruidvat]], a chemist operator from continental Europe, to allow Kingfisher to focus on its DIY and electrical chains. Kruidvat was subsequently sold to [[Watson's|AS Watson]], the retail and manufacturing business of the [[Hong Kong]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[CK Hutchison Holdings]], formally [[Hutchison Whampoa]], in November 2002.\n\nAS Watson is also the parent company of Savers, the United Kingdom's number three chemist chain. Subsequently, several of Superdrug's smaller shops were converted into Savers, and approximately three hundred Savers shops were converted into branches of Superdrug.\n\nIn April 2006, Superdrug entered the [[Republic of Ireland]], and began rolling out its \"next generation\" shops, the first of which opened in [[Uxbridge]]. These focused on cosmetics and fragrance above all else and used plasma screens throughout the shop. Superdrug announced their intention to create 150 more next generation shops in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://business.highbeam.com/4143/article-1G1-167030506/superdrug-rolls-out-next-generation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301191654/http://business.highbeam.com/4143/article-1G1-167030506/superdrug-rolls-out-next-generation |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-03-01 |title=Superdrug rolls out the next generation |author= |date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Recent years===\nIn February 2010, Superdrug became a [[BUAV]] approved retailer,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buav.org/a/2010/02/19/282 |title=Superdrug becomes BUAV approved |author=|date=19 February 2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref> joining several other high street chains in pledging its own brand products will be free from animal testing.

In 1871, after Saud had taken the capital [[Riyadh]]. Abdul Rahman was sent to [[Baghdad]] to negotiate with the [[Ottoman Empire]] for help. Unsuccessful after two years, he tried to take [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] in the east where Abdullah was now based, but without success, and eventually returned to Riyadh. After Saud's death in 1875, Abdul Rahman was recognized as successor, but within a year Riyadh was taken by Abdullah. He was forced to abdicate.\n\nIn 1887 the sons of Saud bin Faisal, who kept up desultory hostilities against their uncles, managed to capture Abdullah. The [[Emirate of Ha'il|Rashidi amirs of Ha'il]] were able to secure Abdullah's release in exchange for Abdul-Rahman. Abdullah was taken to Ha'il and a Rashidi emir appointed to him to govern Riyadh. Abdul Rahman was able to rise in revolt in 1887 and take and defend Riyadh, but his attempts to expand control ended in disaster.
