The novels had been serialized in ''[[Dragon Magazine (Fujimi Shobo)|Dragon Magazine]]'', and were later adapted into several [[manga]] titles, [[anime]] television series, anime films, [[original video animation|OVA]] series, role-playing video games, and other media. ''Slayers'' follows the adventures of teenage sorceress [[Lina Inverse]] and her companions as they journey through their world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.ca/The-Slayers-DVD-Collection/dp/1578004861 |title=The Slayers DVD Collection |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=Amazon.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explodedgoat.com/animereview.php?num=9 |title=Anime Review |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=Exploded goat}}</ref> Using powerful magic and swordsmanship they battle overreaching wizards, demons seeking to destroy the world, and an occasional hapless gang of bandits. The anime series is considered to be one of the most popular of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Anime encyclopedia\" />\n\n==Setting and characters==\n{{See also|List of Slayers characters}}\nIn the ''Slayers'' universe, the ultimate being is the Lord of Nightmares, the creator of at least four parallel worlds. An artifact known as the Claire Bible contains information about the Lord of Nightmares' task to regain its \"true form\",<ref>Episode 21 of Slayers NEXT</ref> which is only attainable by destroying these worlds and returning them to the chaos (sea of darkness) that it itself is. For unexplained reasons, though, the Lord of Nightmares has not acted upon this desire by itself so far. On each of these worlds are gods (''shinzoku'', lit. \"godly race\") and monsters (''[[mazoku]]'', lit. \"demon race\"), fighting without end. Should the gods win the war in a world, that world will be at peace. Should the monsters win, the world will be destroyed and returned to the Sea of Chaos.\n\nIn the world where the ''Slayers'' takes place, Flare Dragon Ceiphied and the Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo are, respectively, the supreme god and monster. Long ago, their war ended more or less in a stalemate, when Ceiphied was able to split Shabranigdo's existence into seven pieces in order to prevent him from coming back to life, then seal them within human souls. As the souls are reincarnated, the individual fragments would wear down until Shabranigdo himself would be destroyed. However, Ceiphied was so exhausted by this that he himself sank into the Sea of Chaos, leaving behind four parts of himself in the world. A millennium before the events in ''Slayers'', one of Ruby-Eye's fragments (which was sealed in the body of Lei Magnus, a very powerful sorcerer) revived and began the {{nihongo|Resurrection War|\u964d\u9b54\u6226\u4e89|K\u014dma-sens\u014d|alternately \"War of Demon Conquering\"}} against one of the parts of Ceiphied, the Water Dragon King, also known as Aqualord Ragradia. Ultimately, the piece of Shabranigdo won, but Aqualord, using the last remnants of her power, sealed him into a block of magical ice within the Kataart Mountains. Nevertheless, Shabranigdo's lieutenants remained at liberty, sealing a part of the world within a magical barrier, through which only mazoku could pass.<ref>Slayers novel 7, [[Tokyopop]] translation, pg. 137-138</ref>\n\nThere are four types of magic within the ''Slayers'' universe: Black, White, Shamanistic, and Holy. Black magic spells, such as the famous Dragon Slave, call directly on the powers of the mazoku and are capable of causing enormous damage. White magic spells are of an obscure origin and are used for healing or protection. Shamanistic magic is focused on manipulation and alteration of the basic elements of the natural world (earth, wind, fire, water and spirit) and contains spells for both offense and convenience, such as Raywing, Fireball, or Elmekia Lance. Holy magic uses the power of the shinzoku, but the aforementioned barrier made its usage impossible for anyone inside before the death of the mazoku Hellmaster Phibrizzo. As a rule, mazoku can only be harmed by spiritual (astral) shamanistic magic, holy magic, or black magic which draws power from another mazoku with greater might than the target.\n\nAbove all other magic, however, are the immensely destructive spells drawing power from the Lord of Nightmares. The two spells of this class are the Ragna Blade, capable of cutting through any obstacle or being, and the Giga Slave, which can kill any opponent, but which could also destroy the world itself if the spell is miscast. Some have claimed that these terrible spells, drawing their power directly from the Lord of Nightmares, constitute a fifth form of magic: Chaos magic.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Light novels===\n''Slayers'' was originally serialized in ''[[Dragon Magazine (Fujimi Shobo)|Dragon Magazine]]'' in 1989 as a short story series written by [[Hajime Kanzaka]], and with artwork by Rui Araizumi.<ref name=\"Anime encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=The Anime Encyclopedia, Revised and Expanded Edition |last1=Clements |first1=Jonathan |last2=McCarthy |first2=Helen |page=591 |isbn=1-933330-10-4}}</ref> The serialized chapters were then published as ''Slayers'' light novels across 15 volumes from January 25, 1990 to May 15, 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4829123451/ |title=\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30ba!

The novels had been serialized in ''[[Dragon Magazine (Fujimi Shobo)|Dragon Magazine]]'', and were later adapted into several [[manga]] titles, [[anime]] television series, anime films, [[original video animation|OVA]] series, role-playing video games, and other media. ''Slayers'' follows the adventures of teenage sorceress [[Lina Inverse]] and her companions as they journey through their world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.ca/The-Slayers-DVD-Collection/dp/1578004861 |title=The Slayers DVD Collection |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=Amazon.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explodedgoat.com/animereview.php?num=9 |title=Anime Review |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=Exploded goat}}</ref> Using powerful magic and swordsmanship they battle overreaching wizards, demons seeking to destroy the world, and an occasional hapless gang of bandits. The anime series is considered to be one of the most popular of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Anime encyclopedia\" />\n\n==Setting and characters==\n{{See also|List of Slayers characters}}\nIn the ''Slayers'' universe, the ultimate being is the Lord of Nightmares, the creator of at least four parallel worlds. An artifact known as the Claire Bible contains information about the Lord of Nightmares' task to regain its \"true form\",<ref>Episode 21 of Slayers NEXT</ref> which is only attainable by destroying these worlds and returning them to the chaos (sea of darkness) that it itself is. For unexplained reasons, though, the Lord of Nightmares has not acted upon this desire by itself so far. On each of these worlds are gods (''shinzoku'', lit. \"godly race\") and monsters (''[[mazoku]]'', lit. \"demon race\"), fighting without end. Should the gods win the war in a world, that world will be at peace. Should the monsters win, the world will be destroyed and returned to the Sea of Chaos.\n\nIn the world where the ''Slayers'' takes place, Flare Dragon Ceiphied and the Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo are, respectively, the supreme god and monster. Long ago, their war ended more or less in a stalemate, when Ceiphied was able to split Shabranigdo's existence into seven pieces in order to prevent him from coming back to life, then seal them within human souls. As the souls are reincarnated, the individual fragments would wear down until Shabranigdo himself would be destroyed. However, Ceiphied was so exhausted by this that he himself sank into the Sea of Chaos, leaving behind four parts of himself in the world. A millennium before the events in ''Slayers'', one of Ruby-Eye's fragments (which was sealed in the body of Lei Magnus, a very powerful sorcerer) revived and began the {{nihongo|Resurrection War|\u964d\u9b54\u6226\u4e89|K\u014dma-sens\u014d|alternately \"War of Demon Conquering\"}} against one of the parts of Ceiphied, the Water Dragon King, also known as Aqualord Ragradia. Ultimately, the piece of Shabranigdo won, but Aqualord, using the last remnants of her power, sealed him into a block of magical ice within the Kataart Mountains. Nevertheless, Shabranigdo's lieutenants remained at liberty, sealing a part of the world within a magical barrier, through which only mazoku could pass.<ref>Slayers novel 7, [[Tokyopop]] translation, pg. 137-138</ref>\n\nThere are four types of magic within the ''Slayers'' universe: Black, White, Shamanistic, and Holy. Black magic spells, such as the famous Dragon Slave, call directly on the powers of the mazoku and are capable of causing enormous damage. White magic spells are of an obscure origin and are used for healing or protection. Shamanistic magic is focused on manipulation and alteration of the basic elements of the natural world (earth, wind, fire, water and spirit) and contains spells for both offense and convenience, such as Raywing, Fireball, or Elmekia Lance. Holy magic uses the power of the shinzoku, but the aforementioned barrier made its usage impossible for anyone inside before the death of the mazoku Hellmaster Phibrizzo. As a rule, mazoku can only be harmed by spiritual (astral) shamanistic magic, holy magic, or black magic which draws power from another mazoku with greater might than the target.\n\nAbove all other magic, however, are the immensely destructive spells drawing power from the Lord of Nightmares.

Yuki's classmates work hard to keep Yuki safe while she seeks out fun school activities every day. It is learned that Yuki is a delusional school girl, believing that everything is normal and her classmates and teachers are alive and well at first.\n\nLater, Megumi Sakura learns from her mother and Yuri about the outbreak, realizing the change in the city's situation. Yuki later holds a school trip to the shopping mall which was hit by zombie attack like the rest of the city. After the tour, Miki quickly comes to learn about her delusions, including the fact that the existence of Megumi is also one of them. She also learns from Yuri and Kurumi how Megumi, who founded the School Living Club with Yuri, sacrificed herself in order to protect her students from the zombies, the resulting shock of which left Yuki with the delusion that Megumi and the other students are still alive. Miki later learns a little about how Yuki's way of thinking helps Kurumi and others and in order to understand more, she decides to become a trial member of the School Living Club. \n\nOne day, Yuki and friends find a hidden safe containing an emergency manual, which reveals the school was involved with a biological weapon and was constructed as a safe house in the event of an outbreak.\n\n==Characters==\n===School Living Club===\nThe main characters of the series who are a small club of girls who prioritize being able to live while inside the school.\n;{{nihongo|Yuki Takeya|\u4e08\u69cd \u7531\u7d00|Takeya Yuki}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gakkougurashi.com/chara/yuki.html |title=Character - Yuki |website=Gakkou Gurashi! |language=Japanese |accessdate=July 5, 2015 }}</ref>\n:{{animevoices|[[Inori Minase]]<ref name=\"debut\" />|[[Brittney Karbowski]]<ref name=\"English Cast\">{{cite web|title=School Live English Dub Cast List|url=http://www.sentaifilmworks.com/news/school-live-english-dub-cast-list|website=Sentai Filmworks|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Live action portrayal: Midori Nagatsuki<ref name=\"liveactioncast\">{{cite web|title=Live-Action School-Live!

It was initially intended to be a \"useful, instructive, and factual weekly newspaper of Opera in New York\".{{Cite quote|date=July 2018}} Its first issue was published on 7 December 1936 and consisted of only one folded broadsheet. Its second year of publication saw its transformation into a 17-page magazine with advertising, with its first magazine issue appearing on 15 November 1937. Beginning with the December 1940 issue, the magazine began to concentrate much of its content on the weekly [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]]. The magazine at this point offered bi-weekly issues of an expanded size during the Fall, Winter, and Spring, but was on hiatus during the summers. As time went on, the magazine began to take on a more international scope of coverage; but it still maintained a strong interest in the New York opera scene and the Met in particular.\n\nIn the Fall of 1957 Frank Merkling succeeded Peltz as the second chief editor of ''Opera News'', with his first issue appearing on 14 October 1957. In 1972 the magazine became a year-round publication, adding monthly issues in the summer months while maintaining its bi-weekly schedule during the opera season. In 1974 Robert Jacobson became the magazine's third chief editor. Jacobson was succeeded by Patrick O'Connor (1988), who was succeeded in 1989 by Patrick J. Smith. In 1998, Smith was succeeded by Rudolph S. Rauch. Under the leadership of Rauch and executive editor [[Brian Kellow]], the magazine switched to a monthly publication format in September 1998. F. Paul Driscoll, the current editor in chief, was appointed in July 2003.\n\nBeginning with the June 2012 issue, the Metropolitan Opera said that ''Opera News'' would cease reviewing Met performances, following dissatisfaction among the Met leadership with the magazine's recent critiques of [[Robert Lepage]]'s production of the [[Ring Cycle]] and of the company's direction under [[Peter Gelb]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Daniel J. |last=Wakin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/arts/music/opera-news-will-stop-reviewing-metropolitan-opera.html |date=May 21, 2012 |title=Latest Met Aria: Bad Opera News Is No News |work=The New York Times}}</ref> However, reactions from the public led to the decision being reversed.<ref>{{Cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-met-opera-news-review-20120522,0,2040627.story |first=Chris |last=Barton |date=May 22, 2012 |title=The Met reverses policy, will allow ''Opera News'' to review productions}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |work= [[National Public Radio]]|url= http://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/online-debate-operatic-intensity-met-and-its-critics|first= |last=Boise State Public Radio |date=May 24, 2012 |title=An Online Debate Of Operatic Intensity: The Met And Its Critics}}</ref>\n\n==''Opera News'' Awards==\nSince 2005 the magazine has annually bestowed five ''Opera News'' Awards for Distinguished Achievement.\n\nPast recipients of the awards have included:\n*1st \u2013 2005: [[James Conlon]], [[R\u00e9gine Crespin]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], [[Susan Graham]], [[Dolora Zajick]]\n*2nd \u2013 2006: [[Ben Heppner]], [[James Levine]], [[Ren\u00e9 Pape]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Deborah Voigt]]\n*3rd \u2013 2007: [[Stephanie Blythe]], [[Olga Borodina]], [[Thomas Hampson]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Julius Rudel]]\n*4th \u2013 2008: [[John Adams (composer)]], [[Natalie Dessay]], [[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]], [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Sherrill Milnes]]\n*5th \u2013 2009: [[Martina Arroyo]], [[Joyce DiDonato]], [[Shirley Verrett]], [[Gerald Finley]], [[Philip Glass]]\n*6th \u2013 2010: [[Jonas Kaufmann]], [[Riccardo Muti]], [[Patricia Racette]], [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[Bryn Terfel]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Sixth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Jonas Kaufmann, Riccardo Muti, Patricia Racette, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa & Bryn Terfel|url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=16734|work=Opera News|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=August 4, 2010}}</ref>\n*7th \u2013 2011: [[Karita Mattila]], [[Anja Silja]], [[Dmitri Hvorostovsky]], [[Peter Mattei]], [[Peter Sellars]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Karita Mattila, Anja Silja, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Peter Mattei and Peter Sellars|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2011/8/News/2011_Opera_News_Awards_Honorees_Announced.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=August 11, 2011}}</ref>\n*8th \u2013 2012: [[David Daniels (countertenor)|David Daniels]], [[Simon Keenlyside]], [[Eric Owens (bass-baritone)|Eric Owens]], [[Mirella Freni]], [[Dawn Upshaw]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 ''Opera News'' Awards Honorees Announced|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2012/8/News/2012_Opera_News_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=August 7, 2012}}</ref>\n*9th \u2013 2013: [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]], [[Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez]], [[Christa Ludwig]], [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]], [[Nina Stemme]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrice Ch\u00e9reau, Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, Christa Ludwig, James Morris and Nina Stemme to be Honored at the Ninth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2013/9/News/ON_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref>\n*10th \u2013 2014: [[Piotr Becza\u0142a]], [[Ferruccio Furlanetto]], [[Sondra Radvanovsky]], [[Samuel Ramey]], [[Teresa Stratas]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tenth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Piotr Beczala, Ferruccio Furlanetto, Sondra Radvanovsky, Samuel Ramey and Teresa Stratas|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2014/12/News/2015_Opera_News_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref>\n*11th \u2013 2015: [[Joseph Calleja]], [[El\u012bna Garan\u010da]], [[Waltraud Meier]], [[Anna Netrebko]], [[Jos\u00e9 van Dam]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Calleja, El\u012bna Garan\u010da, Waltraud Meier, Anna Netrebko & Jos\u00e9 van Dam Named as 2016 ''Opera News'' Awards Recipients|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/12/News/Opera_News_Awards_Honorees.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=6 July 2016|date=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n*12th \u2013 2016: [[Robert Carsen]], [[Christine Goerke]], [[Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin]], [[Matthew Polenzani]], [[Frederica von Stade]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwopera/article/12th-Annual-Opera-News-Awards-Are-Announced-20161031 | title=12th Annual ''Opera News'' Awards Are Announced!

It was initially intended to be a \"useful, instructive, and factual weekly newspaper of Opera in New York\".{{Cite quote|date=July 2018}} Its first issue was published on 7 December 1936 and consisted of only one folded broadsheet. Its second year of publication saw its transformation into a 17-page magazine with advertising, with its first magazine issue appearing on 15 November 1937. Beginning with the December 1940 issue, the magazine began to concentrate much of its content on the weekly [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]]. The magazine at this point offered bi-weekly issues of an expanded size during the Fall, Winter, and Spring, but was on hiatus during the summers. As time went on, the magazine began to take on a more international scope of coverage; but it still maintained a strong interest in the New York opera scene and the Met in particular.\n\nIn the Fall of 1957 Frank Merkling succeeded Peltz as the second chief editor of ''Opera News'', with his first issue appearing on 14 October 1957. In 1972 the magazine became a year-round publication, adding monthly issues in the summer months while maintaining its bi-weekly schedule during the opera season. In 1974 Robert Jacobson became the magazine's third chief editor. Jacobson was succeeded by Patrick O'Connor (1988), who was succeeded in 1989 by Patrick J. Smith. In 1998, Smith was succeeded by Rudolph S. Rauch. Under the leadership of Rauch and executive editor [[Brian Kellow]], the magazine switched to a monthly publication format in September 1998. F. Paul Driscoll, the current editor in chief, was appointed in July 2003.\n\nBeginning with the June 2012 issue, the Metropolitan Opera said that ''Opera News'' would cease reviewing Met performances, following dissatisfaction among the Met leadership with the magazine's recent critiques of [[Robert Lepage]]'s production of the [[Ring Cycle]] and of the company's direction under [[Peter Gelb]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Daniel J. |last=Wakin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/arts/music/opera-news-will-stop-reviewing-metropolitan-opera.html |date=May 21, 2012 |title=Latest Met Aria: Bad Opera News Is No News |work=The New York Times}}</ref> However, reactions from the public led to the decision being reversed.<ref>{{Cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-met-opera-news-review-20120522,0,2040627.story |first=Chris |last=Barton |date=May 22, 2012 |title=The Met reverses policy, will allow ''Opera News'' to review productions}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |work= [[National Public Radio]]|url= http://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/online-debate-operatic-intensity-met-and-its-critics|first= |last=Boise State Public Radio |date=May 24, 2012 |title=An Online Debate Of Operatic Intensity: The Met And Its Critics}}</ref>\n\n==''Opera News'' Awards==\nSince 2005 the magazine has annually bestowed five ''Opera News'' Awards for Distinguished Achievement.\n\nPast recipients of the awards have included:\n*1st \u2013 2005: [[James Conlon]], [[R\u00e9gine Crespin]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], [[Susan Graham]], [[Dolora Zajick]]\n*2nd \u2013 2006: [[Ben Heppner]], [[James Levine]], [[Ren\u00e9 Pape]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Deborah Voigt]]\n*3rd \u2013 2007: [[Stephanie Blythe]], [[Olga Borodina]], [[Thomas Hampson]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Julius Rudel]]\n*4th \u2013 2008: [[John Adams (composer)]], [[Natalie Dessay]], [[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]], [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Sherrill Milnes]]\n*5th \u2013 2009: [[Martina Arroyo]], [[Joyce DiDonato]], [[Shirley Verrett]], [[Gerald Finley]], [[Philip Glass]]\n*6th \u2013 2010: [[Jonas Kaufmann]], [[Riccardo Muti]], [[Patricia Racette]], [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[Bryn Terfel]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Sixth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Jonas Kaufmann, Riccardo Muti, Patricia Racette, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa & Bryn Terfel|url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=16734|work=Opera News|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=August 4, 2010}}</ref>\n*7th \u2013 2011: [[Karita Mattila]], [[Anja Silja]], [[Dmitri Hvorostovsky]], [[Peter Mattei]], [[Peter Sellars]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Karita Mattila, Anja Silja, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Peter Mattei and Peter Sellars|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2011/8/News/2011_Opera_News_Awards_Honorees_Announced.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=August 11, 2011}}</ref>\n*8th \u2013 2012: [[David Daniels (countertenor)|David Daniels]], [[Simon Keenlyside]], [[Eric Owens (bass-baritone)|Eric Owens]], [[Mirella Freni]], [[Dawn Upshaw]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 ''Opera News'' Awards Honorees Announced|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2012/8/News/2012_Opera_News_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=August 7, 2012}}</ref>\n*9th \u2013 2013: [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]], [[Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez]], [[Christa Ludwig]], [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]], [[Nina Stemme]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrice Ch\u00e9reau, Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, Christa Ludwig, James Morris and Nina Stemme to be Honored at the Ninth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2013/9/News/ON_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref>\n*10th \u2013 2014: [[Piotr Becza\u0142a]], [[Ferruccio Furlanetto]], [[Sondra Radvanovsky]], [[Samuel Ramey]], [[Teresa Stratas]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tenth Annual ''Opera News'' Awards to Honor Piotr Beczala, Ferruccio Furlanetto, Sondra Radvanovsky, Samuel Ramey and Teresa Stratas|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2014/12/News/2015_Opera_News_Awards.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref>\n*11th \u2013 2015: [[Joseph Calleja]], [[El\u012bna Garan\u010da]], [[Waltraud Meier]], [[Anna Netrebko]], [[Jos\u00e9 van Dam]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Calleja, El\u012bna Garan\u010da, Waltraud Meier, Anna Netrebko & Jos\u00e9 van Dam Named as 2016 ''Opera News'' Awards Recipients|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/12/News/Opera_News_Awards_Honorees.html|work=Opera News|accessdate=6 July 2016|date=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n*12th \u2013 2016: [[Robert Carsen]], [[Christine Goerke]], [[Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin]], [[Matthew Polenzani]], [[Frederica von Stade]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwopera/article/12th-Annual-Opera-News-Awards-Are-Announced-20161031 | title=12th Annual ''Opera News'' Awards Are Announced!
