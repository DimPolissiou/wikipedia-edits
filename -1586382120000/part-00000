The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://wkusports.com/documents/2019/7/17/2019_WKU_Football_Media_Guide.pdf WKU Football Media Guide retrieved 31 March 2020.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].

The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://wkusports.com/documents/2019/7/17/2019_WKU_Football_Media_Guide.pdf WKU Football Media Guide retrieved 31 March 2020.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012.

The stadium is part of a sport center, which since 2007 has also consisted of a multi-purpose hall named Spar Nord Arena, while the stadium itself includes [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] certified athletics and sports facilities such as six round lanes, eight straight lanes, starting blocks, electronic timing, two tracks for the [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]], [[pole vault]] and three throw cages surrounding an association football field.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /> The ground has a lighting installation with a light intensity of 500 [[lux]] and have been approved for televised [[Danish 1st Division]] matches by the [[Danish Football Association|Danish FA]].<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /> Apart from hosting matches for the [[Danish 1st

(2018).\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the [[List of football stadiums in Denmark|stadium]] at Engvej broke ground in May 1941, with the last details coming into place in the spring of 1943, and the new stadium was finished in 1944 at a total cost of DKK 130,000.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> As part of the agreement between [[Skive IK]] and [[Skive Municipality]], a new club house was built at the ground at a cost of DKK 12,000 and the club officially moved to Engvej in the spring of 1944.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> The stadium, with a total area of 9.5 [[barrel of land|barrels of land]] located at the [[meadow]] referred as ''Rosens Eng'' next to Karup River, consisted of an exhibition field with athletics courses, two training fields and four tennis courts.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> In the years leading up to the construction of the stadium, the meadow had already been filled up by the municipality as relief work for the unemployed.<ref name=\"drkis\" /> The inauguration of the stadium at Engvej took place on 5 June 1944 ([[Constitution Day (Denmark)|Constitution Day]]) with a programme consisting of a large athletics event with participation of many of the country's strongest athletes and an [[association football]] match in front of nearly 4,000 [[Audience|spectators]].<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"skiveam-his\" /> Skive IK, participating in the 1943\u201344 JBU's Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke, lost their association football match against the best placed [[Jutland]]ish league team in the [[1943\u201344 Danish War Tournament|1943\u201344 season]], [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|Aarhus GF]].<ref name=\"sik100\" /> Arbejdernes Idr\u00e6tsforening (AIF), which was the competing sports team in the city, had their own inauguration of the stadium on 18 June 1944 with music, singing and association football, and their first team in the JBU's Mellemr\u00e6kke played an exhibition match against the local rivals [[Holstebro Boldklub|Holstebro BK]] from the JBU's Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke.<ref name=\"sik100\" />\n\nThe City Council of [[Skive, Denmark|Skive]] made a unanimous decision on 12 June 1944 to prohibit the presence of non-paying [[audience|spectators]] at the north lying [[hill]]side, with the residence of the Skive Museum, during association football matches.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> Proposed by the then Street and Road Committee, the ban was meant to discourage potential ''free riders'' from viewing the matches from outside that stadium's gates, which could cost revenue for Skive IK and Skive Municipality.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> However, the local [[police]] have never enforced the ban nor spend resources on it, which have not had any significant impact.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> In the spring of 1945, the [[Denmark in World War II|German occupying forces]] seizes the stadium facilities and on 8 May 1945 a large parade was held by the [[Danish resistance movement]].<ref name=\"skiveam-his\" /><ref name=\"drkis\" /> Although the construction of a covered spectator stand had to be abandoned due to the stringent rationing of building material during [[World War II]], it was finally built starting from the summer of 1965 to spring 1966 using voluntary labor and with partial financial support from Skive Municipality for the [[building material]]s, and was attached to Skive IK's new club member's house next to the football field \u2014 the house was inaugurated on 28 March 1966.<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"drkis\" /><ref name=\"djfh-m\u00e5\" />\n\nThe stadium holds 10,000 people of which 523 are seated at the covered grandstand in the south west side.<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /> The stadium's record attendance was recorded on 19 May 1955 ([[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]]), when sold-out stadium crowd of nearly 10,000 spectators watched the last decisive league match in the [[1954\u201355 Jutland Series]] between the two highest placed teams in the northern division, Skive IK and local rivals [[Viborg FF]], competing for the division title and hence a spot in the [[Jutland Series|1954\u201355 Jutland Championship]] Final and qualification for the [[1954\u201355 Kvalifikationsturneringen]] (popularly known as the ''Danish 4th Division'').<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /> The [[Danish football league system|level 4]] league match, that Viborg FF won 3\u20132 in windy rain, is reportedly the largest match attendance to a lower ranking Danish league game, outside of the top three divisional structure.<ref

At that point, club members referred to the 55 years old ground as the most outdated [[Danish football league system|division]] stadium in Denmark.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> As a consequence of the first phase, that involved the [[running track]]s for the [[athlete]]s having synthetic coating installed by 1999 and hence upgrading them to [[International Association of Athletics Federations|international standards]], Skive IK was forced to relocate their [[Professionalism in association football|professional association football]] home matches to Egeris Idr\u00e6tsanl\u00e6g (more specifically ''Bane 1'') in the south part of the city \u2014 the team played a last game at the stadium, before the renovations commenced, against [[Skovshoved IF]] in the fall of 1997 as part of their [[1997\u201398 Danish 2nd Division]] campaign.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"sf-12.05.2002\" /> The club's professional senior team played at their temporary ground until the reconstruction was completed in 2003, while Skive AM was the only club to use the stadium facilities after the completion of phase one.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"pol-07.11.2002\" /> After a 5.5 year displacement period, Skive IK inaugurated the renovated stadium on 11 May 2003 with a derby against [[Holstebro Boldklub|Holstebro BK]] in front of 1,720 spectators as part of a larger celebration program that included [[Public speaking|speeches]], [[cycling]] and athletics competitions.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> The first phase had cost Skive Municipality DKK 10 million, which delayed the second phase of the project due to lack of funds.<ref name=\"sf-12.05.2002\" /> The task of completing phase two was handed to a local Skive contractor, Kaj Ove Madsen A/S.<ref name=\"sf-28.06.2002\" /> The second phase involved renovations to the buildings by 2003, resulting in a two-story extension of the building's wings totaling 190 m\u00b2, 520 covered seatings and other facilities at the grandstand, a more contemporary [[scoreboard]] and a new grass blanket on the football field was laid.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /> The existing [[changing room]]s were renovated with additional changing rooms installed for the referees.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> Changes also included facilities such as an [[Health club|exercise room]], [[public toilet]]s, a [[cafeteria]] with an extended terrace, a [[kitchen]] at the [[Storey#Numbering|building's ground floor]], while the first floor got VIP rooms for sponsors, press and meetings, a speakerbox, and rooms for the local athletics and cycling clubs, Skive AM and Skive Cykelklub.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> Plankings were erected around the stadium as part of the modernisations to the stadium, with the support of Skive IK's then [[chairperson|chairman]], to prevent matches being viewed from Engvej, and the Skive Committee on Culture and Industry took the initiative to beautify the planking with [[vine|climbing plants]].<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" />\n\nThe running tracks were renovated again in 2009 due to wear and tear together with the buildings in 2010, and included the installation of a [[balcony]] at the grandstand and, due to security reasons, an designated area for the away fans at association football matches and better sponsor facilities.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /> On 7 and 10 April 2016, the stadium hosted two [[2016 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship qualification]] games, and have previously staged two men's [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national youth teams]] in 1961 and 2015.<ref name=\"ldb-skive\" /> An upgrade of the existing [[floodlight]]s of 150 [[lux]] to 500 lux was done in the late 2000s to better support the minimum requirements of 1000 lux set forward for evening TV-transmissions at level 2.\n\nNew demands for [[under-soil heating]] at all professional matches in the Danish 1st Division were implemented beginning with the 2017/18 season, and Skive IK could no longer rely on a several years long dispensation from the Danish FA. Hence, in the summer of 2017 [[Skive Municipality]] decided to invest DKK 2.6 million in installing a total of 25 kilometers of pipes under the municipal owned facility's football field as part of the new heating system provided by Danjord.<ref name=\"tvmv-varme\" /><ref name=\"sf-28.11.2018\" /> In the years leading up to 2010, both Skive IK Elite A/S and Skive AM had been paying Skive Municipality an [[Economic rent|annual rent]] of DKK 100,000 and in the years leading up to 2019, SIK Elite were paying DKK 318,999 in annual rent for the usage of Skive Stadium, but the latest investments to the ground heating and recent overpayments from Skive IK meant an adjustment of the annual rent down to DKK 295,000 not including the payment for using the new heating system.<ref name=\"sf-28.11.2018\" /> The watering system at the stadium, installed in the summer of 2010, makes use of the nearby river, Karup \u00c5, which lowers the cost of water to a minimum.<ref name=\"sf-26.07.2018\" />\n\n== Name, sponsorships and logos ==\nOn 8 September 2009, the Finance Committee of [[Skive Municipality]] approved the sale of the rights to naming [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]] at Skive Stadium to Skive IK Elite A/S for DKK 25,000 for four years in addition to having the rights to sell banner ads at Skive Stadium.<ref name=\"sf-09.09.2009\" /><ref name=\"sf-14.11.2009\" /> On 1 July 2010 the regional [[bank]], Sparbank, obtained the naming rights for the stadium, renaming it Sparbank Arena, creating matching names with the indoor athletics hall next to the stadium, that was constructed in 2007.<ref name=\"sparbank-05.07.2010\" /> When the regional [[Skive, Denmark|Skive]]-based bank merged with the [[Aalborg]]-based bank [[Spar Nord Bank]] in the fall of 2012, the sponsorship agreement was continued in the new financial constellation, with the stadium name being changed to Spar Nord Arena, beginning 18 November 2012.<ref name=\"sf-19.11.2012\" /> The bank announced a withdrawal from its main sponsorship of Skive IK Elite A/S and its naming rights to the stadium in the fall of 2017, which was made public in February 2018, but would continue having the naming rights for the stadium in 2018 until a new sponsor was found.<ref name=\"bold.dk-21.03.2018\" /><ref name=\"skiveik-26.03.2018\" /> Due to uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal, for a short period in March 2018, the stadium was hence temporarily referred to as SIK Arena.<ref name=\"bold.dk-21.03.2018\" /> On 1 July 2018, Skive Stadium officially changed its name to Hancock Arena, when a sponsorship deal was reached between the local brewery Hancock Bryggerierne A/S and SIK Elite, that is set to expire on 1 January 2022.<ref name=\"bold.dk-19.04.2018\" /> At [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] matches, it is still known under its original name, Skive Stadium, due to sponsorship restrictions.\n\nLogos used for the naming rights agreements of the stadium:\n<gallery widths=\"170px\">\nFile:blank.png | '''Sparbank Arena'''<br />(2010\u20132012)<br />Sponsor: Sparbank\nFile:blank.png | '''Spar Nord Arena'''<br />(2012\u20132018)<br />Sponsor: [[Spar Nord Bank]]\nFile:blank.png | '''Hancock Arena'''<br />(2018\u2013''present'')<br />Sponsor: Hancock Brewery\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\">{{cite web |title=Fakta om Hancock Arena |url=http://www.skive-ik.dk/fan/stadion |website=www.skive-ik.dk |publisher=[[Skive IK|Skive Idr\u00e6ts Klub]] |accessdate=14 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214131810/http://www.skive-ik.dk/fan/stadion |archivedate=14 December 2019 |language=da}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"sik100\">{{cite book |last1=Preisler |first1=Erik |title=SIK - Skive idr\u00e6tsklub gennem 100 \u00e5r |date=2000 |publisher=Skive Idr\u00e6tsklub |location=Skive |isbn=87-988248-0-5 |pages=42-46;

1943\u201344 JBU's Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke, lost their association football match against the best placed [[Jutland]]ish league team in the [[1943\u201344 Danish War Tournament|1943\u201344 season]], [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|Aarhus GF]].<ref name=\"sik100\" /> Arbejdernes Idr\u00e6tsforening (AIF), which was the competing sports team in the city, had their own inauguration of the stadium on 18 June 1944 with music, singing and association football, and their first team in the JBU's Mellemr\u00e6kke played an exhibition match against the local rivals [[Holstebro Boldklub|Holstebro BK]] from the JBU's Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke.<ref name=\"sik100\" />\n\nThe City Council of [[Skive, Denmark|Skive]] made an unanimous decision on 12 June 1944 to prohibit the presence of non-paying [[audience|spectators]] at the north lying [[hill]]side, with the residence of the Skive Museum, during association football matches.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> Proposed by the then Street and Road Committee, the ban was meant to discourage potential ''free riders'' from viewing the matches from outside that stadium's gates, which could cost revenue for Skive IK and Skive Municipality.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> However, the local [[police]] have never enforced the ban nor spend resources on it, which have not had any significant impact.<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" /> In the spring of 1945, the [[Denmark in World War II|German occupying forces]] seizes the stadium facilities and on 8 May 1945 a large parade was held by the [[Danish resistance movement]].<ref name=\"skiveam-his\" /><ref name=\"drkis\" /> Although the construction of a covered spectator stand had to be abandoned due to the stringent rationing of building material during [[World War II]], it was finally built starting from the summer of 1965 to spring 1966 using voluntary labor and with partial financial support from Skive Municipality for the [[building material]]s, and was attached to Skive IK's new club member's house next to the football field \u2014 the house was inaugurated on 28 March 1966.<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"drkis\" /><ref name=\"djfh-m\u00e5\" />\n\nThe stadium holds 10,000 people of which 523 are seated at the covered grandstand in the south west side.<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /> The stadium's record attendance was recorded on 19 May 1955 ([[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]]), when sold-out stadium crowd of nearly 10,000 spectators watched the last decisive league match in the [[1954\u201355 Jutland Series]] between the two highest placed teams in the northern division, Skive IK and local rivals [[Viborg FF]], competing for the division title and hence a spot in the [[Jutland Series|1954\u201355 Jutland Championship]] Final and qualification for the [[1954\u201355 Kvalifikationsturneringen]] (popularly known as the ''Danish 4th Division'').<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /> The [[Danish football league system|level 4]] league match, that Viborg FF won 3\u20132 in windy rain, is reportedly the largest match attendance to a lower ranking Danish league game, outside of the top three divisional structure.<ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"tipsbladet-skiveik\" />\n\nLarge [[renovation]]s and expansions to the stadium began in 1998. At that point, club members referred to the 55 years old ground as the most outdated [[Danish football league system|division]] stadium in Denmark.<ref name=\"sik100\" /> As a consequence of the first phase, that involved the [[running track]]s for the [[athlete]]s having synthetic coating installed by 1999 and hence upgrading them to [[International Association of Athletics Federations|international standards]], Skive IK was forced to relocate their [[Professionalism in association football|professional association football]] home matches to Egeris Idr\u00e6tsanl\u00e6g (more specifically ''Bane 1'') in the south part of the city \u2014 the team played a last game at the stadium, before the renovations commenced, against [[Skovshoved IF]] in the fall of 1997 as part of their [[1997\u201398 Danish 2nd Division]] campaign.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /><ref name=\"sf-12.05.2002\" /> The club's professional senior team played at their temporary ground until the reconstruction was completed in 2003, while Skive AM was the only club to use the stadium facilities after the completion of phase one.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"pol-07.11.2002\" /> After a 5.5 year displacement period, Skive IK inaugurated the renovated stadium on 11 May 2003 with a derby against [[Holstebro Boldklub|Holstebro BK]] in front of 1,720 spectators as part of a larger celebration program that included [[Public speaking|speeches]], [[cycling]] and athletics competitions.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> The first phase had cost Skive Municipality DKK 10 million, which delayed the second phase of the project due to lack of funds.<ref name=\"sf-12.05.2002\" /> The task of completing phase two was handed to a local Skive contractor, Kaj Ove Madsen A/S.<ref name=\"sf-28.06.2002\" /> The second phase involved renovations to the buildings by 2003, resulting in a two-story extension of the building's wings totaling 190 m\u00b2, 520 covered seatings and other facilities at the grandstand, a more contemporary [[scoreboard]] and a new grass blanket on the football field was laid.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /><ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /><ref name=\"sik100\" /> The existing [[changing room]]s were renovated with additional changing rooms installed for the referees.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> Changes also included facilities such as an [[Health club|exercise room]], [[public toilet]]s, a [[cafeteria]] with an extended terrace, a [[kitchen]] at the [[Storey#Numbering|building's ground floor]], while the first floor got VIP rooms for sponsors, press and meetings, a speakerbox, and rooms for the local athletics and cycling clubs, Skive AM and Skive Cykelklub.<ref name=\"sik-nyh\" /> Plankings were erected around the stadium as part of the modernisations to the stadium, with the support of Skive IK's then [[chairperson|chairman]], to prevent matches being viewed from Engvej, and the Skive Committee on Culture and Industry took the initiative to beautify the planking with [[vine|climbing plants]].<ref name=\"skifol-forbudt\" />\n\nThe running tracks were renovated again in 2009 due to wear and tear together with the buildings in 2010, and included the installation of a [[balcony]] at the grandstand and, due to security reasons, an designated area for the away fans at association football matches and better sponsor facilities.<ref name=\"skiveam-stadion\" /> On 7 and 10 April 2016, the stadium hosted two [[2016 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship qualification]] games, and have previously staged two men's [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national youth teams]] in 1961 and 2015.<ref name=\"ldb-skive\" /> An upgrade of the existing [[floodlight]]s of 150 [[lux]] to 500 lux was done in the late 2000s to better support the minimum requirements of 1000 lux set forward for evening tv-transmissions at level 2.\n\nNew demands for [[under-soil heating]] at all professional matches in the Danish 1st Division were implemented beginning with the 2017/18 season, and Skive IK could no longer rely on a several years long dispensation from the Danish FA. Hence, in the summer of 2017 [[Skive Municipality]] decided to invest DKK 2.6 million in installing a total of 25 kilometers of pipes under the municipal owned facility's football field as part of the new heating system provided by Danjord.<ref name=\"tvmv-varme\" /><ref name=\"sf-28.11.2018\" /> In the years leading up to 2010, both Skive IK Elite A/S and Skive AM had been paying Skive Municipality an [[Economic rent|annual rent]] of DKK 100,000 and in the years leading up to 2019, SIK Elite were paying DKK 318,999 in annual rent for the usage of Skive Stadium, but the latest investments to the ground heating and recent overpayments from Skive IK meant an adjustment of the annual rent down to DKK 295,000 not including the payment for using the new heating system.<ref name=\"sf-28.11.2018\" /> The watering system at the stadium, installed in the summer of 2010, makes use of the nearby river, Karup \u00c5, which lowers the cost of water to a minimum.<ref name=\"sf-26.07.2018\" />\n\n== Name, sponsorships and logos ==\nOn 8 September 2009, the Finance Committee of [[Skive Municipality]] approved the sale of the rights to naming [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]] at Skive Stadium to Skive IK Elite A/S for DKK 25,000 for four years in addition to having the rights to sell banner ads at Skive Stadium.<ref name=\"sf-09.09.2009\" /><ref name=\"sf-14.11.2009\" /> On 1 July 2010 the regional [[bank]], Sparbank, obtained the naming rights for the stadium, renaming it Sparbank Arena, creating matching names with the indoor athletics hall next to the stadium, that was constructed in 2007.<ref name=\"sparbank-05.07.2010\" /> When the regional [[Skive, Denmark|Skive]]-based bank merged with the [[Aalborg]]-based bank [[Spar Nord Bank]] in the fall of 2012, the sponsorship agreement was continued in the new financial constellation, with the stadium name being changed to Spar Nord Arena, beginning 18 November 2012.<ref name=\"sf-19.11.2012\" /> The bank announced a withdrawal from its main sponsorship of Skive IK Elite A/S and its naming rights to the stadium in the fall of 2017, which was made public in February 2018, but would continue having the naming rights for the stadium in 2018 until a new sponsor was found.<ref name=\"bold.dk-21.03.2018\" /><ref name=\"skiveik-26.03.2018\" /> Due to uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal, for a short period in March 2018, the stadium was hence temporarily referred to as SIK Arena.<ref name=\"bold.dk-21.03.2018\" /> On 1 July 2018, Skive Stadium officially changed its name to Hancock Arena, when a sponsorship deal was reached between the local brewery Hancock Bryggerierne A/S and SIK Elite, that is set to expire on 1 January 2022.<ref name=\"bold.dk-19.04.2018\" /> At [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] matches, it is still known under its original name, Skive Stadium, due to sponsorship restrictions.\n\nLogos used for the naming rights agreements of the stadium:\n<gallery widths=\"170px\">\nFile:blank.png | '''Sparbank Arena'''<br />(2010\u20132012)<br />Sponsor: Sparbank\nFile:blank.png | '''Spar Nord Arena'''<br />(2012\u20132018)<br />Sponsor: [[Spar Nord Bank]]\nFile:blank.png | '''Hancock Arena'''<br />(2018\u2013''present'')<br />Sponsor: Hancock Brewery\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"skiveik-stadion\">{{cite web |title=Fakta om Hancock Arena |url=http://www.skive-ik.dk/fan/stadion |website=www.skive-ik.dk |publisher=[[Skive IK|Skive Idr\u00e6ts Klub]] |accessdate=14 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214131810/http://www.skive-ik.dk/fan/stadion |archivedate=14 December 2019 |language=da}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"sik100\">{{cite book |last1=Preisler |first1=Erik |title=SIK - Skive idr\u00e6tsklub gennem 100 \u00e5r |date=2000 |publisher=Skive Idr\u00e6tsklub |location=Skive |isbn=87-988248-0-5 |pages=42-46;

This list includes cases where a convicted individual was later cleared of the crime and either has received an official exoneration, or a consensus exists that the individual was unjustly punished or where a conviction has been quashed and no retrial has taken place, so that the accused is assumed innocent. This list is not exhaustive.

On September 8, 2014, President Otto P\u00e9rez announced that Fernando Carrera was being removed from his post as Foreign Affairs Minister, and transferred to the UN, where he served as the Guatemalan Ambassador at the Permanent Mission.[4] Ambassador Carrera presented his credential letters to the UN Secretary-General on September 19, 2014.\n\nBecause of the political turmoils in Guatemala, in 2015, Ambassador Carrera requested publicly for the resignation of President Perez Molina. After manifesting it in an opinion editorial, he presented his resignation to his post at the UN on August 25, 2015, in 1971 and the rest of the family moved to Costa Rica in 1975, where he finishes primary and secondary school. He finishes his undergraduate studies as Bachelor at the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica in 1990, and then departs to England, to obtain his MPhil degree on Economics and Politics of Development at the University of Cambridge in 1992. He is married to economist Elizabeth Ugalde Miranda, Costa Rican, with whom he has two daughters, Amanda Isabel and Laura Beatriz. Fernando Carrera was wrongly suspected by police of carrying out a robbery in January 2005. He was stopped by police while driving, and as the officers failed to identify themselves as police, he panicked and tried to escape. The police then shot at his car as he escaped, and he was hit eight times. While unconscious, his car continued driving for 200 meters and fatally ran down two women and a child. Carrera was taken to hospital in serious condition and survived. He was subsequently put on trial, and in June 2007 was convicted of robbery and aggravated manslaughter.  He was sentenced to 30 years in prison, which was subsequently reduced to 15 years. Irregularities were found in his case. He was released on a court order in 2013, though without being declared innocent. The [[Supreme Court of Argentina]] officially exonerated him in October 2016.<ref name=\"info bar\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2016/10/25/masacre-de-pompeya-la-corte-suprema-absolvio-a-fernando-carrera/|title=Masacre de Pompeya: la Corte Suprema y absolvi\u00f3 a Fernando Carrera|website=Infobae|accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\n=== Armenia ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He and his brother were subjected to physical violence by the police (beating, punching, kicking, blows to the ears causing a broken eardrum, forced to sit on a bottle) to force a confession from Poghosyan. The Lori Regional Court convicted Poghosyan of rape and murder in 1999. In 2003 following another offense, the real culprit was found, it became clear that the evidence against Poghosyan had been fabricated by the police and Poghosyan was freed.

Early the next morning, her body was found in Gun Alley. She had been raped and strangled. Ross was convicted on the basis of several witnesses who testified that Ross confessed to them as well several strands of blonde hair on a blanket at Ross's house. In 1993, a former school teacher named Kevin Morgan began researching Ross's case. Morgan found a file in the Office of Public Prosecutions containing the original hair samples, which had been thought lost. In 1998, two independent scientific authorities - the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine and the forensics division of the Australian Federal Police - found that the two lots of hair did not come from the same person, thereby disproving with certainty the most damning piece of evidence presented at Colin Ross's trial. Colin Ross was pardoned on May 27, 2008, 86 years after his execution.<ref>{{cite news|last=Silvester|first=John|title=Ross cleared of murder nearly 90 years ago|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bcrimeb-man-cleared-of-murder-86-years-after-he-was-executed/2008/05/26/1211653938453.html|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=2008-05-27}}</ref><ref>Kevin Morgan (2012) ''Gun Alley: Murder, Lies and Failure of Justice'' (2nd ed., updated).

Brewer was killed by an intruder with a tomahawk and scissors in her beachside apartment. Beamish, who is deaf and mute, lived near Brewer. He signed a confession, which he claimed he signed under duress. It was later determined that Brewer's murder was likely committed by Perth serial killer [[Eric Edgar Cooke]], who confessed to the murder prior to his execution. Another man, [[John Button (campaigner)|John Button]], was also convicted of murders assumed to have been committed by Cooke.<ref name=Mayes>{{cite news|last1=Mayes|first1=Andrea|title=After 41 years, convicted killer can appeal|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/28/1023864657636.html|agency=The Age|date=June 29, 2002}}</ref>\n|-\n|February 9, 1963\n|[[John Button (campaigner)|John Button]]\n|Murder of his 17-year-old girlfriend Rosemary Anderson\n|[[Fremantle, Western Australia]]\n|10 years\n|5 years\n|Yes\n|Nineteen-year-old Button and his girlfriend Rosemary Anderson were celebrating his birthday at his parents' house. After an argument, Anderson decided to walk home. Button followed her in his car but she refused to get in and continued walking. Button stopped to smoke a cigarette before driving on. He found her lying injured and unconscious on the side of the road. She died later at the hospital.<ref name=\"Why me\">Button, J. Why Me Lord!. Perth: Digital Document Company. {{ISBN|0-646-36466-9}}</ref>{{rp|p 42}} Button had a bad stutter and police interpreted this as being nervous due to the questions he was being asked. Button was refused access to his parents or a lawyer and was hit once by an interviewing police officer,<ref name=\"Why me\"/>{{rp|p 49}} before finally confessing to killing Anderson after 22 hours of interrogation. Damage to Button's car was also introduced at trial. He was charged with wilful murder and served 5 years in prison.\n\nIn 1963, Perth [[serial killer]], [[Eric Edgar Cooke]], confessed to the murder of Anderson when arrested in 1963 and again before he was executed. At his appeal, Trevor Condron, the police officer who had examined John Button's car in 1963 told the appeals court that while the car was damaged, the damage was not consistent with hitting a person and that three weeks before Anderson's death, Button had reported to police another accident. This accident report had been known to police at the original trial but been discounted as irrelevant. The court also heard from Dr Neil Turner who had treated Anderson. He claimed that her injuries were not consistent with Button's vehicle. The world's leading pedestrian accident expert, American William \"Rusty\" Haight, was flown to Australia and testified that experiments with a biomedical human-form dummy, a similar Simca to Button's and an EJ [[Holden]] similar to the one Cooke claimed he was driving when he hit Anderson, matched exactly Cooke's account and excluded the Simca.<ref>[http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20000610/news/002.shtml Beamish: action after 40 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005004216/http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20000610/news/002.shtml |date=2009-10-05 }} [[Post Newspapers|The Post]]</ref><ref>[http://netk.net.au/Button/Button.pdf A Case of Science and Justice] [[The Skeptic (UK magazine)|The Skeptic]] Spring 2002 pdf.

He was found guilty on circumstantial evidence, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad on June 30, 1948. Later, an investigation resulted in Tobianski's posthumous acquittal.

He had approached the police and told them he had known the victim, intending to offer his help any way he could, but he then became a suspect and was arrested. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was based solely on a confession and reenaction he provided to police which he later retracted, claiming that the police had extracted the confession out of him by physically abusing him and depriving him of sleep for four days. An appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court was rejected, although errors in the investigation were acknowledged. In 1980, Ezra Goldberg, a retired policeman concluded that Baranes was innocent. He gave the information to Judge [[Haim Cohn]], one of the Supreme Court judges who had rejected his appeal. Cohn concluded that his judgement was wrong, and suggested Baranes to ask for a pardon. Baranes refused, claiming that such a request would be an admission of a crime he didn't commit. Cohn then asked President [[Chaim Herzog]] to grant Baranes a pardon. Baranes was finally released in June 1983 after receiving a presidential pardon. He had served 8.5 years of his sentence. Following his release, Baranes continued his struggle to clear his name. Three times his requests for a [[new trial]] were denied. In March 2002, Supreme Court Justice [[Dalia Dorner]] finally ruled that Baranes should get a new trial. Four weeks later, Judge Cohn died. His last phone conversation was with Justice Dorner; he called her from his sickbed and thanked her for fixing the injustice \"that I did\". Baranes was one of the people who carried Cohn's coffin at his funeral. In December 2002, the court acquitted Baranes - without hearing evidence and without deciding whether Baranes committed the crime after the prosecution decided not to have a trial. In 2003, Baranes was awarded [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] 1.4&nbsp;million in compensation. On August 5, 2010, he was awarded a further NIS 5,029,000 in compensation.

After 14 days, Naffso confessed, and was tried before a military court in 1981, convicted, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. In 1987, he appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that his confession had been extracted illegally and that the prosecution had presented fabricated evidence. The Supreme Court judges cleared Naffso of most of the charges and sharply criticized Naffso's interrogators, accused them of [[perjury]], and of not taking reasonable measures during his interrogation. A plea bargain was reached, under which Naffso agreed to plead guilty to exceeding authority creating a national security risk. Naffso's sentence was reduced to 2 years and a demotion to the rank of Sergeant, and as a result, he was released immediately. The Naffso affair was one of the reasons the [[Landau Commission]], set up to investigate methods used by [[Shin Bet]], the Israeli internal security service, was set up.

He pled guilty to the four murders he confessed to, and was convicted of murdering Steinmann. In 1995, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Seven years later, journalist and author Peter Holenstein showed evidence that Ferrarri could not have killed Steinmann, including DNA analysis that a pubic hair found on her body did not match him. A subsequent comparison of [[dentures]] proved that the bite mark on her body did not come from him, but from a similar-looking man who had committed suicide in 1983.

The police then shot at his car as he escaped, and he was hit eight times. While unconscious, his car continued driving for 200 meters and fatally ran down two women and a child. Carrera was taken to hospital in serious condition and survived. He was subsequently put on trial, and in June 2007 was convicted of robbery and aggravated manslaughter.

Button was refused access to his parents or a lawyer and was hit once by an interviewing police officer,<ref name=\"Why me\"/>{{rp|p 49}} before finally confessing to killing Anderson after 22 hours of interrogation. Damage to Button's car was also introduced at trial. He was charged with wilful murder and served 5 years in prison.\n\nIn 1963, Perth [[serial killer]], [[Eric Edgar Cooke]], confessed to the murder of Anderson when arrested in 1963 and again before he was executed. At his appeal, Trevor Condron, the police officer who had examined John Button's car in 1963 told the appeals court that while the car was damaged, the damage was not consistent with hitting a person and that three weeks before Anderson's death, Button had reported to police another accident. This accident report had been known to police at the original trial but been discounted as irrelevant. The court also heard from Dr Neil Turner who had treated Anderson. He claimed that her injuries were not consistent with Button's vehicle. The world's leading pedestrian accident expert, American William \"Rusty\" Haight, was flown to Australia and testified that experiments with a biomedical human-form dummy, a similar Simca to Button's and an EJ [[Holden]] similar to the one Cooke claimed he was driving when he hit Anderson, matched exactly Cooke's account and excluded the Simca.<ref>[http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20000610/news/002.shtml Beamish: action after 40 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005004216/http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20000610/news/002.shtml |date=2009-10-05 }} [[Post Newspapers|The Post]]</ref><ref>[http://netk.net.au/Button/Button.pdf A Case of Science and Justice] [[The Skeptic (UK magazine)|The Skeptic]] Spring 2002 pdf.

She died 5 days later. Witnesses gave police a description of a man wearing a cowboy hat enter the establishment, lock the door, and walk towards the back. Sophonow, who had a police record, bore a resemblance to the sketch. He was convicted on the basis of the eyewitness identification and a jailhouse informant who testified that Sophonow confessed to him. Sophonow was tried three times. The first ended in a mistrial, the second two in convictions. Both convictions were overturned and the court of appeal ordered an acquittal. The Winnipeg police service began a reinvestigation and in June 2000, they publicly announced that Sophonow was innocent and another suspect had been identified. In 2001, Justice Peter Cory concluded that police misconduct contributed to the wrongful conviction. The use of jailhouse informants and misuse and manipulation of eyewitness accounts was criticized.<ref name=Rossmo>{{cite book|last1=Rossmo|first1=D.

On June 7, 2005, Chief Coroner for Ontario, Dr. Barry McLellan, announced that a formal review would be conducted of criminal cases for which Smith had performed the autopsy.

The Chief Military Prosecutor's order to detain and interrogate Tobianski for 10 days was ignored; instead, he was subjected to a [[drumhead court-martial]]. He was found guilty on circumstantial evidence, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad on June 30, 1948. Later, an investigation resulted in Tobianski's posthumous acquittal.

He had approached the police and told them he had known the victim, intending to offer his help any way he could, but he then became a suspect and was arrested. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was based solely on a confession and reenaction he provided to police which he later retracted, claiming that the police had extracted the confession out of him by physically abusing him and depriving him of sleep for four days. An appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court was rejected, although errors in the investigation were acknowledged. In 1980, Ezra Goldberg, a retired policeman concluded that Baranes was innocent. He gave the information to Judge [[Haim Cohn]], one of the Supreme Court judges who had rejected his appeal. Cohn concluded that his judgement was wrong, and suggested Baranes to ask for a pardon. Baranes refused, claiming that such a request would be an admission of a crime he didn't commit. Cohn then asked President [[Chaim Herzog]] to grant Baranes a pardon. Baranes was finally released in June 1983 after receiving a presidential pardon. He had served 8.5 years of his sentence. Following his release, Baranes continued his struggle to clear his name. Three times his requests for a [[new trial]] were denied. In March 2002, Supreme Court Justice [[Dalia Dorner]] finally ruled that Baranes should get a new trial. Four weeks later, Judge Cohn died. His last phone conversation was with Justice Dorner; he called her from his sickbed and thanked her for fixing the injustice \"that I did\". Baranes was one of the people who carried Cohn's coffin at his funeral. In December 2002, the court acquitted Baranes - without hearing evidence and without deciding whether Baranes committed the crime after the prosecution decided not to have a trial. In 2003, Baranes was awarded [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] 1.4&nbsp;million in compensation. On August 5, 2010, he was awarded a further NIS 5,029,000 in compensation. Amos Baranes died in September 2011.

Naffso was interrogated and subjected to various forms of torture to extract a confession. After 14 days, Naffso confessed, and was tried before a military court in 1981, convicted, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. In 1987, he appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that his confession had been extracted illegally and that the prosecution had presented fabricated evidence. The Supreme Court judges cleared Naffso of most of the charges and sharply criticized Naffso's interrogators, accused them of [[perjury]], and of not taking reasonable measures during his interrogation. A plea bargain was reached, under which Naffso agreed to plead guilty to exceeding authority creating a national security risk. Naffso's sentence was reduced to 2 years and a demotion to the rank of Sergeant, and as a result, he was released immediately. The Naffso affair was one of the reasons the [[Landau Commission]], set up to investigate methods used by [[Shin Bet]], the Israeli internal security service, was set up. Naffso subsequently filed a compensation claim against the state, and reached a compromise under which he would be given $1&nbsp;million in compensation and pledge not to publicly reveal details of the case.\n|-\n|\n|Arnoldo Lazorovsky\n|Sodomy against a minor and committing an indecent act\n|\n|6 years\n|6 years\n|Yes\n|In 2000, Arnoldo Lazorovsky was convicted of sexually assaulting a minor while working as a janitor at the Kfar Saba Country Club between 1991 and 1994, and was sentenced to six years in prison, after being accused by a young man several years after the alleged crimes occurred.

After his hat, coat and neckband were found on the side of the road with a sharp cut and sprinkled in blood, his servant John Perry claimed that Perry's own brother and mother had murdered Harrison to rob him, and subsequently dumped the body in a pond. The pond was drained but no body was found. The Perrys then alternated between pleading guilt and innocence, until they were all found guilty and hanged. However, Harrison reappeared in 1662, claiming to have been abducted by [[Barbary pirates]]. It has been claimed that this case caused British courts to not give murder sentences without a body for the next 250 years.\n|-\n|1678\n|[[Thomas Whitbread]]\n|Treason - conspiracy to murder King Charles II\n|London\n|Execution\n|Executed\n|No\n|Convicted and executed on the perjured evidence of [[Titus Oates]].\n|-\n|1679\n|[[Edmund Berry Godfrey|Robert Green, Henry Berry and Lawrence Hill]]\n|Murder\n|London\n|Death\n|Executed\n|No\n|Robert Green, Henry Berry and Lawrence Hill were hanged in 1679 at Greenberry Hill on false evidence for the unsolved murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey.

Evans was hanged in 1950. Christie was later found to be a serial killer who had murdered at least six women at the same property where Evans's wife and daughter had been killed. An official inquiry conducted 15 years after Evans's hanging concluded that Christie had been responsible for the death of Evans's daughter. The police were incompetent in several searches of the house at 10 Rillington Place, missing bones of Christie's earlier victims exposed in the garden when they were looking for the bodies of Evans's wife and daughter.

In 2019 the four men's case was returned to the [[Appeal Court]], who overturned their convictions after 47 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-50674984|title=Convictions quashed in corrupt detective case|date=December 5, 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===United States===\n\nDue to the high number of notable wrongful conviction entries for the United States, the list can be viewed via the main article.\n{{Main|List of wrongful convictions in the United States}}\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Their results are portrayed... as possessing a degree of validity and reliability that they simply do not have.\" Rakoff commends (p. 85) the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] recommendation to \"creat[e] an independent National Institute of Forensic Science to do the basic testing and promulgate the basic standards that would make forensic science much more genuinely scientific.\"\n\n{{Miscarriage of justice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Miscarriage Of Justice Cases}}\n[[Category:Overturned convictions| ]]\n[[Category:Case law lists by judge| ]]\n[[Category:Judicial review| ]]\n[[Category:Wrongful convictions|*]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: Subsequently \u2192 Subsequently,,  298,000\u00a0USD \u2192  US$298,000, an unanimous \u2192 a unanimous, \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_miscarriage_of_justice_cases"}
