Thunderstrock is a [[DIY ethic | Do-It-Yourself (DIY)]] and [[Benefit concert | charity concert]] and its idea is to support and encourage the live bands along with the [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music listeners of [[Ranchi]] and the state of [[Jharkhand]] in [[India]]. Simultaneously, the idea is to donate the income generated from the sale of tickets to groups (or [[Non-governmental organization | NGOs]]) working for the welfare of society.\n\n==History==\n===Beginning in 2008===\nThe idea of Thunderstrock emerged back in the year 2008, the idea was to generate funds for Jharkhand Rock Music Association (JRMA) so that JRMA could further plan concerts for rock bands of Ranchi. The initiative was further taken up by band members from Kaalmantra, Genesis and Sonu Chhetry from the band Sparsh, which were the prominent bands of that time. The first season of Thunderstrock was held in August 2008 at [[Ashok Group | Hotel Ashok]] in Ranchi. As the initiators for the concept of Thunderstrock, Kaalmantra and Genesis took up the stage that year. These bands were already famous with the rock music lovers of Ranchi, hence the footfall for the concert was immense and the show managed to fetch around Rs. 25,000 (around $580, according to exchange rates for 2008) which was later donated to JRMA by Mr K.C. Shashidhar, the Chief General Manager of NABARD ([[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]]).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Thunderstrock 2008 Lineup\n|-\n| Kaalmantra\n|-\n| Genesis\n|}\n\n===Second edition in 2009===\nThe second season happened in July 2009. Kaalmantra, Genesis and JRMA being the organizers this time. The event was brought forward with an agenda of spreading awareness among youth on the evils of alcoholism and child labour. Along with that, the festival was organized with an intention to support [[Yuwa-India]] which is an [[Non-governmental organization | NGOs]] that empowers girls by combating child marriage, illiteracy and human trafficking in [[Jharkhand]] through football and education. This season also featured bands like Hypnotize, Kaos and none other than Sparsh which was the leading rock band of Ranchi back then. The show was a huge success and again it collected Rs. 25,000 ($543, according to the exchange rates of 2010) and a donation was made to [[Yuwa-India]] after the show.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Thunderstrock 2009 Lineup\n|-\n| Hynotize\n|-\n| Kaos\n|-\n| Sparsh\n|}\n\n===Break in between 2010-2014===\nBy the end of 2010s came the downfall in the audience count for rock and metal music in Ranchi. This really affected the footfall of the audience in the festival especially in a city like Ranchi which is a small city and has not much of people listening to rock and metal music. Also, the initiators of the festival got jobs and moved on leaving the festival for a break. Even though Thunderstrock as a proper festival never happened in these years but the concept and the idea were used to organize other small scale DIY event in the city. The gap was witnessed with the rise of other [[DIY ethic | Do-It-Yourself (DIY)]] festivals in the city which followed the same momentum in which this festival was started.\n\n===Start after a gap in 2014 and complete silence till 2017=== \nThe fourth season happened on 7th September 2014 and from here on, [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69's]] vocalist Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of organizing this festival. For the first time, it was organized in an open-air style which experienced a footfall of around 2500. The season featured bands like Death Note (present-day Reciprocal), Destiny (present-day Iris 13), Virus, Error 404, [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69]], Genesis and the leading rock band of [[Darjeeling]] named Head Motif. The donations of that year went to Harmu Football Academy. \n\nHaving organized this festival on such a large scale for the first time, the next season in 2015 could not be conducted as there was a shortage of funds as the festival has got no backing from sponsors which is the major barrier to organizing this festival annually. This one year gap in 2015 led to the failure of organizing this festival in 2016 and 2017 as well. Also, a reason being that the initiator Tarang Kerketta was very much occupied with [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69]] shows across India.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Also on the same day, there was a cultural festival going in [[St. Xavier's College, Ranchi]] which pulled a lot of audience football. Even though the festival experienced a strong footfall of 1500 people and it is actually a huge number in a city like Ranchi and especially in a time when the metal music scene is completely down in all over India and people usually don't turn up to attend or buy the tickets to a metal music concert.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
