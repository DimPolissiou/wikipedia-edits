His ideas continue to influence [[family values]], education and [[management]] in China and East Asia. In his ''[[Great Learning]]'' Confucius wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge.

Levinson proposed that personal development comes under the influence\u2014throughout [[personal life|life]]\u2014of aspirations, which he called \"the Dream\":\n\n<blockquote>\nWhatever the nature of his Dream, a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out.  It makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is consonant with and infused by the Dream, or opposed to it.  If the Dream remains unconnected to his life it may simply die, and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose.<ref>\nDaniel Levinson, Seasons of a Man's Life, Ballantine Press, 1978, page 91-92\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nResearch on success in reaching goals, as undertaken by [[Albert Bandura]] (born 1925), suggested that [[self-efficacy]]<ref>Albert Bandura (1997).

He meant that one very popular aria, \"un Bel Di\". So if I was to come back the next summer to earn more money during the next year I'd better know that aria. You know, and I didn't know anything about it; I just learned that one aria and a few others and then one thing led to another and I studied that, and I discovered that I could sing that, sort of, that way.

The virus is primarily spread between people through close contact and via [[respiratory droplets]] produced from coughs or sneezes.<ref name=\"WHO2020QA\" /><ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /> It mainly

via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nThe degree to which the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain, but research has indicated that the [[Pharynx|pharynx]] reaches peak [[Viral load|viral load]] approximately four days after infection.<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref

SARS-CoV-2]]\n\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain

facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\"

days after infection.<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in

facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral

study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching

found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the

It is centred on the [[confluence]] of the [[Red River of the North|Red]] and [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] rivers, near the [[Longitude|longitudinal centre]] of [[North America]].\n\nThe city is named after the nearby [[Lake Winnipeg]]; the name comes from the [[Cree language|Western Cree]] words for muddy water. The region was a trading centre for [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the [[Red River Colony|Selkirk settlers]] of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. {{As of|2016|alt=As at 2016}}, Winnipeg is the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|seventh-most populated municipality]] in Canada, with a resident population of about 778,500.<ref name=\"2016_Census\"/> Being far inland, the [[Winnipeg#Climate|local climate]] is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around {{convert|-21|C|F}} and average July highs of {{convert|26|C|F}}.<ref name=\"Environment Canada 1981-2010\"/>\n\nKnown as the \"Gateway to the West\", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the [[Festival du Voyageur]], the [[Winnipeg Folk Festival]], the [[Jazz Winnipeg Festival]], the [[Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival]], and [[Folklorama]].

Beatrice and her husband, however, only inherited some of the lands that had belonged to her mother. Beatrice was forced to give up Thoire-Villars to her aunt, also named Beatrice. The claim of Beatrice to all of her mother's inheritance was strong considering the power of Guigues. However, due to exclusion of women from succession to Savoy, the county passed to her uncle, [[Philip I, Count of Savoy|Philip I]]. Philip supported Beatrice's aunt in the Faucigny inheritance dispute, leading to a war. Beatrice was captured and imprisoned. She was forced to cede a portion of her inheritance to her aunt and pay homage to Savoy throughout the 1290s.{{sfn|Carrier|2001|p=36}}\n\nIn 1269, Guigues died and due to the minority of their son John, Beatrice was appointed his regent.{{sfn|Cox|1999|p=371}} Her son was married to Bonne, daughter of [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]], who was a cousin of Beatrice. However, her son died after a fall from a horse aged around eighteen. He was eventually succeeded by Beatrice's older daughter Anne and her husband [[Humbert I of Viennois|Humbert]], with future dauphins descending from their marriage. Following the death of her son, Beatrice left for [[Taninges]] with his remains, laying them to rest there and praying for his soul in the monastery she founded, M\u00e9lan.\n\n==Second marriage and widowhood==\nBeatrice was married for a second time on April 2, 1273 to [[Gaston VII, Viscount of B\u00e9arn]].{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=378}} Her second marriage is confirmed by the agreement dated 15 December 1284 under which Gaston makes an agreement with Anne and Humbert over his claim on the County of Vienne.<ref>State Archives, volume 102, page 15, fascicule 1.</ref> Beatrice arranged a marriage for stepdaughter [[Constance of B\u00e9arn]] to [[Aymon II of Geneva]], a relative through her grandmother.{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=435-436}} Gaston had dealt with domestic problems amongst his daughters from his first marriage and which would succeed him upon death, his sons-in-law [[Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix]] and [[Gerald VI, Count of Armagnac]] had battled for power. The marriage between Beatrice and Gaston did not produce any children. After seventeen years of marriage, Gaston died and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Roger-Bernard.\n\nBeatrice did not remarry after the death of her second husband but did have more political involvement with her family back in Savoy. In 1294, she transferred her lands between Seyssel and Freiburg to her cousin Count Amadeus V. In 1296, she gave up her title as ''Dame of Faucigny'' to her son-in-law Humbert, for the benefit of one of his sons, reserving the usufruct for herself.<ref>Kerrebrouck (2000), pp. 624-5.</ref> Beatrice continued to be a powerful force in Savoy, causing torment for her cousin Amadeus especially, when she attempted to claim Savoy for her grandson Hugh. However, the claim proved unsuccessful and Amadeus remained Count for the rest of his lifetime.\n\nBeatrice died on 21 April 1310 and was buried at her monastery in Melun beside her son.

The claim of Beatrice to all of her mother's inheritance was strong considering the power of Guigues. However, due to exclusion of women from succession to Savoy, the county passed to her uncle, [[Philip I, Count of Savoy|Philip I]]. Philip supported Beatrice's aunt in the Faucigny inheritance dispute, leading to a war. Beatrice was captured and imprisoned. She was forced to cede a portion of her inheritance to her aunt and pay homage to Savoy throughout the 1290s.{{sfn|Carrier|2001|p=36}}\n\nIn 1269, Guigues died and due to the minority of their son John, Beatrice was appointed his regent.{{sfn|Cox|1999|p=371}} Her son was married to Bonne, daughter of [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]], who was a cousin of Beatrice. However, her son died after a fall from a horse aged around eighteen. He was eventually succeeded by Beatrice's older daughter Anne and her husband [[Humbert I of Viennois|Humbert]], with future dauphins descending from their marriage. Following the death of her son, Beatrice left for [[Taninges]] with his remains, laying them to rest there and praying for his soul in the monastery she founded, M\u00e9lan.\n\n==Second marriage and widowhood==\nBeatrice was married for a second time on April 2, 1273 to [[Gaston VII, Viscount of B\u00e9arn]].{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=378}} Her second marriage is confirmed by the agreement dated 15 December 1284 under which Gaston makes an agreement with Anne and Humbert over his claim on the County of Vienne.<ref>State Archives, volume 102, page 15, fascicule 1.</ref> Beatrice arranged a marriage for stepdaughter [[Constance of B\u00e9arn]] to [[Aymon II of Geneva]], a relative through her grandmother.{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=435-436}} Gaston had dealt with domestic problems amongst his daughters from his first marriage and which would succeed him upon death, his sons-in-law [[Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix]] and [[Gerald VI, Count of Armagnac]] had battled for power. The marriage between Beatrice and Gaston did not produce any children. After seventeen years of marriage, Gaston died and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Roger-Bernard.\n\nBeatrice did not remarry after the death of her second husband but did have more political involvement with her family back in Savoy. In 1294, she transferred her lands between Seyssel and Freiburg to her cousin Count Amadeus V. In 1296, she gave up her title as ''Dame of Faucigny'' to her son-in-law Humbert, for the benefit of one of his sons, reserving the usufruct for herself.<ref>Kerrebrouck (2000), pp. 624-5.</ref> Beatrice continued to be a powerful force in Savoy, causing torment for her cousin Amadeus especially, when she attempted to claim Savoy for her grandson Hugh. However, the claim proved unsuccessful and Amadeus remained Count for the rest of his lifetime.\n\nBeatrice died on 21 April 1310 and was buried at her monastery in Melun beside her son. Her various alliances with relatives and clerics in [[Geneva]] and the sharing out of her inheritance during and after her life, led to conflicts amongst her descendants for generations.<ref>Marie Jos\u00e9 (1956), p. 46.</ref> The disputes between the House of Savoy and Dauphin de Viennois over the territory which the House of Savoy won back from the French in the [[Treaty of Paris (1355)]].\n\n==Issue==\n*Anne (1255\u20131298), later successor, married in 1273 to [[Humbert de la Tour du Pin]]\n*Catherine (died after 25 January 1307), mentioned in her father's will and testament <ref>Wurstenberger (1858), Vol. IV, 732, p. 407.</ref>\n*John I (1264\u20131282), his successor\n*Andrew (1267 \u2013 c. 1270)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |language=French |title=La Vie Montagnard en Faucigny a la Fin du Moyen-\u00c2ge |first=Nicolas |last=Carrier |publisher=L'Harmattan |year=2001 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |first=Eugene L. |last=Cox |title=The Eagles of Savoy: The House of Savoy in Thirteenth-Century Europe |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1974 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |chapter=The kingdom of Burgundy, the lands of the house of Savoy and adjacent territories |first=Eugene |last=Cox |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 5, C.1198-c.1300 |editor-first1=David |editor-last1=Abulafia |editor-first2=Rosamond |editor-last2=McKitterick |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |ref=harv}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Savoy, Beatrice of, Dame of Faucigny}}\n[[Category:1310 deaths]]\n[[Category:House of Savoy|Beatrice]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:13th-century women rulers]]\n[[Category:13th-century French people]]\n[[Category:13th-century French women]]\n[[Category:14th-century French people]]\n[[Category:14th-century French women]]\n[[Category:13th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:13th-century Italian women]]\n[[Category:14th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:14th-century Italian women]]\n", "name_user": "ArisMethymna", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_of_Savoy,_Dame_of_Faucigny"}

Hyles often described his less-than-ideal upbringing which, he said, included a distant father. At the age of eighteen, Hyles enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and served as a [[paratrooper]] with the [[82nd Airborne Division]] during [[World War II]]. He and his wife, Beverly, were married during the war.\n\nAfter the war was over, Hyles completed his college education at [[East Texas Baptist University]] (then College) in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], the seat of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]]. After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, [[Bogata, Texas]]; Grange Hall Baptist Church, [[Marshall, Texas]]; and Southside Baptist Church, [[Henderson, Texas]]. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members.<ref name=\"Janega\" /> It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.<ref name=\"Janega\" /><ref name=\"BJH\">Falsani, Cathleen. \"Brother Jack Hyles of Hammond dies at 74\" ''Chicago Sun Times'', February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\n===The move to Hammond, Indiana===\nIn 1959, Hyles moved to the church provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood avenue, [[Munster, Indiana]], and became the pastor of [[First Baptist Church of Hammond]]. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, said to be mostly \"high-society types.\"  About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles' preaching style, which was much different than that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church\u2014freeing it from its ties with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]]s. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.<ref name=\"Chalfant\" /><ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nBeginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, [[Elmer Towns]] wrote a book called ''The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow'' which analyzed First Baptist's Sunday School.<ref name=\"FBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbchammond.com/the_voice/01%20decembervoice2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=First Baptist Church...

As early as 1975, ''Time'' magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, \"Superchurch.\"  The ''Time'' article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913788,00.html Superchurch]'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]] December 1, 1975 (retrieved June 4, 2006).</ref>  In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday.<ref name=\"Time\" />  In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nHyles spoke at '[[The Sword of the Lord]]' conferences with [[John R. Rice]] and his own annual \"Pastors School\". The school continues to attract as many as seven thousand annual visitors to the Hammond area.<ref>{{cite web | last = Zabroski | first = Steve | year = 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414133420/http://nwitimes.com/articles/1997/10/04/export247369.txt|archivedate=April 14, 2009|url = http://nwitimes.com/articles/2006/03/24/news/lake_county/2970eb71e3fc94308625713b0014b869.txt | title = Faithful flock to Hammond | work = [[Northwest Indiana Times]] | accessdate = March 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles wrote approximately fifty works in his lifetime with over 14 million total copies in circulation, including the popular ''Is There A Hell?'', based on a sermon he preached at a National Sword of the Lord Conference.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  Another work, ''Enemies of Soul Winning'' tackled many issues considered controversial in fundamentalist and evangelical circles, which include the doctrine of repentance, [[Lordship salvation]], and the role of the church in soul winning. The ''Calvary Contender'' wrote, \"Hyles will be remembered as a one-of-a-kind, ever controversial leader whose ministry touched the lives of multitudes.\"<ref>{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | title = Jack Hyles Succumbs To Heart Attack | work = [[Calvary Contender]] | accessdate = May 1, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060512171223/http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | archivedate = May 12, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles was better known as \"Brother Hyles\" to his tens of thousands of congregants.<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles often held nationwide speaking engagements. In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]], Texas, the seat of [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]], hosted by pastor Luther Wallace \"Buck\" Hatfield (1929\u20131995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder. Hatfield and Spencer also adapted the bus ministry approach for their congregations.\n\nIn his book, ''Enemies of Soulwinning'', Hyles taught that one could not be born again unless the [[King James Version]] was used somewhere along the line in that person's life.<ref>''Enemies of Soulwinning'' by Jack Hyles, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> He did not teach [[Landmarkism]]/[[Baptist successionism]] (the belief that the Baptist church is the original church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at [[Pentecost]]), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in AD 313.<ref name=\"landmark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Printed%20Books/Dr%20Jack%20Hyles/The%20Church/fundamental_baptist_church-chap_23.htm|title=What Is a Fundamental Baptist Church?}}</ref>\n\n=== Honors, award, and praise ===\nIn contrast to the criticism, Hyles has been the recipient of praise, an honorary doctorate, and other accolades throughout the course of his life, even continuing past his death. The ''Washington Post'' compared the \"meek\" preaching style of [[Jerry Falwell]] to the \"spit and fire\" of Hyles. The Post suggested that after you heard a preacher like Hyles, \"you knew that you'd been preached to\".<ref>Harrington, Walt. \"What Hath Falwell Wrought?\" ''Washington Post'', July 24, 1988, p.

After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, [[Bogata, Texas]]; Grange Hall Baptist Church, [[Marshall, Texas]]; and Southside Baptist Church, [[Henderson, Texas]]. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members.<ref name=\"Janega\" /> It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.<ref name=\"Janega\" /><ref name=\"BJH\">Falsani, Cathleen. \"Brother Jack Hyles of Hammond dies at 74\" ''Chicago Sun Times'', February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\n===The move to Hammond, Indiana===\nIn 1959, Hyles moved to the church provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood avenue, [[Munster, Indiana]], and became the pastor of [[First Baptist Church of Hammond]]. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, said to be mostly \"high-society types.\"  About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles' preaching style, which was much different than that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church\u2014freeing it from its ties with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]]s. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.<ref name=\"Chalfant\" /><ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nBeginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, [[Elmer Towns]] wrote a book called ''The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow'' which analyzed First Baptist's Sunday School.<ref name=\"FBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbchammond.com/the_voice/01%20decembervoice2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=First Baptist Church...

As early as 1975, ''Time'' magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, \"Superchurch.\"  The ''Time'' article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913788,00.html Superchurch]'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]] December 1, 1975 (retrieved June 4, 2006).</ref>  In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday.<ref name=\"Time\" />  In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nHyles spoke at '[[The Sword of the Lord]]' conferences with [[John R.

The ''Calvary Contender'' wrote, \"Hyles will be remembered as a one-of-a-kind, ever controversial leader whose ministry touched the lives of multitudes.\"<ref>{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | title = Jack Hyles Succumbs To Heart Attack | work = [[Calvary Contender]] | accessdate = May 1, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060512171223/http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | archivedate = May 12, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles was better known as \"Brother Hyles\" to his tens of thousands of congregants.<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles often held nationwide speaking engagements. In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]], Texas, the seat of [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]], hosted by pastor Luther Wallace \"Buck\" Hatfield (1929\u20131995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder. Hatfield and Spencer also adapted the bus ministry approach for their congregations.\n\nIn his book, ''Enemies of Soulwinning'', Hyles taught that one could not be born again unless the [[King James Version]] was used somewhere along the line in that person's life.<ref>''Enemies of Soulwinning'' by Jack Hyles, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> He did not teach [[Landmarkism]]/[[Baptist successionism]] (the belief that the Baptist church is the original church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at [[Pentecost]]), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in AD 313.<ref name=\"landmark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Printed%20Books/Dr%20Jack%20Hyles/The%20Church/fundamental_baptist_church-chap_23.htm|title=What Is a Fundamental Baptist Church?}}</ref>\n\n=== Honors, award, and praise ===\nIn contrast to the criticism, Hyles has been the recipient of praise, an honorary doctorate, and other accolades throughout the course of his life, even continuing past his death. The ''Washington Post'' compared the \"meek\" preaching style of [[Jerry Falwell]] to the \"spit and fire\" of Hyles. The Post suggested that after you heard a preacher like Hyles, \"you knew that you'd been preached to\".<ref>Harrington, Walt. \"What Hath Falwell Wrought?\" ''Washington Post'', July 24, 1988, p. W19.</ref> Falwell said that \"Hyles will be remembered as a leader in evangelism through the local church.\"  Falwell also said, \"He inspired me as a young pastor to win others to Christ through Sunday school, the pulpit, and personal witnessing. He made a great contribution to the cause of Christ\".<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Midwestern Baptist College]], an unaccredited Bible college in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].<ref>As discussed along with his misuse of the title on [[Preying from the Pulpit]] in May 1993 by [[WJBK]] of [[Detroit]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Chicago Sun Times'' wrote about Hyles on the occasion of his death, \"When he chose the interests of poor, inner-city kids over millionaire church members, they said he'd never keep the doors of his church open.\" However, Hyles \"proved them all wrong. In the process he built one of the largest congregations in the country, a college, six schools, and a vibrant ministry that will now have to survive without him.\"<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\n[[Matthew Barnett]], while discussing his work at an inner-city Los Angeles ministry, explained how he learned from Hyles.
