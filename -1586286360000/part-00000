Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative.

In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nIn Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.\n\nEarly in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].\n\nThe Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H.

In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty.

Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative. This became commonly known as \"[[No Taxation without Representation]].\" Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies despite the fact that the colonists had no representative in Parliament.<ref>John C.

In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nIn Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.\n\nEarly in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].\n\nThe Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H.

In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty. They were also revived in [[Vermont]], holding meetings well into the early 1800's with notable members such as Lieutenant Colonel Martin Scott and Hiram Harwood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bennington.pastperfectonline.com/archive/4C9E4089-98C4-4879-B9DA-139449056493|title=Sons of Liberty Minutes|last=|first=|date=|website=Bennington Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Flags==\nIn 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red.

The city is situated on the [[Guden\u00e5|Guden\u00e5 River]] in the hilly and lush landscape of [[S\u00f8h\u00f8jlandet]], surrounded by Denmark\u2019s largest forest district and a great number of lakes.

Silkeborg Papirfabrik (Silkeborg Paper mill) was located near the [[Guden\u00e5]] River where Silkeborg castle once stood, in order to exploit the river as a source of energy for the mill, as a resource for paper production  and as a means of transport.  Michael Drewsen, regarded as the founder of the city, was responsible for the daily management of the mill. A statue of Michael Drewsen now stands in front of the old city hall in the town square.\nA commission to establish Silkeborg as a trading centre was set up in 1845, and the site grew into a small settlement, from a population of 30 in 1844 to 556 in 1850 and to 1,204 in 1855. The City Council and the Parish were both established in 1855. The railway was built in 1871.\nSilkeborg was given the status of [[market town]] (''k\u00f8bstad'') in 1900. The population was recorded as being 7,228 in 1901, and 8,792 in 1911. \nDuring the [[German occupation of Denmark]], the [[Gestapo]] turned the Silkeborg Bad (Silkeborg Baths), which had until then served as the municipal sanatorium, into its Danish headquarters.<ref>[http://www.silkeborgshistorie.dk/01-hist-06-arbejd-01.asp], Hverdagen under bes\u00e6ttelsen, Retrieved 8 October 2013.</ref> The remnants of German bunkers can still be seen today, and one of these bunkers is now a public museum.\n\n==Geography==\nSilkeborg is located in region known as [[S\u00f8h\u00f8jlandet]] (lit.: the lake-highland) in mid-eastern [[Jutland]], regarded as one of the most beautiful areas in Denmark. The landscape consists mostly of lakes, extensive woodlands (such as the [[Silkeborg Forests]]) and some of the highest points in Denmark, including [[Himmelbjerget]]. It is also one of the most expensive areas in Denmark in which to live, and the neighbouring village of [[Sejs]] is known for its particularly large mansions and lakeside villas at [[Brass\u00f8]].\n\n==Economy==\nFor many years the paper mill (Silkeborg Papirfabrik) was the most prominent business in the city, but during the 1990s it suffered financial difficulties.<ref>[http://www.wikisilkeborg.dk/index.php/Silkeborg_Papirfabrik], Silkeborg Papirfabrik, Retrieved 8 October 2013.</ref> In 1993, the German corporation, Drewsen Spezialpapiere, bought the mill, but in 2000 decided to close it. An urban renewal project turned the industrial area closest to the city centre partly into a new commercial district with a hotel, a cinema, a concert hall, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; and partly into a new residential neighbourhood with modern apartment buildings.\n\nThe city has a large number of car dealerships, and is also the headquarters of [[Jyske Bank]], Denmark's third-largest bank.<ref>[http://www.banktorvet.dk/banker/jyske-bank/], About Jyske Bank, Retrieved 8 October 2013.</ref>\n\n==Main sights==\n* '''Silkeborg Museum:''' The oldest preserved building in the city is Silkeborg Manor constructed in 1767.

Each day, a different company puts on a fireworks display and the winner is announced on Saturday. On Saturday evening, the winner from three years before puts on a major firework show sponsored by the City Council. Nowadays the fireworks are fired from a huge raft on Silkeborg Lake just next to City Hall, however, in years gone by, the show was done from the roof of the old paper mill.\n\n==Sports==\nThe two most popular sports in Silkeborg are football and handball:\n* The city\u2019s professional football team, [[Silkeborg IF]], play in Danish football's highest league, the [[Danish Superliga]]. The team has won the League Trophy once, in [[1993-94 Danish Superliga|1994]]; the [[Danish Cup]] in [[2000-01 Danish Cup|2001]]; and the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in [[1997 UEFA Intertoto Cup|1997]]. Silkeborg IF plays its home matches at [[Silkeborg Stadion]], renamed Mascot Park after the company [[MASCOT Workwear|Mascot]], a textiles manufacturer, which bought the rights to the stadium name. It is located close to the city centre and has a capacity of 10,000 people.\n* Silkeborg\u2019s professional handball team is [[Bjerringbro-Silkeborg|BSV]] (named after the three towns of [[Bjerringbro]], Silkeborg, and Voel). The team is a part of the [[Danish Handball League]], and plays its home matches at [[Silkeborg-Hallerne|Jysk Arena]], previously known Silkeborg Hallerne, a sports centre northeast of the city centre. The ladies handball team Silkeborg-Voel usually plays its home matches at Voel Hallerne about 10&nbsp;km from Silkeborg.\n* The motor racing circuit [[Jyllands-Ringen]] is located about 5&nbsp;km east of the city centre, in Resenbro. The circuit is 2.3&nbsp;km long and was a part of the DTC, ([[Danish Touringcar Championship]]) and currently a part of the [[STCC TCR Scandinavia Touring Car Championship|TCR Scandinavia Touring Car Championship]] and the [[TCR Denmark Touring Car Championship|TCR Denmark Touring Car Series]].\n* Silkeborg IF Cykling is a cycling club based in Silkeborg. In 2004, the club created an \u00e9lite amateur team, called Team Designa K\u00f8kken. Its biggest accomplishment came in 2008 when rider [[Jakob Fuglsang]] won [[Danmark Rundt]] (i.e. The Tour of Denmark).\n* Silkeborg has a ski resort, with natural snow in winter, and also a nylon track that allows for year-round skiing. The ski resort is located in Gjern about 15&nbsp;km from the city centre.<ref>[http://www.skiurlaub-infos.com/165/skiing-denmark.html Skiing in Denmark], Skiurlaub-Infos, Retrieved 11 October 2008.</ref>\n* In March 2019, Silkeborg hosted the World Women's [[Curling]] Championships.<ref>[http://www.worldcurling.org/wwcc-2019-venue Silkeborg, Denmark to host World Women\u2019s Curling Championship 2019], World Curling Federation, Retrieved 18 March 2019.</ref>\n\n==Media==\nSilkeborg is served by two media outlets; a newspaper and a radio station. The oldest of the two is the daily newspaper ''[[Midtjyllands Avis]]'' founded in 1857<ref name=jphus>{{cite web|title=Other Activities|url=http://www.jppol.dk/en/artikler/other-activities.aspx|work=JP/Politikens Hus|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215230834/http://www.jppol.dk/en/artikler/other-activities.aspx|archive-date=15 February 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> as ''Silkeborg Avis''. It is the sixth oldest newspaper in Denmark and was founded when the town of Silkeborg had only existed for 11 years. For many years the paper had its own paper press, but now it is printed at [[Jyllands-Posten]]'s facilities.\n\n''Midtjyllands Avis'' is now owned by the Silkeborg Avis group. This group is also the joint owner of the radio station Radio 1 (formerly known as Radio Silkeborg), a commercial radio station broadcasting online and on FM across central Jutland. The radio station tends to air a mix of pop music and local news. The sister station, Silkeborg Guld, tailors its programming for audiences interested in older Danish and English music, only interrupted by adverts. The newspaper and the radio station are both headquartered at Papirfabrikken.\n\nOn the 16th of August 2013 it was announced that Radio Silkeborg was to be handed over to the Radio ABC Group. As a consequence, five employees were made redundant, but programmes would continue to be broadcast on the same FM frequency.<ref>[http://www.radioassistant.com/dk/2013/08/breaking-radio-1-og-silkeborg-guld-lukker/ Radio Silkeborg closes], Retrieved 17 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n* '''Road''': Silkeborg is connected by motorways to [[Aarhus]], [[Herning]], [[Horsens]], [[Randers]] and [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]].  A new motorway was completed in September 2016 connecting Silkeborg to Aarhus and Herning. Regional buses to the surrounding cities depart from the train station. Local public transport includes 12 local bus routes serving the city centre and suburbs.\n* '''Rail''': The main station, Silkeborg Station, is on the railway line between Aarhus and Herning, with services currently operated by [[Arriva]] Danmark.

The city is situated on the [[Guden\u00e5|Guden\u00e5 River]] in the hilly and lush landscape of [[S\u00f8h\u00f8jlandet]], surrounded by Denmark\u2019s largest forest district and a great number of lakes.

Silkeborg Papirfabrik (Silkeborg Paper mill) was located near the [[Guden\u00e5]] River where Silkeborg castle once stood, in order to exploit the river as a source of energy for the mill, as a resource for paper production  and as a means of transport.  Michael Drewsen, regarded as the founder of the city, was responsible for the daily management of the mill. A statue of Michael Drewsen now stands in front of the old city hall in the town square.\nA commission to establish Silkeborg as a trading centre was set up in 1845, and the site grew into a small settlement, from a population of 30 in 1844 to 556 in 1850 and to 1,204 in 1855. The City Council and the Parish were both established in 1855. The railway was built in 1871.\nSilkeborg was given the status of [[market town]] (''k\u00f8bstad'') in 1900. The population was recorded as being 7,228 in 1901, and 8,792 in 1911. \nDuring the [[German occupation of Denmark]], the [[Gestapo]] turned the Silkeborg Bad (Silkeborg Baths), which had until then served as the municipal sanatorium, into its Danish headquarters.<ref>[http://www.silkeborgshistorie.dk/01-hist-06-arbejd-01.asp], Hverdagen under bes\u00e6ttelsen, Retrieved 8 October 2013.</ref> The remnants of German bunkers can still be seen today, and one of these bunkers is now a public museum.\n\n==Geography==\nSilkeborg is located in region known as [[S\u00f8h\u00f8jlandet]] (lit.: the lake-highland) in mid-eastern [[Jutland]], regarded as one of the most beautiful areas in Denmark. The landscape consists mostly of lakes, extensive woodlands (such as the [[Silkeborg Forests]]) and some of the highest points in Denmark, including [[Himmelbjerget]]. It is also one of the most expensive areas in Denmark in which to live, and the neighbouring village of [[Sejs]] is known for its particularly large mansions and lakeside villas at [[Brass\u00f8]].\n\n==Economy==\nFor many years the paper mill (Silkeborg Papirfabrik) was the most prominent business in the city, but during the 1990s it suffered financial difficulties.<ref>[http://www.wikisilkeborg.dk/index.php/Silkeborg_Papirfabrik], Silkeborg Papirfabrik, Retrieved 8 October 2013.</ref> In 1993, the German corporation, Drewsen Spezialpapiere, bought the mill, but in 2000 decided to close it. An urban renewal project turned the industrial area closest to the city centre partly into a new commercial district with a hotel, a cinema, a concert hall, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; and partly into a new residential neighbourhood with modern apartment buildings.\n\nThe city has a large number of car dealerships, and is also the headquarters of [[Jyske Bank]], Denmark's third-largest bank.<ref>[http://www.banktorvet.dk/banker/jyske-bank/], About Jyske Bank, Retrieved 8 October 2013.</ref>\n\n==Main sights==\n* '''Silkeborg Museum:''' The oldest preserved building in the city is Silkeborg Manor constructed in 1767.

For many years the paper had its own paper press, but now it is printed at [[Jyllands-Posten]]'s facilities.\n\n''Midtjyllands Avis'' is now owned by the Silkeborg Avis group. This group is also the joint owner of the radio station Radio 1 (formerly known as Radio Silkeborg), a commercial radio station broadcasting online and on FM across central Jutland. The radio station tends to air a mix of pop music and local news. The sister station, Silkeborg Guld, tailors its programming for audiences interested in older Danish and English music, only interrupted by adverts. The newspaper and the radio station are both headquartered at Papirfabrikken.\n\nOn the 16th of August 2013 it was announced that Radio Silkeborg was to be handed over to the Radio ABC Group. As a consequence, five employees were made redundant, but programmes would continue to be broadcast on the same FM frequency.<ref>[http://www.radioassistant.com/dk/2013/08/breaking-radio-1-og-silkeborg-guld-lukker/ Radio Silkeborg closes], Retrieved 17 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n* '''Road''': Silkeborg is connected by motorways to [[Aarhus]], [[Herning]], [[Horsens]], [[Randers]] and [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]].  A new motorway was completed in September 2016 connecting Silkeborg to Aarhus and Herning. Regional buses to the surrounding cities depart from the train station. Local public transport includes 12 local bus routes serving the city centre and suburbs.\n* '''Rail''': The main station, Silkeborg Station, is on the railway line between Aarhus and Herning, with services currently operated by [[Arriva]] Danmark. The former railway connections to [[Horsens]] and [[Lang\u00e5]] were closed in the 1960s, meaning the city has been left with eastward and westward trains only.\n* '''Water''': The [[Guden\u00e5]] River was for many years an important transport link for passengers and cargo, but passenger transport along the river is now only available for tourists during the summer.\n* '''Airport''': [[Karup Airport|Midtjyllands Lufthavn]] (Karup Airport) is the closest airport, located 40&nbsp;km North West of the city. The airport offers several daily flights to the Danish capital, [[Copenhagen]].\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Harald Madsen \"Bivognen\" \"Sl\u00e4pvagnen\".jpg|thumb|140px|Harald Madsen, 1930's]]\n[[File:Simon Kvamm - Nephew (Band) - Roskilde Festival 2010-2.jpg|thumb|140px|Simon Kvamm, 2010]]\n[[File:Alphabeat .jpg|thumb|140px|Alphabeat, 2008]]\n=== The Arts ===\n* [[Lau Lauritzen Sr.]] (1878\u20131938) a Danish film director, screenwriter and actor during the silent era of film \n* [[Astrid Aagesen]] (1883\u20131965) a Danish-Swedish designer who crafted objects made out of pewter and silver\n* [[Harald Madsen]] (1890\u20131949) a variety artist and film actor in popular Danish silent movies\n* [[S\u00f8ren Hjorth Nielsen]] (1901\u20131983) a Danish painter and illustrator \n* [[Erik Raadal]] (1905 in Horn \u2013 1941) an important Danish landscape painter from the 1930s\n* [[Asger Jorn]] (1914\u20131973) a painter, sculptor, ceramic artist and author.

Initially, erosion began to reveal that the clearing began at the gentle slope of the highland valley but later expanded to a steep slope. \n\nIt was one of the first sites to be made a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] (1978). However, due to serious population declines of some of its characteristic native species, in 1996 it was also added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]].\n\nThe national park suffered from fires in April 2019, which destroyed some areas. Helicopters were sent in from Kenya to help extinguish the fires. \n\n== Geography ==\nOver millions of years, due to the large erosion of the [[Ethiopian plateau]], serrated mountain peaks, deep valleys, and 1,500 meters of sheer cliffs have been created, making it one of the most spectacular scenery in the world.\n\nThe heritage area is on the western side of the [[Simien Mountains]] and is 120&nbsp;km from the Gondar province of Begemder in the northwestern part of [[Ethiopia]]. The Simien area is rich in perforated basalt, and serves as an ideal catchment basin. Water is reserved by the [[Mayshasha River]], which runs through the two rainy days and the national park from north to south. As a result, national parks are abundant with wildlife and plants.\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nThe vegetation is mixed with African alpine forests, wilderness forests and alpine vegetation. High altitude areas include montane savannah and tree heath (''[[Erica arborea]]''), giant lobelia (''[[Lobelia rhynchopetalum]]''), yellow primrose (''Primula verticillata''), everlastings (''[[Helichrysum]]'' spp.), A lady's mantle (alchemilla), and a moss (mosses, [[Grimmiaceae]]). Lichen covers the trees of the alpine area. Vegetation throughout the park is divided into three sections, Montane forest (1900-3000m), Ericaceous Belt or SubAfroalpine (2700-3700m) and the Afroalpine (3700-5433m). Within the Montane forest there are Juniper trees (''Juniperous procera''), African Redwood (''Hagenia abyssinica),'' African Olive (''Olea africana),'' Fig Trees (''Ficus spp),'' and Waterberry Trees (''Szygium guineense).'' There are also many varieties of shrubs including Nightshade (''Solanum sessilistellatum''), Abyssinian rose (''Rosa abyssinica),'' Cowslip (''primula verticillata''), and Stinging Nettle (''Urtica''). <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.simienmountains.org/the-park/size-location-and-vegetation|title=Simien plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The ridges and canyons have scattered meadows, forests and bushes.

There are also large herbivores, such as [[bushbuck]], [[common duiker]], and [[klipspringer]].\n\nThe 400 species of birds include [[Bearded vulture|lammergeyer]], [[Verreaux's eagle]], [[Kestrel|kestrels]], [[Vulture|vultures]], [[lanner falcon]] (''Falco biarmicus''), African buzzard ([[augur buzzard]]) and [[thick-billed raven]]. A total of 21 species of mammals, 3 species of endemic species, 63 species of birds and 7 species of endemic species are recorded.\n\n== Conservation ==\nIt was established as a [[national park]] in 1969 and is protected under the National Reserve Act. Current heritage requires effective management. The number of management staff should be increased and education should be strengthened. The management of national parks effectively protects the representative species of parks and works closely with local residents to reduce the pressure on park resources by expanding arable land, overfishing [[livestock]], and overcapacity of natural resources. Due to [[global climate change]], pressure on heritage sites is growing.\n\nSufficient financial support is needed for park management and livelihood alternative development of local residents. It is necessary to prepare, implement, review and monitor the management plan, to revise and expand the boundary of the park, and to participate fully in the local residents. Local cooperation is particularly important to prevent sustainable use of national park resources and to develop sustainable [[livelihood]]s. Adequate financial support for resettlement of inhabitants in the heritage area and the introduction of effective livestock management are essential to reduce the severe stress on wildlife.\n\nIn order to maintain excellent universal values, [[environmental education]] and training programs of residents living in and out of the heritage are needed as well as obtaining the cooperation and support of local residents in heritage management.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nSemien Mountains 13.jpg|Semien Mountains\nMountain nyala.jpg |[[Bushbuck]]\nGeladas near Chennek.jpg|[[Gelada]]s\nCanis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|[[Ethiopian wolf]]\nGiant Lobelia 03.jpg|''Lobelia rhynchopetalum''\nRaptor, Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia (2456222802).jpg|Bird of prey\nThick-billed Raven 02.jpg|[[Thick-billed raven]]\nSimiensk\u00e9 hory.jpg|Cliff in the National Park\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[National parks in Ethiopia]]\n* [[List of World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia]]\n<!-- This probably shouldn't be here: also contain high, rugged peaks -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikivoyage|Simien National Park}}\n{{Commonscat|Simien Mountains National Park}}\n* [https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=9 UNESCO World Heritage profile of Simien National Park]\n* [http://www.unep-wcmc.org/medialibrary/2011/06/23/4d8797fe/Simien%20National%20Park.pdf United Nations Environment Programme: World Conservation Monitoring Centre: Simien National Park]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607154904/http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2001/06/22-06-01/NATIONAL.htm The National Parks of Ethiopia: Simien Mountain Adventure - Part I (''Addis Tribune'')]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060323175533/http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2001/06/29-06-01/Nationa.htm The National Parks of Ethiopia: Simien Mountain Adventure - Part II (''Addis Tribune'')]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607112239/http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2001/07/06-07-01/National.htm The National Parks of Ethiopia: Simien Mountain Adventure - Part III (''Addis Tribune'')]\n\n{{National Parks of Ethiopia}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia}}\n\n[[Category:National parks of Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:Amhara Region]]\n[[Category:Semien Mountains]]\n[[Category:Ethiopian Highlands]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Danger]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=June 2017}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=June 2017}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox Protected area \n| name = Simien Mountains National Park\n| iucn_category = II\n| photo = File:Semien Mountains 9.jpg\n| photo_caption = Semien Mountains\n| location = [[Ethiopia]]\n| nearest_city = [[Debarq]] and [[Mekane Berhan]]\n| embedded1 = {{designation list | embed=yes\n   | designation1 = WHS\n   | designation1_offname = Simien National Park\n   | designation1_date = 1978 <small>(2nd [[World Heritage Committee|session]])</small>\n   | designation1_type = Natural\n   | designation1_criteria = vii, x\n   | designation1_number = [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/9 9]\n   | designation1_free1name = State Party\n   | designation1_free1value = {{ETH}}\n   | designation1_free2name = Region\n   | designation1_free2value = [[List of World Heritage Sites in Africa|Africa]]\n   | designation1_free3name = [[List of World Heritage in Danger|Endangered]]\n   | designation1_free3value = 1996\u20132017<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1683/ Ethiopian World Heritage site, Simien National Park no longer in danger] at [[UNESCO]] website (4 July 2017)</ref>\n}}\n| map = Ethiopia\n| relief = 1\n| coordinates = {{coord|13|11|N|38|4|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| area_km2 = 220\n| established = 1969\n| visitation_num = \n| visitation_year = \n| governing_body = \n}}\n\n'''Simien Mountains National Park''' is one of the [[National parks in Ethiopia|national parks]] of [[Ethiopia]].

There are also large herbivores, such as [[bushbuck]], [[common duiker]], and [[klipspringer]].\n\nThe 400 species of birds include [[Bearded vulture|lammergeyer]], [[Verreaux's eagle]], [[Kestrel|kestrels]], [[Vulture|vultures]], [[lanner falcon]] (''Falco biarmicus''), African buzzard ([[augur buzzard]]) and [[thick-billed raven]].

Current heritage requires effective management. The number of management staff should be increased and education should be strengthened. The management of national parks effectively protects the representative species of parks and works closely with local residents to reduce the pressure on park resources by expanding arable land, overfishing [[livestock]], and overcapacity of natural resources. Due to [[global climate change]], pressure on heritage sites is growing.\n\nSufficient financial support is needed for park management and livelihood alternative development of local residents. It is necessary to prepare, implement, review and monitor the management plan, to revise and expand the boundary of the park, and to participate fully in the local residents. Local cooperation is particularly important to prevent sustainable use of national park resources and to develop sustainable [[livelihood]]s. Adequate financial support for resettlement of inhabitants in the heritage area and the introduction of effective livestock management are essential to reduce the severe stress on wildlife.\n\nIn order to maintain excellent universal values, [[environmental education]] and training programs of residents living in and out of the heritage are needed as well as obtaining the cooperation and support of local residents in heritage management.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nSemien Mountains 13.jpg|Semien Mountains\nMountain nyala.jpg |[[Bushbuck]]\nGeladas near Chennek.jpg|[[Gelada]]s\nCanis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|[[Ethiopian wolf]]\nGiant Lobelia 03.jpg|''Lobelia rhynchopetalum''\nRaptor, Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia (2456222802).jpg|Bird of prey\nThick-billed Raven 02.jpg|[[Thick-billed raven]]\nSimiensk\u00e9 hory.jpg|Cliff in the National Park\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[National parks in Ethiopia]]\n* [[List of World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia]]\n<!-- This probably shouldn't be here: also contain high, rugged peaks -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikivoyage|Simien National Park}}\n{{Commonscat|Simien Mountains National Park}}\n* [https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=9 UNESCO World Heritage profile of Simien National Park]\n* [http://www.unep-wcmc.org/medialibrary/2011/06/23/4d8797fe/Simien%20National%20Park.pdf United Nations Environment Programme: World Conservation Monitoring Centre: Simien National Park]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607154904/http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2001/06/22-06-01/NATIONAL.htm The National Parks of Ethiopia: Simien Mountain Adventure - Part I (''Addis Tribune'')]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060323175533/http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2001/06/29-06-01/Nationa.htm The National Parks of Ethiopia: Simien Mountain Adventure - Part II (''Addis Tribune'')]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607112239/http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2001/07/06-07-01/National.htm The National Parks of Ethiopia: Simien Mountain Adventure - Part III (''Addis Tribune'')]\n\n{{National Parks of Ethiopia}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia}}\n\n[[Category:National parks of Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:Amhara Region]]\n[[Category:Semien Mountains]]\n[[Category:Ethiopian Highlands]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Danger]]\n", "name_user": "Readaroo", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simien_Mountains_National_Park"}

It was named after the [[Amite River]]. French explorers had named the latter for the friendly (''amiti\u00e9'' in French) indigenous [[Houma people]] they encountered in the region.<ref name=\"Huff Nunnery 2009\">{{cite book|last1=Huff|first1=Robert Glen|last2=Nunnery|first2=Hattie Pearl|title=Amite County & Liberty, Mississippi: Celebrating 200 Years|date=2009|publisher=Donning Co.|location=Virginia Beach, VA|isbn=978-1-57864-547-3}}</ref>\n\nThe legislation that established the county authorized the appointment of five commissioners to find a site for the county seat, near the county's center and near a good spring; its name was to be Liberty. At this time, the total population of the county numbered about 4000 people, about 80% of whom were middle-class families of seventeenth-century Virginia stock who had gradually migrated through other frontier states. Primary religious groups were all Protestant, including [[Baptists]], [[Presbyterians]], and [[Methodists]].\n\nCompleted in 1840, the courthouse in Liberty is the oldest courthouse in Mississippi in continuous use.<ref name=\"Huff Nunnery 2009\" /> Liberty eventually became the county's justice and business center. The county economy was based on timber from [[longleaf pine]] and the cultivation of commodity crops of cotton, [[indigo]], and tobacco, usually on plantations worked by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] African Americans. Given the reliance of planters on labor-intensive crops such as tobacco and cotton, the county soon had a majority population of enslaved African Americans. Even in the antebellum period, the county seat attracted entertainers and lecturers on tour. In the 1850s, Liberty hosted opera singer [[Jenny Lind]], known as the \"Swedish Nightingale,\" at the Walsh building.\n\nIn 1861, the state legislature called a convention to vote on [[secession]] from the United States. David Hurst, the delegate from Amite County, voted against secession, but the majority of the state's delegates voted for it.<ref name=\"Huff Nunnery 2009\" /> Led by South Carolina, the largest slave-owning states were the first in the South to secede. Mississippi voted to join the [[Confederate States of America]]. During the Civil War, Captain [[George H. Tichenor]] married Margaret Anne Drane at the Liberty Baptist Church; Tichenor developed an antiseptic to treat wounds suffered by soldiers in the war.<ref name=\"Huff Nunnery 2009\" /> By the end of the war, 279 men from Amite County had died for the Confederate cause. Amite County was not in a theater of war.\n\n[[File:Liberty little red schoolhouse 2018.jpg|left|thumb|Amite Female Seminary, commonly known as the \"Little Red Schoolhouse,\" established in 1853]]\n\nA raiding party of Union [[cavalry]], under the command of [[Colonel Benjamin Grierson]], is known to have camped in the county nine miles east of [[Liberty, Mississippi|Liberty]] on the evening of April 28, 1863, while conducting a [[Grierson's Raid|deep penetration raid]] as part of the [[Vicksburg Campaign]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grabau|first1=Warren|title=Ninety-Eight Days: A Geographer's View of the Vicksburg Campaign|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee|location=Knoxville|isbn=1-57233-068-6|page=116}}</ref> As part of that raid, Union forces pillages many homes and plantations. Most of the buildings of the Amite Female Seminary, with 13 pianos, were burnt; one building was spared, the small Mary Van Norman Ratcliff Building, commonly known as the \"Little Red Schoolhouse.\"\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, Amite County's population was 60% African American. During Reconstruction, [[freedmen]] elected several African Americans to local office as county sheriff.<ref name=\"MSproj\"/> After Reconstruction, white Democrats regained power in the state legislature through a combination of violent voter repression and fraud. They [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most African Americans and many poor whites in the state by the new 1890 state constitution, which imposed a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]], literacy tests, and other requirements as barriers to voter registration. These were administered by whites in a discriminatory way. Most black voters and many poor whites were dropped from the voter rolls.\n\n===20th century to present===\nRacial violence, including [[lynchings]], escalated during the [[Jim Crow]] years.<ref name=\"MSproj\">[http://mscivilrightsproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=988&Itemid=3043 \"Amite County\"], Mississippi Civil Rights Project.

African Americans were a majority in the state until the 1930s but excluded from voting, they were also excluded from juries and the entire political system.\n\nThe county continued to be based on agriculture, with cotton the basis of the economy into the 1930s. A [[boll weevil]] invasion damaged many cotton crops. Planters shifted to logging and dairy farming in the 1930s, during the Great Depression.\n\nAs agriculture was mechanized, reducing the need for farm labor, many blacks left Amite County during the first half of the 20th century in two waves of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. In the first wave, before World War II, many moved north to Chicago and other industrial cities of the Midwest. In the second wave, they moved to the West Coast, where the burgeoning defense industry created jobs before, during, and after the war. From 1940 to 1960, the county population declined by 29%, as can be seen on the census tables below. Some rural whites also left the county for industrialized cities.\n\nIn the 1950s, local farmer E.W. Steptoe founded a chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) in the county. [[Herbert Lee (activist)|Herbert Lee]], a married farmer with nine children, was among its charter members. They were working to regain constitutional civil rights, including the ability to vote. In the summer of 1961, [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]] from the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] worked in the county to organize African Americans for voter registration. He was beaten by Bill Caston, a cousin to the sheriff, near the county courthouse, and arrested. He was told to leave the county for his own safety.<ref name=\"murder\">[http://mscivilrightsproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:the-murder-of-herbert-lee-and-louis-allen&catid=28:event&Itemid=8 \"Murder of Herbert Lee and Louis Allen\"], Amite County, Mississippi Civil Rights Project. Retrieved March 16, 2014</ref> In the 1960s, only one African American of the total of 5,500 in Amite County was a registered voter. Even after the [[Voting Rights Act]] was passed in 1965, extensive grassroots efforts were required to register eligible voters.<ref name=\"MSproj\"/>\n\nRacial violence against blacks in the county escalated during the years of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. On September 25, 1961, at the [[Westbrook Cotton Gin]], about a dozen witnesses, both white and black, saw [[E.H. Hurst]], a white state legislator, murder Herbert Lee in broad daylight. At the inquest that day, Hurst claimed self-defense and witnesses, intimidated by the armed white men in the courtroom, supported him. Learning that the federal government might hold a grand jury in the case, [[Louis Allen]], an African-American veteran of World War II and witness to Lee's murder, talked to the FBI to try to gain protection if he were to testify truthfully to what he saw. They said they could not help him. Whites suspected he had talked with the FBI and began to harass him.<ref name=\"MSproj\"/>\n\nAllen's business was boycotted by whites, and the veteran was beaten and arrested more than once by the county sheriff. He stayed in the area to help his aging parents, but planned to leave. On January 31, 1964, he was shot and killed on his land. No one was ever prosecuted for Allen's death. Investigations since 1994 suggest that Allen was killed by Daniel (Danny) Jones, the county sheriff and son of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s leader in the county.<ref name=\"cbs60\">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/07/60minutes/main20051850_page2.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody Cold case: \"The murder of Louis Allen\"], ''60&nbsp;Minutes'' (CBS), April 10, 2011</ref> Danny Jones was featured as a likely perpetrator in the Allen case, in a 2011 episode of ''60 Minutes'' focusing on civil rights cold cases, but he denied an interview. He died in 2012 or 2013.\n\nFollowing the repression of the civil rights era and a continuing poor economy, younger African Americans continued to leave the county, seeking jobs in bigger cities. The population declined more than 11 percent from 1960 to 1970, and further declines occurred to 1980 (see census tables below.) Because of the murders of Lee and Allen, voter registration efforts had stopped in the early 1960s. African Americans did not register until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which provided federal protection and oversight. Today the county is majority white in population.\n\nNoted historic sites listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] include the [[Amite County Courthouse]] and the [[Westbrook Cotton Gin]], the only one surviving of seven in the county. In addition, 19th-century plantation houses and the [[Liberty Presbyterian Church|Liberty]] and [[Bethany Presbyterian Church|Bethany Presbyterian]] churches are listed on the Register.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|732|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|730|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.5|sqmi}} (0.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=November 2, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n{{div col}}\n* [[File:US 98.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 98]]\n* [[File:Circle sign 24.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 24]]\n* [[File:Circle sign 33.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 33]]\n* [[File:Circle sign 48.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 48]]\n* [[Mississippi Highway 569]]\n* [[Mississippi Highway 570]]\n* [[Mississippi Highway 567]]\n* [[Mississippi Highway 568]]\n* [[Mississippi Highway 571]]\n* [[Mississippi Highway 584]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Franklin County, Mississippi|Franklin County]] (north)\n* [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Lincoln County]] (northeast)\n* [[Pike County, Mississippi|Pike County]] (east)\n* [[Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana]] (southeast)\n* [[St. Helena Parish, Louisiana]] (south)\n* [[East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]] (southwest)\n* [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi|Wilkinson County]] (west)\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Homochitto National Forest]] (part)\n\n===State protected area===\n* [[Ethel Stratton Vance Natural Area]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amitecounty.ms/ethel-stratton-vance-natural-area|title=Ethel Stratton Vance Natural Area|publisher=Amite County, Mississippi|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe [[flora]] of Amite County consists of about 1000 species of [[vascular plants]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alford|first1=Mac|title=The vascular flora of Amite County, Mississippi|journal=Sida, Contributions to Botany|year=2001|volume=19|pages=645\u2013699|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/163357#/summary|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Havran|first1=J.

In the early part of the 20th century, particularly from 1910 to 1930, and from 1940 to 1970, it was affected by the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of blacks out of the segregated society for jobs and opportunities in Midwest and later, West Coast cities. From 1910 to 1920, the population declined more than 17%, as may be seen from the Census table at right. Particularly in the early 20th century, Blacks left to escape the oppression and violence associated with [[Jim Crow]], [[lynchings]], and their [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] after 1890.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1960, the population declined by more than 29%. Rural whites also left in those years, but a much greater number of African Americans migrated to other areas. After 1930 they became a minority in the county. In 2000, they constituted nearly 43% of the population.\n\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 13,131 people living in the county. 57.7% were [[White American|White]], 41.3% [[African American|Black or African American]], 0.2% Native American, 0.1% [[Asian American|Asian]], 0.2% of some other race and 0.6% [[Multiracial American|of two or more races]]. 0.8% were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] (of any race).\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 February 2020 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=31 January 2008 |title=American FactFinder }}</ref> of 2000, there were 13,599 people, 5,271 households, and 3,879 families living in the county.

The average household size was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.06.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 26.00% under the age of 18, 8.50% from 18 to 24, 25.60% from 25 to 44, 24.60% from 45 to 64, and 15.30% who were 65&nbsp;years of age or older. The median age was 38&nbsp;years. For every 100 females, there were 93.30 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.80 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $26,033, and the median income for a family was $31,256. Males had a median income of $28,306 versus $16,173 for females. The per capita income for the county was $14,048. About 19.30% of families and 22.60% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.70% of those under age 18 and 22.20% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Communities==\n\n===Towns===\n* [[Centreville, Mississippi|Centreville]] (mostly in Wilkinson County)\n* [[Crosby, Mississippi|Crosby]] (partly in Wilkinson County)\n* [[Gloster, Mississippi|Gloster]]\n* [[Liberty, Mississippi|Liberty]] (county seat)\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n* [[Bewelcome, Mississippi|Bewelcome]]\n* [[Coles, Mississippi|Coles]]\n* [[Gillsburg, Mississippi|Gillsburg]]\n* [[Homochitto, Mississippi|Homochitto]]\n* [[Hustler, Mississippi|Hustler]]\n* [[Smithdale, Mississippi|Smithdale]]\n\n===Ghost town===\n* [[Elysian Fields, Mississippi|Elysian Fields]]\n\n==Politics==\nPolitical affiliation and voting patterns in federal elections generally follow those of other traditional southern states, where strong affiliation of conservative whites to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] dominated during the period up to and just beyond the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s. With the rise of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], the white population gradually began to support Republican national candidates, and ultimately shifted into the party. Given the support of the national Democratic Party leaders through the civil rights years, African-American voters affiliated with that party.\n\nIn several elections between World War II and the Civil Rights period, in a period of increasing social change, the white people of Amite County (who were the only ones able to vote in that period) voted for third party candidates, including [[Dixiecrat]] candidate [[Strom Thurmond]] in 1948 (after Democrat President [[Harry S.

It was named after the [[Amite River]]. French explorers had named the latter for the friendly (''amiti\u00e9'' in French) indigenous [[Houma people]] they encountered in the region.<ref name=\"Huff Nunnery 2009\">{{cite book|last1=Huff|first1=Robert Glen|last2=Nunnery|first2=Hattie Pearl|title=Amite County & Liberty, Mississippi: Celebrating 200 Years|date=2009|publisher=Donning Co.|location=Virginia Beach, VA|isbn=978-1-57864-547-3}}</ref>\n\nThe legislation that established the county authorized the appointment of five commissioners to find a site for the county seat, near the county's center and near a good spring; its name was to be Liberty. At this time, the total population of the county numbered about 4000 people, about 80% of whom were middle-class families of seventeenth-century Virginia stock who had gradually migrated through other frontier states. Primary religious groups were all Protestant, including [[Baptists]], [[Presbyterians]], and [[Methodists]].\n\nCompleted in 1840, the courthouse in Liberty is the oldest courthouse in Mississippi in continuous use.<ref name=\"Huff Nunnery 2009\" /> Liberty eventually became the county's justice and business center. The county economy was based on timber from [[longleaf pine]] and the cultivation of commodity crops of cotton, [[indigo]], and tobacco, usually on plantations worked by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] African Americans. Given the reliance of planters on labor-intensive crops such as tobacco and cotton, the county soon had a majority population of enslaved African Americans. Even in the antebellum period, the county seat attracted entertainers and lecturers on tour. In the 1850s, Liberty hosted opera singer [[Jenny Lind]], known as the \"Swedish Nightingale,\" at the Walsh building.\n\nIn 1861, the state legislature called a convention to vote on [[secession]] from the United States. David Hurst, the delegate from Amite County, voted against secession, but the majority of the state's delegates voted for it.<ref name=\"Huff Nunnery 2009\" /> Led by South Carolina, the largest slave-owning states were the first in the South to secede. Mississippi voted to join the [[Confederate States of America]]. During the Civil War, Captain [[George H. Tichenor]] married Margaret Anne Drane at the Liberty Baptist Church; Tichenor developed an antiseptic to treat wounds suffered by soldiers in the war.<ref name=\"Huff Nunnery 2009\" /> By the end of the war, 279 men from Amite County had died for the Confederate cause. Amite County was not in a theater of war.\n\n[[File:Liberty little red schoolhouse 2018.jpg|left|thumb|Amite Female Seminary, commonly known as the \"Little Red Schoolhouse,\" established in 1853]]\n\nA raiding party of Union [[cavalry]], under the command of [[Colonel Benjamin Grierson]], is known to have camped in the county nine miles east of [[Liberty, Mississippi|Liberty]] on the evening of April 28, 1863, while conducting a [[Grierson's Raid|deep penetration raid]] as part of the [[Vicksburg Campaign]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grabau|first1=Warren|title=Ninety-Eight Days: A Geographer's View of the Vicksburg Campaign|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee|location=Knoxville|isbn=1-57233-068-6|page=116}}</ref> As part of that raid, Union forces pillages many homes and plantations. Most of the buildings of the Amite Female Seminary, with 13 pianos, were burnt; one building was spared, the small Mary Van Norman Ratcliff Building, commonly known as the \"Little Red Schoolhouse.\"\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, Amite County's population was 60% African American. During Reconstruction, [[freedmen]] elected several African Americans to local office as county sheriff.<ref name=\"MSproj\"/> After Reconstruction, white Democrats regained power in the state legislature through a combination of violent voter repression and fraud. They [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most African Americans and many poor whites in the state by the new 1890 state constitution, which imposed a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]], literacy tests, and other requirements as barriers to voter registration. These were administered by whites in a discriminatory way. Most black voters and many poor whites were dropped from the voter rolls.\n\n===20th century to present===\nRacial violence, including [[lynchings]], escalated during the [[Jim Crow]] years.<ref name=\"MSproj\">[http://mscivilrightsproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=988&Itemid=3043 \"Amite County\"], Mississippi Civil Rights Project.

African Americans were a majority in the state until the 1930s but excluded from voting, they were also excluded from juries and the entire political system.\n\nThe county continued to be based on agriculture, with cotton the basis of the economy into the 1930s. A [[boll weevil]] invasion damaged many cotton crops. Planters shifted to logging and dairy farming in the 1930s, during the Great Depression.\n\nAs agriculture was mechanized, reducing the need for farm labor, many blacks left Amite County during the first half of the 20th century in two waves of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. In the first wave, before World War II, many moved north to Chicago and other industrial cities of the Midwest. In the second wave, they moved to the West Coast, where the burgeoning defense industry created jobs before, during, and after the war. From 1940 to 1960, the county population declined by 29%, as can be seen on the census tables below. Some rural whites also left the county for industrialized cities.\n\nIn the 1950s, local farmer E.W. Steptoe founded a chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) in the county. [[Herbert Lee (activist)|Herbert Lee]], a married farmer with nine children, was among its charter members. They were working to regain constitutional civil rights, including the ability to vote. In the summer of 1961, [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]] from the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] worked in the county to organize African Americans for voter registration. He was beaten by Bill Caston, a cousin to the sheriff, near the county courthouse, and arrested. He was told to leave the county for his own safety.<ref name=\"murder\">[http://mscivilrightsproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:the-murder-of-herbert-lee-and-louis-allen&catid=28:event&Itemid=8 \"Murder of Herbert Lee and Louis Allen\"], Amite County, Mississippi Civil Rights Project. Retrieved March 16, 2014</ref> In the 1960s, only one African American of the total of 5,500 in Amite County was a registered voter. Even after the [[Voting Rights Act]] was passed in 1965, extensive grassroots efforts were required to register eligible voters.<ref name=\"MSproj\"/>\n\nRacial violence against blacks in the county escalated during the years of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. On September 25, 1961, at the [[Westbrook Cotton Gin]], about a dozen witnesses, both white and black, saw [[E.H. Hurst]], a white state legislator, murder Herbert Lee in broad daylight. At the inquest that day, Hurst claimed self-defense and witnesses, intimidated by the armed white men in the courtroom, supported him. Learning that the federal government might hold a grand jury in the case, [[Louis Allen]], an African-American veteran of World War II and witness to Lee's murder, talked to the FBI to try to gain protection if he were to testify truthfully to what he saw. They said they could not help him. Whites suspected he had talked with the FBI and began to harass him.<ref name=\"MSproj\"/>\n\nAllen's business was boycotted by whites, and the veteran was beaten and arrested more than once by the county sheriff. He stayed in the area to help his aging parents, but planned to leave. On January 31, 1964, he was shot and killed on his land. No one was ever prosecuted for Allen's death. Investigations since 1994 suggest that Allen was killed by Daniel (Danny) Jones, the county sheriff and son of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s leader in the county.<ref name=\"cbs60\">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/07/60minutes/main20051850_page2.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody Cold case: \"The murder of Louis Allen\"], ''60&nbsp;Minutes'' (CBS), April 10, 2011</ref> Danny Jones was featured as a likely perpetrator in the Allen case, in a 2011 episode of ''60 Minutes'' focusing on civil rights cold cases, but he denied an interview. He died in 2012 or 2013.\n\nFollowing the repression of the civil rights era and a continuing poor economy, younger African Americans continued to leave the county, seeking jobs in bigger cities. The population declined more than 11 percent from 1960 to 1970, and further declines occurred to 1980 (see census tables below.) Because of the murders of Lee and Allen, voter registration efforts had stopped in the early 1960s. African Americans did not register until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which provided federal protection and oversight. Today the county is majority white in population.\n\nNoted historic sites listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] include the [[Amite County Courthouse]] and the [[Westbrook Cotton Gin]], the only one surviving of seven in the county.

In the early part of the 20th century, particularly from 1910 to 1930, and from 1940 to 1970, it was affected by the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of blacks out of the segregated society for jobs and opportunities in Midwest and later, West Coast cities. From 1910 to 1920, the population declined more than 17%, as may be seen from the Census table at right. Particularly in the early 20th century, Blacks left to escape the oppression and violence associated with [[Jim Crow]], [[lynchings]], and their [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] after 1890.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1960, the population declined by more than 29%. Rural whites also left in those years, but a much greater number of African Americans migrated to other areas. After 1930 they became a minority in the county. In 2000, they constituted nearly 43% of the population.\n\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 13,131 people living in the county. 57.7% were [[White American|White]], 41.3% [[African American|Black or African American]], 0.2% Native American, 0.1% [[Asian American|Asian]], 0.2% of some other race and 0.6% [[Multiracial American|of two or more races]]. 0.8% were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] (of any race).\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 February 2020 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=31 January 2008 |title=American FactFinder }}</ref> of 2000, there were 13,599 people, 5,271 households, and 3,879 families living in the county. The population density was 19 people per square mile (7/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 6,446 housing units at an average density of 9 per square&nbsp;mile (3/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the county was 56.42% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 42.65% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.13% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 0.08% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.01% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.21% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.49% from two or more races. 0.83% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 5,271 households out of which 31.20% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.10% were married couples living together, 16.30% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.40% were non-families. 24.50% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.00% had someone living alone who was 65&nbsp;years of age or older. The average household size was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.06.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 26.00% under the age of 18, 8.50% from 18 to 24, 25.60% from 25 to 44, 24.60% from 45 to 64, and 15.30% who were 65&nbsp;years of age or older. The median age was 38&nbsp;years. For every 100 females, there were 93.30 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.80 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $26,033, and the median income for a family was $31,256. Males had a median income of $28,306 versus $16,173 for females. The per capita income for the county was $14,048. About 19.30% of families and 22.60% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.70% of those under age 18 and 22.20% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Communities==\n\n===Towns===\n*[[Centreville, Mississippi|Centreville]] (mostly in Wilkinson County)\n*[[Crosby, Mississippi|Crosby]] (partly in Wilkinson County)\n*[[Gloster, Mississippi|Gloster]]\n*[[Liberty, Mississippi|Liberty]] (county seat)\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n*[[Bewelcome, Mississippi|Bewelcome]]\n*[[Coles, Mississippi|Coles]]\n*[[Gillsburg, Mississippi|Gillsburg]]\n*[[Homochitto, Mississippi|Homochitto]]\n*[[Hustler, Mississippi|Hustler]]\n*[[Smithdale, Mississippi|Smithdale]]\n\n===Ghost town===\n*[[Elysian Fields, Mississippi|Elysian Fields]]\n\n==Politics==\nPolitical affiliation and voting patterns in federal elections generally follow those of other traditional southern states, where strong affiliation of conservative whites to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] dominated during the period up to and just beyond the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s. With the rise of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], the white population gradually began to support Republican national candidates, and ultimately shifted into the party. Given the support of the national Democratic Party leaders through the civil rights years, African-American voters affiliated with that party.\n\nIn several elections between World War II and the Civil Rights period, in a period of increasing social change, the white people of Amite County (who were the only ones able to vote in that period) voted for third party candidates, including [[Dixiecrat]] candidate [[Strom Thurmond]] in 1948 (after Democrat President [[Harry S. Truman]] had taken action that year to integrate the military), [[Harry F. Byrd]] in 1960, and segregationist [[George Wallace]] in 1968.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

It has a gangway through the centre to allow passengers to pass between the two parts of the train.\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe FLIRT is a new generation of multiple units, even though it has a striking resemblance with [[Stadler GTW|GTW]] vehicles. The trains can have two to six sections and electric variants are available for all commonly used power supply systems (AC and DC) as well as [[Standard gauge|standard]] and [[Russian gauge|broad gauge]]. It has [[jacobs bogie]]s shared between the individual coaches, with wide walk-through gangways. The floor height at the entrances can be chosen by the operator, providing level boarding at most stations. [[Railway coupling#Multi-Function Couplers|Automatic couplers]] of either Schwab type (on all Swiss units) or [[Scharfenberg coupler|Scharfenberg type]] at both ends of the train allow up to four trains to be connected.\n\nAll FLIRT variations use [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT-based traction converters]] from [[ABB Group|ABB]], which drive the [[induction motor]]s located in the two bogies at either end of the train. On the two-section trains, only one bogie is powered, while on longer versions it is possible to have a third powered bogie in the middle, found on the trains for [[Vy (transport operator)|Vy]] in Norway and for [[PKP Intercity]] in Poland. Each bogie usually has a continuous power rating of {{convert|1000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} giving a typical four-section train {{convert|2000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} total power output as well as maximum power output of {{convert|2600|kW|hp|abbr=on}} over a short time. Depending on the number of powered bogies, the length and weight, they will reach top speeds between {{convert|120|and|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} (typically {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Acceleration also varies between {{convert|0.8|and|1.2|m/s2|ft/s2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe diesel version is essentially an electric version with a diesel power module inserted, generating electricity for the electric motors.

Stadler eventually leased space from the [[Utah Transit Authority]] in their former Union Pacific shops in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah.\n\nPublic unveiling events for the completed American built FLIRT units occurred in both [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on October 9, 2017; and Salt Lake City on the [[Salt Lake, Garfield and Western Railway]] on October 13, 2017 as Stadler broke ground for their permanent Salt Lake facility. <ref>{{cite web|title=TEX Rail orders Stadler Flirt DMUs |website=Railway Gazette|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/tex-rail-orders-stadler-flirt-dmus.html|date=2015-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.stadlerrail.com/en/news/2015/06/10/stadler-rail-wins-100-million-dollar-contract-in-t/| title=Stadler Rail wins 100-million-dollar contract in Texas| website=Stadler Rail| date=2015-06-10| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621185402/http://www.stadlerrail.com/en/news/2015/06/10/stadler-rail-wins-100-million-dollar-contract-in-t/| archivedate=21 June 2015| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dickson|first1=Gordon|title=Fort Worth authority signs deal for TEX Rail cars|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/news/traffic/your-commute/article23613976.html|work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|date=2015-06-09}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/business/2017/10/13/stadler-breaks-ground-on-railcar-manufacturing-plant-expected-to-employ-1000-in-west-salt-lake-city/|title=Stadler breaks ground on railcar manufacturing plant expected to employ 1,000 in west Salt Lake City|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThree 2-car FLIRT sets are being built for [[Arrow (commuter rail)|Arrow]] service in [[Redlands, California]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Technical Proposal|url=http://www.gosbcta.com/plans-projects/projects/arrow/16-1001531-ExhibitA.pdf|website=San Bernardino County Transportation Authority|publisher=Stadler|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref> set to begin operations in 2022.<ref name=\"RDF\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/construction-begins-for-rail-connecting-redlands-to-san-bernardino|title=Construction begins for rail connecting Redlands to San Bernardino|work=Redlands Daily Facts|date=July 19, 2019}}</ref> The $31.4 million contract includes the vehicles themselves, spare parts, and training for servicing and operation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Emerson|first1=Sandra|title=Redlands takes next step in bringing passenger rail service to city|url=http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/general-news/20170728/redlands-takes-next-step-in-bringing-passenger-rail-service-to-city|accessdate=31 July 2017|agency=Redlands Daily Facts|date=28 July 2017}}</ref> In November 2019, the [[San Bernardino County Transit Authority]] ordered an additional FLIRT powered via [[hydrogen fuel cell]], the first such train in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stadler to deliver hydrogen-powered train to SBCTA |url=https://www.railway-technology.com/news/stadler-deliver-hydrogen-powered-train-sbcta/ |accessdate=24 November 2019 |agency=Railway Age |date=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nEight 4-car sets are to enter service with [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] on the [[Silver Line (Dallas Area Rapid Transit)|Silver Line]] when it opens in 2022.<ref>[https://www.metro-magazine.com/rail/news/734353/stadler-secures-contract-for-eight-flirt-for-texas Stadler secures contract to build 8 Flirt trains for Texas] ''[[Metro Magazine|Metro]]'' 3 June 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.metro-report.com/news/suburban-commuter/single-view/view/cotton-belt-railway-dmu-order-placed-1.html Cotton Belt railway DMU order placed] ''[[Metro Report International]]'' 3 June 2019</ref>\n\n==Canceled contracts==\n===Latvia===\nOn 1 July 2014 Latvian rail operator [[Pasa\u017eieru vilciens]] announced that it would acquire FLIRT trains as part of a hire/purchase contract,<ref>[http://www.pv.lv/images/userfiles/presei/jauno_vilcienu_rezultati.docx] {{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> however Pv owner [[Latvian Railways]] ultimately withdrew the contract and no procurement went ahead.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 15 February 2012, a FLIRT unit used for tests and driver education, without passengers, derailed near [[Holmestrand]] in [[Norway]], injuring five people.

passenger [[multiple unit]] trainset made by [[Stadler Rail]] of Switzerland. The baseline design of FLIRT is an electric multiple unit [[Articulated car|articulated trainset]] that can come in units of two to twelve cars with two to six motorized axles.

It has a gangway through the centre to allow passengers to pass between the two parts of the train.\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe FLIRT is a new generation of multiple units, even though it has a striking resemblance with [[Stadler GTW|GTW]] vehicles. The trains can have two to six sections and electric variants are available for all commonly used power supply systems (AC and DC) as well as [[Standard gauge|standard]] and [[Russian gauge|broad gauge]]. It has [[jacobs bogie]]s shared between the individual coaches, with wide walk-through gangways. The floor height at the entrances can be chosen by the operator, providing level boarding at most stations. [[Railway coupling#Multi-Function Couplers|Automatic couplers]] of either Schwab type (on all Swiss units) or [[Scharfenberg coupler|Scharfenberg type]] at both ends of the train allow up to four trains to be connected.\n\nAll FLIRT variations use [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT-based traction converters]] from [[ABB Group|ABB]], which drive the [[induction motor]]s located in the two bogies at either end of the train. On the two-section trains, only one bogie is powered, while on longer versions it is possible to have a third powered bogie in the middle, found on the trains for [[Vy (transport operator)|Vy]] in Norway and for [[PKP Intercity]] in Poland. Each bogie usually has a continuous power rating of {{convert|1000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} giving a typical four-section train {{convert|2000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} total power output as well as maximum power output of {{convert|2600|kW|hp|abbr=on}} over a short time. Depending on the number of powered bogies, the length and weight, they will reach top speeds between {{convert|120|and|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} (typically {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Acceleration also varies between {{convert|0.8|and|1.2|m/s2|ft/s2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe diesel version is essentially an electric version with a diesel power module inserted, generating electricity for the electric motors. In [[TEXRail]] application, the diesel power module contains two 520&nbsp;kW  [[Deutz AG]] TCD 16.0 V8 that complies with [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] Tier 4 emission standard.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/stadler-unveils-tex-rail-flirt-dmu.html|title=Stadler unveils TEX Rail Flirt DMU|date=2017-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n===Algeria===\nOn 18 March 2006, the Algerian operator [[SNTF]] announced that it had ordered 64 four-car EMUs for suburban services in [[Algiers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-alger-contract.html|title=Stadler wins Alger contract|date=1 May 2006|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref> The trains were delivered between 2008\u201310.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/first-flirt-to-algeria.html|title=First Flirt to Algeria|date=8 January 2008|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref>\n\n===Azerbaijan===\nIn November 2019, it was announced that [[Azerbaijan Railways|Az\u0259rbaycan D\u0259mir Yollar\u0131 (Azerbaijan Railways)]] had placed a \u20ac115 million order for ten [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|Russian gauge]] Stadler FLIRT units in various configurations, for delivery to start taking place in 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://railcolornews.com/2019/11/27/az-broad-gauge-network-broad-gauge-flirts-for-azerbaijan/|title=Broad-gauge network FLIRTs for Azerbaijan|date=27 November 2019|work=Railcolor News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/azerbaijan-brings-stadlers-cutting-edge-trains-to-caspian-2019-11-27-34/|title=Azerbaijan Brings Stadler\u2019s Cutting-Edge Trains to Caspian|date=27 November 2019|work=Caspian News}}</ref>\n\nThe order specification is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/es/media/article/stadler-sells-its-flirt-to-azerbaijan-for-the-first-time/657/|title=Stadler sells its FLIRT to Azerbaijan for the first time|date=27 November 2019|work=Stadler Rail AG}}</ref>\n* 3x [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]] for suburban trains\n* 3x EMU for regional trains\n* 4x [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] for regional trains\nTrain length is to range between 93 metres and 107 metres, with capacity varying from 236 to 271 passengers.\n\nBecause the Azerbaijan Railway is currently converting the [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] voltage of many lines on its network from [[List of railway electrification systems#3 kV DC|3kV DC]] to [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25kV AC]], the diesel fleet will be introduced first, allowing the service to be upheld during this conversion process.\n\n===Belarus===\nTen [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|Russian gauge]] units were delivered to the [[Belarusian Railways]]<ref>[http://www.stadlerrail.com/medien/2010/03/19/stadler-gewinnt-in-weissrussland/ Stadler wins in Belarus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125641/http://www.stadlerrail.com/medien/2010/03/19/stadler-gewinnt-in-weissrussland/ |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> in 2011.

Also called a \"Patron Saint of America\", Tamenend represented peace and amity. A Tammany society founded in Philadelphia holds an annual Tammany festival. Tammany societies were established across the United States after the [[American Revolutionary War]], and Tammany assumed mythic status as an icon for the peaceful politics of negotiation.\n\n==Life and legend==\n\nTamanend reputedly took part in a meeting between the leaders of the Lenni-Lenape nation, and the leaders of the Pennsylvania colony held under a large elm tree at [[Shackamaxon|Shakamaxon]] in the early 1680s. William Penn and Tamanend continued to sign seven more documents assuring each other, and their peoples, of peaceable understanding after the initial one in 1683. Tamanend is recorded as having said that the Lenni-Lenape and the English colonists would \"live in peace as long as the waters run in the rivers and creeks and as long as the stars and moon endure.\" These words have been memorialized on the statue of Tamanend that still stands in Philadelphia. \nIt is believed that Tamanend died in 1701. Over the next century, many folk legends surrounded Tamanend, and his fame assumed mythical proportions among the people of Philadelphia, who began to call him \"King Tammany,\" \"Saint Tammany,\" and the \"Patron Saint of America.\" The people of Philadelphia organized a Tammany society and an annual Tammany festival. These traditions soon spread across America. Tammany's popular status was partly due to the desire by colonists to express a distinct \"American\" identity, in place of their former European nationalities. Tammany provided an apt symbol for this kind of patriotism.\n\nBecause of Philadelphia's prominence during the American Revolution and subsequent decades, Tammany soon became a national symbol throughout much of the newly formed country.\n\n==Legacy==\n===Tammany Societies===\n{{main|Tammanies}}\n\n[[Image:Tammany Hall LC-USZ62-101734.jpg|thumb|280px|Tammany Hall on East 14th Street in Manhattan featured a white marble statue of Tamanend (located in the arch on top of the building).]]\n\nIn 1772, the original Tammany Society was formed in Philadelphia (it was originally called the \"Sons of King Tammany\" but was later renamed the \"Sons of St. Tammany\"). Soon, Tammany societies were organized in communities from Georgia to Rhode Island, and west to the Ohio River. The most famous of these was New York City's Society of St. Tammany, whose members developed an influential [[political machine]] known as \"[[Tammany Hall]].\" A white marble statue of Tamanend adorned the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the building on East 14th Street that housed Tammany Hall.\n\n===Tammany Festivals===\nBy the early 1770s, annual Tammany Festivals were being held in Philadelphia and Annapolis. The festivals were held on May 1, replacing the [[May Day]] traditions of Europe but continuing popular folk traditions. For example, the Saint Tammany Day celebrated on May 1, 1771, in Annapolis had a [[may pole]] decorated with ribbons. People danced in American Indian style to music while holding a ribbon and moving in a circle around the pole.\n\nOn May 1, 1777, [[John Adams]] wrote of the Tammany festival in Philadelphia during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Adams, who was in Philadelphia attending the [[Second Continental Congress]] as a delegate from Massachusetts, wrote a letter home to his wife [[Abigail Adams]], which said:\n\n<blockquote>This is King Tammany's Day. Tammany was an Indian King, of this part of the Continent, when Mr. Penn first came here. His court was in this town. He was friendly to Mr. Penn and very serviceable to him. He lived here among the first settlers for some time and until old age. ... The people here have sainted him and keep his day.<ref>Lyman H. Butterfield, ed., ''Adams Family Correspondence;'' Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963-1973, II, pp.&nbsp;229\u2013230.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn May 1, 1778, General [[George Washington]] and the [[Continental Army]] held a Tammany festival while camped at [[Valley Forge]]. The \"men spent the day in mirth and jollity...in honor of King Tammany\" (''Military Journal of George Ewing,'' 1928).\n\nAfter the end of the Revolutionary War, Tammany celebrations spread throughout the United States, including to [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Local societies promoted annual festivals, usually held on May 1. Tammany celebrations were such important events that, in 1785, George Washington appeared at the Tammany festival in Richmond, Virginia with Virginia governor [[Patrick Henry]]. The Tammany Society in New York City held its first festival in 1787.\n\n'''Developments since 2003'''<br>\nIn 2003, two identical [[concurrent resolution]]s were introduced in the [[United States Congress]] (Senate Concurrent Resolution 39 and House Concurrent Resolution 123) that sought to establish \"St. Tammany Day\" on May 1 as a [[Public holidays of the United States|national day of recognition]].

It featured the first major opera [[libretto]] written in the United States that had an American theme, and it was the earliest drama about ethnic Americans. The opera  premiered at the John Street Theatre, New York, on March 3, 1794, featuring English actress and 'grande dame' of American theatre, [[Charlotte Melmoth]]. Melmoth refused to speak the opera's epilogue, as she disapproved of its patriotic sentiments.

The novel was part of his ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'', a series of works that explored the colonial past, with strong influence on American literary culture and the emerging nation's identity.
