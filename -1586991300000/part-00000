The fabric may be hung as two pieces, or a single piece, folded to make a loop, classified as hammock silks. Performers climb the suspended fabric without the use of safety lines and rely only on their training and skill to ensure safety. They use the fabric to wrap, suspend, drop, swing, and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions. Aerial silks may be used to fly through the air, striking poses and figures while flying.  Some performers use dried or spray [[rosin]] on their hands and feet to increase the [[friction]] and grip on the fabric.\n\n== Tricks ==\n[[File:Aerial Silk performance.jpg|thumb|Aerial silk trick]]\nThe three main categories of tricks are climbs, wraps, and drops. Climbs employed by aerialists range from purely practical and efficient, such as the Russian climb, to athletic and elegant tricks of their own, such as the straddle climb. Wraps are static poses where aerialists wrap the silks around one or more parts of their body. In general, the more complicated the wrap, the stronger the force of friction and the less effort required to hold oneself up. Some wraps, such as the straddle-back-balance, actually allow performers to completely release their hands. Foot locks are a sub-category of wraps where the silks are wrapped around one or both feet, for instance, an ankle hang. In a drop, performers wrap themselves up high on the silks before falling to a lower position. Drops can combine aspects of [[free fall]], rolling or otherwise rotating oneself before landing in a new pose. Preparation for a drop can make for a pretty wrap, but the ultimate goal is the fall rather than the pose. Of the three trick types, drops require the most strength and are also the most potentially dangerous. Rosin (dry or mixed with rubbing alcohol) is employed to help performers maintain their grip.  Aerial silks are a demanding art and require a high degree of strength, power, flexibility, courage, stamina, and grace to practice.\n[[File:Aerial Silks Duet.jpg|thumb|Aerial silk duet]]\n\n==Fabrics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}The fabrics used as silks are very strong with some give and flexibility.

A basic daisy chain tops out at around 4kN (1,000 lbs) on each loop, and end to end is around 22kN (5,000 lbs). <ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754337117705478</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rope climbing]]\n*[[Aerial hoop]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140131140047/http://www.fedec.eu/resources.1637.html ''Basic Circus Arts Instruction Manual'']: Chapter 2 - \"Static Trapeze, Rope and Silks.\" &#91;PDF, 6.2 MB&#93; and Chapter 8 - \"Manual for Safety and Rigging.\" [PDF, 3.3 MB] European Federation of Professional Circus Schools (FEDEC), 2008.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716072433/http://aerialrigging.simplycircus.com/Rigging%20Army%20FM5-125%201995.pdf FM 5-125: ''Rigging Techniques, Procedures, and Applications''].

{"title_page": "Advisory speed limit", "text_new": "[[Image:Advisory Curve Speed English 45.svg|thumb|upright|right|A U.S. advisory speed limit sign, warning drivers of a curve ahead.]]\n\nAn '''advisory speed limit''' is a speed recommendation by a governing body, used when it may be non-obvious to the driver that the [[Assured_Clear_Distance_Ahead#Safe_speed | safe speed]] is below the [[speed limit | legal speed]]. It is a posting which either approximates the [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#ACDA Rule specific case generalized to the Basic Speed Law | Basic Speed Law or rule]] (and is subject to enforcement as such) or is based on a maximum g-force exerted at a specific speed.

Childhood pain that has remained relatively dormant for decades can be re-stimulated or \"triggered\" by the dynamics of intimacy. \"Just as a car backfiring triggers a soldier into unconscious memories of gunfire, when the ACoA grows up and enters the intimate relationships of partnering and parenting, the very vulnerability, dependency and closeness of those relationships can trigger unhealed and unconscious pain from childhood.\" \n\nDuring the 1990s, the organization went through rapid growth. In 1989, there were 1,300 ACA meetings and by 2003 there were an estimated 40,000 members of ACA.<ref>\"The ACOA marketplace\" (Lily Collet: The pseudonym of a Mill Valley, California writer whose work has been published in the New Yorker,\nMother Jones, The Washington Post, and elsewhere), The Family Therapy Networker (Editor: Richard Simon, PhD), January/February 1990, p31.</ref><ref>Self-help organizations for alcohol and drug problems: Toward evidence-based practice and policy; [[Keith Humphreys]] et al; Journal of substance abuse treatment 26 (2004);</ref> In 2014, there were 1,300 groups worldwide, about 780 of these in the USA. \n\nACA is more of a therapeutic program which emphasizes taking care of the self and re-parenting one's own wounded inner child with love.

ACA membership has few formal requirements. ACA does not receive any outside economic contributions and is supported by donations from its members. The organization is not related to any particular religion and has no political affiliation.\n\n==History and growth==\nACA/ACOA was originally named \"Post Teen\" in Mineola, Long Island in 1973.  [[Tony A.]] was among its founders. This twelve-step program is incorporated as Adult Children of Alcoholics/Dysfunctional Families. The ACA framework is based on the 12 steps and 12 traditions of AA.<ref name=\"responsesidetherapy.com\">[http://responsesidetherapy.com/pdf/ACA_Support_Groups.pdf Adult Children of Alcoholics Support Groups: A valuable adjunct in treating clients]; Martin R.

Woititz, a best-selling author, lecturer and counselor to the troubled offspring of alcoholics, died last Thursday at her home in Roseland, N.J. She was 55.\"</ref>\n\nThe term ACoA was also extended to include PTSD by Tian Dayton PhD, specifically in her book ''The ACoA Trauma Syndrome.''In it she describes how pain from childhood emerges and gets played out in adulthood, for the ACoA, as a post traumatic stress reaction. Childhood pain that has remained relatively dormant for decades can be re-stimulated or \"triggered\" by the dynamics of intimacy. \"Just as a car backfiring triggers a soldier into unconscious memories of gunfire, when the ACoA grows up and enters the intimate relationships of partnering and parenting, the very vulnerability, dependency and closeness of those relationships can trigger unhealed and unconscious pain from childhood.\" \n\nDuring the 1990s, the organization went through rapid growth. In 1989, there were 1,300 ACA meetings and by 2003 there were an estimated 40,000 members of ACA.<ref>\"The ACOA marketplace\" (Lily Collet: The pseudonym of a Mill Valley, California writer whose work has been published in the New Yorker,\nMother Jones, The Washington Post, and elsewhere), The Family Therapy Networker (Editor: Richard Simon, PhD), January/February 1990, p31.</ref><ref>Self-help organizations for alcohol and drug problems: Toward evidence-based practice and policy; [[Keith Humphreys]] et al; Journal of substance abuse treatment 26 (2004);</ref> In 2014, there were 1,300 groups worldwide, about 780 of these in the USA. \n\nACA is more of a therapeutic program which emphasizes taking care of the self and re-parenting one's own wounded inner child with love. It aims to build oneself up, assumes personal responsibility by unequivocally standing up for one's right to a healthy life and actively works on the changes necessary to achieving it. The collective stance is not to wallow in \"being a victim\" but to move into the practical application of seeing family dysfunction as a generational affliction and a pattern that can be healed. \n\nThrough fellowship and the support of ACA's sponsors and peers, as well as the literature, members come to learn that even the most wounded of them has an inner child worthy of love and healing.

Victoria's Secret used the show to promote and market its goods in high-profile settings.\n\nThe show is a lavish event with elaborate costumed lingerie, varying music by leading entertainers, and [[Scenic design|set design]] according to the different themes running within the show. The show attracted hundreds of celebrities and entertainers, with special performers and acts every year. Each year, twenty to forty of the world's top [[fashion model]]s we're selected to perform in the fashion show. In a typical year, this included about a half dozen women under contract to the company,<ref name=\"MB\" /> known as [[Victoria's Secret Angels]]; the current Angels include [[Candice Swanepoel]], [[Lais Ribeiro]], [[Elsa Hosk]], [[Jasmine Tookes]], [[Martha Hunt]], [[Sara Sampaio]], [[Romee Strijd]], [[Stella Maxwell]], [[Taylor Hill (model)|Taylor Hill]], [[Josephine Skriver]], [[Barbara Palvin]], [[Alexina Graham]], [[Grace Elizabeth]], and [[Leomie Anderson]].\n\nAmerican [[network television]] broadcasts the show during [[prime time]]. The first few shows in the 1990s were held in the days preceding [[Valentine's Day]] to promote the brand for this holiday due to its romantic theme. They were not aired on national television. In 1999 and 2000, the show was [[webcast]]. Beginning in 2001, the shows were moved ahead of the [[Christmas holiday season]]. Also in 2001, the show made its network television broadcast debut on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], though from 2002 to 2017, it had been broadcast on [[CBS]]; the show moved back to ABC for the 2018 edition. The show has been held at a variety of locations in different cities including [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Cannes]], [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Shanghai]].

The idea to feature wings as part of the collection came in the wake of the immense success of the \"Angels\"-bra line, which was advertised with the models [[Tyra Banks]], [[Helena Christensen]], [[Karen Mulder]], [[Daniela Pestova]], and [[Stephanie Seymour]] wearing wings, and was introduced to the annual show in 1998. The very same models who were featured in the campaigns for the \"Angel\"-bra line, with the exception of [[Chandra North]] filling in the spot for Christensen, walked the runway with Angel wings on. Over the years, the show featured various forms and sizes of wings, such as butterfly, peacock, or devil wings, which have become emblematic of the Victoria's Secret brand. In theory, wings are any ornamental back piece worn by a model on the runway, or any sort of structural appendage resembling traditional wings. Even though the amount of wings have expanded over the years and thus far have taken away the prestige to wear wings, a lot of models still consider it an honor to wear wings.\n\n[[Adriana Lima]] has worn the most wings in the history of the show. With her count of 22 pair of wings, she's closely followed by [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] and [[Candice Swanepoel]], who have  worn 18 pair of wings.\n\n== Critical review ==\nThe early webcasts were criticized for poor connection, and users that could connect were subjected to low video quality.<ref name=\"TMBA\" /> One critic from ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the initial 20th-century webcast experience as having felt like he was \"watching a striptease through a keyhole\".<ref name=\"IRASMbVS\" />\n\nSome critics have described the 21st-century televised editions of the show as pornographic,<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2091491/ | title = These Are a Few of My Favorite Thongs: The Victoria's Secret spectacle on CBS | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 20, 2003 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | author = Stevens, Dana}}</ref><ref name=\"WGPVSS\">{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,70904,00.html | title = Watchdog Groups Protest Victoria's Secret Show | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 20, 2002 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}</ref>  while others have described it as both \"outright commercialism\" and indistinguishable from an [[infomercial]].<ref name=\"VVSoT\" /> The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has received complaints regarding the broadcast, but no fines have been imposed, with the FCC, following the 2001 airing, citing the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and stating that \"sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium\" were not broadcast.<ref>''People'': [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,623699,00.html Sexy Telecast No Problem With FCC.]  March 26, 2002.</ref>  In the initial 2001 airing ABC blurred the screen on particularly sheer lingerie.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" />  This enabled the show to pass muster with its internal Broadcast Standards and Practices department and to achieve a [[TV Parental Guidelines]] rating of TV-14 (a rating maintained for each broadcast presentation over the years), as a TV-MA rating is virtually unmarketable for advertisers on broadcast television.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cultureandfamily.org/articledisplay.asp?id=310&department=CFI&categoryid=cfreport | title = FCC Investigating ABC's 'Victoria's Secret Fashion Show' | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 21, 2001 | author = Kleder, Martha | publisher = [[Concerned Women for America]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728121642/http://www.cultureandfamily.org/articledisplay.asp?id=310&department=CFI&categoryid=cfreport|archive-date=July 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 2002, the [[National Organization for Women]] protested the show calling it a \"soft-core porn infomercial.\"<ref name=\"Slate\"/>   They were joined in protest by the [[Parents Television Council]] and other watchdog organizations.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" /> Despite the program's timeslot and parental ratings, some affiliates have chosen not to air the program, including [[Fisher Communications]]' CBS stations in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]] in the past.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" />  In 2009, the [[American Decency Association]] organized [[email]] letters of protests to sponsors of the show including [[AT&T]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Netflix]], [[Nikon]], and [[Reebok]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americandecency.org/archives/victorias-secret-toning-down-not/#more-2743|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717081121/http://www.americandecency.org/archives/victorias-secret-toning-down-not/#more-2743|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 17, 2011 | title = Victoria's Secret toning down?

more models are chosen to wear the \"Swarovski Outfit\" and the \"Swarovski Wings\" every year. The first Swarovski items that were shown on the runway were given to [[Alessandra Ambrosio]]. [[Victoria's Secret]] had worked with [[Swarovski]] for 9 years prior to the Swarovski items worn on the runway in 2011.<ref>https://www.crystals-from-swarovski.com/editorial/events/15-years-of-victorias-secret-and-swarovski.en.html/</ref>\n\n[[Alessandra Ambrosio]]'s Swarovski outfit, worn in 2011, included a 60-pound wing which was made out of 105,000 Swarovski crystals. The base of her wing was made out of 23-carat gold. [[Cameron Russell]] was given the \"10th Anniversary\" Swarovski outfit, worn in 2012, celebrating Victoria's Secret's 10th year working with Swarovski.\n\nThe 2013 Swarovski outfit was a 3D printed piece given to [[Lindsay Ellingson]], which included mini-micro Swarovski crystals. In 2017, [[Elsa Hosk]] was chosen to wear the 15th Anniversary Swarovski outfit, which came out to a total value of $1,000,000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

sponsored by and featuring [[Victoria's Secret]], a brand of [[lingerie]] and [[sleepwear]]. Victoria's Secret used the show to promote and market its goods in high-profile settings.\n\nThe show is a lavish event with elaborate costumed lingerie, varying music by leading entertainers, and [[Scenic design|set design]] according to the different themes running within the show. The show attracted hundreds of celebrities and entertainers, with special performers and acts every year. Each year, twenty to forty of the world's top [[fashion model]]s we're selected to perform in the fashion show. In a typical year, this included about a half dozen women under contract to the company,<ref name=\"MB\" /> known as [[Victoria's Secret Angels]]; the current Angels include [[Candice Swanepoel]], [[Lais Ribeiro]], [[Elsa Hosk]], [[Jasmine Tookes]], [[Martha Hunt]], [[Sara Sampaio]], [[Romee Strijd]], [[Stella Maxwell]], [[Taylor Hill (model)|Taylor Hill]], [[Josephine Skriver]], [[Barbara Palvin]], [[Alexina Graham]], [[Grace Elizabeth]], and [[Leomie Anderson]].\n\nAmerican [[network television]] broadcasts the show during [[prime time]].

The idea to feature wings as part of the collection came in the wake of the immense success of the \"Angels\"-bra line, which was advertised with the models [[Tyra Banks]], [[Helena Christensen]], [[Karen Mulder]], [[Daniela Pestova]], and [[Stephanie Seymour]] wearing wings, and was introduced to the annual show in 1998. The very same models who were featured in the campaigns for the \"Angel\"-bra line, with the exception of [[Chandra North]] filling in the spot for Christensen, walked the runway with Angel wings on. Over the years, the show featured various forms and sizes of wings, such as butterfly, peacock, or devil wings, which have become emblematic of the Victoria's Secret brand. In theory, wings are any ornamental back piece worn by a model on the runway, or any sort of structural appendage resembling traditional wings. Even though the amount of wings have expanded over the years and thus far have taken away the prestige to wear wings, a lot of models still consider it an honour to wear wings.\n\n[[Adriana Lima]] has worn the most wings in the history of the show. With her count of 22 pair of wings, she's closely followed by [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] and [[Candice Swanepoel]], who have  worn 18 pair of wings.\n\n== Critical review ==\nThe early webcasts were criticized for poor connection, and users that could connect were subjected to low video quality.<ref name=\"TMBA\" /> One critic from ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the initial 20th-century webcast experience as having felt like he was \"watching a striptease through a keyhole\".<ref name=\"IRASMbVS\" />\n\nSome critics have described the 21st-century televised editions of the show as pornographic,<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2091491/ | title = These Are a Few of My Favorite Thongs: The Victoria's Secret spectacle on CBS | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 20, 2003 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | author = Stevens, Dana}}</ref><ref name=\"WGPVSS\">{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,70904,00.html | title = Watchdog Groups Protest Victoria's Secret Show | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 20, 2002 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}</ref>  while others have described it as both \"outright commercialism\" and indistinguishable from an [[infomercial]].<ref name=\"VVSoT\" /> The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has received complaints regarding the broadcast, but no fines have been imposed, with the FCC, following the 2001 airing, citing the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and stating that \"sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium\" were not broadcast.<ref>''People'': [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,623699,00.html Sexy Telecast No Problem With FCC.]  March 26, 2002.</ref>  In the initial 2001 airing ABC blurred the screen on particularly sheer lingerie.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" />  This enabled the show to pass muster with its internal Broadcast Standards and Practices department and to achieve a [[TV Parental Guidelines]] rating of TV-14 (a rating maintained for each broadcast presentation over the years), as a TV-MA rating is virtually unmarketable for advertisers on broadcast television.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cultureandfamily.org/articledisplay.asp?id=310&department=CFI&categoryid=cfreport | title = FCC Investigating ABC's 'Victoria's Secret Fashion Show' | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 21, 2001 | author = Kleder, Martha | publisher = [[Concerned Women for America]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728121642/http://www.cultureandfamily.org/articledisplay.asp?id=310&department=CFI&categoryid=cfreport|archive-date=July 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 2002, the [[National Organization for Women]] protested the show calling it a \"soft-core porn infomercial.\"<ref name=\"Slate\"/>   They were joined in protest by the [[Parents Television Council]] and other watchdog organizations.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" /> Despite the program's timeslot and parental ratings, some affiliates have chosen not to air the program, including [[Fisher Communications]]' CBS stations in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]] in the past.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" />  In 2009, the [[American Decency Association]] organized [[email]] letters of protests to sponsors of the show including [[AT&T]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Netflix]], [[Nikon]], and [[Reebok]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americandecency.org/archives/victorias-secret-toning-down-not/#more-2743|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717081121/http://www.americandecency.org/archives/victorias-secret-toning-down-not/#more-2743|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 17, 2011 | title = Victoria's Secret toning down?

The first Swarovski items that were shown on the runway were given to [[Alessandra Ambrosio]]. [[Victoria's Secret]] had worked with [[Swarovski]] for 9 years prior to the Swarovski items worn on the runway in 2011.<ref>https://www.crystals-from-swarovski.com/editorial/events/15-years-of-victorias-secret-and-swarovski.en.html/</ref>\n\n[[Alessandra Ambrosio]]\u2019s Swarovski outfit, worn in 2011, included a 60-pound wing which was made out of 105,000 Swarovski crystals. The base of her wing was made out of 23-carat gold. [[Cameron Russell]] was given the \"10th Anniversary\" Swarovski outfit, worn in 2012, celebrating Victoria's Secret's 10th year working with Swarovski.\n\nThe 2013 Swarovski outfit was a 3D printed piece given to [[Lindsay Ellingson]], which included mini-micro Swarovski crystals. In 2017, [[Elsa Hosk]] was chosen to wear the 15th Anniversary Swarovski outfit, which came out to a total value of $1,000,000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!
