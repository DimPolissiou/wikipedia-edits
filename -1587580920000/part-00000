The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This [[alluvium]] builds up to form the river delta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/tfd-modeling/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack \u2013 Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics:: TFD Modeling|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref> When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its [[stream channel|channel]] and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to [[sediment transport|transport sediment]]. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and [[deposition (geology)|deposits]]. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the [[gradient]] of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see [[slope]]).\n\nAs the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, gravity makes the water flow in the most direct course downslope. If the river breaches its natural levees (i.e., during a flood), it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope.<ref name=\"SlingerlandSmith\">Slingerland, R. and N. D. Smith (1998), \"Necessary conditions for a meandering-river avulsion,\" ''Geology'' (Boulder), 26, 435\u2013438.</ref> Second, as its slope gets lower, the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases, which results in the deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This makes it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the body of standing water at a steeper slope. Often when the channel does this, some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel. When these channel-switching events occur, a mature delta develops a [[distributary]] network.\n\nAnother way these distributary networks form is from the deposition of [[mouth bars]] (mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river). When this mid-channel bar is deposited at the mouth of a river, the flow is routed around it. This results in additional deposition on the upstream end of the mouth-bar, which splits the river into two distributary channels. A good example of the result of this process is the [[Wax Lake Delta]].\n\nIn both of these cases, depositional processes force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan, because more rapid changes in channel position resultsf in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird's-feet, are examples of rivers that do not [[Avulsion (river)|avulse]] often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape. [[Alluvial fan]] deltas, as seen by their name, avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal fan shape.\n\nMost large river deltas discharge to intra-cratonic basins on the trailing edges of passive margins due to the majority of large rivers such as the Mississippi, Nile, Amazon, Ganges, Indus, and Yangtze discharging along passive continental margins.<ref name=Milliman>{{cite journal |last1=Milliman |first1=J.

Topography along active margins tend to be steeper and less widespread, which results in sediments not having the ability to pile up and accumulate due to the sediment traveling into a steep subduction trench rather than a shallow continental shelf.\n\nThere are many other smaller factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins. Along active margins, orogenic sequences cause tectonic activity to form over-steepened slopes, brecciated rocks, and volcanic activity resulting in delta formation to exist closer to the sediment source.<ref name=Milliman/><ref name=Goodbred>{{cite journal |last1=Goodbred |first1=S.

Notable examples include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Tagus]] estuary.\n\n=== Inland deltas ===\n[[File:OkavangoDelta.png|thumb|right|Okavango Delta]]In rare cases the river delta is located inside a large valley and is called an [[inverted river delta]]. Sometimes a river divides into multiple branches in an inland area, only to rejoin and continue to the sea. Such an area is called an ''inland delta'', and often occurs on former lake beds. The [[Inner Niger Delta]] and [[Peace\u2013Athabasca Delta]] are notable examples. The [[Amazon River|Amazon]] also has an inland delta before the island of [[Maraj\u00f3]], and the [[Danube]] has one in the valley on the Slovak-Hungarian border between [[Bratislava]] and [[I\u017ea]].\n\nIn some cases, a river flowing into a flat arid area splits into channels that evaporate as it progresses into the desert. The [[Okavango Delta]] in [[Botswana]] is one example.\n\n=== Mega deltas ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nThe generic term ''mega delta'' can be used to describe very large Asian river deltas, such as the [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze]], [[Pearl River Delta|Pearl]], [[Red River Delta|Red]], [[Mekong Delta|Mekong]], [[Irrawaddy Delta|Irrawaddy]], [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra]], and [[Indus River Delta|Indus]].\n\n== Sedimentary structure ==\n[[File:Line5066 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Delta on [[Kachemak Bay]] at low tide]]\nThe formation of a delta is complicated, multiple, and cross-cutting over time, but in a simple delta three main types of bedding may be distinguished: the bottomset beds, foreset/frontset beds, and topset beds. This three part structure may be seen in small scale by [[crossbedding]].<ref name=maine /><ref>D.G.A Whitten, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Geology'' (1972)</ref>\n*The bottomset beds are created from the lightest suspended particles that settle farthest away from the active delta front, as the river flow diminishes into the standing body of water and loses energy. This suspended load is deposited by [[sediment gravity flow]], creating a [[turbidite]]. These beds are laid down in horizontal layers and consist of the finest grain sizes.\n*The foreset beds in turn are deposited in inclined layers over the bottomset beds as the active lobe advances. Foreset beds form the greater part of the bulk of a delta, (and also occur on the lee side of [[sand dunes]]).<ref name=\"BatesDict\">Robert L. Bates, Julia A. Jackson, ''Dictionary of Geological Terms'' [[American Geological Institute|AGI]] (1984)</ref> The sediment particles within foreset beds consist of larger and more variable sizes, and constitute the [[bed load]] that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the channel bottom. When the bed load reaches the edge of the delta front, it rolls over the edge, and is deposited in steeply dipping layers over the top of the existing bottomset beds. Under water, the slope of the outermost edge of the delta is created at the [[angle of repose]] of these sediments. As the foresets accumulate and advance, [[wikt:subaqueous|subaqueous]] landslides occur and readjust overall slope stability. The foreset slope, thus created and maintained, extends the delta lobe outward. In cross section, foresets typically lie in angled, parallel bands, and indicate stages and seasonal variations during the creation of the delta.\n*The topset beds of an advancing delta are deposited in turn over the previously laid foresets, truncating or covering them. Topsets are nearly horizontal layers of smaller-sized sediment deposited on the top of the delta and form an extension of the landward alluvial plain.<ref name=\"BatesDict\" /> As the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta, the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced, causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta's top. Topset beds are subdivided into two regions: the upper delta plain and the lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is unaffected by the tide, while the boundary with the lower delta plain is defined by the upper limit of tidal influence.<ref>Hori, K. and Saito, Y.

Dams block sedimentation, which can cause the delta to erode away.  The use of water upstream can greatly increase salinity levels as less fresh water flows to meet the salty ocean water.  While nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans, the [[Nile Delta]] and [[Colorado River Delta]] are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water. Construction, irrigation, and land alteration have impacted delta formation. As humans have altered surface roughness, runoff, and groundwater storage, studies have shown river delta retreat. However, historical data documents show that during the Roman Empire and Little Ice Age (times where there was considerable anthropogenic pressure), there were significant sediment accumulation in deltas. The industrial revolution has only amplified the impact of humans on delta growth and retreat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maselli |first1=Vittorio |last2=Trincardi |first2=Fabio |date=2013-05-31 |title=Man made deltas |journal=Scientific Reports |language=en |volume=3 |pages=1926 |doi=10.1038/srep01926 |issn=2045-2322 |pmc=3668317 |pmid=23722597}}</ref>\n\n== Deltas in the economy ==\nAncient deltas are a benefit to the economy due to their well sorted [[sand]] and [[gravel]].

The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This [[alluvium]] builds up to form the river delta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/tfd-modeling/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack \u2013 Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics:: TFD Modeling|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref> When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its [[stream channel|channel]] and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to [[sediment transport|transport sediment]]. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and [[deposition (geology)|deposits]]. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the [[gradient]] of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see [[slope]]).\n\nAs the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, gravity makes the water flow in the most direct course downslope. If the river breaches its natural levees (i.e., during a flood), it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope.<ref name=\"SlingerlandSmith\">Slingerland, R. and N. D. Smith (1998), \"Necessary conditions for a meandering-river avulsion,\" ''Geology'' (Boulder), 26, 435\u2013438.</ref> Second, as its slope gets lower, the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases, which results in the deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This makes it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the body of standing water at a steeper slope. Often when the channel does this, some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel. When these channel-switching events occur, a mature delta develops a [[distributary]] network.\n\nAnother way these distributary networks form is from the deposition of [[mouth bars]] (mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river). When this mid-channel bar is deposited at the mouth of a river, the flow is routed around it. This results in additional deposition on the upstream end of the mouth-bar, which splits the river into two distributary channels. A good example of the result of this process is the [[Wax Lake Delta]].\n\nIn both of these cases, depositional processes force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan, because more rapid changes in channel position resultsf in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird's-feet, are examples of rivers that do not [[Avulsion (river)|avulse]] often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape. [[Alluvial fan]] deltas, as seen by their name, avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal fan shape.\n\nMost large river deltas discharge to intra-cratonic basins on the trailing edges of passive margins due to the majority of large rivers such as the Mississippi, Nile, Amazon, Ganges, Indus, and Yangtze discharging along passive continental margins.<ref name=Milliman>{{cite journal |last1=Milliman |first1=J.

Topography along active margins tend to be steeper and less widespread, which results in sediments not having the ability to pile up and accumulate due to the sediment traveling into a steep subduction trench rather than a shallow continental shelf.\n\nThere are many other smaller factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins. Along active margins, orogenic sequences cause tectonic activity to form over-steepened slopes, brecciated rocks, and volcanic activity resulting in delta formation to exist closer to the sediment source.<ref name=Milliman/><ref name=Goodbred>{{cite journal |last1=Goodbred |first1=S.

With a high wave energy near shore and a steeper slope offshore, waves will make river deltas smoother. Waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta, causing the delta to retreat.<ref name=\"Anthony 53\u201378\" /> For deltas that form further upriver in an estuary, there are complex yet quantifiable linkages between winds, tides, river discharge, and delta water levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/tfd-hydrometeorology/|title=Dr. Gregory B.

Notable examples include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Tagus]] estuary.\n\n=== Inland deltas ===\n[[File:OkavangoDelta.png|thumb|right|Okavango Delta]]In rare cases the river delta is located inside a large valley and is called an [[inverted river delta]]. Sometimes a river divides into multiple branches in an inland area, only to rejoin and continue to the sea. Such an area is called an ''inland delta'', and often occurs on former lake beds. The [[Inner Niger Delta]] and [[Peace\u2013Athabasca Delta]] are notable examples. The [[Amazon River|Amazon]] also has an inland delta before the island of [[Maraj\u00f3]], and the [[Danube]] has one in the valley on the Slovak-Hungarian border between [[Bratislava]] and [[I\u017ea]].\n\nIn some cases, a river flowing into a flat arid area splits into channels that evaporate as it progresses into the desert. The [[Okavango Delta]] in [[Botswana]] is one example.\n\n=== Mega deltas ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nThe generic term ''mega delta'' can be used to describe very large Asian river deltas, such as the [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze]], [[Pearl River Delta|Pearl]], [[Red River Delta|Red]], [[Mekong Delta|Mekong]], [[Irrawaddy Delta|Irrawaddy]], [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra]], and [[Indus River Delta|Indus]].\n\n== Sedimentary structure ==\n[[File:Line5066 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Delta on [[Kachemak Bay]] at low tide]]\nThe formation of a delta is complicated, multiple, and cross-cutting over time, but in a simple delta three main types of bedding may be distinguished: the bottomset beds, foreset/frontset beds, and topset beds. This three part structure may be seen in small scale by [[crossbedding]].<ref name=maine /><ref>D.G.A Whitten, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Geology'' (1972)</ref>\n*The bottomset beds are created from the lightest suspended particles that settle farthest away from the active delta front, as the river flow diminishes into the standing body of water and loses energy. This suspended load is deposited by [[sediment gravity flow]], creating a [[turbidite]]. These beds are laid down in horizontal layers and consist of the finest grain sizes.\n*The foreset beds in turn are deposited in inclined layers over the bottomset beds as the active lobe advances. Foreset beds form the greater part of the bulk of a delta, (and also occur on the lee side of [[sand dunes]]).<ref name=\"BatesDict\">Robert L. Bates, Julia A. Jackson, ''Dictionary of Geological Terms'' [[American Geological Institute|AGI]] (1984)</ref> The sediment particles within foreset beds consist of larger and more variable sizes, and constitute the [[bed load]] that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the channel bottom. When the bed load reaches the edge of the delta front, it rolls over the edge, and is deposited in steeply dipping layers over the top of the existing bottomset beds. Under water, the slope of the outermost edge of the delta is created at the [[angle of repose]] of these sediments. As the foresets accumulate and advance, [[wikt:subaqueous|subaqueous]] landslides occur and readjust overall slope stability. The foreset slope, thus created and maintained, extends the delta lobe outward. In cross section, foresets typically lie in angled, parallel bands, and indicate stages and seasonal variations during the creation of the delta.\n*The topset beds of an advancing delta are deposited in turn over the previously laid foresets, truncating or covering them. Topsets are nearly horizontal layers of smaller-sized sediment deposited on the top of the delta and form an extension of the landward alluvial plain.<ref name=\"BatesDict\" /> As the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta, the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced, causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta's top. Topset beds are subdivided into two regions: the upper delta plain and the lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is unaffected by the tide, while the boundary with the lower delta plain is defined by the upper limit of tidal influence.<ref>Hori, K. and Saito, Y.

Dams block sedimentation, which can cause the delta to erode away.  The use of water upstream can greatly increase salinity levels as less fresh water flows to meet the salty ocean water.  While nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans, the [[Nile Delta]] and [[Colorado River Delta]] are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water. Construction, irrigation, and land alteration have impacted delta formation. As humans have altered surface roughness, runoff, and groundwater storage, studies have shown river delta retreat. However, historical data documents show that during the Roman Empire and Little Ice Age (times where there was considerable anthropogenic pressure), there were significant sediment accumulation in deltas. The industrial revolution has only amplified the impact of humans on delta growth and retreat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maselli |first1=Vittorio |last2=Trincardi |first2=Fabio |date=2013-05-31 |title=Man made deltas |journal=Scientific Reports |language=en |volume=3 |pages=1926 |doi=10.1038/srep01926 |issn=2045-2322 |pmc=3668317 |pmid=23722597}}</ref>\n\n== Deltas in the economy ==\nAncient deltas are a benefit to the economy due to their well sorted [[sand]] and [[gravel]].

Ahlquist]] published his seminal work where divided [[adrenoceptor]]s into \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtypes, this allowed a better understanding of drugs [[mechanisms of action]].\n\nIn 1987, after [[Montreal Protocol]], [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] inhalers were phased out and [[Hydrofluoroalkane|HFA]] inhalers replace them. In 1987 [[CRISPR]] technique was discovered by [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] that in the next century would be used for [[genome editing]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year of discovery !!
