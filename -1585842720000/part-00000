It was developed and published by [[Changyou.com]]. ''Blade Wars'' is inspired by [[martial arts]] and takes place in a [[fantasy]] universe where three playable races, the Abyssals, Humans, and Immortals battle for dominance in PVP encounters.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game features F2P martial arts and uses an [[isometric view]] and employs a control scheme similar to the one used in [[RuneScape]] and the [[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]] game series.\n\nThe battle system is based on a dynamic algorithm that factors in a player's level, the time between attacks and the enemy's position. Players are able to feign attacks or dodge an opponent's strikes. Skill combinations can be customized to result in powerful attacks, which generate extra damage during a battle.\n\nThe game incorporates many of the features found in Changyou's previously released title, ''[[Dragon Oath]]''. Mounts, trading, guild battles and daily events are included in ''Blade Wars''. Unlike ''Dragon Oath'', ''Blade Wars'' uses a [[2.5D]] [[graphics engine]], mixing 2D and 3D graphics into an isometric view.\n\nThe game allows players to use strategy in customizing the fighting system and encourages skilled players to challenge each other for supremacy.

(Publication Committee of Modern Korean Literature of a Century, ''Short History of Korean Literature, Vol.1: Before the Independence'' (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2008), 487.)</ref> was a [[Korea|Korean]] [[writer]]. He wrote in a variety of genres including [[Novel|novels]], [[play (theatre)|play]]s, reports, and reviews, in two languages, Korean and Japanese. His career as a writer first began in Japan after publishing a short story written in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and his [[Korean language|Korean]]-written works were later published in Korea. For his short story \"Bit soge (\ube5b \uc18d\uc5d0, Into the Light),\" written in Japanese, he became the first Korean to be nominated for the Akutagawa Prize. He went to [[China]] in 1945 to join the army fighting for Korea's liberation. After the country's independence, he mostly lived and wrote in [[North Korea]] and died in 1950 during the [[Korean War]].\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Before the 1940s ===\nKim was born into a wealthy family in Pyeongyang, in 1914. While he was studying in Pyeongyang High School, he led a strike again Japan for which he was expelled from school.<ref>Gwon Yeongmin, \"Kim Sa-ryang,\" Encyclopedia of Contemporary Korean Literature, accessed November 27, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=333236&cid=41708&categoryId=41737.</ref> He moved to Japan in 1932, graduated Saga High School, and got into Tokyo Imperial University in 1936 to study German literature. In university, he published a short story entitled \"Toseongnang (\ud1a0\uc131\ub791, The Shantytown near the Earthen Ramparts)\" in the second volume of the literary coterie magazine ''River Bank'', adapted it into a play, and performed it with the Joseon Art Group. However, the performance caused trouble and he was in detention with other members of the group for two months. In 1938, he took part in the performance of ''Chunhyangjeon'' (\ucd98\ud5a5\uc804, The Story of Chunhyang) in Joseon, organized by the drama company Sinhyeop. Kim submitted his thesis about Heinrich Heine and graduated university in 1939. After the graduation, he briefly worked as a journalist for the ''Chosun Ilbo.'' He published the short story \"Into the Light,\" and also translated and introduced into Japanese many Korean literary works, such as \"Mumyeong (\ubb34\uba85, Absence of Light),\" a short story written by Yi Kwang-su.\n\n=== The 1940s ===\nIn 1940, Kim Sa-ryang became the first Korean author to be nominated for the Akutagawa Prize, for his short story \"Into the Light.\" He started publishing serially his novel ''Nakjo'' (\ub099\uc870, Falling) in Korean from 1940 to 1941. Also, his Japanese-written short stories \"Cheonma (\ucc9c\ub9c8, Heavenly Horse)\" and \"Pulsup gipsugi (\ud480\uc232 \uae4a\uc219\uc774, Far into the Grassland)\" came out in 1940, and \"Hyangsu (\ud5a5\uc218, Homesick)\" in 1941. In the same year, his first short story collection ''Into the Light'' was published in Japan. He wrote stories in Korean as well, such as \"Yuchijang-eseo mannan sanai (\uc720\uce58\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9cc\ub09c \uc0ac\ub098\uc774, The Man I Met in Jail),\" published in 1941.<ref>The story was later translated into Japanese with the title \"Count Q\" and included in his second short story collection.</ref> During the Pacific War, he was in detention for 50 days, forced to follow the Japanese military on the frontlines of the Southeast Asia and to write about them, but he refused to the end.<ref>\"Kim Sa-ryang,\" Encyclopedia of Korean Culture, accessed November 27, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=552287&cid=46645&categoryId=46645.</ref> In 1942, he published \"Sipjang kkopsae (\uc2ed\uc7a5 \uaf3d\uc0c8, The Chief Worker, Mr. Hunchback)\" and the short story collection ''Gohyang'' (\uace0\ud5a5, Hometown). In the same year, Kim returned to his hometown and researched the conditions of the slash-and-burn farming villages, and published the novels ''Taebaek sanmaek'' (\ud0dc\ubc31\uc0b0\ub9e5, The Taebaek Mountains) and ''Badaui norae'' (\ubc14\ub2e4\uc758 \ub178\ub798, Songs of the Sea) in 1943. He was sent to China in 1945 as a member of the group organized to entertain student soldiers, but he escaped to the Taihang mountain in Yan'an, China. Later, he joined the Alliance for Joseon Liberation in North China, and wrote the play ''Hojeop'' (\ud638\uc811, Tiger Swallowtail) while fighting against Japan. On hearing the news of Japan's defeat in August 15, 1945, he returned to his home country as the advance party of the Korean Volunteer Army. He participated in a roundtable talk of writers held in Seoul and the inaugural meeting of the Literary Alliance of Joseon.\n\n=== After the independence of Korea ===\nWhile publishing serially ''Yeonan mangmyeonggi'' (\uc5f0\uc548\ub9dd\uba85\uae30, Living in Exile in Yan'an), whose title was later changed to ''Noma Malli'' (\ub178\ub9c8 \ub9cc\ub9ac, The Slow Horse Goes Four Thousand Kilometers), Kim moved to North Korea and became a major member of culture and arts organizations. He left a number of works, including his plays ''Noeseong'' (\ub1cc\uc131, Thunder), published in 1946, and ''Daeoneun taeyangeul hyanghayeo'' (\ub300\uc624\ub294 \ud0dc\uc591\uc744 \ud5a5\ud558\uc5ec, The Ranks Go Towards the Sun), in 1950. Then he took part in the Korean War as one of the war writers and wrote reports like \"Seoul-eseo suwon-euro (\uc11c\uc6b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c, From Seoul to Suwon)\" and \"Urineun ireoke igyeotda (\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub807\uac8c \uc774\uacbc\ub2e4, This Is How We Won).\" He reportedly died of a heart attack near Wonju, in October, 1950, after finishing his last work, the report on war ''Badaga boinda'' (\ubc14\ub2e4\uac00 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4, I See the Ocean). His works have been translated and introduced in not only Japan and Korea, but also China and the U.S. In 2005, a monument commemorating Kim's literary legacy was erected at the entrance of the village of Hujiazhuang in China.\n\n== Writing ==\n\n=== Style ===\nMany of Kim's works vividly depict the reality of Korea and its situation as a Japanese colony.<ref>Gwon Yeongmin, \"Kim Sa-ryang,\" Encyclopedia of Contemporary Korean Literature, accessed November 27, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=333236&cid=41708&categoryId=41737.</ref> He did write a lot in Japanese, but he focused on the reality of the colonized country, explored the identity of the Korean people,<ref>Publication Committee of Modern Korean Literature of a Century, ''Short History of Korean Literature, Vol.1: Before the Independence'' (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2008), 488.</ref> and criticized the Japanese colonization.<ref>Hwang Ho-duk, \"On Kim Sa-ryang's ''Into the Light'': Writing in Japanese,\" ''History Towards Tomorrow'' 32 (2008), 140.</ref> Also, he prolifically wrote in and translated into both Korean and Japanese, showing a strong commitment to his bilingualism.<ref>Kim Hye-yeon, ''Study on Modern Korean Literature and Bilingualism, Focusing on Kim Sa-ryang'' (Paju: Kookhak, 2012), 69\u201370.</ref>\n\n=== Major works ===\nHis short story \"Into the Light,\" written in Japanese and published in 1939, is one of the major works of Kim's early career.

The narrator of the story who acts like a Japanese and Haruo who denies his Korean blood reveal their true identities at the end. \"Into the Light\" is significant as it posed the question of ethnic identity during the last period of the colonization when the Japanese government tried to assimilate the Koreans, and as it supported 'Korean things' that can never be assimilated.<ref>Gong Jong-gu, \"Politics of Names in Kim Sa-ryang's Works,\" ''Journal of Modern Literary Theory'' 72 (2018), 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the time when Japan invaded the country and culminating in the March First Movement of 1919, the Korean-written novel ''Nakjo,'' published from 1940 to 1941, recounts the story of the family of Yun Seong-hyo, a descendant of a high ranking, corrupt official. The title ''Nakjo,'' or falling, means the fall of corrupt, pro-Japanese influences who originally served as the officials of the Joseon's feudal system. The novel is fascinating because it describes different aspects of a colonized society and it deals with the family of the pro-Japanese official who is apprehensive about the vengeance of independence activists.<ref>Lim Heon-yeong, \"On Kim Sa-ryang's Writing: Reading a Distorted Life in the Dark Times,\" ''Nakjo'' (Incheon: Keungeul, 2010).</ref> It also successfully captures the beauty of the Korean language by implementing the dialect of Pyeongyang, traditional ''pansori'' songs, onomatopoeic and mimetic words.<ref>Kim Hye-yeon, ''Study on Modern Korean Literature and Bilingualism, Focusing on Kim Sa-ryang'' (Paju: Kookhak, 2012), 185\u2013186.</ref>\n\nThe travel report ''Noma malli,'' which came out in 1946 after the country's independence, documents his personal experience of escaping to Yan'an in China and joining the Korean Volunteer Army; it also serves as a historical material of great import about the activism against Japan carried out in China during the last period of the colonization. \"Noma\" in the title means a slow horse and is a humble expression suggesting that the author joined the activism against Japan too late.<ref>Kim Jaenam, Research on Kim Sa-ryang's Works, ''Sejong University Thesis'' 17 (1991), 92.</ref> This report is another example of a cultural resistance against Japanese imperialism,<ref>Yu Imha, \"Re-discussing Kim Sa-ryang's Noma malli: From the Search of a Subaltern to Fighting Against Imperialism,\" ''Japanese Studies'' 40, 2015, 147\u2013152.</ref> and its narrator refuses to give up hope for the home country and Asia in such harsh realities.<ref>Gwak Hyeongduk, ''Kim Sa-ryang and the Colonial Literature Around the End of Japanese Imperialism'' (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2017), 367.</ref> Through this work, Kim suggests that his escape was a way to fight against Japan and to ensure his freedom to write,<ref>''Kim sa-ryang jakpumjip'', edited by Lim Heonyeong (Seoul: Zmanz Books, 2013), 179\u2013183.</ref> and also one of his attempts to realize utopia.<ref>Gwak Hyeongduk, ''Kim Sa-ryang and the Colonial Literature Around the End of Japanese Imperialism'' (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2017), 48.</ref>\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nKim received diverse criticisms in South and North Korea and the literary world of the Korean Japanese. In the latter, he was categorized as a writer of proletarian literature and became well-known after his nomination for the Akutagawa Prize. In North Korea, his name was erased in the literary history because he was from the Yeonan (Yan'an in Chinese) group, which stood against Kim Il-sung, until he was reinstated in 1987 and reevaluated as a conscientious nationalist.

While he was studying in Pyeongyang High School, he led a strike again Japan for which he was expelled from school.<ref>Gwon Yeongmin, \"Kim Sa-ryang,\" Encyclopedia of Contemporary Korean Literature, accessed November 27, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=333236&cid=41708&categoryId=41737.</ref> He moved to Japan in 1932, graduated Saga High School, and got into Tokyo Imperial University in 1936 to study German literature. In university, he published a short story entitled \"Toseongnang (\ud1a0\uc131\ub791, The Shantytown near the Earthen Ramparts)\" in the second volume of the literary coterie magazine ''River Bank'', adapted it into a play, and performed it with the Joseon Art Group. However, the performance caused trouble and he was in detention with other members of the group for two months. In 1938, he took part in the performance of ''Chunhyangjeon'' (\ucd98\ud5a5\uc804, The Story of Chunhyang) in Joseon, organized by the drama company Sinhyeop. Kim submitted his thesis about Heinrich Heine and graduated university in 1939. After the graduation, he briefly worked as a journalist for the ''Chosun Ilbo.'' He published the short story \"Into the Light,\" and also translated and introduced into Japanese many Korean literary works, such as \"Mumyeong (\ubb34\uba85, Absence of Light),\" a short story written by Yi Kwang-su.\n\n=== The 1940s ===\nIn 1940, Kim Sa-ryang became the first Korean author to be nominated for the Akutagawa Prize, for his short story \"Into the Light.\" He started publishing serially his novel ''Nakjo'' (\ub099\uc870, Falling) in Korean from 1940 to 1941.

In the same year, his first short story collection ''Into the Light'' was published in Japan. He wrote stories in Korean as well, such as \"Yuchijang-eseo mannan sanai (\uc720\uce58\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9cc\ub09c \uc0ac\ub098\uc774, The Man I Met in Jail),\" published in 1941.<ref>The story was later translated into Japanese with the title \"Count Q\" and included in his second short story collection.</ref> During the Pacific War, he was in detention for 50 days, forced to follow the Japanese military on the frontlines of the Southeast Asia and to write about them, but he refused to the end.<ref>\"Kim Sa-ryang,\" Encyclopedia of Korean Culture, accessed November 27, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=552287&cid=46645&categoryId=46645.</ref> In 1942, he published \"Sipjang kkopsae (\uc2ed\uc7a5 \uaf3d\uc0c8, The Chief Worker, Mr. Hunchback)\" and the short story collection ''Gohyang'' (\uace0\ud5a5, Hometown). In the same year, Kim returned to his hometown and researched the conditions of the slash-and-burn farming villages, and published the novels ''Taebaek sanmaek'' (\ud0dc\ubc31\uc0b0\ub9e5, The Taebaek Mountains) and ''Badaui norae'' (\ubc14\ub2e4\uc758 \ub178\ub798, Songs of the Sea) in 1943. He was sent to China in 1945 as a member of the group organized to entertain student soldiers, but he escaped to the Taihang mountain in Yan'an, China. Later, he joined the Alliance for Joseon Liberation in North China, and wrote the play ''Hojeop'' (\ud638\uc811, Tiger Swallowtail) while fighting against Japan.

In South Korea, he was hardly acknowledged since he moved to North Korea and wrote in Japanese; however, after the 1990s, critics enthusiastically acclaimed him for his bilingual and post colonialist writing.<ref>Publication Committee of Modern Korean Literature of a Century, ''Short History of Korean Literature, Vol.1: Before the Independence'' (Seoul: Somyung Books, 2008), 489.</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Complete collections and anthologies ===\n\n==== Japan ====\n\u300a\uae40\uc0ac\ub7c9 \uc804\uc9d1\u300b(\uc804 4\uad8c), \ud558\ucd9c\uc11c\ubc29\uc2e0\uc0ac, 1973~1974 / ''Kim sa-ryang jeonjip jeon 4 gwon'' (Complete Collection of Kim Sa-ryang's Works in Four Volumes), Kawade Shobo Shinsha, 1973\u20131974\n\n\u300a\uae40\uc0ac\ub7c9 \uc791\ud488\uc9d1\u300b, \uc774\ub860\uc0ac (Tokyo), 1954 / ''Kim sa-ryang jakpumjip'' (Selected Works of Kim Sa-ryang'')'', Rironsha (Tokyo), 1954\n\n==== Korea ====\n\u300a\uae40\uc0ac\ub7c9 \uc120\uc9d1\u300b, \uad6d\ub9bd\ucd9c\ud310\uc0ac(\ud3c9\uc591), 1955 / ''Kim sa-ryang seonjip'' (Kim Sa-ryang Anthology''),'' Guklip (Pyeongyang), 1955\n\n\u300a\uae40\uc0ac\ub7c9 \uc791\ud488\uc9d1\u300b, \ubb38\uc608\ucd9c\ud310\uc0ac(\ud3c9\uc591), 1987 / ''Kim sa-ryang jakpumjip'' (Selected Works of Kim Sa-ryang'')'', Munye (Pyeongyang), 1987\n\n\u300a\uae40\uc0ac\ub7c9, \uc791\ud488\uacfc \uc5f0\uad6c\u300b, \uae40\uc7ac\uc6a9\u2027\uacfd\ud615\ub355, \uc5ed\ub77d, 2008-2016 / ''Kim sa-ryang, jakpumgwa yeongu'' (Study and Selected Works of Kim Sa-ryang), Kim Jae-yong, Gwak Hyeongduk, Youkrack Books, 2008\u20132016\n\n\u300a\uae40\uc0ac\ub7c9 \uc791\ud488\uc120\u300b, \uae00\ub204\ub9bc, 2011 / ''Kim sa-ryang jakpumseon'' (Selected Works of Kim Sa-ryang'')'', Geulnurim, 2011\n\n\u300a\uae40\uc0ac\ub7c9 \uc791\ud488\uc9d1\u300b, \uc784\ud5cc\uc601 \uc5ee\uc74c, \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744\ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294\uc9c0\uc2dd, 2013 / ''Kim sa-ryang jakpumjip'' (Selected Works of Kim Sa-ryang), edited by Lim Heonyeong, Zmanz Books, 2013\n\n\u300a\uae40\uc0ac\ub7c9 \uc120\uc9d1\u300b, \uc5ed\ub77d, 2016 / ''Kim sa-ryang seonjip'' (Kim Sa-ryang Anthology''),'' Youkrack Books, 2016\n\n=== Short story collections ===\n\n==== Japan ====\n\u300a\ube5b \uc18d\uc5d0\u300b, \uc18c\uc0b0\uc11c\uc810(\ub3c4\ucfc4), 1940 / ''Bit soge'' (Into the Light), Sosan Seojeom (Tokyo), 1940\n\n\u300a\uace0\ud5a5\u300b, \uac11\uc870\uc11c\ub9bc(\uad50\ud1a0), 1942 / ''Gohyang'' (Hometown), Gapjo Seorim (Kyoto), 1942\n\n==== Korea ====\n\u300a\ud48d\uc0c1\u300b, \uc870\uc120\uc778\ubbfc\ucd9c\ud310\uc0ac, 1948 / ''Pungsang'' (Wind and Frost), Joseon Inmin, 1948\n\n\u300a\uc885\uad70\uae30\u300b, \uae40\uc7ac\ub0a8 \uc5ee\uc74c, \uc0b4\ub9bc\ud130, 1992 / ''Jonggun-gi'' (Reports on the Korean War), edited by Kim Jaenam, Sallimteo, 1992\n\n\u300a\ube5b \uc18d\uc73c\ub85c\u300b, \uc18c\ub2f4\ucd9c\ud310\uc0ac, 2001 / ''Bit sogeuro'' (Into the Light), Sodam Books, 2001\n\n=== Novels ===\n\n==== Japan ====\n\u300a\ub178\ub9c8\ub9cc\ub9ac\u300b, \uc870\uc77c\uc2e0\ubb38\uc0ac, 1972 / ''Noma Malli'' (The Slow Horse Goes Four Thousand Kilometers), Asahi Shimbun, 1972\n\n==== Korea ====\n\u300a\ub178\ub9c8\ucc9c\ub9ac\u300b, \uc591\uc11c\uac01(\ud3c9\uc591), 1947 / ''Noma Cheolli'' (The Slow Horse Goes Four Hundred Kilometers), Yangseogak (Pyeongyang), 1947\n\n\u300a\ub178\ub9c8\ub9cc\ub9ac\u300b, \uc774\uc0c1\uacbd \ud3b8\uc9d1, \ub3d9\uad11\ucd9c\ud310\uc0ac, 1989 / ''Noma Malli'' (The Slow Horse Goes Four Thousand Kilometers), edited by Lee Sang-gyeong, Donggwang, 1989\n\n\u300a\ud0dc\ubc31\uc0b0\ub9e5\u300b, \uae40\ud559\ub3d9 \uc62e\uae40, \ub178\ud2b8\ubd81, 2006 / ''Taebaek sanmaek'' (The Taebaek Mountains), translated by Kim Hakdong, Noteubuk, 2006\n\n\u300a\ub099\uc870\u300b, \ud070\uae00, 2010 / ''Nakjo'' (Falling), Keungeul, 2010\n\n== Translations ==\n\u300a\ube5b \uc18d\uc5d0\u300b, \ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud1a0\ud37c \uc2a4\uce87 \uc601\uc5ed, \uc544\uc2dc\uc544, 2015 / Into the Light: Volume 95, translated by Christopher D.

Originally \"van Dijck\", with the [[IJ (digraph)|\"IJ\" digraph]], in Dutch. Anthony is the English for the Dutch Anthonis or Antoon, though Anthonie, Antonio or Anthonio was also used; in French he is often Antoine, in Italian Anthonio or Antonio. In English a capitalised \"Van\" in Van Dyck was more usual until recent decades (used by Waterhouse for example), and \"Dyke\" was often used during his lifetime and later (and is usual for the beard style).</ref> 22 March 1599&nbsp;\u2013 9 December 1641) was a [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque artist]] who became the leading [[court painter]] in England after success in the [[Southern Netherlands]] and Italy.\n\nThe seventh child of Frans van Dyck, a wealthy [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] silk merchant, Anthony was precocious as a youth and painted from an early age.  In his late teens he was already enjoying success as an independent painter, becoming a master in the [[Guild of Saint Luke|Antwerp guild]] in 1618.  By this time he was working in the studio of the leading northern painter of the day, [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who became a major influence on his work.  Van Dyck worked in London for some months in 1621, then returned to Flanders for a brief time, before travelling to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, based mostly in Genoa. In the late 1620s he completed his greatly admired ''Iconography'' series of portrait [[etching]]s, mostly of other artists.  He spent five years in Flanders after his return from Italy, and from 1630 was court painter for the archduchess [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], Habsburg Governor of Flanders. In 1632 he returned to London to be the main court painter, at the request of [[Charles I of England]].\n\nWith the exception of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], van Dyck and his contemporary [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, revolutionising the genre. He is best known for his portraits of European aristocracy, most notably Charles I and his family and associates. Van Dyck became the dominant influence on [[English school of painting|English portrait-painting]] for the next 150 years. He also painted [[mythological]] and [[biblical]] subjects, including altarpieces, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in [[watercolour]] and [[etching]].  His superb brushwork, apparently rather quickly painted, can usually be distinguished from the large areas painted by his many assistants.  His portrait style changed considerably between the different countries he worked in, culminating in the relaxed elegance of his last English period.  His influence extends into the modern period. The [[Van Dyke beard]] is named after him. During his lifetime, Charles I granted him a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]], and he was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], an indication of his standing at the time of his death.\n\n==Life and work==\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 008b.jpg|thumb|left|''Self-portrait'', 1613\u201314]]\n\n===Education===\nAntoon van Dyck (his Flemish name) was born to prosperous parents in Antwerp.

His influence on the young artist was immense. Rubens referred to the nineteen-year-old van Dyck as \"the best of my pupils\".<ref>Brown, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe origins and exact nature of their relationship are unclear. It has been speculated that van Dyck was a pupil of Rubens from about 1613, as even his early work shows little trace of van Balen's style, but there is no clear evidence for this.<ref name=\"EW\">Ellis Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530-1790'', 4th Edn, 1978, pp. 70-77, Penguin Books (now Yale History of Art series)</ref> At the same time the dominance of Rubens in the relatively small and declining city of Antwerp probably explains why, despite his periodic returns to the city, van Dyck spent most of his career abroad.<ref name=\"EW\" /> In 1620, in Rubens's contract for the major commission for the ceiling of the [[Carolus Borromeuskerk]], the [[Jesuit]] church at Antwerp (lost to fire in 1718), van Dyck is specified as one of the \"discipelen\" who was to execute the paintings to Rubens' designs.<ref name=\"Martin, op and page cit\">Martin, op and page cit.</ref> Unlike van Dyck, Rubens worked for most of the courts of Europe, but avoided exclusive attachment to any of them.\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 012.jpg|thumb|Genoan hauteur from the Lomellini family, 1623]]\nIn 1620, at the instigation of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham]], van Dyck went to England for the first time where he worked for King [[James I of England]], receiving \u00a3100.<ref name=\"EW\" /> It was in [[London]] in the collection of the [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]] that he first saw the work of [[Titian]], whose use of colour and subtle modeling of form would prove transformational, offering a new stylistic language that would enrich the compositional lessons learned from Rubens.<ref>Brown, page 19.</ref>\n\nAfter about four months, he returned to Flanders, but left in late 1621 for Italy, where he remained for six years. There he studied the Italian masters while starting his career as a successful portraitist. He was already presenting himself as a figure of consequence, annoying the rather bohemian Northern artist's colony in [[Rome]], says [[Giovan Pietro Bellori]], by appearing with \"the pomp of [[Zeuxis]] ... his behaviour was that of a nobleman rather than an ordinary person, and he shone in rich garments. Since he was accustomed in the circle of Rubens to noblemen, and being naturally of elevated mind, and anxious to make himself distinguished, he therefore wore\u2014as well as silks\u2014a hat with feathers and brooches, gold chains across his chest, and was accompanied by servants.\"<ref>[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''Painting at Court'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1971, pp. 124-5</ref>\n[[File:Anthony Van Dyck, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|225px|left|''Anthony van Dyck'', by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1627\u201328)]]\nHe was mostly based in [[Genoa]], although he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed for some time in [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]], where he was quarantined during the 1624 plague, one of the worst in Sicily's history. There he produced an important series of paintings of the city's plague saint [[Saint Rosalia]]. His depictions of a young woman with flowing blonde hair wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril, became the standard iconography of the saint from that time onward and was extremely influential for Italian Baroque painters, from [[Luca Giordano]] to [[Pietro Novelli]]. Versions include those in [[Saint Rosalia (Anthony van Dyck)|Madrid]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Houston)|Houston]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (London)|London]], [[Saint Rosalie Interceding for the Plague\u2013Stricken of Palermo|New York]] and [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Palermo)|Palermo]], as well as [[Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo]] in Puerto Rico, and [[Coronation of Saint Rosalia]] in Vienna. Van Dyck's series of St Rosalia paintings have been studied by [[Gauvin Alexander Bailey]] and [[Xavier F. Salomon]], both of whom curated or co-curated exhibitions devoted to the theme of Italian art and the plague.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/arts/design/desperately-painting-the-plague.html</ref><ref>https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA284449813&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00036536&p=AONE&sw=w</ref><ref>https://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/about/exhibitions-archive/exhibitions-archive-by-date/2012-van-dyck-in-sicily/</ref> Recently the New York Times published an article about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's painting of Saint Rosalia by Van Dyck in the context of the [[Covid-19]] virus.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/arts/design/van-dyck-metropolitan-museum-virus.html</ref>.\n\nFor the Genoese aristocracy, then in a final flush of prosperity, he developed a full-length portrait style, drawing on [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and Titian as well as Rubens' style from his own period in Genoa, where extremely tall but graceful figures look down on the viewer with great hauteur. In 1627, he went back to Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of [[Brussels]] he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695.{{sfn|Cust|1899}} He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630, he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large [[altarpiece]]s, and began his printmaking (see below).\n\n===London===\n[[File:Sir-Anthony-van-Dyck-Lord-John-Stuart-and-His-Brother-Lord-Bernard-Stuart.jpg|thumb|''[[Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart]]'', c. 1638, exemplifies the more intimate, but still elegant style he developed in England]]\nKing Charles I was the most passionate collector of art among the [[House of Stuart|Stuart kings]], and saw painting as a way of promoting his elevated view of the monarchy. In 1628, he bought the fabulous collection that the [[Charles I, Duke of Mantua|Duke of Mantua]] was forced to sell, and he had been trying since his accession in 1625 to bring leading foreign painters to England. In 1626, he was able to persuade [[Orazio Gentileschi]] to settle in England, later to be joined by his daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi|Artemisia]] and some of his sons. Rubens was an especial target, who eventually in 1630 came on a diplomatic mission, which included painting, and he later sent Charles more paintings from Antwerp. Rubens was very well-treated during his nine-month visit, during which he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. Charles's court portraitist, [[Daniel Mytens]], was a somewhat pedestrian Dutchman. Charles was very short, less than {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, and presented challenges to a portrait artist.\n\nVan Dyck had remained in touch with the English court and had helped King Charles's agents in their search for pictures. He had also sent back some of his own works, including a portrait (1623) of himself with [[Endymion Porter]], one of Charles's agents, a mythological work, ''Rinaldo and [[Armida]]'' (1629, now in the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]), and a religious picture for the Queen. He had also painted Charles's sister, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia]], at [[The Hague]] in 1632. In April of that year, van Dyck returned to London and was taken under the wing of the court immediately, being knighted in July and at the same time receiving a pension of \u00a3200 a year, in the grant of which he was described as ''[[Principal Painter in Ordinary|principalle Paynter in ordinary to their majesties]]''.<ref name=\"Grosvenor Gallery Stephens 1887 p. 14\">{{cite book |author=Grosvenor Gallery |last2=Stephens |first2=F.G. |title=Exhibition of the Works of Sir Anthony Van Dyck |publisher=H.

He was provided with a house on the [[River Thames]] at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the [[City of London|City]], thus avoiding the monopoly of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]]. A suite of rooms in [[Eltham Palace]], no longer used by the royal family, was also put at his disposal as a country retreat. His Blackfriars studio was frequently visited by the King and Queen (later a special causeway was built to ease their access), who hardly sat for another painter while van Dyck lived.<ref name=\"EW\" />{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 044.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Charles I at the Hunt]]'', c. 1635, Louvre]]\nHe was an immediate success in England, rapidly painting a large number of portraits of the King and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], as well as their children. Many portraits were done in several versions, to be sent as diplomatic gifts or given to supporters of the increasingly embattled king. Altogether van Dyck has been estimated to have painted forty portraits of King Charles himself, as well as about thirty of the Queen, nine of the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]], and multiple ones of other courtiers.<ref>Gaunt, William, ''English Court Painting''</ref> He painted many of the court, and also himself and his mistress, Margaret Lemon.\n\nIn England he developed a version of his style which combined a relaxed elegance and ease with an understated authority in his subjects which was to dominate English portrait-painting to the end of the 18th century. Many of these portraits have a lush landscape background. His portraits of Charles on horseback updated the grandeur of Titian's Emperor Charles V, but even more effective and original is his portrait of Charles dismounted in the [[Louvre]]: \"Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King\".<ref>Levey p. 128</ref> Although his portraits have created the classic idea of \"[[Cavalier]]\" style and dress, in fact a majority of his most important patrons in the nobility, such as [[Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton|Lord Wharton]] and the Earls of [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland]] and [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], took the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] side in the [[English Civil War]] that broke out soon after his death.{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n[[File:Anton Van Dyck - Christ carrying the Cross - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Christ carrying the Cross'']]\nThe King [[Queen in Council|in]] [[Privy Council of England|Council]] by [[letters patent]] granted van Dyck ''[[denization|denizenship]]'' in 1638, and he married Mary, the daughter of [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie#Family|Patrick Ruthven]], who, although the title was forfeited, styled himself [[Earl of Gowrie#Lords Ruthven (1488)|Lord Ruthven]].<ref>Cokayne, G.

Van Dyck tried to persuade Charles to commission him to do a large-scale series of works on the history of the [[Order of the Garter]] for the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]], for which Rubens had earlier done the huge ceiling paintings (sending them from Antwerp).\n\nA sketch for one wall remains, but by 1638 Charles was too short of money to proceed.<ref name=\"EW\" /> This was a problem Vel\u00e1zquez did not have, but equally van Dyck's daily life was not encumbered by trivial court duties as Vel\u00e1zquez's was. In his visits to Paris in his last years van Dyck tried to obtain the commission to paint the Grande Gallerie of the [[Louvre]] without success.<ref>Levey, op cit p. 136</ref>\n\nA list of history paintings produced by van Dyck in England survives, compiled by van Dyck's biographer Bellori, based on information from [[Sir Kenelm Digby]].  None of these works appear to remain, except the ''Eros and Psyche'' done for the King (below).<ref name=\"EW\" /> But many other works, rather more religious than mythological, do survive, and though they are very fine, they do not reach the heights of Vel\u00e1zquez's history paintings. Earlier ones remain very much within the style of Rubens, although some of his Sicilian works are individualistic.\n\nVan Dyck's portraits certainly flattered more than Vel\u00e1zquez's. When [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, later Electoress of Hanover]], first met Queen Henrietta Maria, in exile in Holland in 1641, she wrote: \"Van Dyck's handsome portraits had given me so fine an idea of the beauty of all English ladies, that I was surprised to find that the Queen, who looked so fine in painting, was a small woman raised up on her chair, with long skinny arms and teeth like defence works projecting from her mouth...\"<ref name=\"EW\" />\n[[File:The Cheeke Sisters by Van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|''The Cheeke Sisters'', a late double portrait]]\nSome critics have blamed van Dyck for diverting a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition\u2014of painters such as [[William Dobson]], [[Robert Walker (painter)|Robert Walker]] and [[Isaac Fuller]]\u2014into what certainly became elegant blandness in the hands of many of van Dyck's successors, like [[Peter Lely|Lely]] or [[Godfrey Kneller|Kneller]].<ref name=\"EW\" /> The conventional view has always been more favourable: \"When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art\" (Jonathan Richardson: ''An Essay on the Theory of Painting'', 1715, 41). Thomas Gainsborough is reported to have said on his deathbed \"We are all going to heaven, and Van Dyck is of the Company.\"{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n\nA fairly small number of [[Landscape art|landscape]] pen and wash drawings or [[watercolour]]s made in England played an important part in introducing the Flemish watercolour landscape tradition to England. Some are studies, which reappear in the background of paintings, but many are signed and dated and were probably regarded as finished works to be given as presents. Several of the most detailed are of [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], a port for ships to the Continent, suggesting that van Dyck did them casually whilst waiting for wind or tide to improve.<ref>Royalton-Kisch, Martin.

Van Dyck produced drawings, and for eighteen of the portraits he himself [[etching|etched]] with great brilliance the heads and the main outlines of the figure, for an [[engraving|engraver]] to work up: \"Portrait etching had scarcely had an existence before his time, and in his work it suddenly appears at the highest point ever reached in the art\".<ref name=\"Hind\">Arthur M.

His own etched plates appear not to have been published commercially until after his death, and early states are very rare.<ref name=\"Decker\">Becker, D. P., in KL Spangeberg (ed), ''Six Centuries of Master Prints'', Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, no. 72, {{ISBN|0-931537-15-0}}</ref> Most of his plates were printed after only his work had been done. Some exist in further [[state (printmaking)|states]] after engraving had been added, sometimes obscuring his etching. He continued to add to the series until at least his departure for England, and presumably added [[Inigo Jones]] whilst in London.\n\nThe series was a great success, but was his only venture into printmaking; portraiture probably paid better, and he was constantly in demand. At his death there were eighty plates by others, of which fifty-two were of artists, as well as his own eighteen. The plates were bought by a publisher; with the plates reworked periodically as they wore out they continued to be printed for centuries, and the series added to, so that it reached over two hundred portraits by the late 18th century. In 1851, the plates were bought by the ''Calcographie du [[Louvre]]''.<ref name=\"Decker\" />\n\nThe ''Iconography'' was highly influential as a commercial model for reproductive printmaking; now forgotten series of portrait prints were enormously popular until the advent of [[photography]]: \"the importance of this series was enormous, and it provided a repertory of images that were plundered by portrait painters throughout Europe over the next couple of centuries\".{{sfn|Cust|1899}} Van Dyck's brilliant etching style, which depended on open lines and dots, was in marked contrast to that of the other great portraitist in prints of the period, [[Rembrandt]], and had little influence until the 19th century, when it had a great influence on artists such as [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] in the last major phase of portrait etching.<ref name=\"Hind\" /> [[Hyatt Mayor]] wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Etchers have studied Van Dyck ever since, for they can hope to approximate his brilliant directness, whereas nobody can hope to approach the complexity of Rembrandt's portraits.<ref>Mayor, Alpheus Hyatt.

According to a visitor he usually only made a drawing on paper, which was then enlarged onto canvas by an assistant; he then painted the head himself. The costume in which the client wished to be painted was left at the studio and often with the unfinished canvas sent out to artists specialised in rendering such clothing.{{sfn|Cust|1899}} In his last years these studio collaborations accounted for some decline in the quality of work.<ref>Brown, pp. 84-6.</ref>\n\nIn addition many copies untouched by him, or virtually so, were produced by the workshop, as well as by professional copyists and later painters. The number of paintings ascribed to him had by the 19th century become huge, as with [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and others. However, most of his assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, so compared to many masters consensus among [[art historian]]s on attributions to him is usually relatively easy to reach, and museum labelling is now mostly updated ([[English country houses|country house]] attributions may be more dubious in some cases).\n\nThe relatively few names of his assistants that are known are Dutch or Flemish. He probably preferred to use trained Flemings, as no equivalent English training existed in this period.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Van Dyck's enormous influence on English art does not come from a tradition handed down through his pupils; in fact it is not possible to document a connection to his studio for any English painter of any significance.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Dutchman [[Adriaen Hanneman]] (1604\u20131671) returned to his native [[Den Haag|The Hague]] in 1638 to become the leading portraitist there.<ref>Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p. 138 QB, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}</ref> Flemish painter [[Pieter Thijs]] studied in van Dyck's workshop as one of van Dyck's last pupils.

In his late teens he was already enjoying success as an independent painter, becoming a master in the [[Guild of Saint Luke|Antwerp guild]] in 1618.  By this time he was working in the studio of the leading northern painter of the day, [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who became a major influence on his work.  Van Dyck worked in London for some months in 1621, then returned to Flanders for a brief time, before travelling to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, based mostly in Genoa. In the late 1620s he completed his greatly admired ''Iconography'' series of portrait [[etching]]s, mostly of other artists.  He spent five years in Flanders after his return from Italy, and from 1630 was court painter for the archduchess [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], Habsburg Governor of Flanders. In 1632 he returned to London to be the main court painter, at the request of [[Charles I of England]].\n\nWith the exception of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], van Dyck and his contemporary [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, revolutionising the genre. He is best known for his portraits of European aristocracy, most notably Charles I and his family and associates. Van Dyck became the dominant influence on [[English school of painting|English portrait-painting]] for the next 150 years. He also painted [[mythological]] and [[biblical]] subjects, including altarpieces, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in [[watercolour]] and [[etching]].  His superb brushwork, apparently rather quickly painted, can usually be distinguished from the large areas painted by his many assistants.  His portrait style changed considerably between the different countries he worked in, culminating in the relaxed elegance of his last English period.  His influence extends into the modern period. The [[Van Dyke beard]] is named after him. During his lifetime, Charles I granted him a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]], and he was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], an indication of his standing at the time of his death.\n\n==Life and work==\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 008b.jpg|thumb|left|''Self-portrait'', 1613\u201314]]\n\n===Education===\nAntoon van Dyck (his Flemish name) was born to prosperous parents in Antwerp.

Since he was accustomed in the circle of Rubens to noblemen, and being naturally of elevated mind, and anxious to make himself distinguished, he therefore wore\u2014as well as silks\u2014a hat with feathers and brooches, gold chains across his chest, and was accompanied by servants.\"<ref>[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''Painting at Court'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1971, pp. 124-5</ref>\n[[File:Anthony Van Dyck, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|225px|left|''Anthony van Dyck'', by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1627\u201328)]]\nHe was mostly based in [[Genoa]], although he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed for some time in [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]], where he was quarantined during the 1624 plague, one of the worst in Sicily's history. There he produced an important series of paintings of the city's plague saint [[Saint Rosalia]]. His depictions of a young woman with flowing blonde hair wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril, became the standard iconography of the saint from that time onward and was extremely influential for Italian Baroque painters, from [[Luca Giordano]] to [[Pietro Novelli]]. Versions include those in [[Saint Rosalia (Anthony van Dyck)|Madrid]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Houston)|Houston]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (London)|London]], [[Saint Rosalie Interceding for the Plague\u2013Stricken of Palermo|New York]] and [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Palermo)|Palermo]], as well as [[Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo]] in Puerto Rico, and [[Coronation of Saint Rosalia]] in Vienna. Van Dyck's series of St Rosalia paintings have been studied by [[Gauvin Alexander Bailey]] and [[Xavier F.

In 1627, he went back to Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of [[Brussels]] he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695.{{sfn|Cust|1899}} He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630, he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large [[altarpiece]]s, and began his printmaking (see below).\n\n===London===\n[[File:Sir-Anthony-van-Dyck-Lord-John-Stuart-and-His-Brother-Lord-Bernard-Stuart.jpg|thumb|''[[Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart]]'', c. 1638, exemplifies the more intimate, but still elegant style he developed in England]]\nKing Charles I was the most passionate collector of art among the [[House of Stuart|Stuart kings]], and saw painting as a way of promoting his elevated view of the monarchy. In 1628, he bought the fabulous collection that the [[Charles I, Duke of Mantua|Duke of Mantua]] was forced to sell, and he had been trying since his accession in 1625 to bring leading foreign painters to England. In 1626, he was able to persuade [[Orazio Gentileschi]] to settle in England, later to be joined by his daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi|Artemisia]] and some of his sons. Rubens was an especial target, who eventually in 1630 came on a diplomatic mission, which included painting, and he later sent Charles more paintings from Antwerp. Rubens was very well-treated during his nine-month visit, during which he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. Charles's court portraitist, [[Daniel Mytens]], was a somewhat pedestrian Dutchman. Charles was very short, less than {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, and presented challenges to a portrait artist.\n\nVan Dyck had remained in touch with the English court and had helped King Charles's agents in their search for pictures. He had also sent back some of his own works, including a portrait (1623) of himself with [[Endymion Porter]], one of Charles's agents, a mythological work, ''Rinaldo and [[Armida]]'' (1629, now in the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]), and a religious picture for the Queen. He had also painted Charles's sister, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia]], at [[The Hague]] in 1632. In April of that year, van Dyck returned to London and was taken under the wing of the court immediately, being knighted in July and at the same time receiving a pension of \u00a3200 a year, in the grant of which he was described as ''[[Principal Painter in Ordinary|principalle Paynter in ordinary to their majesties]]''.<ref name=\"Grosvenor Gallery Stephens 1887 p. 14\">{{cite book |author=Grosvenor Gallery |last2=Stephens |first2=F.G. |title=Exhibition of the Works of Sir Anthony Van Dyck |publisher=H.

He was provided with a house on the [[River Thames]] at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the [[City of London|City]], thus avoiding the monopoly of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]]. A suite of rooms in [[Eltham Palace]], no longer used by the royal family, was also put at his disposal as a country retreat. His Blackfriars studio was frequently visited by the King and Queen (later a special causeway was built to ease their access), who hardly sat for another painter while van Dyck lived.<ref name=\"EW\" />{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 044.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Charles I at the Hunt]]'', c. 1635, Louvre]]\nHe was an immediate success in England, rapidly painting a large number of portraits of the King and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], as well as their children. Many portraits were done in several versions, to be sent as diplomatic gifts or given to supporters of the increasingly embattled king. Altogether van Dyck has been estimated to have painted forty portraits of King Charles himself, as well as about thirty of the Queen, nine of the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]], and multiple ones of other courtiers.<ref>Gaunt, William, ''English Court Painting''</ref> He painted many of the court, and also himself and his mistress, Margaret Lemon.\n\nIn England he developed a version of his style which combined a relaxed elegance and ease with an understated authority in his subjects which was to dominate English portrait-painting to the end of the 18th century. Many of these portraits have a lush landscape background. His portraits of Charles on horseback updated the grandeur of Titian's Emperor Charles V, but even more effective and original is his portrait of Charles dismounted in the [[Louvre]]: \"Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King\".<ref>Levey p. 128</ref> Although his portraits have created the classic idea of \"[[Cavalier]]\" style and dress, in fact a majority of his most important patrons in the nobility, such as [[Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton|Lord Wharton]] and the Earls of [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland]] and [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], took the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] side in the [[English Civil War]] that broke out soon after his death.{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n[[File:Anton Van Dyck - Christ carrying the Cross - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Christ carrying the Cross'']]\nThe King [[Queen in Council|in]] [[Privy Council of England|Council]] by [[letters patent]] granted van Dyck ''[[denization|denizenship]]'' in 1638, and he married Mary, the daughter of [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie#Family|Patrick Ruthven]], who, although the title was forfeited, styled himself [[Earl of Gowrie#Lords Ruthven (1488)|Lord Ruthven]].<ref>Cokayne, G.

The use of saturated colours reveals van Dyck's study of [[Titian]]]]\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 013.jpg|thumb|''[[Henrietta Maria]] and the [[dwarfism|dwarf]], [[Sir Jeffrey Hudson]]'', 1633]]\n\nIn the 17th century, demand for portraits was stronger than for other types of work. Van Dyck tried to persuade Charles to commission him to do a large-scale series of works on the history of the [[Order of the Garter]] for the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]], for which Rubens had earlier done the huge ceiling paintings (sending them from Antwerp).\n\nA sketch for one wall remains, but by 1638 Charles was too short of money to proceed.<ref name=\"EW\" /> This was a problem Vel\u00e1zquez did not have, but equally van Dyck's daily life was not encumbered by trivial court duties as Vel\u00e1zquez's was. In his visits to Paris in his last years van Dyck tried to obtain the commission to paint the Grande Gallerie of the [[Louvre]] without success.<ref>Levey, op cit p. 136</ref>\n\nA list of history paintings produced by van Dyck in England survives, compiled by van Dyck's biographer Bellori, based on information from [[Sir Kenelm Digby]].  None of these works appear to remain, except the ''Eros and Psyche'' done for the King (below).<ref name=\"EW\" /> But many other works, rather more religious than mythological, do survive, and though they are very fine, they do not reach the heights of Vel\u00e1zquez's history paintings. Earlier ones remain very much within the style of Rubens, although some of his Sicilian works are individualistic.\n\nVan Dyck's portraits certainly flattered more than Vel\u00e1zquez's. When [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, later Electoress of Hanover]], first met Queen Henrietta Maria, in exile in Holland in 1641, she wrote: \"Van Dyck's handsome portraits had given me so fine an idea of the beauty of all English ladies, that I was surprised to find that the Queen, who looked so fine in painting, was a small woman raised up on her chair, with long skinny arms and teeth like defence works projecting from her mouth...\"<ref name=\"EW\" />\n[[File:The Cheeke Sisters by Van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|''The Cheeke Sisters'', a late double portrait]]\nSome critics have blamed van Dyck for diverting a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition\u2014of painters such as [[William Dobson]], [[Robert Walker (painter)|Robert Walker]] and [[Isaac Fuller]]\u2014into what certainly became elegant blandness in the hands of many of van Dyck's successors, like [[Peter Lely|Lely]] or [[Godfrey Kneller|Kneller]].<ref name=\"EW\" /> The conventional view has always been more favourable: \"When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art\" (Jonathan Richardson: ''An Essay on the Theory of Painting'', 1715, 41). Thomas Gainsborough is reported to have said on his deathbed \"We are all going to heaven, and Van Dyck is of the Company.\"{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n\nA fairly small number of [[Landscape art|landscape]] pen and wash drawings or [[watercolour]]s made in England played an important part in introducing the Flemish watercolour landscape tradition to England. Some are studies, which reappear in the background of paintings, but many are signed and dated and were probably regarded as finished works to be given as presents. Several of the most detailed are of [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], a port for ships to the Continent, suggesting that van Dyck did them casually whilst waiting for wind or tide to improve.<ref>Royalton-Kisch, Martin.

Van Dyck produced drawings, and for eighteen of the portraits he himself [[etching|etched]] with great brilliance the heads and the main outlines of the figure, for an [[engraving|engraver]] to work up: \"Portrait etching had scarcely had an existence before his time, and in his work it suddenly appears at the highest point ever reached in the art\".<ref name=\"Hind\">Arthur M.

His own etched plates appear not to have been published commercially until after his death, and early states are very rare.<ref name=\"Decker\">Becker, D. P., in KL Spangeberg (ed), ''Six Centuries of Master Prints'', Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, no. 72, {{ISBN|0-931537-15-0}}</ref> Most of his plates were printed after only his work had been done. Some exist in further [[state (printmaking)|states]] after engraving had been added, sometimes obscuring his etching. He continued to add to the series until at least his departure for England, and presumably added [[Inigo Jones]] whilst in London.\n\nThe series was a great success, but was his only venture into printmaking; portraiture probably paid better, and he was constantly in demand. At his death there were eighty plates by others, of which fifty-two were of artists, as well as his own eighteen. The plates were bought by a publisher; with the plates reworked periodically as they wore out they continued to be printed for centuries, and the series added to, so that it reached over two hundred portraits by the late 18th century. In 1851, the plates were bought by the ''Calcographie du [[Louvre]]''.<ref name=\"Decker\" />\n\nThe ''Iconography'' was highly influential as a commercial model for reproductive printmaking; now forgotten series of portrait prints were enormously popular until the advent of [[photography]]: \"the importance of this series was enormous, and it provided a repertory of images that were plundered by portrait painters throughout Europe over the next couple of centuries\".{{sfn|Cust|1899}} Van Dyck's brilliant etching style, which depended on open lines and dots, was in marked contrast to that of the other great portraitist in prints of the period, [[Rembrandt]], and had little influence until the 19th century, when it had a great influence on artists such as [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] in the last major phase of portrait etching.<ref name=\"Hind\" /> [[Hyatt Mayor]] wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Etchers have studied Van Dyck ever since, for they can hope to approximate his brilliant directness, whereas nobody can hope to approach the complexity of Rembrandt's portraits.<ref>Mayor, Alpheus Hyatt.

According to a visitor he usually only made a drawing on paper, which was then enlarged onto canvas by an assistant; he then painted the head himself. The costume in which the client wished to be painted was left at the studio and often with the unfinished canvas sent out to artists specialised in rendering such clothing.{{sfn|Cust|1899}} In his last years these studio collaborations accounted for some decline in the quality of work.<ref>Brown, pp. 84-6.</ref>\n\nIn addition many copies untouched by him, or virtually so, were produced by the workshop, as well as by professional copyists and later painters. The number of paintings ascribed to him had by the 19th century become huge, as with [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and others. However, most of his assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, so compared to many masters consensus among [[art historian]]s on attributions to him is usually relatively easy to reach, and museum labelling is now mostly updated ([[English country houses|country house]] attributions may be more dubious in some cases).\n\nThe relatively few names of his assistants that are known are Dutch or Flemish. He probably preferred to use trained Flemings, as no equivalent English training existed in this period.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Van Dyck's enormous influence on English art does not come from a tradition handed down through his pupils; in fact it is not possible to document a connection to his studio for any English painter of any significance.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Dutchman [[Adriaen Hanneman]] (1604\u20131671) returned to his native [[Den Haag|The Hague]] in 1638 to become the leading portraitist there.<ref>Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p. 138 QB, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}</ref> Flemish painter [[Pieter Thijs]] studied in van Dyck's workshop as one of van Dyck's last pupils.

The AmboVent respirator was engineered for mass-produced at low costs, using off-the-shelf components, without the need for complicated assembly lines. The device's entire [[Blueprint|blueprints]], mechanical & electrical designes, [[Source_code|source-codes]] and medical/engineering test reports were published on [[GitHub]] as [[open-source hardware]] and [[open-source software|software]] on the evening of 1 April 2020.\n\n==Background==\nThe AmboVent system was developed as a solution capable of automatically and repeatedly squeeze a [[Bag valve mask]] (BVM), sometimes known by the proprietary name \"Ambu bag\" or generically as a \"manual resuscitator\" or \"self-inflating bag\", to generate a simple but effective alternative ventilator, for use in extreme situations. The system can operate with any Ambu (or other manufacturers) BVM, sizes 1100 - 1475 cm{{sup|3}} volume.\n\nThe R&D task was initiated by the [[Israeli Air Force]] Electronics and Teleprocessing Base (Unit 108) and others such as First Israel Robotics and various experts and mentors who joined the endeavor on voluntary basis. This ad hoc team work, together as an open organization, aiming at providing in ultra-short time, a viable, usable, simple and intuitive to use mechanical ventilator.

In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known.<ref name=Ernster/> The introduction of [[Cell fractionation|tissue fractionation]] by [[Albert Claude]] allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that [[cytochrome oxidase]] and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitochondria. [[Eugene P. Kennedy|Eugene Kennedy]] and [[Albert L. Lehninger|Albert Lehninger]] discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.<ref name=Ernster/>\n\nThe first high-resolution electron [[micrographs]] appeared in 1952, replacing the Janus Green stains as the preferred way of visualizing the mitochondria.<ref name=Ernster/> This led to a more detailed analysis of the structure of the mitochondria, including confirmation that they were surrounded by a membrane.

In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division are linked to the [[cell cycle]]. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single-celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the [[cytoplasm]].

Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart increases fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases [[uncoupling proteins]] (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the [[adenine nucleotide translocator]] (ANT), the combination of which [[uncoupler|uncouples]] the mitochondria. Uncoupling then increases oxygen consumption by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria are uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. Decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bugger H, Abel ED | title = Mitochondria in the diabetic heart | journal = Cardiovascular Research | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 229\u2013240 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20639213 | pmc = 2952534 | doi = 10.1093/cvr/cvq239 }}</ref>\n\n===Possible relationships to aging===\nGiven the role of mitochondria as the cell's powerhouse, there may be some leakage of the high-energy [[electrons]] in the respiratory chain to form [[reactive oxygen species]].

Adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.<ref name=stryer />\n\nAcetyl-CoA, on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the [[beta-oxidation]] of [[fatty acids]], is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of acetyl-CoA is consumed for every molecule of oxaloacetate present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-CoA that produces CO<sub>2</sub> and water, with the energy thus released captured in the form of ATP.<ref name=stryer />\n\nIn the liver, the carboxylation of [[cytosol]]ic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is an early step in the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway, which converts [[lactic acid|lactate]] and de-aminated [[alanine]] into glucose,<ref name=Voet /><ref name=stryer /> under the influence of high levels of [[glucagon]] and/or [[epinephrine]] in the blood.<ref name=stryer /> Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of [[glycolysis]].<ref name=stryer />\n\nThe enzymes of the citric acid cycle are located in the mitochondrial matrix, with the exception of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], which is bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of Complex II.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = King A, Selak MA, Gottlieb E | title = Succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase: linking mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer | journal = Oncogene | volume = 25 | issue = 34 | pages = 4675\u20134682 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16892081 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1209594 }}</ref> The citric acid cycle oxidizes the acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide, and, in the process, produces reduced cofactors (three molecules of [[NADH]] and one molecule of [[FADH2|FADH<sub>2</sub>]]) that are a source of electrons for the ''[[electron transport chain]]'', and a molecule of [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] (that is readily converted to an ATP).<ref name=Voet/>\n\n====NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>: the electron transport chain====\n{{main|Electron transport chain|Oxidative phosphorylation}}\n[[File:Electron transport chain.svg|thumb|400px|Electron transport chain in the mitochondrial intermembrane space]]\n\nThe electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are transferred to oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), an energy-rich molecule,<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\" /> and hydrogen (protons) in several steps via the electron transport chain.

In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division are linked to the [[cell cycle]]. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single-celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the [[cytoplasm]]. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between [[mitochondrial fusion]] and [[mitochondrial fission|fission]], has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Seo AY, Joseph AM, Dutta D, Hwang JC, Aris JP, Leeuwenburgh C | title = New insights into the role of mitochondria in aging: mitochondrial dynamics and more | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 123 | issue = Pt 15 | pages = 2533\u20132542 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20940129 | pmc = 2912461 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.070490 }}</ref>\n\nThe hypothesis of mitochondrial binary fission has relied on the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM).

Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart increases fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases [[uncoupling proteins]] (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the [[adenine nucleotide translocator]] (ANT), the combination of which [[uncoupler|uncouples]] the mitochondria. Uncoupling then increases oxygen consumption by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria are uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. Decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bugger H, Abel ED | title = Mitochondria in the diabetic heart | journal = Cardiovascular Research | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 229\u2013240 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20639213 | pmc = 2952534 | doi = 10.1093/cvr/cvq239 }}</ref>\n\n===Possible relationships to aging===\nGiven the role of mitochondria as the cell's powerhouse, there may be some leakage of the high-energy [[electrons]] in the respiratory chain to form [[reactive oxygen species]].

Alongside these dinosaur remains were fossilized trees, suggesting that plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward. Other finds from the formation include [[tritylodonts]], [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[mammal|mammal-like]] [[reptile]]s and crow-sized [[pterosaur]]s. Surprisingly were the discovery of [[prosauropod]] remains, which were found commonly on other continents only until the Early Jurassic. However, the bone fragments found at the Hanson Formation were dated until the Middle Jurassic, millions of years later. In 2004, [[paleontologist]]s discovered partial remains of a large [[sauropod]] dinosaur that has not formally been described yet.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clearboth}}\n\n=== Invertebrate paleofauna ===\nThe insects ''[[Ademosynoides]]'' & ''[[Grahamelytron]]'' were claimed to be found on this formation, but they come from the Bajocian of a different formation.

Alongside these dinosaur remains were fossilized trees, suggesting that plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward. Other finds from the formation include [[tritylodonts]], [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[mammal|mammal-like]] [[reptile]]s and crow-sized [[pterosaur]]s. Surprisingly were the discovery of [[prosauropod]] remains, which were found commonly on other continents only until the Early Jurassic. However, the bone fragments found at the Hanson Formation were dated until the Middle Jurassic, millions of years later. In 2004, [[paleontologist]]s discovered partial remains of a large [[sauropod]] dinosaur that has not formally been described yet.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clearboth}}\n\n=== Invertebrate paleofauna ===\nThe insects ''[[Ademosynoides]]'' & ''[[Grahamelytron]]'' were claimed to be found on this formation, but they come from the Bajocian of a different formation.
