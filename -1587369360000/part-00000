Because the distance of each person's step varies, an informal [[calibration]], performed by the user, is required if presentation of the distance covered in a [[unit of length]] (such as in kilometers or miles) is desired, though there are now pedometers that use electronics and software to automatically determine how a person's step varies. Distance traveled (by walking or any other means) can be measured directly by a [[GPS receiver]].\n\nUsed originally by [[sport]]s and [[physical fitness]] enthusiasts, pedometers are now becoming popular as an everyday [[Physical exercise|exercise]] counter and motivator. Often worn on the [[belt (clothing)|belt]] and kept on all day, it can record how many steps the wearer has [[walking|walked]] that day, and thus the kilometers or miles (distance = number of steps \u00d7 step length). Some pedometers will also erroneously record movements other than walking, such as bending to tie one's shoes, or road bumps incurred while riding a vehicle, though the most advanced devices record fewer of these 'false steps'. Step counters can give encouragement to compete with oneself in [[Physical fitness|getting fit]] and losing weight.  A total of 10,000 steps per day, equivalent to {{convert|8|km|mi}}, is recommended by some to be the [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] for an active lifestyle, although this point is debated among experts. Thirty minutes of moderate walking are equivalent to 3,000-4,000 steps as determined by a pedometer.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Taking Steps toward Increased Physical Activity: Using Pedometers To Measure and Motivate| author=Tudor-Locke, Catrine| journal=President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Research Digest, Washington, DC|date=June 2002| url=https://www.presidentschallenge.org/informed/digest/docs/200206digest.pdf}}</ref> Step counters are being integrated into an increasing number of portable consumer electronic devices such as music players, smartphones, mobile phones and watches (called [[activity trackers]])\n\n==Usage==\nPedometers can be a [[motivation]] tool for people wanting to increase their physical activity.

Jiro Kato, who founded Yamasa Tokei Keiki Co., Ltd. in Tokyo, manufactured pedometers recognized to be accurate, and named them \"manpo-meter\" (later \"manpo-kei\", registered as a trademark of the company), claimed to be the world's first device to measure number of steps of walking.<ref>W Ron Sutton, Mr. Pedometer, personally know all 3 people involved</ref>\n\n==Technology==\nThe technology for a pedometer includes a mechanical sensor and software to count steps. Early forms used a mechanical switch to detect steps together with a simple counter. If one shakes these devices, one hears a lead ball sliding back and forth, or a pendulum striking stops as it swings. Today advanced step counters rely on [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inertial sensors and sophisticated software to detect steps. These [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] sensors have either 1-, 2- or 3-axis detection of acceleration. The use of [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inertial sensors permits more accurate detection of steps and fewer false positives. The software technology used to interpret the output of the inertial sensor and \"make sense of accurate steps\" varies widely. The problem is compounded by the fact that in modern day-to-day life, such step-counters are expected to count accurately on locations where users frequently carry their devices (attached to the belt, shirt/pants pocket, hand bag, backpack). In recent years more advanced approaches to measure steps have been made with the use of [[computer vision]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/2a1d784a7102288c20f722000d4d7392/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1976345|title=Optical Pedometer: A new method for distance measuring using camera phones|last=Sj\u00f6berg|first=Joakim|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Accuracy==\nThe accuracy of step counters varies widely between devices. Typically, step counters are reasonably accurate at a walking pace on a flat surface if the device is placed in its optimal position (usually vertically on the belt clip).\nAlthough traditional step counters are affected dramatically when placed at different angles and locations, recent advances have made them more robust to those non-ideal placements. Still, most step counters falsely count steps when a user is driving a car or makes other habitual motions that the device encounters throughout the day.  This error accumulates for users with moderate commutes to work.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Comparison of two waist-mounted and two ankle-mounted electronic pedometers|author1=M. Karabulut |author2=S.

The sensor communicates with an  [[iPhone]] (3GS or higher), [[iPod Touch|iPod touch]] (2nd generation or higher), [[iPod Nano|iPod nano]] (4th generation or higher), or dedicated adapter to transmit workout information such as elapsed time, distance traveled, and calories burned.\n\n====Apple iPhone 5s====\nThe [[iPhone 5s]] was the first iPhone to contain an [[Apple motion coprocessors|Apple Motion Coprocessor]] which was denoted the [[Apple M7|M7]] chip paired with the first [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] [[ARM architecture|ARM-based]] Apple processor, the [[Apple A7]] SoC (System on a Chip).  The addition of the separate always on coprocessor allows the main CPU to snooze while it tracks the motion of the phone, through the use of an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) consisting of an [[accelerometer]], [[MEMS gyroscope]] and [[Digital magnetic compass|digital compass]]. This means that it will know when you're jogging or when you're in the car, and can take that information and store it without needing to drain the battery by having the main CPU run. It can retrofit the data to apps that you download at a later date, meaning any M7-enabled app that uses the new CoreMotion API will be able to give you information on recent training.\n\n====Apple iPhone 6====\nThe [[iPhone 6]] and [[IPhone 6 Plus|6 Plus]] contains the next generation of the Apple Motion Coprocessors with the M8 motion coprocessor, this chip was paired with the vastly improved [[Apple A8]] SoC processor and gained the added sensor input of a [[Bosch Rexroth|Bosch]] Sensortech [[Barometer]] allowing the M8 to sense changes in elevation by the change in [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]].\n\n====Apple iPhone 6s====\nThe [[IPhone 6S|iPhone 6s]] and [[IPhone 6S Plus|6s Plus]] improved the Apple Motion Coprocessors by adding integrating it into the die of the new [[Apple A9]] SoC processor.  This saves space allowing for the reduction of the [[logic board]] size as well as reduced power usage within the phone.  This chip is also at the heart of the [[iPhone SE]].  A variant of the Apple A9, the [[Apple A9X]] also incorporates the M9 processor on-die and drives the Apple [[iPad Pro]].\n\n====Apple Watch====\nThe [[Apple Watch]] extended step-counting capability to Apple's first wearable device using the accelerometer and gyroscope integrated in the [[Apple S1]] SIP ([[System in package]]). Apple Watch works in parallel with a connected iPhone to improve accuracy of the user's step count.<ref>apple.com/watch</ref>\n\n===Fitbit===\nThe [[Fitbit]] is an always-on electronic pedometer, that in addition to counting steps also displays distance traveled, altitude climbed (via a number of flights of steps count), calories burned, current intensity, and time of day. Worn in an armband at night, it also purports to measure the length and quality of a user's sleep. Inbuilt is a daily target, of 10,000 steps and 10 flights of stairs. Connected by USB with a computer, the user's data is automatically uploaded and displayed via a web-based profile page, that keeps track of historical data, to which can be added food consumption data. Based on activity users are awarded badges for daily step and climbing targets, as well as 'lifetime' awards for same. In the US and UK users can also download an iOS or Android app for recording and display of data.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fitbit Ultra Wireless Activity Tracker review|url=http://techstyles.com.au/fitbit-wireless-activity-tracker-review/sports-technology/|publisher=www.techstyles.com.au|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> Most Fitbit devices estimate distance traveled based on steps counted, the intensity of the steps and the user's profile data (specifically gender and height).

The pedometer application tracks steps taken, time elapsed and distance traveled. However the application cannot run continuously as it drains the phone's battery and is therefore of limited use.\n\n====Nokia Sports Tracker====\n[[Nokia Sports Tracker]] features pedometer for Nokia [[Symbian]] phones with an [[Accelerometer]]. Accelerometers are included in phones to save correct orientation on photos and to improve the GPS positioning feature.\n\n====Nokia Step Counter====\nNokia Step Counter is a free application available at [[Nokia Beta Labs]] which works on a wide range of N-Series Nokia phones. The pedometer application tracks steps taken, time elapsed and distance traveled. This application can be left running all day as it is not a huge drain on the battery.\n\n===Sony Ericsson W710 Walkman phone, W580 Walkman phone===\nThe [[Sony Ericsson W710]] and [[Sony Ericsson W580i|W580]] [[Walkman]] phones use embedded 2 axis [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inertial sensors to detect the steps a user takes.  The W710 is a clamshell phone and displays the user's steps on the external display.  The W710 must be closed in order for it to count steps.  When the step counter is activated, it counts detected steps during the day, and at midnight it stores the counter in a day-by-day history and resets it to zero.\n\n===Nintendo DS/Nintendo 3DS/Wii U===\nOn November 1, 2008, [[Nintendo]] released the [[Nintendo DS]] title {{nihongo|'''''[[Personal Trainer: Walking]]'''''|{{lang-ja|\u6b69\u3044\u3066\u308f\u304b\u308b \u751f\u6d3b\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0}}DS|Aruite Wakaru Seikatsu Rhythm DS}}, which includes two pedometers. They connect to the game card via [[infrared]] signals.\n\nOn September 12, 2009, Nintendo released [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] in Japan. Each game comes bundled with a device called a [[Pok\u00e9walker]], which functions as a pedometer and allows players to transfer one Pok\u00e9mon from their game to the Pok\u00e9walker via infrared signals. Unlike the ''Personal Trainer: Walking'' pedometers, the Pok\u00e9walker features a small LCD screen and multiple buttons. Walking with the Pok\u00e9walker earns experience points for the [[Pok\u00e9mon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pokewalker|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/special/hgss/pokewalker/|publisher=www.pokemon.co.jp|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Nintendo 3DS, released March 27, 2011, features an internal pedometer that counts and records daily step counts while in sleep mode.

Because the distance of each person's step varies, an informal [[calibration]], performed by the user, is required if presentation of the distance covered in a [[unit of length]] (such as in kilometers or miles) is desired, though there are now pedometers that use electronics and software to automatically determine how a person's step varies. Distance traveled (by walking or any other means) can be measured directly by a [[GPS receiver]].\n\nUsed originally by [[sport]]s and [[physical fitness]] enthusiasts, pedometers are now becoming popular as an everyday [[Physical exercise|exercise]] counter and motivator. Often worn on the [[belt (clothing)|belt]] and kept on all day, it can record how many steps the wearer has [[walking|walked]] that day, and thus the kilometers or miles (distance = number of steps \u00d7 step length). Some pedometers will also erroneously record movements other than walking, such as bending to tie one's shoes, or road bumps incurred while riding a vehicle, though the most advanced devices record fewer of these 'false steps'. Step counters can give encouragement to compete with oneself in [[Physical fitness|getting fit]] and losing weight.  A total of 10,000 steps per day, equivalent to {{convert|8|km|mi}}, is recommended by some to be the [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] for an active lifestyle, although this point is debated among experts. Thirty minutes of moderate walking are equivalent to 3,000-4,000 steps as determined by a pedometer.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Taking Steps toward Increased Physical Activity: Using Pedometers To Measure and Motivate| author=Tudor-Locke, Catrine| journal=President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Research Digest, Washington, DC|date=June 2002| url=https://www.presidentschallenge.org/informed/digest/docs/200206digest.pdf}}</ref> Step counters are being integrated into an increasing number of portable consumer electronic devices such as music players, smartphones, mobile phones and watches (called [[activity trackers]])\n\n==Usage==\nPedometers can be a [[motivation]] tool for people wanting to increase their physical activity.

Early forms used a mechanical switch to detect steps together with a simple counter. If one shakes these devices, one hears a lead ball sliding back and forth, or a pendulum striking stops as it swings. Today advanced step counters rely on [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inertial sensors and sophisticated software to detect steps. These [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] sensors have either 1-, 2- or 3-axis detection of acceleration. The use of [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inertial sensors permits more accurate detection of steps and fewer false positives. The software technology used to interpret the output of the inertial sensor and \"make sense of accurate steps\" varies widely. The problem is compounded by the fact that in modern day-to-day life, such step-counters are expected to count accurately on locations where users frequently carry their devices (attached to the belt, shirt/pants pocket, hand bag, backpack). In recent years more advanced approaches to measure steps have been made with the use of [[computer vision]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/2a1d784a7102288c20f722000d4d7392/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1976345|title=Optical Pedometer: A new method for distance measuring using camera phones|last=Sj\u00f6berg|first=Joakim|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Accuracy==\nThe accuracy of step counters varies widely between devices. Typically, step counters are reasonably accurate at a walking pace on a flat surface if the device is placed in its optimal position (usually vertically on the belt clip).\nAlthough traditional step counters are affected dramatically when placed at different angles and locations, recent advances have made them more robust to those non-ideal placements. Still, most step counters falsely count steps when a user is driving a car or makes other habitual motions that the device encounters throughout the day.  This error accumulates for users with moderate commutes to work.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Comparison of two waist-mounted and two ankle-mounted electronic pedometers|author1=M. Karabulut |author2=S.

The sensor communicates with an  [[iPhone]] (3GS or higher), [[iPod Touch|iPod touch]] (2nd generation or higher), [[iPod Nano|iPod nano]] (4th generation or higher), or dedicated adapter to transmit workout information such as elapsed time, distance traveled, and calories burned.\n\n====Apple iPhone 5s====\nThe [[iPhone 5s]] was the first iPhone to contain an [[Apple motion coprocessors|Apple Motion Coprocessor]] which was denoted the [[Apple M7|M7]] chip paired with the first [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] [[ARM architecture|ARM-based]] Apple processor, the [[Apple A7]] SoC (System on a Chip).  The addition of the separate always on coprocessor allows the main CPU to snooze while it tracks the motion of the phone, through the use of an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) consisting of an [[accelerometer]], [[MEMS gyroscope]] and [[Digital magnetic compass|digital compass]]. This means that it will know when you're jogging or when you're in the car, and can take that information and store it without needing to drain the battery by having the main CPU run. It can retrofit the data to apps that you download at a later date, meaning any M7-enabled app that uses the new CoreMotion API will be able to give you information on recent training.\n\n====Apple iPhone 6====\nThe [[iPhone 6]] and [[IPhone 6 Plus|6 Plus]] contains the next generation of the Apple Motion Coprocessors with the M8 motion coprocessor, this chip was paired with the vastly improved [[Apple A8]] SoC processor and gained the added sensor input of a [[Bosch Rexroth|Bosch]] Sensortech [[Barometer]] allowing the M8 to sense changes in elevation by the change in [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]].\n\n====Apple iPhone 6s====\nThe [[IPhone 6S|iPhone 6s]] and [[IPhone 6S Plus|6s Plus]] improved the Apple Motion Coprocessors by adding integrating it into the die of the new [[Apple A9]] SoC processor.  This saves space allowing for the reduction of the [[logic board]] size as well as reduced power usage within the phone.  This chip is also at the heart of the [[iPhone SE]].  A variant of the Apple A9, the [[Apple A9X]] also incorporates the M9 processor on-die and drives the Apple [[iPad Pro]].\n\n====Apple Watch====\nThe [[Apple Watch]] extended step-counting capability to Apple's first wearable device using the accelerometer and gyroscope integrated in the [[Apple S1]] SIP ([[System in package]]). Apple Watch works in parallel with a connected iPhone to improve accuracy of the user's step count.<ref>apple.com/watch</ref>\n\n===Fitbit===\nThe [[Fitbit]] is an always-on electronic pedometer, that in addition to counting steps also displays distance traveled, altitude climbed (via a number of flights of steps count), calories burned, current intensity, and time of day. Worn in an armband at night, it also purports to measure the length and quality of a user's sleep. Inbuilt is a daily target, of 10,000 steps and 10 flights of stairs. Connected by USB with a computer, the user's data is automatically uploaded and displayed via a web-based profile page, that keeps track of historical data, to which can be added food consumption data. Based on activity users are awarded badges for daily step and climbing targets, as well as 'lifetime' awards for same. In the US and UK users can also download an iOS or Android app for recording and display of data.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fitbit Ultra Wireless Activity Tracker review|url=http://techstyles.com.au/fitbit-wireless-activity-tracker-review/sports-technology/|publisher=www.techstyles.com.au|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> Most Fitbit devices estimate distance traveled based on steps counted, the intensity of the steps and the user's profile data (specifically gender and height).

The pedometer application tracks steps taken, time elapsed and distance traveled. However the application cannot run continuously as it drains the phone's battery and is therefore of limited use.\n\n====Nokia Sports Tracker====\n[[Nokia Sports Tracker]] features pedometer for Nokia [[Symbian]] phones with an [[Accelerometer]]. Accelerometers are included in phones to save correct orientation on photos and to improve the GPS positioning feature.\n\n====Nokia Step Counter====\nNokia Step Counter is a free application available at [[Nokia Beta Labs]] which works on a wide range of N-Series Nokia phones. The pedometer application tracks steps taken, time elapsed and distance traveled. This application can be left running all day as it is not a huge drain on the battery.\n\n===Sony Ericsson W710 Walkman phone, W580 Walkman phone===\nThe [[Sony Ericsson W710]] and [[Sony Ericsson W580i|W580]] [[Walkman]] phones use embedded 2 axis [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inertial sensors to detect the steps a user takes.  The W710 is a clamshell phone and displays the user's steps on the external display.  The W710 must be closed in order for it to count steps.  When the step counter is activated, it counts detected steps during the day, and at midnight it stores the counter in a day-by-day history and resets it to zero.\n\n===Nintendo DS/Nintendo 3DS/Wii U===\nOn November 1, 2008, [[Nintendo]] released the [[Nintendo DS]] title {{nihongo|'''''[[Personal Trainer: Walking]]'''''|{{lang-ja|\u6b69\u3044\u3066\u308f\u304b\u308b \u751f\u6d3b\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0}}DS|Aruite Wakaru Seikatsu Rhythm DS}}, which includes two pedometers.

Eddie Hearn's [[Matchroom Sport]] promoted the fight with it being billed \"Edge of Glory\" as both fighters saw this fight as a stepping stone to a shot at a world title. The fight was shown live on [[Sky Sports 1]]. The weigh in took place in Sheffield's [[Sheffield Winter Garden|Winter Gardens]] on 6 July with Brook weighing in at 10&nbsp;st 6&nbsp;lb 10&nbsp;oz (60.16&nbsp;kg) and [[Carson Jones|Jones]] weighing slightly less at 10&nbsp;st 6&nbsp;lb 6&nbsp;oz (60.04&nbsp;kg). Brook dominated the early rounds moving well and connecting regularly with nice two and three punch combinations however as the fight went on he began to tire and Jones was able to land shots of his own. Brook's nose was broken in the 8th round which made it yet more difficult for him to come back into the fight. He was almost floored in the final round but was able to hold on until the bell. Brook did enough in the early rounds to win the fight by [[majority decision]], as the judges' scorecards read 114\u2013114, 116\u2013113, and 115\u2013113 in Brook's favour. Brook was taken to Hospital after the fight due to blood loss from his broken nose.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/18742064|title=Kell Brook v Carson Jones: Brook survives scare to win on points|date=2012-07-07|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2012/7/7/3143697/brook-vs-jones-results-kell-brook-edges-carson-jones-majority-decision-war-british-boxing-news|title=Brook vs Jones Results: Kell Brook Edges Carson Jones in Sheffield War|date=2012-07-07|website=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012 [[Matchroom Sport]] announced that Brook would face Argentinian veteran [[Hector Saldivia]] at the [[Motorpoint Arena Sheffield|Motorpoint Arena]] in [[Sheffield]] on 20 October 2012. The winner would then become the [[mandatory challenger]] for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] welterweight title held at the time by [[Randall Bailey]]. At a packed weigh in the day before the fight at Sheffield's [[Meadowhall Centre]] both fighters weighed in under the 147&nbsp;lbs limit. Brook started strongly knocking Saldivia down midway through the first round. The second round was very similar with Saldivia unable to deal with Brook's superior accuracy and power. In the third Brook landed a solid well timed straight which sent the Argentinian to the floor again. This time he struggled to get up as his legs wobbled beneath him and the referee stopped the contest in the third round.<ref>{{Citation|last=TheProdigy|title=Kell Brook vs Hector Saldivia full fight HD|date=2015-10-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hO6SnirpE4|accessdate=2017-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2012/10/20/3531628/brook-vs-saldivia-results-kell-brook-wins-easy-tko-3-ibf-eliminator-boxing-news|title=Brook demolishes Saldivia in three|date=2012-10-20|website=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==== Brook vs. Alexander cancellation ====\nAfter becoming the mandatory challenger, Brook was set to fight [[Devon Alexander]] for the world title on 19 January 2013 at the [[Nokia Theatre L.A. Live|Nokia Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. However, Brook announced he had sustained an ankle injury and the fight was pushed back until 23 February 2013 and the venue changed to the [[Detroit Masonic Temple|Masonic Temple]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Then Alexander announced he had a bicep injury causing the fight to be rescheduled yet again for 18 May 2013 in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. However, Kell would later pull out of the fight again after injuring his foot killing the fight for a third time, with fellow Brit and [[Matchroom Sport|Matchroom]] Stable mate [[Lee Purdy]] taking his place but retiring in the 7th round.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/boxing/sport/story/202593.html|title=Brook-Alexander postponed for third time|work=ESPN.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/21330836|title=Kell Brook gutted world title fight with Devon Alexander postponed|date=2013-02-04|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n====Brook vs. Jones II, Senchenko====\nAfter the saga with Devon Alexander, Brook took a fight with [[Carson Jones]] in Hull on 13 July 2013, in a rematch of their original fight just over a year previously, which Brook won via a narrow majority decision. Brook took the early rounds of this contest looking far too powerful and quick for the American. Kell went on to win by stoppage in the 8th round to take his record to 30-0.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1703082-kell-brook-vs-carson-jones-results-brook-defeats-jones-in-rematch|title=Kell Brook vs. Carson Jones Results: Brook Defeats Jones in Rematch|last=Ballentine|first=Alex|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIt was announced shortly after the rematch with [[Carson Jones]] that Brook would next face [[Vyacheslav Senchenko]] at the [[Motorpoint Arena Sheffield|Motorpoint Arena]] in [[Sheffield]] on 26 October 2013. Senchenko had recently beaten [[Ricky Hatton]] forcing him to retire for good from boxing. Brook said he was using this as motivation and wanted to \"get revenge\" for a British boxing hero and a personal friend within the sport. Hatton was ringside for the fight and spoke to Kell in the dressing room just prior to the fight. The opening and second rounds were very cagey encounters with neither fighter wanting to give too much away with Brook perhaps using his jab more effectively and taking both the rounds. In the third Brook knocked his opponent down with a powerful right with Senchenko taking the 8 count and continuing. Brook started the fourth strongly out boxing his Ukrainian opponent although Senchenko did unsteady Brook for a few seconds before Brook sent Sencheko back to the canvas with another right. Referee Shada Murdaugh concluded that Senchenko was in no position to continue and Brook was declared the winner by technical knockout.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-2477687/Kell-Brook-stops-Vyacheslav-Senchenko-rounds.html|title=Brook stops Hatton-conqueror Senchenko to earn shot at the IBF welterweight title|date=26 October 2013|work=Daily Mail |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Brook vs. Porter====\n{{Main|Kell Brook vs. Shawn Porter}}\nAfter beating Senchenko, Brook was once again the mandatory challenger for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] welterweight world title. [[Shawn Porter]] was the favorite to win and came out aggressively as he pressurized Brook, relying heavily on looping shots. Brook kept his composure, however, and showcased formidable defensive attributes, strength, and clean punching throughout the fight. Brook's technical ability took over after the middle rounds as the straight one-two combinations hurt Porter. Brook defeated Porter to win the title at the [[StubHub Center]] in [[Carson, California]] on 16 August 2014 by a [[majority decision]] 114\u2013114, 116\u2013112, and 117\u2013111. Brook landed 158 of his 441 punches (36%), mostly jabs. Porter threw 308 more power punches, in total landing 156 of 626 thrown (25%). Porter felt as though he won the fight, \"I thought that I was effective with my attack, but he was ready. I'm not giving any excuses. I want the rematch. I'll find him where he's at, and I'll take it from him.\" Brook claimed he wanted the all-British showdown with [[Amir Khan (boxer)|Amir Khan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/11365012/kell-brook-edges-shawn-porter-claims-ibf-welterweight-title|title=Brook edges Porter for IBF welterweight title|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2165361-shawn-porter-vs-kell-brook-live-round-by-round-results-and-highlights|title=Shawn Porter vs. Kell Brook: Live Round-by-Round Results and Highlights|last=McRae|first=Kevin|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/17/kell-brook-shawn-porter-ibf-title-amir-khan-awaits-boxing|title=Kell Brook beats Shawn Porter to win IBF title while Amir Khan awaits|last=Association|first=Press|date=2014-08-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The fight did not generate as many viewers as expected, an average of 661,000 viewers on Showtime.

In round two, a straight right hand wobbled Dan. Brook followed up with a right uppercut that sent Dan to the canvas. Soon after, Brook landed two straight right hands, the first wobbling Dan and the second creating another knockdown. In the fourth round, Brook threw a straight right and left hand that hurt Dan and followed up with a furry that resulted in the third knockdown.

Brook successfully defended his [[IBF]] welterweight for the second time. Brook landed his jab from the start and picked up the pace as the fight went on, cutting off the ring and walking through his opponent. Gavin remained defensive but did occasionally find success. In round six, Brook showed versatility in throwing a variety of combinations, mixing soft and hard punches, while Gavin attempted to avoid trading. As Brook landed an uppercut however, Gavin exchanged a right hand, which was countered by Brook's straight left hand. Gavin staggered back to the ropes, and the referee stopped the fight as Brook threw another flurry.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/9870580/kell-brook-stops-frankie-gavin-in-six-rounds-to-defend-ibf-world-welterweight-title |title=Kell Brook stops Frankie Gavin in six rounds to defend IBF world welterweight title &#124; Boxing News |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=2015-06-01 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/32949122|title=Kell Brook beats Frankie Gavin to defend IBF welterweight title|date=2015-05-30|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n====Brook vs. Bizier====\nOn 2 September 2015, Hearn announced a deal had been reached for Brook to defend his title against Argentine slugger [[Diego Chaves (boxer)|Diego Chaves]] (23-2-1, 19 KOs), after a deal could not be made with [[Brandon R\u00edos|Brandon Rios]]. The fight was scheduled to take place at the [[Sheffield Arena|Motorpoint Arena]] in Sheffield on 24 October, which would be Brook's third fight in seven months.

Eddie Hearn's [[Matchroom Sport]] promoted the fight with it being billed \"Edge of Glory\" as both fighters saw this fight as a stepping stone to a shot at a world title. The fight was shown live on [[Sky Sports 1]]. The weigh in took place in Sheffield's [[Sheffield Winter Garden|Winter Gardens]] on 6 July with Brook weighing in at 10&nbsp;st 6&nbsp;lb 10&nbsp;oz (60.16&nbsp;kg) and [[Carson Jones|Jones]] weighing slightly less at 10&nbsp;st 6&nbsp;lb 6&nbsp;oz (60.04&nbsp;kg). Brook dominated the early rounds moving well and connecting regularly with nice two and three punch combinations however as the fight went on he began to tire and Jones was able to land shots of his own. Brook's nose was broken in the 8th round which made it yet more difficult for him to come back into the fight. He was almost floored in the final round but was able to hold on until the bell. Brook did enough in the early rounds to win the fight by [[majority decision]], as the judges' scorecards read 114\u2013114, 116\u2013113, and 115\u2013113 in Brook's favour.

At a packed weigh in the day before the fight at Sheffield's [[Meadowhall Centre]] both fighters weighed in under the 147&nbsp;lbs limit. Brook started strongly knocking Saldivia down midway through the first round. The second round was very similar with Saldivia unable to deal with Brook's superior accuracy and power.

Senchenko had recently beaten [[Ricky Hatton]] forcing him to retire for good from boxing. Brook said he was using this as motivation and wanted to \"get revenge\" for a British boxing hero and a personal friend within the sport. Hatton was ringside for the fight and spoke to Kell in the dressing room just prior to the fight. The opening and second rounds were very cagey encounters with neither fighter wanting to give too much away with Brook perhaps using his jab more effectively and taking both the rounds. In the third Brook knocked his opponent down with a powerful right with Senchenko taking the 8 count and continuing. Brook started the fourth strongly out boxing his Ukrainian opponent although Senchenko did unsteady Brook for a few seconds before Brook sent Sencheko back to the canvas with another right. Referee Shada Murdaugh concluded that Senchenko was in no position to continue and Brook was declared the winner by technical knockout.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-2477687/Kell-Brook-stops-Vyacheslav-Senchenko-rounds.html|title=Brook stops Hatton-conqueror Senchenko to earn shot at the IBF welterweight title|date=26 October 2013|work=Daily Mail |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Brook vs. Porter====\n{{Main|Kell Brook vs. Shawn Porter}}\nAfter beating Senchenko, Brook was once again the mandatory challenger for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] welterweight world title. [[Shawn Porter]] was the favorite to win and came out aggressively as he pressurized Brook, relying heavily on looping shots. Brook kept his composure, however, and showcased formidable defensive attributes, strength, and clean punching throughout the fight. Brook's technical ability took over after the middle rounds as the straight one-two combinations hurt Porter. Brook defeated Porter to win the title at the [[StubHub Center]] in [[Carson, California]] on 16 August 2014 by a [[majority decision]] 114\u2013114, 116\u2013112, and 117\u2013111. Brook landed 158 of his 441 punches (36%), mostly jabs. Porter threw 308 more power punches, in total landing 156 of 626 thrown (25%). Porter felt as though he won the fight, \"I thought that I was effective with my attack, but he was ready. I'm not giving any excuses. I want the rematch. I'll find him where he's at, and I'll take it from him.\" Brook claimed he wanted the all-British showdown with [[Amir Khan (boxer)|Amir Khan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/11365012/kell-brook-edges-shawn-porter-claims-ibf-welterweight-title|title=Brook edges Porter for IBF welterweight title|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2165361-shawn-porter-vs-kell-brook-live-round-by-round-results-and-highlights|title=Shawn Porter vs. Kell Brook: Live Round-by-Round Results and Highlights|last=McRae|first=Kevin|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/17/kell-brook-shawn-porter-ibf-title-amir-khan-awaits-boxing|title=Kell Brook beats Shawn Porter to win IBF title while Amir Khan awaits|last=Association|first=Press|date=2014-08-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The fight did not generate as many viewers as expected, an average of 661,000 viewers on Showtime.

After the bout, Brook and Hearn talked about potential unification fights against the likes of Tim Bradley, [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], Keith Thurman and [[Jessie Vargas|Jesse Vargas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/15074690/kell-brook-stops-kevin-bizier-two-rounds-retain-world-title|title=Brook stops Bizier to retain world title|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\n====Jessie Vargas negotiations====\nIt was announced on 12 May 2016 that negotiations for a unification fight with [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] titleholder [[Jessie Vargas]] (27-1, 10 KOs) were under way.

The fight took place on 10 September 2016 at the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]] in London. Brook was scheduled to fight in a unification bout against [[Jessie Vargas]]. Likewise, there were negotiations for Golovkin to fight [[Chris Eubank Jr.]] However, negotiations fell through and Brook agreed to move up two weight divisions to challenge Golovkin.

Although they granted Golovkin a special permit to take the fight, they stated that their title would not be at stake. The reason for the withdrawal was because Brook had never competed in the middleweight division. WBA president Gilberto Mendoza Jr. said, \"What I most regret is that there are no boxers at 160 pounds who will fight against 'Triple G,' and Brook has to move up two divisions to fight against him.\" The Golovkin camp were said to be disappointed with the decision with promoter Tom Loeffler saying, \"somehow the WBA thought it was too dangerous for a welterweight to move up to middleweight to fight the biggest puncher in boxing. I guess that is a compliment to GGG as they sanctioned [Adrien] [[Adrien Broner|Broner]] moving up two divisions [from lightweight to welterweight] to fight [[Paulie Malignaggi]] in 2013, and [[Roy Jones Jr.|Roy Jones]] moving up two divisions [from light heavyweight to heavyweight] to fight [[John Ruiz]] [in 2003] for WBA titles, and Kell Brook is undefeated and considered a top pound-for-pound boxer.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/17461260/gennady-golovkin-wba-middleweight-title-not-stake-fight-kell-brook|title=Golovkin's WBA title not on line in Brook fight|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/wba-declines-sanction-golovkin-brook-middleweight-bout--108333|title=WBA Declines To Sanction Golovkin-Brook Middleweight Bout - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-14}}</ref>\n\nOn the night, Brook was staggered early in the first round, but kept his composure, growing stronger as the rounds unfolded. In the opening rounds, he was trading blows with Golovkin, but suffered a damaged eye socket, and after heavy punishment in the fifth, trainer Dominic Ingle threw in the towel, losing by TKO.

In round 10, Spence, having Brook against the ropes unloaded some heavy power shots, which caused Brook to take a knee. In round 11, before the fight was stopped, Brook motioned many times that he couldn't see through his left eye and voluntarily took a knee, again counting as a knockdown.

Brook rejected the idea and insisted they fight at catchweight.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/amir-khan-vs-kell-brook-active-talks-says-hearn--132661|title=Amir Khan vs. Kell Brook in Active Talks, Says Hearn|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingnewsandviews.com/2018/10/19/amir-khan-demands-same-contract-clause-for-brook-fight-as-canelo-vs-fielding/|title=Amir Khan Demands Same Contract Clause For Brook Fight As Canelo vs Fielding|date=2018-10-19|work=Boxing News and Views|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/kell-brook-aims-december-fight-no-issue-with-147-khan--132798|title=Kell Brook Aims For December Fight, No Issue With 147 For Khan|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-us}}</ref> On 19 October, according to The Sheffield Star, Brook had split with longtime trainer Dom Ingle.

After 12 round, the three judges scored the fight comfortably 118\u2013110, 119\u2013109, and 117\u2013111 in favour of Brook. Zerafa fought weight and did enough to get a couple of rounds. Brook started the fight quick landing shots on Zerafa in the opening couple of rounds. He started to then slow down his workrate and by the midway point, his punch output began to drop. Brook, although landed plenty himself, allowed himself to be hit more than usual. It was the first time Brook went the 12 round distance since 2014 when he won the IBF title against Porter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/kell-brook-goes-distance-beats-zerafa-results--134445|title=Kell Brook Goes The Distance, Beats Zerafa in WBA Eliminator|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref> After the fight, Brook admitted he was not at his best and also stated his performance might tempt a lot of boxers to now get in the ring with him.

A few days later, Hearn made it public that he had offered Khan \u00a38m [$10.1 million] flat fee, plus an upside of the revenue to fight Brook.

Its [[rohe|''takiw\u0101'']] (tribal area) is the largest in New Zealand, and extends from White Bluffs / Te Parinui o Whiti (southeast of [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]]), Mount Mahanga and [[Kahurangi Point]] in the north to [[Stewart Island]] in the south. The ''takiw\u0101'' comprises  18 [[r\u016bnanga]] (governance areas) corresponding to traditional settlements.\n\nSome definitions of Ng\u0101i Tahu include the [[Waitaha (South Island iwi)|Waitaha]] and [[K\u0101ti M\u0101moe]] tribes who lived in the South Island prior to the arrival of Ng\u0101i T\u0101hu.<ref name=\"tkmentry\" /> The five primary [[hap\u016b]] (sub-tribes) of the three tribes are K\u0101ti Kur\u012b, Ng\u0101ti Irakehu, K\u0101ti Huirapa, Ng\u0101i T\u016b\u0101huriri and Ng\u0101i Te Ruakihikihi. \n\n==History==\nNg\u0101i Tahu trace their traditional descent from Tahup\u014dtiki, the younger brother of Porou Ariki who is the founding ancestor of [[Ng\u0101ti Porou]].

The ancestress T\u016bhaitara, senior granddaughter of Rakawahakura, insulting her husband Chief Marukore of Ng\u0101ti Mamoe,<ref name=\"Tainui\"/><ref name=\"Papanui\">{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/papanui/| title=Papanui| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> or [[Te K\u0101hea]], and his ancestry, as well as various other exchanges are the reason for war between their two tribes. He was a local viewed as below her status. The pair had 11 children in total, including Tamaraeroa, Huirapa, Tahumat\u0101, Pahirua and Hinehou.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/> Huirapa is the son who K\u0101ti Huirapa descends from.\n\nT\u016bhaitara instructed Tamaraeroa and Huirapa to kill Marukore at a place called Papanui.<ref name=\"Papanui\"/> However, Marukore knew of their plan and defeated them in the Battle of H\u016bkete after which their sister Hinehou laid them on the floor of her [[whare]], leaving her belongings with them before burning down the building in an incident now known as 'K\u0101rara K\u014dpae' (The Laying Down of Fighting Chiefs).<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/> Alternatively, Marukore himself burned their bodies on a funeral pyre.<ref name=\"Papanui\"/>\n\nNext the brothers Pahirua and Tahumat\u0101 sought out to defeat Marukore. As they were about to take advice from a local chief named R\u0101kaimoari, his daughter Hinewai-a-tapu made a remark about Tahumat\u0101 which sparked the Battle of Te Pakiaka ('The Roots') that lasted for some days. It was named so because Tahumat\u0101 caught Hinewai-a-tapu hiding under some tree roots, and made her his wife.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\nEventually the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe chief Hikaororoa managed to trap Marukore's party in a whare. Hikaororoa asked for the 'chief of the long plume' to come to the door to be cannibalised. Marukore's younger cousin Rokopaekawa took Marukore's head dress (the sign of status) and was sacrificed instead. However he did not cook properly, and the head dress's plume was still visible in the dirt. This was considered a bad omen and so the body was discarded with the incident being called 'Pikit\u016broa' ('The Long Standing Feather Plumes')<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\nMarukore and T\u016bhaitara would both die in the Battle of Tapapanui. This would send the remaining children to a place called Te Oreorehua in [[Wairarapa]] where Hinehou was already living, and southward to [[Te Whanganui-a-Tara]] within a few generations.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\n====Migration to the South Island====\nIn [[Wellington]] a senier chief, Te Aohikuraki, the grandson of T\u016bhaitara, slept with R\u0101kaitekura, a high ranking Ng\u0101i Tahu woman while her husband T\u016bmaro was away visiting his family. Of this Te Hikutawatawa (later named T\u016b\u0101huriri), the ancestor of Ng\u0101i T\u016b\u0101huriri, was born a bastard. T\u016bmaro left for Waimea, near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] with his family members, leaving Te Aohikuraki and Te Hikutawatawa behind. Te Hikutawatawa would later visit Waimea seeking to learn of his heritage. Te Hikutawatawa was outraged his [[mana]] being defiled by T\u016bmaro's father Kahukura-te-paku, and so returned to destroy the site, killing everyone who lived there. After this he was known as T\u016b\u0101huriri ('t\u016b\u0101hu' meaning 'sacred altar', 'riri' meaning 'to be angry').<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\">{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/tuahuriri/| title=T\u016b\u0101huriri| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLate in the 17th century the tribe began migrating to the northern part of the South Island under the leadership of the Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b chief P\u016braho, with his sons Maru and Mako, establishing Kaihinu [[P\u0101]] in the [[Tory Channel|Tory Channel / Kura Te Au]]. After an incident in which a Ng\u0101i Tahu war party had desecrated the bones of one of [[Ng\u0101i Tara]]'s ancestors, P\u016braho was murdered in revenge early one morning when he went to relieve himself. This broke out into a series of battles between the two tribes.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nOn one occasion when Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b fought with [[Rangit\u0101ne]], Chief T\u016bteurutira had mistaken one of his captives, Hinerongo, as one of the enemy's women. She was in fact a member of Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe who had already been taken captive by Rangit\u0101ne, and so he returned her to Matariki P\u0101 on the [[Clarence River, New Zealand|Clarence River]]. This struck a new alliance between their tribes, after which they successfully attacked Rangit\u0101ne in the [[Wairau River|Wairau Valley]]. For this Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Clarence River to Ng\u0101i Tahu, and T\u016bteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the p\u0101. Ng\u0101i Tahu continued to push south, conquering [[Kaik\u014dura]].<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nBy the 1690s Ng\u0101i Tahu had settled in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], including Ng\u0101ti Irakehu peaceably settling among [[Banks Peninsula]]'s Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/> From there they spread further south and into the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. As a consequence for ignoring Chief Te Aweawe's advice to strap two canoes together for a safer passage across the [[Cook Strait]], T\u016b\u0101huriri is said to have been left to drown along with T\u016bmaro, and likely his eldest son H\u0101mua while trying to leave Wellington as some of the last members to make the migration.<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\"/>\n\n===18th century===\nT\u016b\u0101huriri's second eldest son T\u016brakautahi, the famous chief of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhaitara born with a [[club foot]], settled the p\u0101 at [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]] along with other chiefs, which at the time was surrounded by swampland. He also established the p\u0101 north of [[Kaiapoi]] over a Waitaha site, and claimed the area around Banks Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/turakautahi/| title=T\u016brakautahi| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Interestingly, it is said to have been his decision to learn the genealogies and stories of the West Coast tribes [[Ng\u0101ti T\u016bmatak\u014dkiri]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Wairaki]], the latter of which already shared a common ancestry with N\u0101ti Tahu through an ancestor named Tura. A similar approach was taken with Waitaha's genealogies and stories. All three tribes would later be absorbed into Ng\u0101i Tahu.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nT\u016brakautahi's son Kaweriri with his father-in-law Chief Te Ruahikihiki of K\u0101ti Kur\u012b, ancestor of Ng\u0101i Te Ruakihikihi, had settled Taumutu at the southern end of [[Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/te-ruahikihiki/| title=Te Ruahikihiki| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Kaweriri later travelled with a war party south to [[Lowther, New Zealand|Lowther]] where he was slain by the K\u0101ti Mamoe chief Tutemakohu around the year 1725 during the Battle of Waitaramea.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM8AKG_Battle_of_Waitaramea| title=Battle of Waitaramea - Battlefields on Waymarking.com| publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOver time, further marriages had been arranged between the two tribes to cement peace. Notably of Raki-ihia (Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe) and Hineh\u0101kiri, the cousin of Ng\u0101i Tahu\u2019s leading chief Te-hau-tapunui-o-T\u016b, and of Honekai, son of Te-hau-tapunui-o-T\u016b, with Raki-ihia's daughter Kohuwai.

When Ng\u0101ti Toa attacked their hosts, the well-prepared Ng\u0101i Tahu killed all the leading Ng\u0101ti Toa chiefs except Te Rauparaha who subsequently returned to his stronghold at [[Kapiti Island]].\n\nIn November 1830 Te Rauparaha persuaded Captain John Stewart of the brig ''Elizabeth'' to carry him and his warriors in secret to [[Takap\u016bneke]] near present-day [[Akaroa]], where by subterfuge they captured the leading Ng\u0101i Tahu chief, [[Tama-i-hara-nui|Te Maiharanui]], and his wife and daughter.

After a three-month siege, a fire in the p\u0101 allowed Ng\u0101ti Toa to overcome it. Ng\u0101ti Toa then attacked Ng\u0101i Tahu on [[Banks Peninsula]] and took the p\u0101 at [[Onawe]]. In 1832\u201333 Ng\u0101i Tahu retaliated under the leadership of [[T\u016bhawaiki]], Taiaroa, Karetai, and Haereroa, attacking Ng\u0101ti Toa at [[Lake Grassmere]]. Ng\u0101i Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ng\u0101ti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped.\n\nFighting continued for a year or so, with Ng\u0101i Tahu maintaining the upper hand. Ng\u0101ti Toa never again made a major incursion into Ng\u0101i Tahu territory. In 1834 Chief Iwikau of Ng\u0101ti Rangi\u0101moa (senior line of Ng\u0101i Tuahuriri), brother of Te Maiharanui, led a war party into the [[Marlborough Sounds]], though Ng\u0101ti Toa had hidden from them and could not be found.

[[James Watkin]], based at [[Karitane]] found materials prepared by [[North Island]] missions couldn't be used in [[Otago]].<ref name=\"harlow87\">Harlow, R. (1987). ''A word-list of South Island Maori''. Auckland: Linguistic Society of New Zealand. {{ISBN|0-9597603-2-6}}</ref> However, from the 20th century until the early 21st century the dialect came close to extinction and was officially discouraged.<ref>Harlow, R.B. (1979). \"\"Regional Variation in Maori\". ''New Zealand Journal of Archaeology'', 1, 123\u2013138.</ref>\n\nSouthern M\u0101ori contains almost all the same [[phonemes]] as other M\u0101ori dialects (namely: {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u, f, h, k, m, n, p, r, t, w/}}), along with the same [[diphthong]]s. But it lacks {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (\"ng\") \u2014 this sound merged with {{IPA|/k/}} in prehistoric times: for example: ''Ng\u0101i Tahu'' as opposed to ''K\u0101i Tahu''). This change did not occur in the northern part of the Ng\u0101i Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes ({{IPA|/b, p, l, r/}}) has been debated. Non-standard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as ''g'' (as distinct from ''k'', e.g., Katigi, Otago), ''v'' (e.g., Mavora), ''l'' instead of ''r'' (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and ''w'' or ''u'' instead of ''wh'' as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay, Booai (P\u016bhoi)).<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\nThe [[apocope]] (the dropping of the final vowel of words) resulting from pronunciations like 'Wacky-white' for \"[[Waikouaiti]]\" have been identified with Southern M\u0101ori. However, the devoicing (rather than apocope) of final vowels occurs in the speech of native speakers of the M\u0101ori language throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of \"Paraparam\" or \"Waiuk\".<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTe R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ng\u0101i Tahu, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the iwi and the [[New Zealand Government]] under Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.<ref>For example: {{cite web|url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/research/|title=Research|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|publisher=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|accessdate=16 June 2014|quote=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is regularly approached by researchers and organisations seeking engagement, advice or support for various research projects.}}</ref> It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a T\u016bhono organisation.

The ''takiw\u0101'' comprises  18 [[r\u016bnanga]] (governance areas) corresponding to traditional settlements.\n\nSome definitions of Ng\u0101i Tahu include the [[Waitaha (South Island iwi)|Waitaha]] and [[K\u0101ti M\u0101moe]] tribes who lived in the South Island prior to the arrival of Ng\u0101i T\u0101hu.<ref name=\"tkmentry\" /> The five primary [[hap\u016b]] (sub-tribes) of the three tribes are K\u0101ti Kur\u012b, Ng\u0101ti Irakehu, K\u0101ti Huirapa, Ng\u0101i T\u016b\u0101huriri and Ng\u0101i Te Ruakihikihi. \n\n==History==\nNg\u0101i Tahu trace their traditional descent from Tahup\u014dtiki, the younger brother of Porou Ariki who is the founding ancestor of [[Ng\u0101ti Porou]].

The ancestress T\u016bhaitara, senior granddaughter of Rakawahakura, insulting her husband Chief Marukore of Ng\u0101ti Mamoe,<ref name=\"Tainui\"/><ref name=\"Papanui\">{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/papanui/| title=Papanui| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> or [[Te K\u0101hea]], and his ancestry, as well as various other exchanges are the reason for war between their two tribes. He was a local viewed as below her status. The pair had 11 children in total, including Tamaraeroa, Huirapa, Tahumat\u0101, Pahirua and Hinehou.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/> Huirapa is the son who K\u0101ti Huirapa descends from.\n\nT\u016bhaitara instructed Tamaraeroa and Huirapa to kill Marukore at a place called Papanui.<ref name=\"Papanui\"/> However, Marukore knew of their plan and defeated them in the Battle of H\u016bkete after which their sister Hinehou laid them on the floor of her [[whare]], leaving her belongings with them before burning down the building in an incident now known as 'K\u0101rara K\u014dpae' (The Laying Down of Fighting Chiefs).<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/> Alternatively, Marukore himself burned their bodies on a funeral pyre.<ref name=\"Papanui\"/>\n\nNext the brothers Pahirua and Tahumat\u0101 sought out to defeat Marukore. As they were about to take advice from a local chief named R\u0101kaimoari, his daughter Hinewai-a-tapu made a remark about Tahumat\u0101 which sparked the Battle of Te Pakiaka ('The Roots') that lasted for some days. It was named so because Tahumat\u0101 caught Hinewai-a-tapu hiding under some tree roots, and made her his wife.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\nEventually the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe chief Hikaororoa managed to trap Marukore's party in a whare. Hikaororoa asked for the 'chief of the long plume' to come to the door to be cannibalised. Marukore's younger cousin Rokopaekawa took Marukore's head dress (the sign of status) and was sacrificed instead. However he did not cook properly, and the head dress's plume was still visible in the dirt. This was considered a bad omen and so the body was discarded with the incident being called 'Pikit\u016broa' ('The Long Standing Feather Plumes')<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\nMarukore and T\u016bhaitara would both die in the Battle of Tapapanui. This would send the remaining children to a place called Te Oreorehua in [[Wairarapa]] where Hinehou was already living, and southward to [[Te Whanganui-a-Tara]] within a few generations.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\n====Migration to the South Island====\nIn [[Wellington]] a senier chief, Te Aohikuraki, the grandson of T\u016bhaitara, slept with R\u0101kaitekura, a high ranking Ng\u0101i Tahu woman while her husband T\u016bmaro was away visiting his family. Of this Te Hikutawatawa (later named T\u016b\u0101huriri), the ancestor of Ng\u0101i T\u016b\u0101huriri, was born a bastard. T\u016bmaro left for Waimea, near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] with his family members, leaving Te Aohikuraki and Te Hikutawatawa behind. Te Hikutawatawa would later visit Waimea seeking to learn of his heritage. Te Hikutawatawa was outraged his [[mana]] being defiled by T\u016bmaro's father Kahukura-te-paku, and so returned to destroy the site, killing everyone who lived there. After this he was known as T\u016b\u0101huriri ('t\u016b\u0101hu' meaning 'sacred altar', 'riri' meaning 'to be angry').<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\">{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/tuahuriri/| title=T\u016b\u0101huriri| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLate in the 17th century the tribe began migrating to the northern part of the South Island under the leadership of the Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b chief P\u016braho, with his sons Maru and Mako, establishing Kaihinu [[P\u0101]] in the [[Tory Channel|Tory Channel / Kura Te Au]]. After an incident in which a Ng\u0101i Tahu war party had desecrated the bones of one of [[Ng\u0101i Tara]]'s ancestors, P\u016braho was murdered in revenge early one morning when he went to relieve himself. This broke out into a series of battles between the two tribes.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nOn one occasion when Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b fought with [[Rangit\u0101ne]], Chief T\u016bteurutira had mistaken one of his captives, Hinerongo, as one of the enemy's women. She was in fact a member of Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe who had already been taken captive by Rangit\u0101ne, and so he returned her to Matariki P\u0101 on the [[Clarence River, New Zealand|Clarence River]]. This struck a new alliance between their tribes, after which they successfully attacked Rangit\u0101ne in the [[Wairau River|Wairau Valley]]. For this Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Clarence River to Ng\u0101i Tahu, and T\u016bteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the p\u0101. Ng\u0101i Tahu continued to push south, conquering [[Kaik\u014dura]].<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nBy the 1690s Ng\u0101i Tahu had settled in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], including Ng\u0101ti Irakehu peaceably settling among [[Banks Peninsula]]'s Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/> From there they spread further south and into the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. As a consequence for ignoring Chief Te Aweawe's advice to strap two canoes together for a safer passage across the [[Cook Strait]], T\u016b\u0101huriri is said to have been left to drown along with T\u016bmaro, and likely his eldest son H\u0101mua while trying to leave Wellington as some of the last members to make the migration.<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\"/>\n\n===18th century===\nT\u016b\u0101huriri's second eldest son T\u016brakautahi, the famous chief of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhaitara born with a [[club foot]], settled the p\u0101 at [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]] along with other chiefs, which at the time was surrounded by swampland. He also established the p\u0101 north of [[Kaiapoi]] over a Waitaha site, and claimed the area around Banks Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/turakautahi/| title=T\u016brakautahi| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Interestingly, it is said to have been his decision to learn the genealogies and stories of the West Coast tribes [[Ng\u0101ti T\u016bmatak\u014dkiri]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Wairaki]], the latter of which already shared a common ancestry with N\u0101ti Tahu through an ancestor named Tura. A similar approach was taken with Waitaha's genealogies and stories. All three tribes would later be absorbed into Ng\u0101i Tahu.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nT\u016brakautahi's son Kaweriri with his father-in-law Chief Te Ruahikihiki of K\u0101ti Kur\u012b, ancestor of Ng\u0101i Te Ruakihikihi, had settled Taumutu at the southern end of [[Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/te-ruahikihiki/| title=Te Ruahikihiki| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Kaweriri later travelled with a war party south to [[Lowther, New Zealand|Lowther]] where he was slain by the K\u0101ti Mamoe chief Tutemakohu around the year 1725 during the Battle of Waitaramea.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM8AKG_Battle_of_Waitaramea| title=Battle of Waitaramea - Battlefields on Waymarking.com| publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOver time, further marriages had been arranged between the two tribes to cement peace. Notably of Raki-ihia (Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe) and Hineh\u0101kiri, the cousin of Ng\u0101i Tahu\u2019s leading chief Te-hau-tapunui-o-T\u016b, and of Honekai, son of Te-hau-tapunui-o-T\u016b, with Raki-ihia's daughter Kohuwai.

When Ng\u0101ti Toa attacked their hosts, the well-prepared Ng\u0101i Tahu killed all the leading Ng\u0101ti Toa chiefs except Te Rauparaha who subsequently returned to his stronghold at [[Kapiti Island]].\n\nIn November 1830 Te Rauparaha persuaded Captain John Stewart of the brig ''Elizabeth'' to carry him and his warriors in secret to [[Takap\u016bneke]] near present-day [[Akaroa]], where by subterfuge they captured the leading Ng\u0101i Tahu chief, [[Tama-i-hara-nui|Te Maiharanui]], and his wife and daughter.

After a three-month siege, a fire in the p\u0101 allowed Ng\u0101ti Toa to overcome it. Ng\u0101ti Toa then attacked Ng\u0101i Tahu on [[Banks Peninsula]] and took the p\u0101 at [[Onawe]]. In 1832\u201333 Ng\u0101i Tahu retaliated under the leadership of [[T\u016bhawaiki]], Taiaroa, Karetai, and Haereroa, attacking Ng\u0101ti Toa at [[Lake Grassmere]]. Ng\u0101i Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ng\u0101ti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped.\n\nFighting continued for a year or so, with Ng\u0101i Tahu maintaining the upper hand. Ng\u0101ti Toa never again made a major incursion into Ng\u0101i Tahu territory. In 1834 Chief Iwikau of Ng\u0101ti Rangi\u0101moa (senior line of Ng\u0101i Tuahuriri), brother of Te Maiharanui, led a war party into the [[Marlborough Sounds]], though Ng\u0101ti Toa had hidden from them and could not be found.

This change did not occur in the northern part of the Ng\u0101i Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes ({{IPA|/b, p, l, r/}}) has been debated. Non-standard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as ''g'' (as distinct from ''k'', e.g., Katigi, Otago), ''v'' (e.g., Mavora), ''l'' instead of ''r'' (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and ''w'' or ''u'' instead of ''wh'' as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay, Booai (P\u016bhoi)).<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\nThe [[apocope]] (the dropping of the final vowel of words) resulting from pronunciations like 'Wacky-white' for \"[[Waikouaiti]]\" have been identified with Southern M\u0101ori. However, the devoicing (rather than apocope) of final vowels occurs in the speech of native speakers of the M\u0101ori language throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of \"Paraparam\" or \"Waiuk\".<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTe R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ng\u0101i Tahu, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the iwi and the [[New Zealand Government]] under Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.<ref>For example: {{cite web|url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/research/|title=Research|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|publisher=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|accessdate=16 June 2014|quote=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is regularly approached by researchers and organisations seeking engagement, advice or support for various research projects.}}</ref> It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a T\u016bhono organisation.
