Though McGillivray's main talent lay in landscape painting, she also practiced painting in watercolour during her career.

McGillivray was a contemporary of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. She encouraged the influential Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].\n\nIn the 1920s, McGillivrays career exploded. Her art mainly was influenced by the Post-Impressionist and Fauvist movements. McGillivray lived in Whitby, Ottawa and Toronto but travelled often to pursue her work. She visited Europe, Alaska, Jamaica and Trinidad. Exhibition locations include Toronto Malloney's, Continental Galleries, Montreal, and her own studio in her hometown.\n\nThe National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre and galleries in Oshawa, Whitby, Kitchener, London, and Windsor all hold her work in their collections. McGillivray was an Associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy and a member of many associations such as the Ontario Society of Artists, the New York Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour as well as an Associate Member of the Royal Canadian Academy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Florence Helena McGillivray died in Toronto on May 7, 1938, and is buried at Union Cemetery, Oshawa.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Florence H. Mc Gillivray.png|thumb|Florence Helena McGillivray, 1907]]\n\nFlorence Helena McGillivray was born in the small farm town of [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]], Ontario on March 1, 1864. She was the eleventh of thirteen children, and the youngest female of the Scottish immigrant farmer, George McGillivray (1813-1894) and his wife, Caroline Amelia Fothergill McGillivray (1828-1909). \n\nIn 1870, the family moved to Inverlynn, a house located at 1300 Gifford Street in Whitby, Ontario. To this day, the property has remained in the possession of George McGillivray`s descendants. The children attended a grammar school in Whitby, and she had shown artistic talent in her early childhood years so she pursued her art by attending The Central Ontario School of Art, where she studied under Professor [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]]. Florence then began taking one-on-one lessons from renowned Canadian artists such as [[Farquhar McGillivray Knowles]] and [[Lucius O\u2019Brien]] to name only a few.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvhs.ca/publications/utga-following-florence.html|title=A Bridge A-Building|website=www.gvhs.ca|access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref> \n\n== Education ==\nAfter studying at the Ontario School of Art, McGillivray had private lessons with J.W.L.

She had a brilliant and unusual handling of brushwork that created unique compositions.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nShe was one of the first women artists to explore the landscape of northern Ontario and Quebec.

In the same year, she was also said to have been elected president of the International Art Union.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMcGillivray moved back to Canada in 1914. The most prolific and vibrant phase of her artistic career occurred during the 1920s while she lived in Ottawa, where she set up a studio at Frank Street.

She was the eleventh of thirteen children, and the youngest female of the Scottish immigrant farmer, George McGillivray (1813-1894) and his wife, Caroline Amelia Fothergill McGillivray (1828-1909). McGillivray had three close siblings; Elizabeth Fothergill McGillivray Hillary (1847-1877), Mary Eliza McGillivray (1849-1911) and William McGillivray (1865-1904).\n\nIn 1870, the family moved to Inverlynn, a house located at 1300 Gifford Street in Whitby, Ontario. To this day, the property has remained in the possession of George McGillivray`s descendants. The children attended a grammar school in Whitby, and she had shown artistic talent in her early childhood years so she pursued her art by attending The Central Ontario School of Art, where she studied under Professor [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]].

At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in [[Los Angeles]], the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General [[Stephen W. Kearney]] were at [[Warner's Ranch]]. Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain [[Archibald Gillespie]] to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of San Pasqual]], fought in the [[San Pasqual Valley]] which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v49-1/war.htm|first=Richard|last=Griswold del Castillo|title=The U.S.-Mexican War in San Diego, 1846\u20131847|publisher=The Journal of San Diego History|work=SAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY|date=Winter 2003|volume=49|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nStockton and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of Alta California with the \"[[Treaty of Cahuenga]]\" on January 13, 1847.

The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was \"for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of San Francisco,\" and the Mexican\u2013American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of [[San Diego Bay]], so as to include the entire bay within the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Griswold de Castillo|1990|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n[[File:Alonzo Horton.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Oval, black and white shoulder-height portrait of a man in his forties or fifties, slightly balding wearing a suit|Namesake of [[Horton Plaza and Broadway Fountain|Horton Plaza]], [[Alonzo Horton]] developed \"New Town\" which became [[Downtown San Diego]].]]\nThe state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850.

In 1850, [[William Heath Davis]] promoted a new development by the bay shore called \"New San Diego\", several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only of a pier, a few houses and an Army depot for the support of [[Fort Yuma]].  After 1854, the fort became supplied by sea and by [[Steamboats of the Colorado River|steamboats on the Colorado River]] and the depot fell into disuse.  From 1857 to 1860, San Diego became the western terminus of the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]], the earliest overland [[stagecoach]] and mail operation from the [[Eastern United States]] to California, coming from [[Texas]] through [[New Mexico Territory]] in less than 30 days.<ref name = \"Pierce\">[http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/1969/april/jackass/ Basil C.

Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be oriented to [[utility cycling]]. This is partly because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.<ref name=\"BestBike\">{{cite news|title=San Diego, Madison (WI) and Boulder (CO) Are Best among Cities of Their Size, While Atlanta, Boston and Houston Are Worst |publisher=Bicycling |date=January 26, 2006 |url=http://www.bikechattanooga.org/BicyclingMagazineRecognizesChattanoogainTop21Cities.html |accessdate=April 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131075226/http://www.bikechattanooga.org/BicyclingMagazineRecognizesChattanoogainTop21Cities.html |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:OverCoronadoSanDiegoAug07.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|View of [[Coronado, California|Coronado]] and San Diego from the air]]\n\nSan Diego is served by the [[San Diego Trolley]] light rail system,<ref name=\"SD-Trolley\">{{cite web | title=SDMTS \u2013 Trolley Information | publisher=San Diego Metropolitan Transit System | url=http://www.sdmts.com/Trolley/Trolley.asp | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> by the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System|SDMTS bus system]],<ref>{{cite web | title=SDMTS \u2013 Bus Routes | publisher=San Diego Metropolitan Transit System | url=http://www.sdmts.com/mtscr/BusRoutes.aspx | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> and by [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]]<ref name=\"Coaster\">{{cite web | title=COASTER \u2013 NCTD | publisher=North County Transit District | url=http://www.gonctd.com/coaster | date= | accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> and [[Pacific Surfliner|Amtrak Pacific Surfliner]]<ref name=\"Surfliner\">{{cite web | title=Pacific Surfliner Train \u2013 from Los Angeles to San Diego & More \u2013 Amtrak | publisher=National Railroad Passenger Corporation | url=http://www.amtrak.com/pacific-surfliner-train | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> commuter rail; northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego county]] is also served by the [[Sprinter (light rail)|Sprinter]] light rail line.<ref>{{cite web | title=SPRINTER \u2013 NCTD | publisher=North County Transit District | url=http://www.gonctd.com/sprinter | date= | accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> The trolley primarily serves downtown and surrounding urban communities, [[Mission Valley, San Diego, California|Mission Valley]], east county, and coastal south bay.

At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in [[Los Angeles]], the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General [[Stephen W. Kearney]] were at [[Warner's Ranch]]. Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain [[Archibald Gillespie]] to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of San Pasqual]], fought in the [[San Pasqual Valley]] which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v49-1/war.htm|first=Richard|last=Griswold del Castillo|title=The U.S.-Mexican War in San Diego, 1846\u20131847|publisher=The Journal of San Diego History|work=SAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY|date=Winter 2003|volume=49|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nStockton and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of Alta California with the \"[[Treaty of Cahuenga]]\" on January 13, 1847.

The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was \"for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of San Francisco,\" and the Mexican\u2013American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of [[San Diego Bay]], so as to include the entire bay within the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Griswold de Castillo|1990|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n[[File:Alonzo Horton.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Oval, black and white shoulder-height portrait of a man in his forties or fifties, slightly balding wearing a suit|Namesake of [[Horton Plaza and Broadway Fountain|Horton Plaza]], [[Alonzo Horton]] developed \"New Town\" which became [[Downtown San Diego]].]]\nThe state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850.

In 1850, [[William Heath Davis]] promoted a new development by the bay shore called \"New San Diego\", several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only of a pier, a few houses and an Army depot for the support of [[Fort Yuma]].  After 1854, the fort became supplied by sea and by [[Steamboats of the Colorado River|steamboats on the Colorado River]] and the depot fell into disuse.

Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be oriented to [[utility cycling]]. This is partly because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common.

Gentoo encourages users to build a Linux kernel tailored to their particular hardware. It allows very fine control of which services are installed and running; also, memory usage can be reduced, compared to other distributions, by omitting unnecessary kernel features and services.<ref name=\"Negus2008\" />{{rp|386}}\n\nA very large collection of software is available. Each package contains details of any dependencies on other software, so only the minimum set need be installed to run the required applications.

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]]. The original design was based on the [[Ports collection|ports system]] used by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) based operating systems. The portage tree contains over 19,000 packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system.<ref name=\"Negus2006\">{{cite book|author=Chris Negus|title=Live Linux CDs: Building and Customizing Bootables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S3eUgb39C8C&pg=PA224|year=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall Professional|isbn=978-0-13-243274-0|pages=224\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA single invocation of portage's {{mono|emerge}} command can update the local copy of the portage tree, search for a package, or download, compile, and install one or more packages and their dependencies. The built-in features can be set for individual packages, or globally, with so-called \"USE flags\".<ref name=\"Negus2006\"/>\n\nPortage provides a way to set the amount of processes that can run and the maximum load average for the processor cores using the {{mono|EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS}} flag <ref>https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</ref> in either the default configuration file at <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code> or a file that <code>export</code>s the flag, like in <code>/root/.bashrc</code>.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Major changes, such as changing the layout of how files are installed across the entire system, typically involve a profile upgrade and may require rebuilding all installed software. These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]). Profiles formerly tracked the versioning of install media, and switched to two-digit year-based naming after the discontinuation of versioned media. The following new profile versions have been released after 2008.0:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Version\n!

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]]. The original design was based on the [[Ports collection|ports system]] used by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) based operating systems. The portage tree contains over 19,000 packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system.<ref name=\"Negus2006\">{{cite book|author=Chris Negus|title=Live Linux CDs: Building and Customizing Bootables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S3eUgb39C8C&pg=PA224|year=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall Professional|isbn=978-0-13-243274-0|pages=224\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA single invocation of portage's {{mono|emerge}} command can update the local copy of the portage tree, search for a package, or download, compile, and install one or more packages and their dependencies. The built-in features can be set for individual packages, or globally, with so-called \"USE flags\".<ref name=\"Negus2006\"/>\n\nPortage provides a way to set the amount of processes that can run and the maximum load average for the processor cores using the {{mono|EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS}} flag <ref>https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</ref> in either the default configuration file at <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code> or a file that <code>export</code>s the flag, like in <code>/root/.bashrc</code>.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]).

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks.

Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid.

As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]].

Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal.

His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon.

Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo.

As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid.

It is typical of Korean webtoons, especially those by Naver, to be in full color with modern CG/shading. Colors are useful in this series to help distinguish characters, because many are introduced but have relatively minor roles in the progression of the plot.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anime-planet.com/users/clamrwar/reviews/8294|title=The God of High School|date=June 5, 2012|website=Anime-Planet|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Webtoon]]\n* [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]]\n* [[Korean Wave]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list.nhn?titleId=318995&weekday=fri God of High School on Naver (Korean)]\n* [http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/list?title_no=66 God of High School on LINE Webtoon (English)]\n* [http://blog.naver.com/lungdi Park Yong-Jae's Blog]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPevDF7cZU \"Fly to High\" by Younha (The God of High School Game OST)]\n* [http://atkmagazine.com/2015/09/24/god-high-school-strong-nothing-everything/ Review on ATK Magazine's website]\n* Review on [https://realotakugamer.com/the-best-around-the-god-of-highschool-manga-review RealOtakuGamer.com]\n\n{{MAPPA}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:God of High School}}\n[[Category:South Korean webtoons]]\n[[Category:2011 webtoon debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s webtoons]]\n[[Category:Crunchyroll Originals]]\n[[Category:MAPPA]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on South Korean webtoons]]\n[[Category:2020 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Upcoming anime television series]]\n", "name_user": "Lord Yeager", "label": "safe", "comment": "Naver is not publisher.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_High_School"}
