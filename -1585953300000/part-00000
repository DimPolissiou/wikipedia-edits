In one version of the story, the character ''bi\u00e1ng'' was invented by the [[Qin Dynasty]] Premier [[Li Si]]. However, since the character is not found in the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', it may have been created much later than the time of Li Si.

It was concluded that the character was invented by a noodle shop.{{clarify|July 20111|date=July 2011}}\n\nOne hypothesis is that there was no such character or meaning for this word in the beginning, and the word actually came [[onomatopoeia|from the sound]] people make from chewing the noodles, \"biang biang biang\".\n\nA legend about a student fabricating a character for the noodle to get out of a biangbiang noodle bill also is a commonly-believed hypothesis about the origin of the character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinasimplified.com/2014/02/28/biang/|title=The Hardest Chinese Character |last=Beck|first=Stewart Lee|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAccording to an article on ''[[China Daily]]'', the word \"biang\" actually refers to the sound made by the chef when he creates the noodles by pulling the dough and slapping it on the table.<ref>{{cite web|work=China Daily |title=Biangbiang Shaanxi street food |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/food/2012-11/18/content_15939056.htm|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n[[File:Biang biang noodles.jpg|thumb|''Bi\u00e1ngbi\u00e1ngmi\u00e0n'' in Traditional characters.

The Traditional character for ''bi\u00e1ng'' is combined with the Simplified character for ''mi\u00e0n''.]]\nThe origins of the biangbiang noodles and the character ''bi\u00e1ng'' are unclear. In one version of the story, the character ''bi\u00e1ng'' was invented by the [[Qin Dynasty]] Premier [[Li Si]]. However, since the character is not found in the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', it may have been created much later than the time of Li Si. Similar characters were found used by [[Tiandihui]].\n\nIn the 2007 season of the [[TVB]] show ''The Web'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=[[:zh:\u4e00\u7db2\u6253\u76e1|\u4e00\u7db2\u6253\u76e1]]}}), the show's producers tried to find the origin of the character by contacting university professors, but they could not verify the Li Si story or the origin of the character. It was concluded that the character was invented by a noodle shop.{{clarify|July 20111|date=July 2011}}\n\nOne hypothesis is that there was no such character or meaning for this word in the beginning, and the word actually came [[onomatopoeia|from the sound]] people make from chewing the noodles, \"biang biang biang\".\n\nA legend about a student fabricating a character for the noodle to get out of a biangbiang noodle bill also is a commonly-believed hypothesis about the origin of the character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinasimplified.com/2014/02/28/biang/|title=The Hardest Chinese Character |last=Beck|first=Stewart Lee|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAccording to an article on ''[[China Daily]]'', the word \"biang\" actually refers to the sound made by the chef when he creates the noodles by pulling the dough and slapping it on the table.<ref>{{cite web|work=China Daily |title=Biangbiang Shaanxi street food |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/food/2012-11/18/content_15939056.htm|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n[[File:Biang biang noodles.jpg|thumb|''Bi\u00e1ngbi\u00e1ngmi\u00e0n'' in Traditional characters.

This is on the basis of its being actually a compound word, a phenomenon quite common in ancient Hebrew. ''Col'' ({{Hebrew|\u05db\u05dc}}, Kaf + Lamed) = \"all\" or \"whole\"; ''Lev'' ({{Hebrew|\u05dc\u05d1}}, Lamed + Bet) means \"heart\". Therefore, Caleb (or Calev as pronounced in Hebrew) would actually mean \"whole hearted\". This might be due to the Biblical Caleb, a companion of Moses and Joshua, being noted for his astute powers of observation and fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\n==Biblical account==\n{{cleanup|reason=section neglects question most readers would have:the morality of the contemplated invasion|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 058.png|thumb|right|''Return of the Spies'', 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\n\nCaleb, son of [[Jephunneh]]  ({{bibleverse|Numbers|13:6|9}}) is not to be confused with Caleb, great-grandson of [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]] through [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] ({{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|2:3-9|9}}). This other Caleb was the [[Caleb (son of Hezron)|son of Hezron]], and his wife was Azubah ({{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|2:18,19|9}}).\n\nAccording to {{bibleverse|Numbers|13|9}}, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, was one of [[The Twelve Spies|the twelve spies]] sent by [[Moses]] into Canaan. Their task, over a period of 40 days,<ref>{{bibleverse|Numbers|14:34|9}}</ref> was to explore the [[Negev]] and surrounding area, and to make an assessment of the geographical features of the land, the strength and numbers of the [[population]], the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] potential and actual performance of the land, settlement patterns (whether their [[City|cities]] were like camps or strongholds), and [[forestry]] conditions.

Jephunneh is called a [[Kenizzite]] ({{bibleverse|Numbers|32:12|9}}, {{bibleverse|Joshua|14:6|9}},{{bibleverse|Joshua|14:14|9|14}}). The Kenizzites are listed ({{bibleverse|Genesis|15:19|9}}) as one of the nations who lived in the land of Canaan, at the time that God covenanted with Abram (Abraham) to give that land to his descendants forever ({{bibleverse|Genesis|17:8|9}}). However, Caleb is mentioned alongside the descendants of Judah recorded in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|4|9}}: \"And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh: Iru, Elah, and Naam; and the sons of Elah: Kenaz\" ({{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|4:15|9}}).<ref name=jps/> {{bibleverse|Numbers|13:6|9}}, likewise, lists Caleb as a tribal leader in Judah.\n\nThe Kenizzites are generally considered an Edomite clan (see {{bibleverse|Genesis|36:40-43|9}}).<ref name=\"FreedmanMyers2000\">{{cite book|author1=David Noel Freedman|author2=Allen C.

Since Hebron itself was one of the [[Cities of Refuge]] to be ruled by the [[Levites]], it is later explained that Caleb actually was given the outskirts ({{bibleverse|Joshua|21:11-13|9}}). Caleb promised his daughter [[Achsah]] in marriage to whoever would conquer the land of [[Debir]] from the giants. This was eventually accomplished by [[Othniel Ben Kenaz]], Caleb's nephew ({{bibleverse|Judges|1:13|9}}), who became Caleb's son-in-law as well ({{bibleverse|Joshua|15:16,17|9}}).\n\n[[1 Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Samuel|25:3|9}} states that [[Nabal]], the husband of [[Abigail]] before [[David]], was \"a Calebite\" (Hebrew ''klby'').<ref name=\"Fokkelman1981\">{{cite book|author=J.

A reference to him is also found in the [[Quran]], although his name is not mentioned.\n\n==Name==\nAccording to ''[[The Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', \"since 'Caleb' signifies dog, it has been thought that the dog was the totem of [Caleb's] clan\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Morris Jastrow, Jr. |author2=George A. Barton |author3=Marcus Jastrow |author4=Louis Ginzberg |date=1906 |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |chapter = Caleb |chapter-url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3918-caleb |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> The New American Standard Exhaustive Concordance states that the name ''Kaleb'' (Caleb) is related to the word for \"dog\" ({{lang|he-Latn|keleb}}).<ref>NAS Exhaustive Concordance, \"[http://biblehub.com/nasec/hebrew/3612.htm Keleb]\", accessed 9 June 2017</ref> The Bible was written down centuries before [[Hebrew diacritics]] were introduced, and there is no certain knowledge of how the name was pronounced when the biblical text was written. \n\nIn Hebrew, the name is pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|l|\u025b|b}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|l|\u025b|v}}; the modern English pronunciation {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|e\u026a|l|\u0259|b}} is courtesy of the [[Great Vowel Shift]].\n\nAn alternate Hebrew meaning offered for ''Caleb'' is \"faithful, devotion, whole hearted, bold, brave\". This is on the basis of its being actually a compound word, a phenomenon quite common in ancient Hebrew. ''Col'' ({{Hebrew|\u05db\u05dc}}, Kaf + Lamed) = \"all\" or \"whole\"; ''Lev'' ({{Hebrew|\u05dc\u05d1}}, Lamed + Bet) means \"heart\". Therefore, Caleb (or Calev as pronounced in Hebrew) would actually mean \"whole hearted\". This might be due to the Biblical Caleb, a companion of Moses and Joshua, being noted for his astute powers of observation and fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\n==Biblical account=={{cleanup|reason=section neglects question most readers would have:the morality of the contemplated invasion|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 058.png|thumb|right|''Return of the Spies'', 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\n\nCaleb, son of [[Jephunneh]]  ({{bibleverse|Numbers|13:6|9}}) is not to be confused with Caleb, great-grandson of [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]] through [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] ({{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|2:3-9|9}}). This other Caleb was the [[Caleb (son of Hezron)|son of Hezron]], and his wife was Azubah ({{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|2:18,19|9}}).\n\nAccording to {{bibleverse|Numbers|13|9}}, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, was one of [[The Twelve Spies|the twelve spies]] sent by [[Moses]] into Canaan. Their task, over a period of 40 days,<ref>{{bibleverse|Numbers|14:34|9}}</ref> was to explore the [[Negev]] and surrounding area, and to make an assessment of the geographical features of the land, the strength and numbers of the [[population]], the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] potential and actual performance of the land, settlement patterns (whether their [[City|cities]] were like camps or strongholds), and [[forestry]] conditions. Moses also asked them to be courageous and to return with samples of local produce.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Numbers|13:17-20|9}}</ref>\n\nIn the Numbers 13 listing of the heads of each tribe, {{bibleverse|Numbers|13:6|9|verse 6}} reads \"Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.\" Caleb's report balanced the appeal of the land and its fruits with the challenge of making a conquest.\n\n{{bibleverse|Numbers|13:30|9|Verse 30}} of chapter 13 reads \"And Caleb stilled the people toward Moses, and said: 'We should go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.{{'\"}}<ref name=jps>Jewish Publication Society Version (1917)</ref> Caleb and [[Joshua]] said the people should trust God and go into the land; the other ten spies, being fearful and rebellious, argued that conquering the land was impossible.\n\n===Caleb and Kenizzites===\nCaleb the spy is the son of Jephunneh. Jephunneh is called a [[Kenizzite]] ({{bibleverse|Numbers|32:12|9}}, {{bibleverse|Joshua|14:6|9}},{{bibleverse|Joshua|14:14|9|14}}). The Kenizzites are listed ({{bibleverse|Genesis|15:19|9}}) as one of the nations who lived in the land of Canaan, at the time that God covenanted with Abram (Abraham) to give that land to his descendants forever ({{bibleverse|Genesis|17:8|9}}). However, Caleb is mentioned alongside the descendants of Judah recorded in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|4|9}}: \"And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh: Iru, Elah, and Naam; and the sons of Elah: Kenaz\" ({{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|4:15|9}}).<ref name=jps/> {{bibleverse|Numbers|13:6|9}}, likewise, lists Caleb as a tribal leader in Judah.\n\nThe Kenizzites are generally considered an Edomite clan (see {{bibleverse|Genesis|36:40-43|9}}).<ref name=\"FreedmanMyers2000\">{{cite book|author1=David Noel Freedman|author2=Allen C.

Since Hebron itself was one of the [[Cities of Refuge]] to be ruled by the [[Levites]], it is later explained that Caleb actually was given the outskirts ({{bibleverse|Joshua|21:11-13|9}}). Caleb promised his daughter [[Achsah]] in marriage to whoever would conquer the land of [[Debir]] from the giants. This was eventually accomplished by [[Othniel Ben Kenaz]], Caleb's nephew ({{bibleverse|Judges|1:13|9}}), who became Caleb's son-in-law as well ({{bibleverse|Joshua|15:16,17|9}}).\n\n[[1 Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Samuel|25:3|9}} states that [[Nabal]], the husband of [[Abigail]] before [[David]], was \"a Calebite\" (Hebrew ''klby'').<ref name=\"Fokkelman1981\">{{cite book|author=J.

They only agreed to carry in samples of produce after Caleb brandished a sword and threatened to fight over the matter.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis. (1911).

His parents were [[:hu:Bartis Ferenc|Ferenc Bartis]] (1936\u20132006) and Margit Gherasim. Ferenc, his father, was a writer, poet and journalist. His family were part of the persecuted [[Hungarian minority of Romania]]. Following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], Ferenc was imprisoned in [[Gherla Prison]] but was given amnesty by [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] seven years later and released.

In 1984, sixteen-year-old Attila and his father were stripped of their Romanian citizenship and presented with stateless passports, and advised to leave for Hungary. Attila moved with his father to [[Budapest]]. Attila graduated from a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]].

His parents were [[:hu:Bartis Ferenc|Ferenc Bartis]] (1936\u20132006) and Margit Gherasim. Ferenc, his father, was a writer, poet and journalist.

In 1984, sixteen-year-old Attila and his father were stripped of their Romanian citizenship and presented with stateless passports, and advised to leave for Hungary. Attila moved with his father to [[Budapest]]. Attila graduated from a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]].
