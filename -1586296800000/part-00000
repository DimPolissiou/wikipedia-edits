Her father, Anatoly Kosmodemyansky, studied in a [[theological]] seminary, but did not graduate. He later worked as a librarian. Her mother, Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Churikova), was a school teacher. In 1925 Zoya's brother, [[Aleksandr Kosmodemyansky]], was born.

Her teachers noted her essays for deep understanding of the subject and for imagery. She read far beyond the curriculum. The list of authors she read included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Aleksandr Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], [[Karamzin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Miguel Cervantes]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Wolfgang Goethe]], and [[William Shakespeare]]. Zoya kept a notebook where she recorded her thoughts about the books she read. Such as: \"In Shakespeare's tragedies the death of a hero is always accompanied by a triumph of a high moral cause.\" She liked [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont]] and often sang Kl\u00e4rchen's song \"Die Trommel ger\u00fchret.\" Her favorite music was [[Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's Symphony No.{{nbsp}}5]]. Her striving for high ideals led to misunderstandings with her classmates. On the eve of 1939, the girls wrote each other notes with New Year wishes. Zoya received the following note \"Zoya, don't judge people so strict. Don't take everything so close to heart. Know that most people are egoist, flatterers, are insincere and you can't depend on them. You should leave their words without attention. Such is my New Year wish.\" After reading the note Zoya said, \"If one thinks of people like that, then what has one to live for?\"\n\nKosmodemyanskaya joined the [[Komsomol]] in 1938. In October 1941, still a high school student in Moscow, she volunteered for a partisan unit. To her mother, who tried to dissuade her, she answered \"What can I do when the enemy is so close? If they came here I would not be able to continue living.\" Zoya was assigned to the partisan unit 9903 (Staff of the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]]). Of the one thousand people who joined the unit in October 1941 only half survived the war. At the village of Obukhovo near [[Naro-Fominsk]], Kosmodemyanskaya and other partisans crossed the front line and entered territory occupied by the [[Germany|Germans]]. They mined roads and cut communication lines. On November 27, 1941 Zoya received an assignment to burn the village of Petrischevo, where a German cavalry regiment was stationed.\n\nIn Petrischevo, Zoya managed to set fire to horse stables and a couple of houses. On November 27 at 2{{nbsp}}o'clock in the morning Boris Krainov, Vasily Klubkov and Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya set fire to three houses in Petrishchev (residents of Karelova, Solntseva and Smirnov).<ref name=\"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\">''\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u041c. \u041c.''

Smirnova A. V. confirmed this fact with her testimony [6]. Zoya's friend at the sabotage school of Claudia Miloradova claims that one of the homes burned by Zoya was used as a German communications center. [24] The house of the Voronin family in the village was actually used as a headquarters for the officers of the troops to be moved, but was not burned. Many members of the sabotage group note that houses were burned in which German soldiers had spent the night, and also kept their horses used for transportation of military cargoes in the yards.<ref name=\"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\"/> The writer A.

Later, Klubkov was also captured by the Germans. Zoya, having missed her comrades and left alone, decided to return to Petrishchevo and continue arson. However, the German military authorities in the village had by that time organized a gathering of local residents, on which they had formed a militia in order to avoid further arson. After being arrested she was stripped, beaten, interrogated and tortured with 200 lashes and her body burnt,<ref>https://archive.is/20051227015937/http://www.smi.ru/05/04/05/3442763.html</ref> but refused to give any information. The following morning she was marched to the center of the village with a board around her neck bearing the inscription 'Houseburner' and hanged.\n\nHer final words were:\n\n{{quote|Hey, comrades! Why are you looking so sad? Be brave, fight, beat the Germans, burn, trample them! I'm not afraid to die, comrades. It is happiness to die for one's people!}}\n\nand to the Germans:\n\n{{Quote|You hang me now, but I'm not alone. There are two hundred million of us. You can't hang us all. They will avenge me.}}\n\nAnd before the moment of hanging with the rope on her neck she said:<ref>Petr Lidov. \"Tania\". \"Pravda\" newsletter. 26th of January 1942 [http://zoyakosmodemyanskaya.ru/books5-34.htm](in Russian)</ref><ref>Petr Lidov. \"Partisan Tania\". \"Pioneer\" newsletter.

The journalist had heard about Zoya's execution from an elderly peasant, and was impressed by the young woman's courage. The witness recounted: \"They were hanging her and she was giving a speech. They were hanging her and she was threatening them.\" Lidov travelled to [[Petrishchevo]], collected details from local residents and published an article about the then-unknown partisan girl. Soon after, [[Joseph Stalin]] noticed the article. He proclaimed: \"Here is the people's heroine\", which started a [[Soviet propaganda during World War II|propaganda campaign]] honouring Kosmodemyanskaya. In February, she was identified and was awarded the order of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=Gorinov>Mikhail Gorinov, [http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/RUHIST/ZOYA.HTM Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya (1923\u20131941)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527151227/http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/RUHIST/ZOYA.HTM |date=May 27, 2011 }}, ''Otechestvennaya istoriia'', \u21161, 2003, {{ISSN|0869-5687}}</ref>\n\nZoya's account was repeatedly published in Pravda.

April 5, 2005 {{in lang|ru}}</ref> The article alleged that there were no German troops in the village of Petrischevo, in spite of several photos of her being hanged by German soldiers. Zhovtis blamed Stalin's [[scorched earth]] policy for the 'unnecessary' death of the young woman.<ref name=smi/> The newspaper subsequently published letters from readers, many of which included stories contradicting the mainstream version. One research supported that the person executed in Petrischevo was not Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya but a \"[[missing in action]]\" partisan, although later official conclusion from the Institute for Criminal Expertise and the [[Department of Justice of the Russian Federation]] stated otherwise. The ''Argumenty i Fakty'' articles prompted a response from ''[[Pravda]]'' observer [[Viktor Kozhemyaka]] in the form of an article titled ''Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again''.<ref>Viktor Kozhemyaka. ''Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again'' [[Pravda]] November 29, 1991</ref> Ten years later, Kozhemyaka wrote another article ''Zoya is executed yet again'',<ref>Viktor Kozhemyaka ''Zoya is executed yet again'' [[Pravda]], November 29 and November 30, 2001</ref> in which he lamented some \"absurd material\" on Internet boards, which alleged that Zoya had hurt Russian peasants rather than German troops, that she suffered from [[schizophrenia]], that she was a fanatical Stalinist, and so on.\n\n===New developments===\n[[File:Washed Zoya - tribute to Victory Day.jpg|left|thumb|[[Femen]] activist is washing a monument for Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya in Ukraine in tribute on Victory Day.]]\n\nAn important development was the publication by the newspaper ''Glasnost'' of the previously unknown protocols of the official commission of residents of Petrischevo village and Gribtsovsky [[selsoviet]] on January 25, 1942 (two months after Zoya's execution).<ref>Ivan Osadchy ''Her name and deeds are immortal'', Glasnost, September 24, 1997</ref> The protocol stated that Kosmodemyanskaya was caught while trying to destroy a stable containing more than 300 German horses. It also quite graphically described her torture and execution.<ref name=smi/>\n\nA slightly different story was told by the notes of Pyotr Lidov published in ''Parlamentskaya Gazeta'' in 1999. Apparently, Lidov for years meticulously collected all the available information on Kosmodemyanskaya. The notes supported the version that Kosmodemyanskaya and Vasily Klubkov were caught while asleep on the outskirts of Petrischevo. The Germans were called by Petrischevo resident Semyon Sviridov. Lidov's notes also included an interview with a German [[noncommissioned officer]] taken prisoner by the Red Army. The interview described the negative effect on the [[morale]] of the German soldiers who witnessed the burning of the houses.<ref name=smi/>\n\n===Klubkov's betrayal version===\nSome details of Zoya's assignment and arrest were classified for about sixty years because treachery might have been involved. The criminal case number 16440 was declassified in 2002. The case was then reviewed by [[Russia]]'s Chief Military Prosecutor Office, and it was decided that Vasily Klubkov, who betrayed Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, was not eligible for rehabilitation. According to criminal case 16440, three Soviet combatants: Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Vasily Klubkov, and their commander [[Boris Krainov]] had to perform acts of sabotage in [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]. They had been given the task of setting fire to houses in the village of Petrishchevo, where German troops were quartered. Krainov was to operate in the central part of the village, Kosmodemyanskaya in the southern and Klubkov in the northern parts. Krainov was the first to carry out his task and returned to the base. Zoya performed her task too, as was evidenced by three columns of flame in the southern part of Petrischevo seen from the base. Only the northern part was not set on fire. According to Klubkov, he was captured by two German soldiers and taken to their headquarters. A German officer threatened to kill him, and Klubkov gave him the names of Kosmodemyanskaya and Krainov. After this, Kosmodemyanskaya was captured by the Germans.<ref name=\"RIAN\">{{cite web|date=November 16, 2006 |url=http://www.rian.ru/zabytoe/20061116/55692377.html |title=The Truth on Zoya and Shura |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |language=Russian |accessdate=November 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123211131/http://www.rian.ru/zabytoe/20061116/55692377.html |archivedate=November 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date = October 9, 2002 |url = http://www.mk.ru/numbers/14/article206.htm |title = Agent is not the subject for rehabilitation |work = [[Moskovskij Komsomolets]] |language = Russian |accessdate = November 22, 2006 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070115080756/http://www.mk.ru/numbers/14/article206.htm |archivedate = January 15, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of female Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya:''Story of Zoya and Shura'', Foreign Languages Publishing House: Moscow, 1953 (\"Shura\" is a nickname for \"Alexander\", the author is Zoya's mother).\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya}}\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081020094524/http://mir.voskres.ru/mirbo07/a22.html Martyrdom of village priest Pyotr Kosmodemyansky] (in Russian)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517201556/http://www.greeklish.org/features/zoya/home.html Zoya's Story], a short biography, some tributes and excerpts from the book \"Story of Zoya and Shura\"\n* [http://photo.peoples.ru/state/citizen/zoya_kosmodemianskaya/3.shtml Photo of dead Zoya]\n* [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=284 Biography (in Russian)], on the website dedicated to the Heroes of the Soviet Union/Russia\n* [http://www.northstarcompass.org/nsc0504/zoya.htm Short Biographical Article (in English)], from Northstar Compass\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050406100247/http://www.vor.ru/English/Victory/vict_20.html Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya] From The Voice of Russia\n{{Female HSU Partisans}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kosmodemyanskaya, Zoya}}\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:1941 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Gavrilovsky District]]\n[[Category:Female resistance members of World War II]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Soviet partisans]]\n[[Category:Soviet prisoners of war]]\n[[Category:Russian people of World War II]]\n[[Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Executed Russian women]]\n[[Category:Executed people from Tambov Oblast]]\n[[Category:Executed Russian people]]\n[[Category:People executed by Nazi Germany by hanging]]\n[[Category:Russian people executed by Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Executed Soviet people from Russia]]\n[[Category:Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Women in the Russian and Soviet military]]\n[[Category:Soviet civilians killed in World War II]]\n[[Category:Russian women in World War II]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Infobox military person\n|name        = Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya\n|birth_date  = September 13, 1923\n|death_date  = {{death date and age|1941|11|29|1923|9|13}}\n|birth_place = [[Gavrilovsky District|Osino-Gay]], [[Tambov Oblast]], [[Soviet Union]]\n|death_place = Petrischevo, [[Moscow Oblast]], Soviet Union\n|image       = Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, 1941.png\n|caption     = \n|nickname    = \n|allegiance  = {{USSR}}\n|branch      = \n|serviceyears= \n|rank        = \n|commands    = \n|battles     = \n|awards      = [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]\n|laterwork   = \n}}\n'''Zoya Anatolyevna Kosmodemyanskaya'''<ref>Also [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] '''Kosmodem'yanskaya'''.</ref> ({{lang-rus|\u0417\u043e\u0301\u044f \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|p=\u02c8zoj\u0259 k\u0259sm\u0259d\u02b2\u026a\u02c8m\u02b2jansk\u0259j\u0259}}; September 13, 1923 \u2013 November 29, 1941) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Soviet partisans|partisan]],<ref>Pravda.ru [http://english.pravda.ru/photo/report/russian_women_heroes-1796 Russian women heroes of the Great Patriotic War], a photo report</ref> and recipient of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (awarded [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]]).<ref name=\"cottam\">Kazimiera J.

Her father, Anatoly Kosmodemyansky, studied in a [[theological]] seminary, but did not graduate. He later worked as a librarian. Her mother, Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Churikova), was a school teacher. In 1925 Zoya's brother, [[Aleksandr Kosmodemyansky]], was born.

Her teachers noted her essays for deep understanding of the subject and for imagery. She read far beyond the curriculum. The list of authors she read included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Aleksandr Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], [[Karamzin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Miguel Cervantes]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Wolfgang Goethe]], and [[William Shakespeare]]. Zoya kept a notebook where she recorded her thoughts about the books she read. Such as: \"In Shakespeare's tragedies the death of a hero is always accompanied by a triumph of a high moral cause.\" She liked [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont]] and often sang Kl\u00e4rchen's song \"Die Trommel ger\u00fchret.\" Her favorite music was [[Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's Symphony No.{{nbsp}}5]]. Her striving for high ideals led to misunderstandings with her classmates. On the eve of 1939, the girls wrote each other notes with New Year wishes. Zoya received the following note \"Zoya, don't judge people so strict. Don't take everything so close to heart. Know that most people are egoist, flatterers, are insincere and you can't depend on them. You should leave their words without attention. Such is my New Year wish.\" After reading the note Zoya said, \"If one thinks of people like that, then what has one to live for?\"\n\nKosmodemyanskaya joined the [[Komsomol]] in 1938. In October 1941, still a high school student in Moscow, she volunteered for a partisan unit. To her mother, who tried to dissuade her, she answered \"What can I do when the enemy is so close? If they came here I would not be able to continue living.\" Zoya was assigned to the partisan unit 9903 (Staff of the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]]). Of the one thousand people who joined the unit in October 1941 only half survived the war. At the village of Obukhovo near [[Naro-Fominsk]], Kosmodemyanskaya and other partisans crossed the front line and entered territory occupied by the [[Germany|Germans]]. They mined roads and cut communication lines. On November 27, 1941 Zoya received an assignment to burn the village of Petrischevo, where a German cavalry regiment was stationed.\n\nIn Petrischevo, Zoya managed to set fire to horse stables and a couple of houses. On November 27 at 2{{nbsp}}o'clock in the morning Boris Krainov, Vasily Klubkov and Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya set fire to three houses in Petrishchev (residents of Karelova, Solntseva and Smirnov).<ref name=\"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\">''\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u041c. \u041c.''

Smirnova A. V. confirmed this fact with her testimony [6]. Zoya's friend at the sabotage school of Claudia Miloradova claims that one of the homes burned by Zoya was used as a German communications center. [24] The house of the Voronin family in the village was actually used as a headquarters for the officers of the troops to be moved, but was not burned. Many members of the sabotage group note that houses were burned in which German soldiers had spent the night, and also kept their horses used for transportation of military cargoes in the yards.<ref name=\"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\"/> The writer A.

Later, Klubkov was also captured by the Germans. Zoya, having missed her comrades and left alone, decided to return to Petrishchevo and continue arson. However, the German military authorities in the village had by that time organized a gathering of local residents, on which they had formed a militia in order to avoid further arson. After being arrested she was stripped, beaten, interrogated and tortured with 200 lashes and her body burnt<ref>https://archive.is/20051227015937/http://www.smi.ru/05/04/05/3442763.html</ref>, but refused to give any information. The following morning she was marched to the center of the village with a board around her neck bearing the inscription 'Houseburner' and hanged.\n\nHer final words were:\n\n{{quote|Hey, comrades! Why are you looking so sad? Be brave, fight, beat the Germans, burn, trample them! I'm not afraid to die, comrades. It is happiness to die for one's people!}}\n\nand to the Germans:\n\n{{Quote|You hang me now, but I'm not alone. There are two hundred million of us. You can't hang us all.

The journalist had heard about Zoya's execution from an elderly peasant, and was impressed by the young woman's courage. The witness recounted: \"They were hanging her and she was giving a speech. They were hanging her and she was threatening them.\" Lidov travelled to [[Petrishchevo]], collected details from local residents and published an article about the then-unknown partisan girl. Soon after, [[Joseph Stalin]] noticed the article. He proclaimed: \"Here is the people's heroine\", which started a [[Soviet propaganda during World War II|propaganda campaign]] honouring Kosmodemyanskaya.

In September 1991, an article by [[Aleksandr Zhovtis]] was published in the weekly Russian magazine ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]''.<ref>Alexander Zhovtis ''Corrections to the canonical versions'', [[Argumenty i Fakty]], N39, 1991</ref><ref name=smi>[https://archive.is/20051227015937/http://www.smi.ru/05/04/05/3442763.html ''Legends of the Great Patriotic War.

April 5, 2005 {{in lang|ru}}</ref> The article alleged that there were no German troops in the village of Petrischevo, in spite of several photos of her being hanged by German soldiers. Zhovtis blamed Stalin's [[scorched earth]] policy for the 'unnecessary' death of the young woman.<ref name=smi/> The newspaper subsequently published letters from readers, many of which included stories contradicting the mainstream version. One research supported that the person executed in Petrischevo was not Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya but a \"[[missing in action]]\" partisan, although later official conclusion from the Institute for Criminal Expertise and the [[Department of Justice of the Russian Federation]] stated otherwise. The ''Argumenty i Fakty'' articles prompted a response from ''[[Pravda]]'' observer [[Viktor Kozhemyaka]] in the form of an article titled ''Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again''.<ref>Viktor Kozhemyaka. ''Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again'' [[Pravda]] November 29, 1991</ref> Ten years later, Kozhemyaka wrote another article ''Zoya is executed yet again'',<ref>Viktor Kozhemyaka ''Zoya is executed yet again'' [[Pravda]], November 29 and November 30, 2001</ref> in which he lamented some \"absurd material\" on Internet boards, which alleged that Zoya had hurt Russian peasants rather than German troops, that she suffered from [[schizophrenia]], that she was a fanatical Stalinist, and so on.\n\n===New developments===\n[[File:Washed Zoya - tribute to Victory Day.jpg|left|thumb|[[Femen]] activist is washing a monument for Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya in Ukraine in tribute on Victory Day.]]\n\nAn important development was the publication by the newspaper ''Glasnost'' of the previously unknown protocols of the official commission of residents of Petrischevo village and Gribtsovsky [[selsoviet]] on January 25, 1942 (two months after Zoya's execution).<ref>Ivan Osadchy ''Her name and deeds are immortal'', Glasnost, September 24, 1997</ref> The protocol stated that Kosmodemyanskaya was caught while trying to destroy a stable containing more than 300 German horses. It also quite graphically described her torture and execution.<ref name=smi/>\n\nA slightly different story was told by the notes of Pyotr Lidov published in ''Parlamentskaya Gazeta'' in 1999. Apparently, Lidov for years meticulously collected all the available information on Kosmodemyanskaya. The notes supported the version that Kosmodemyanskaya and Vasily Klubkov were caught while asleep on the outskirts of Petrischevo. The Germans were called by Petrischevo resident Semyon Sviridov. Lidov's notes also included an interview with a German [[noncommissioned officer]] taken prisoner by the Red Army. The interview described the negative effect on the [[morale]] of the German soldiers who witnessed the burning of the houses.<ref name=smi/>\n\n===Klubkov's betrayal version===\nSome details of Zoya's assignment and arrest were classified for about sixty years because treachery might have been involved. The criminal case number 16440 was declassified in 2002. The case was then reviewed by [[Russia]]'s Chief Military Prosecutor Office, and it was decided that Vasily Klubkov, who betrayed Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, was not eligible for rehabilitation. According to criminal case 16440, three Soviet combatants: Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Vasily Klubkov, and their commander [[Boris Krainov]] had to perform acts of sabotage in [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]. They had been given the task of setting fire to houses in the village of Petrishchevo, where German troops were quartered. Krainov was to operate in the central part of the village, Kosmodemyanskaya in the southern and Klubkov in the northern parts. Krainov was the first to carry out his task and returned to the base. Zoya performed her task too, as was evidenced by three columns of flame in the southern part of Petrischevo seen from the base. Only the northern part was not set on fire. According to Klubkov, he was captured by two German soldiers and taken to their headquarters. A German officer threatened to kill him, and Klubkov gave him the names of Kosmodemyanskaya and Krainov. After this, Kosmodemyanskaya was captured by the Germans.<ref name=\"RIAN\">{{cite web|date=November 16, 2006 |url=http://www.rian.ru/zabytoe/20061116/55692377.html |title=The Truth on Zoya and Shura |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |language=Russian |accessdate=November 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123211131/http://www.rian.ru/zabytoe/20061116/55692377.html |archivedate=November 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date = October 9, 2002 |url = http://www.mk.ru/numbers/14/article206.htm |title = Agent is not the subject for rehabilitation |work = [[Moskovskij Komsomolets]] |language = Russian |accessdate = November 22, 2006 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070115080756/http://www.mk.ru/numbers/14/article206.htm |archivedate = January 15, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of female Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya:''Story of Zoya and Shura'', Foreign Languages Publishing House: Moscow, 1953 (\"Shura\" is a nickname for \"Alexander\", the author is Zoya's mother).\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya}}\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081020094524/http://mir.voskres.ru/mirbo07/a22.html Martyrdom of village priest Pyotr Kosmodemyansky] (in Russian)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517201556/http://www.greeklish.org/features/zoya/home.html Zoya's Story], a short biography, some tributes and excerpts from the book \"Story of Zoya and Shura\"\n* [http://photo.peoples.ru/state/citizen/zoya_kosmodemianskaya/3.shtml Photo of dead Zoya]\n* [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=284 Biography (in Russian)], on the website dedicated to the Heroes of the Soviet Union/Russia\n* [http://www.northstarcompass.org/nsc0504/zoya.htm Short Biographical Article (in English)], from Northstar Compass\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050406100247/http://www.vor.ru/English/Victory/vict_20.html Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya] From The Voice of Russia\n{{Female HSU Partisans}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kosmodemyanskaya, Zoya}}\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:1941 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Gavrilovsky District]]\n[[Category:Female resistance members of World War II]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Soviet partisans]]\n[[Category:Soviet prisoners of war]]\n[[Category:Russian people of World War II]]\n[[Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Executed Russian women]]\n[[Category:Executed people from Tambov Oblast]]\n[[Category:Executed Russian people]]\n[[Category:People executed by Nazi Germany by hanging]]\n[[Category:Russian people executed by Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Executed Soviet people from Russia]]\n[[Category:Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Women in the Russian and Soviet military]]\n[[Category:Soviet civilians killed in World War II]]\n[[Category:Russian women in World War II]]\n", "name_user": "Chrism", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLife and death", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoya_Kosmodemyanskaya"}

The attack was supported by intense ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting; both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the [[Volga River]].\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus]], a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarian]] armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.<ref>Beevor (1998: 239)</ref> The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] in the Stalingrad area.

There were a number of [[Salient (territory)|salients]], but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1942, because even though [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy losses west of [[Moscow]] the previous winter, 65% of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped.

The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the [[Volga River]]. The river was a key route from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of [[Lend Lease]] supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]] much more difficult.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|909|date=June 2011}}<ref>P.M.H.

Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city, based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union.

The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0952, Russland, bei Stalingrad, Offiziersbesprechung.jpg|thumb|Situation briefing near Stalingrad between a German company commander and a platoon leader]]\n\nThe initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.\n\nBy the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers are only {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which had important implications later in the course of the battle.

Beginning in late August, continuing in September and into October, the Soviets committed between two and four armies in hastily coordinated and poorly controlled attacks against the Germans' northern flank. The actions resulted in more than 200,000 Soviet Army casualties but did slow the German assault.\n\nOn 23 August the 6th Army reached the outskirts of Stalingrad in pursuit of the 62nd and 64th Armies, which had fallen back into the city.

These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942\u20131943 (19 November 1942 \u2013 3 March 1943), which involved some fifteen Armies operating on several fronts.

The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and [[Voronezh]]. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where {{convert|1|\u2013|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretches were being defended by a single platoon. These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons.

The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|915|date=June 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of [[Kotelnikovo]] was held only by the Romanian 4th Army.

The northern flank was defended by Hungarian and Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defence, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.\n\nDuring the preparations for the attack, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organisation, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack.<ref name=\"Beevor1998\"/>{{Rp|117|date=May 2009}} The operation was code-named \"Uranus\" and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]].

The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen.

The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, deployed in exposed positions, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the [[Romanian Third Army|Romanian 3rd Army]], which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun.\n\nBehind the front lines, no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]]. The response by the ''Wehrmacht'' was both chaotic and indecisive. Poor weather prevented effective air action against the Soviet offensive.  Army Group B was in disarray and faced strong Soviet pressure across all its fronts.  Hence it was ineffective in relieving the 6th army.\n\nOn 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian [[4th Army Corps (Romania)|4th Army Corps]].

Not all of the 6th Army was trapped: 50,000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket. These belonged mostly to the other two divisions of the 6th Army between the Italian and Romanian Armies: the 62nd and 298th Infantry Divisions. Of the 210,000 Germans, 10,000 remained to fight on, 105,000 surrendered, 35,000 left by air and the remaining 60,000 died.\n\nEven with the desperate situation of the Sixth Army, Army Group A continued their invasion of the Caucasus further south from 19 November until 19 December. By 19 December the German army was in full retreat out of the Caucasus, while using the Sixth Army to tie down the Soviet forces. Hence Army Group A was never used to help relieve the Sixth Army.\n\n[[Army Group Don]] was formed under Field Marshal von Manstein.

When asked by Hitler, G\u00f6ring replied, after being convinced by [[Hans Jeschonnek]],<ref name=hayward98/>{{Rp|234|date=May 2009}} that the ''Luftwaffe'' could supply the 6th Army with an \"[[airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]].\" This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]], albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army.<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|132}}\n\n[[File:Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad late 1942.jpg|thumb|A Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad]]\n\nThe director of ''Luftflotte'' 4, Wolfram von Richthofen, tried to get this decision overturned. The forces under the 6th Army were almost twice as large as a regular German army unit, plus there was also a corps of the 4th Panzer Army trapped in the pocket. The maximum 107 tonnes they could deliver a day \u2013 based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at [[Pitomnik Airfield|Pitomnik]] to land at \u2013 was far less than the minimum 750 tonnes needed.<ref name=hayward98/><ref group=\"Note\">Shirer p. 926 says that \"Paulus radioed that they would need a minimum of 750 tons of supplies day flown in,\" while Craig pp. 206\u201307 quotes Zeitzler as pressing Goering about his boast that the Luftwaffe could airlift the needed supplies: \"Are you aware&nbsp;... how many daily sorties the army in Stalingrad will need?&nbsp;... Seven hundred tons!

General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demyansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement, and said that the Luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt. He acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up Stalingrad would mean, but this would be made easier to bear by conserving the combat power of the Sixth Army and regaining the initiative.<ref>Kehrig, Manfred ''Stalingrad'', Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags Anstalt, 1974 pp. 279, 311\u201312, 575.</ref> He ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of disengaging the Soviets. Hitler reiterated that the Sixth Army would stay at Stalingrad and that the air bridge would supply it until the encirclement was broken by a new German offensive.\n\nSupplying the 270,000 men trapped in the \"cauldron\" required 700 tons of supplies a day. That would mean 350 [[Ju 52]] flights a day into Pitomnik. At a minimum, 500 tons were required. However, according to Adam, \"On not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|119, 127, 131, 134}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was able to deliver an average of 85 tonnes of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of 106 tonnes per day. The most successful day, 19 December, the ''Luftwaffe'' delivered 262 tonnes of supplies in 154 flights. The outcome of the airlift was the Luftwaffe's failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft \u2013 tools that included airfield facilities, supplies, manpower, and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions.

The 6th Army slowly starved. General [[Kurt Zeitzler|Zeitzler]], moved by their plight, began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times.

Operation Winter Storm (''Operation Wintergewitter''), the German attempt led by Erich von Manstein to relieve the trapped army from the south, was initially successful. By 18 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) of Sixth Army's positions. However the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all German forces in the area.  The starving encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with Manstein's advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on Rostov-on-Don, \"an early abandonment\" of Stalingrad \"would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus,\" and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30&nbsp;km advance towards Hoth's spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air.

The Germans set up a \"mobile defence\" of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions \u2013 supported by at least 100 tanks \u2013 attacked the Italian Cosseria and [[3rd Infantry Division Ravenna|Ravenna]] Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders,<ref>''\"During this phase, the Germans praised the steadfastness of Italian infantry, who held out tenaciously even in isolated strong-points, but eventually reached their breaking-point under this constant pressure. \"'' The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers, Rolf-Dieter M\u00fcller, p. 83\u201384, I.B.Tauris, 28 February 2014</ref> but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paoletti|first=Ciro|title=A Military History of Italy|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|year=2008|page=177| isbn=978-0-275-98505-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uz8eiwzEMHQC&pg=PA182&dq=Ariete+tanks+fight!#PPA177,M1|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. Sensing that this was the last chance for a breakout, Manstein pleaded with Hitler on 18 December, but Hitler refused. Paulus himself also doubted the feasibility of such a breakout. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions.

Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called ''HiWis'', Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody urban warfare began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defence of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown. The Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0316-0204-005, Russland, Paulus in Kriegsgefangenschaft.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Friedrich Paulus]] (left), with his chief of staff, ''Generalleutnant'' [[Arthur Schmidt (soldier)|Arthur Schmidt]] (centre) and his aide, [[Wilhelm Adam (politician)|Wilhelm Adam]] (right), after their surrender]]\n\nOn 22 January, Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender. Hitler rejected it on a point of honour. He telegraphed the 6th Army later that day, claiming that it had made a historic contribution to the greatest struggle in German history and that it should stand fast \"to the last soldier and the last bullet.\" Hitler told Goebbels that the plight of the 6th Army was a \"heroic drama of German history.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|p=549}}</ref> On 24 January, in his radio report to Hitler, Paulus reported \"18,000 wounded without the slightest aid of bandages and medicines.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|193}}\n\nOn 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets north and south of Mamai-Kurgan.

Brown University historian [[Omer Bartov]] claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany. Almost every letter expressed belief in Germany's ultimate victory and their willingness to fight and die at Stalingrad to achieve that victory.<ref name=Bartov>Bartov, Omer ''Hitler's Army'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991 pp.&nbsp;166\u201367</ref> Bartov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from Stalingrad but in their letters to their families boasted that they were proud to \"sacrifice themselves for the F\u00fchrer\".<ref name=Bartov/>\n\nThe remaining forces continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers but by early March 1943, the last small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered.

British war correspondent [[Alexander Werth]] described the following scene in his ''Russia at War'' book, based on a first-hand account of his visit to Stalingrad on 3\u20135 February 1943,\n\n{{quote|We [...] went into the yard of the large burnt out building of the Red Army House; and here one realised particularly clearly what the last days of Stalingrad had been to so many of the Germans. In the porch lay the skeleton of a horse, with only a few scraps of meat still clinging to its ribs. Then we came into the yard. Here lay more {{sic|?|more}} horses' skeletons, and to the right, there was an enormous horrible [[cesspool]] \u2013 fortunately, frozen solid. And then, suddenly, at the far end of the yard I caught sight of a human figure. He had been crouching over another cesspool, and now, noticing us, he was hastily pulling up his pants, and then he slunk away into the door of the basement. But as he passed, I caught a glimpse of the wretch's face \u2013 with its mixture of suffering and idiot-like incomprehension. For a moment, I wished that the whole of Germany were there to see it. The man was probably already dying. In that basement [...] there were still two hundred Germans\u2014dying of hunger and frostbite. \"We haven't had time to deal with them yet,\" one of the Russians said. \"They'll be taken away tomorrow, I suppose.\" And, at the far end of the yard, besides the other cesspool, behind a low stone wall, the yellow corpses of skinny Germans were piled up \u2013 men who had died in that basement\u2014about a dozen wax-like dummies. We did not go into the basement itself \u2013 what was the use? There was nothing we could do for them.<ref>Alexander Werth, Russia at War 1941\u20131945, New York, E. P.

Some 35,000 were eventually sent on transports, of which 17,000 did not survive. Most died of wounds, disease (particularly [[typhus]]), cold, overwork, mistreatment and malnutrition. Some were kept in the city to help rebuild it.\n\nA handful of senior officers were taken to Moscow and used for propaganda purposes, and some of them joined the [[National Committee for a Free Germany]].

Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p. 107.</ref> At the time, the global significance of the battle was not in doubt. Writing in his diary on 1 January 1943, British General [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], reflected on the change in the position from a year before:\n\n{{quote|I felt Russia could never hold, Caucasus was bound to be penetrated, and [[Abadan]] (our Achilles heel) would be captured with the consequent collapse of [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India]], etc. After Russia's defeat how were we to handle the German land and air forces liberated? England would be again bombarded, threat of invasion revived... And now! We start 1943 under conditions I would never have dared to hope. Russia has held, Egypt for the present is safe. There is a hope of clearing North Africa of Germans in the near future... Russia is scoring wonderful successes in Southern Russia.<ref name=\"P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107\"/>}}\n\nAt this point, the British had won the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] in November 1942. However, there were only about 50,000 German soldiers at El Alamein in Egypt, while at Stalingrad 300,000 to 400,000 Germans had been lost.<ref name=\"P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107\"/>\n\nRegardless of the strategic implications, there is little doubt about Stalingrad's symbolism. Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility and dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. Joseph Goebbels read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.<ref>P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, pp. 104\u201305, 107.</ref>\n\nThe reverse was the case on the Soviet side. There was an overwhelming surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: \"You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad.\" Stalin was feted as the hero of the hour and made a Marshal of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"P.M.H.

The attack was supported by intense ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting; both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the [[Volga River]].\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus]], a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarian]] armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.<ref>Beevor (1998: 239)</ref> The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] in the Stalingrad area.

There were a number of [[Salient (territory)|salients]], but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1942, because even though [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy losses west of [[Moscow]] the previous winter, 65% of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped.

The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the [[Volga River]]. The river was a key route from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of [[Lend Lease]] supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]] much more difficult.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|909|date=June 2011}}<ref>P.M.H.

Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city, based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union.

The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0952, Russland, bei Stalingrad, Offiziersbesprechung.jpg|thumb|Situation briefing near Stalingrad between a German company commander and a platoon leader]]\n\nThe initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.\n\nBy the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers are only {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which had important implications later in the course of the battle.

These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942\u20131943 (19 November 1942 \u2013 3 March 1943), which involved some fifteen Armies operating on several fronts.

The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and [[Voronezh]]. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where {{convert|1|\u2013|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretches were being defended by a single platoon. These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons.

The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|915|date=June 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of [[Kotelnikovo]] was held only by the Romanian 4th Army.

The northern flank was defended by Hungarian and Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defence, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.\n\nDuring the preparations for the attack, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organisation, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack.<ref name=\"Beevor1998\"/>{{Rp|117|date=May 2009}} The operation was code-named \"Uranus\" and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]].

The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen.

The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, deployed in exposed positions, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the [[Romanian Third Army|Romanian 3rd Army]], which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun.\n\nBehind the front lines, no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]]. The response by the ''Wehrmacht'' was both chaotic and indecisive. Poor weather prevented effective air action against the Soviet offensive.  Army Group B was in disarray and faced strong Soviet pressure across all its fronts.  Hence it was ineffective in relieving the 6th army.\n\nOn 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian [[4th Army Corps (Romania)|4th Army Corps]].

Not all of the 6th Army was trapped: 50,000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket. These belonged mostly to the other two divisions of the 6th Army between the Italian and Romanian Armies: the 62nd and 298th Infantry Divisions. Of the 210,000 Germans, 10,000 remained to fight on, 105,000 surrendered, 35,000 left by air and the remaining 60,000 died.\n\nEven with the desperate situation of the Sixth Army, Army Group A continued their invasion of the Caucasus further south from 19 November until 19 December. By 19 December the German army was in full retreat out of the Caucasus, while using the Sixth Army to tie down the Soviet forces. Hence Army Group A was never used to help relieve the Sixth Army.\n\n[[Army Group Don]] was formed under Field Marshal von Manstein.

When asked by Hitler, G\u00f6ring replied, after being convinced by [[Hans Jeschonnek]],<ref name=hayward98/>{{Rp|234|date=May 2009}} that the ''Luftwaffe'' could supply the 6th Army with an \"[[airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]].\" This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]], albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army.<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|132}}\n\n[[File:Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad late 1942.jpg|thumb|A Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad]]\n\nThe director of ''Luftflotte'' 4, Wolfram von Richthofen, tried to get this decision overturned. The forces under the 6th Army were almost twice as large as a regular German army unit, plus there was also a corps of the 4th Panzer Army trapped in the pocket. The maximum 107 tonnes they could deliver a day \u2013 based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at [[Pitomnik Airfield|Pitomnik]] to land at \u2013 was far less than the minimum 750 tonnes needed.<ref name=hayward98/><ref group=\"Note\">Shirer p. 926 says that \"Paulus radioed that they would need a minimum of 750 tons of supplies day flown in,\" while Craig pp. 206\u201307 quotes Zeitzler as pressing Goering about his boast that the Luftwaffe could airlift the needed supplies: \"Are you aware&nbsp;... how many daily sorties the army in Stalingrad will need?&nbsp;... Seven hundred tons!

General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demyansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement, and said that the Luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt. He acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up Stalingrad would mean, but this would be made easier to bear by conserving the combat power of the Sixth Army and regaining the initiative.<ref>Kehrig, Manfred ''Stalingrad'', Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags Anstalt, 1974 pp. 279, 311\u201312, 575.</ref> He ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of disengaging the Soviets. Hitler reiterated that the Sixth Army would stay at Stalingrad and that the air bridge would supply it until the encirclement was broken by a new German offensive.\n\nSupplying the 270,000 men trapped in the \"cauldron\" required 700 tons of supplies a day. That would mean 350 [[Ju 52]] flights a day into Pitomnik. At a minimum, 500 tons were required. However, according to Adam, \"On not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|119, 127, 131, 134}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was able to deliver an average of 85 tonnes of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of 106 tonnes per day. The most successful day, 19 December, the ''Luftwaffe'' delivered 262 tonnes of supplies in 154 flights. The outcome of the airlift was the Luftwaffe's failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft \u2013 tools that included airfield facilities, supplies, manpower, and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions.

The 6th Army slowly starved. General [[Kurt Zeitzler|Zeitzler]], moved by their plight, began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times.

Operation Winter Storm (''Operation Wintergewitter''), the German attempt led by Erich von Manstein to relieve the trapped army from the south, was initially successful. By 18 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) of Sixth Army's positions. However the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all German forces in the area.  The starving encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with Manstein's advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on Rostov-on-Don, \"an early abandonment\" of Stalingrad \"would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus,\" and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30&nbsp;km advance towards Hoth's spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air.

The Germans set up a \"mobile defence\" of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions \u2013 supported by at least 100 tanks \u2013 attacked the Italian Cosseria and [[3rd Infantry Division Ravenna|Ravenna]] Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders,<ref>''\"During this phase, the Germans praised the steadfastness of Italian infantry, who held out tenaciously even in isolated strong-points, but eventually reached their breaking-point under this constant pressure. \"'' The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers, Rolf-Dieter M\u00fcller, p. 83\u201384, I.B.Tauris, 28 February 2014</ref> but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paoletti|first=Ciro|title=A Military History of Italy|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|year=2008|page=177| isbn=978-0-275-98505-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uz8eiwzEMHQC&pg=PA182&dq=Ariete+tanks+fight!#PPA177,M1|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. Sensing that this was the last chance for a breakout, Manstein pleaded with Hitler on 18 December, but Hitler refused. Paulus himself also doubted the feasibility of such a breakout. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions.

Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called ''HiWis'', Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody urban warfare began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defence of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown. The Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0316-0204-005, Russland, Paulus in Kriegsgefangenschaft.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Friedrich Paulus]] (left), with his chief of staff, ''Generalleutnant'' [[Arthur Schmidt (soldier)|Arthur Schmidt]] (centre) and his aide, [[Wilhelm Adam (politician)|Wilhelm Adam]] (right), after their surrender]]\n\nOn 22 January, Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender. Hitler rejected it on a point of honour. He telegraphed the 6th Army later that day, claiming that it had made a historic contribution to the greatest struggle in German history and that it should stand fast \"to the last soldier and the last bullet.\" Hitler told Goebbels that the plight of the 6th Army was a \"heroic drama of German history.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|p=549}}</ref> On 24 January, in his radio report to Hitler, Paulus reported \"18,000 wounded without the slightest aid of bandages and medicines.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|193}}\n\nOn 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets north and south of Mamai-Kurgan.

Brown University historian [[Omer Bartov]] claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany. Almost every letter expressed belief in Germany's ultimate victory and their willingness to fight and die at Stalingrad to achieve that victory.<ref name=Bartov>Bartov, Omer ''Hitler's Army'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991 pp.&nbsp;166\u201367</ref> Bartov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from Stalingrad but in their letters to their families boasted that they were proud to \"sacrifice themselves for the F\u00fchrer\".<ref name=Bartov/>\n\nThe remaining forces continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers but by early March 1943, the last small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered.

British war correspondent [[Alexander Werth]] described the following scene in his ''Russia at War'' book, based on a first-hand account of his visit to Stalingrad on 3\u20135 February 1943,\n\n{{quote|We [...] went into the yard of the large burnt out building of the Red Army House; and here one realised particularly clearly what the last days of Stalingrad had been to so many of the Germans. In the porch lay the skeleton of a horse, with only a few scraps of meat still clinging to its ribs. Then we came into the yard. Here lay more {{sic|?|more}} horses' skeletons, and to the right, there was an enormous horrible [[cesspool]] \u2013 fortunately, frozen solid. And then, suddenly, at the far end of the yard I caught sight of a human figure. He had been crouching over another cesspool, and now, noticing us, he was hastily pulling up his pants, and then he slunk away into the door of the basement. But as he passed, I caught a glimpse of the wretch's face \u2013 with its mixture of suffering and idiot-like incomprehension. For a moment, I wished that the whole of Germany were there to see it. The man was probably already dying. In that basement [...] there were still two hundred Germans\u2014dying of hunger and frostbite. \"We haven't had time to deal with them yet,\" one of the Russians said. \"They'll be taken away tomorrow, I suppose.\" And, at the far end of the yard, besides the other cesspool, behind a low stone wall, the yellow corpses of skinny Germans were piled up \u2013 men who had died in that basement\u2014about a dozen wax-like dummies. We did not go into the basement itself \u2013 what was the use? There was nothing we could do for them.<ref>Alexander Werth, Russia at War 1941\u20131945, New York, E. P.

Some 35,000 were eventually sent on transports, of which 17,000 did not survive. Most died of wounds, disease (particularly [[typhus]]), cold, overwork, mistreatment and malnutrition. Some were kept in the city to help rebuild it.\n\nA handful of senior officers were taken to Moscow and used for propaganda purposes, and some of them joined the [[National Committee for a Free Germany]].

Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p. 107.</ref> At the time, the global significance of the battle was not in doubt. Writing in his diary on 1 January 1943, British General [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], reflected on the change in the position from a year before:\n\n{{quote|I felt Russia could never hold, Caucasus was bound to be penetrated, and [[Abadan]] (our Achilles heel) would be captured with the consequent collapse of [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India]], etc. After Russia's defeat how were we to handle the German land and air forces liberated? England would be again bombarded, threat of invasion revived... And now! We start 1943 under conditions I would never have dared to hope. Russia has held, Egypt for the present is safe. There is a hope of clearing North Africa of Germans in the near future... Russia is scoring wonderful successes in Southern Russia.<ref name=\"P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107\"/>}}\n\nAt this point, the British had won the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] in November 1942. However, there were only about 50,000 German soldiers at El Alamein in Egypt, while at Stalingrad 300,000 to 400,000 Germans had been lost.<ref name=\"P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107\"/>\n\nRegardless of the strategic implications, there is little doubt about Stalingrad's symbolism. Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility and dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. Joseph Goebbels read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.<ref>P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, pp. 104\u201305, 107.</ref>\n\nThe reverse was the case on the Soviet side. There was an overwhelming surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: \"You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad.\" Stalin was feted as the hero of the hour and made a Marshal of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"P.M.H.

In her book ''English Grammar: a descriptive linguistics approach'', she bridges the so-called contradiction between descriptive and [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive grammar]] by developing a new framework with which prescriptive grammar can be re-analyzed using the linguistic tools of descriptive linguistics. This approach has been adopted to teach English grammar to [[First language|native speakers]] or [[Foreign language|non-native speakers]] of English.

His corrupt business partner, Frank Semyon ([[Vince Vaughn]]), is forced to make the presentation on his own, in the presence of his mob connections. Vinci Police detective Raymond \"Ray\" Velcoro ([[Colin Farrell]]) is seeking custody of his son, who may be a product of his ex-wife's ([[Abigail Spencer]]) rape, years before. Through flashback, Velcoro is shown meeting Semyon at a bar, where Semyon gives him the name of his wife's rapist. Velcoro is now burned out and unhinged, and also works as an [[mob enforcer|enforcer]] for Semyon. Ventura County detective Antigone \"Ani\" Bezzerides ([[Rachel McAdams]]) conducts a raid on a suspected illegal brothel, which turns out to be a legal porn studio, where she finds her sister Athena working as a [[cam girl]]. Later, the search for Vera Machiado, a missing woman, leads Bezzerides to the woman's last known place of employment, a spiritual retreat run by Bezzerides' estranged father, Eliot, leading to a tense confrontation. A third cop, Highway Patrol officer Paul Woodrugh ([[Taylor Kitsch]]), is put on [[paid leave]] after an actress, Lacey Lindel, tries to seduce him and later falsely accuses him of sexual misconduct when he refuses to look the other way after catching her speeding and violating her parole. While visiting his girlfriend, Emily, Woodrugh secretly takes [[Viagra]] and does not answer her questions about the scars on his body. Late at night, racing his motorcycle without headlights and with near-suicidal ferocity, Woodrugh discovers the corpse of Caspere propped up on a bench, with his eyes burned out.

Lamenting on the news of Caspere's death, Semyon wonders how he'll get out of his financial issues, as he discovers that the money he gave Caspere for the high-speed rail deal was embezzled and he has lost over $5 million \u2013 most of his fortune. Enraged, he begins to investigate Caspere's death in his own way. State investigators still want to push into the rumors of backdoor deals and corruption in Vinci, and recruit Woodrugh as a Special Investigator to gather evidence in exchange for quashing the Lindel solicitation scandal. Bezzerides is warned by her superiors that Velcoro is corrupt and to find a way to make him an informant, while Velcoro is asked by Austin Chessani, the mayor of Vinci, and his own superiors, Police Chief Holloway and Lieutenant Kevin Burris, that the investigation move where they want it. A fourth detective, Teague Dixon, is placed alongside them by the Vinci PD. An autopsy of Caspere's body shows that he was tortured for information and his genitals shot off with a shotgun before being placed at the rest stop. Drunk, Velcoro seeks time with his son and instead gets a cruel backlash from his ex-wife, Gena, who now seeks full custody of their son and threatens a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity test]] to force him away. After an enigmatic visit to his mother, Cynthia, Woodrugh gets into an argument with Emily, who thinks he is cheating, and he leaves her on bad terms. While driving with Velcoro and discussing the case, Bezzerides questions just how compromised he is, a question he leaves unanswered. At the bar, Semyon informs Velcoro about Caspere's secret second house, information which he obtained from a prostitute. As Velcoro enters the home searching for clues, a person in a raven mask appears and shoots him twice with a shotgun, once at [[point blank range]].\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Maybe Tomorrow\n |DirectedBy = [[Janus Metz Pedersen|Janus Metz]]\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|5}}\n |Viewers = 2.62<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/08/sunday-cable-ratings-shark-week-wins-night-true-detective-ballers-the-last-ship-botched-falling-skies-more/427462/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: Shark Week Wins Night, 'True Detective', ' Ballers', 'The Last Ship', 'Botched', 'Falling Skies' & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Sara |last=Bibel |date=July 8, 2015 |accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Velcoro has a dream of a man, later revealed to be his father, in a bar. His father tells Velcoro of a vision of him running out of the woods and being shot to death as Velcoro sees wounds form on his own body. He awakens revealing the shot was non-lethal (the shotgun was loaded with rubber pelleted riot control rounds), and discovers that a hard drive containing footage of Caspere's sexual encounters has been stolen. Semyon begins suffering from [[erectile dysfunction]] for the first time as pressure builds against him while his wife, Jordan, gives him oral sex for [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] which he considers unnatural. Bezzerides and Woodrugh investigate Mayor Chessani's possible connection to Caspere's death by going to his home. They discover his intoxicated young trophy wife, moody daughter and problematic son much to Chessani's dismay who threatens to have Bezzerides and Woodrugh fired. As he recovers, Velcoro meets his father who is also an alcoholic and delivers him ''[[cannabis indica]]'' to help his father sleep. Semyon meets an old business partner in the construction business who already paid his debts, but demands more capital in exchange for new favors. Semyon meets with Osip who hints he is bailing on the deal. Semyon's criminal associate, Blake, enters and reveals his other criminal associate, Stan, was just killed as well. Woodrugh meets an old friend from private security firm Black Mountain, Miguel Gilb, who reminds him of their homosexual encounter during the war. Woodrugh responds by cursing him out and pushing him to the ground. Later Woodrugh uses a gay escort to get into Danny Santos' club for further investigation, where he briefly bumps into Semyon. Semyon tells Santos and other gangsters to find who is murdering his associates. Santos, already having lost respect for Semyon, states he no longer works for him and tells Semyon to leave. Semyon responds by fighting and beating Santos, then removing Santos' golden front teeth with pliers. While Bezzerides and Velcoro share a drink at his house, Gena shows up at his door to inform him he is under investigation by the state for corruption and the prior assault on her rapist; Bezzerides hears the conversation behind the door. Gena attempts to give Velcoro $10,000 to drop the custody battle, which he refuses. A tip from Caspere's assistant Laura leads Bezzerides and Velcoro to investigate a movie set, where they learn that a car had been stolen in the weeks prior, presumably the same car which carried Caspere. As they interrogate a former movie production employee, who quit shortly before the car was stolen, a masked man sets fire to the car which transported Caspere's body right around the corner from the detectives, who chase him. Bezzerides is nearly hit by a truck during the pursuit before Velcoro pulls her out of the way. She thanks Velcoro, who tells her she can thank him by telling him what the state has against him.

Bezzerides and Velcoro follow Caspere's movements, tracking him to vast tracts of land contaminated by the heavy metals dumped in the tailings from decades of mining. A visit to the commune run by Bezzerides's father reveals that Chessani, Caspere and Caspere's psychiatrist Dr. Pitlor have been in business for decades, prompting Velcoro to admit that the State investigation into Vinci is little more than a shakedown. He warns Bezzerides that Chessani did not get to his position without having faced similar pressure in the past, and that he could not survive without powerful friends or amassing power of his own. Political forces\u2014implied to be Chessani's influence\u2014see Bezzerides suspended from her job after a co-worker files a sexual harassment complaint against her, though she is allowed to remain on the special task force. Woodrugh awakens from his investigation into the prostitutes to find that he has slept with Miguel. Refusing to address the issue, Woodrugh leaves to find his motorcycle gone and is later accosted by reporters asking questions about his time with a private military contractor in Iraq. Later meeting with his estranged girlfriend in a diner, where she informs him she is pregnant, Woodrugh desperately proposes marriage to her. Throwing himself back into the investigation, he and Dixon follow up on a lead at a pawn shop where he uncovers a prostitute named Irina had sold a watch owned by Caspere. Velcoro approaches Semyon with this, which Semyon dismisses as unlikely as Stan was killed under similar circumstances and there is no connection to his death. Under pressure from Vinci PD to close the case, Velcoro, Bezzerides and Woodrugh lead a raid against Irina's pimp, Ledo Amarilla, but are ambushed when the building is found to be a methamphetamine lab which promptly explodes when the police open fire. As Amarilla tries to escape, he crashes his SUV into a city bus during a demonstration against the rail project. He and his accomplices open fire on the crowd as the police move in, with Dixon among the dead, and while the gunmen are killed, Velcoro, Bezzerides and Woodrugh are left horrified at the mass civilian and police casualties.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Other Lives\n |DirectedBy = [[John Crowley (director)|John Crowley]]\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|19}}\n |Viewers = 2.42<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/21/sunday-cable-ratings-naked-and-afraid-xl-wins-night-true-detective-balers-the-strain-the-last-ship-more/433961/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'Naked and Afraid XL' Wins Night, 'True Detective', 'Ballers', 'The Strain', 'The Last Ship', 'Tut' & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Sara |last=Bibel |date=July 21, 2015 |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Two months after the shoot-out, the special investigation into Caspere's death has been shut down, with the State Attorney, Geldof, satisfied that Amarilla was responsible. Velcoro has since quit the Vinci PD and works private security for Semyon while fighting his ex-wife and her husband for custody of his son; Bezzerides has been demoted to the sheriff's office evidence lock-up, attending sexual harassment seminars, and has returned to investigating Vera's disappearance in her own time; and Woodrugh has been promoted to detective and investigating insurance fraud while fighting extortion attempts by Lindel. Semyon approaches McCandless, owner of Catalyst\u2014the company holding the lands to be bought for the rail project\u2014with information that the person he sold his waste disposal company to has died under suspicious circumstances. This, combined with McCandless' complicitness in having Semyon use said company prior to its sale to contaminate the lands around the rail project to lower its value before the federal government bought it back are used as blackmail by Semyon to get back into the rail project. McCandless instead gives him the chance to buy back into the project if he can recover the hard drive stolen from Caspere's apartment the night Velcoro was shot. Semyon also has Velcoro tail Blake, whom he no longer trusts. Velcoro spots him and Tony Chessani picking up three girls at Pitlor's clinic then bringing them to Semyon's rival, Osip. Meanwhile, Bezzerides makes a connection between Vera and the cache of blue diamonds found in Caspere's safe deposit box. This prompts Davis to re-open the investigation into Caspere's death under the pretext of finding Irina, bringing Velcoro, Bezzerides, and Woodrugh back together. Davis suspects Geldof colluded with Chessani, using the original investigation to establish an account to fund his campaign for governor and pin the corruption on Caspere. Velcoro is pensive but agrees when Davis offers to help him keep custody of his son. Davis also reveals to Velcoro that Gena's rapist had been arrested six weeks previously. After confirming this with Gena, Velcoro realizes that the tip Semyon gave him years ago was a set-up to corrupt him. Woodrugh follows up on the diamonds and discovers Dixon had been looking for them prior to their discovery but had kept that information to himself during the original investigation. This leads Woodrugh and Bezzerides to conclude that Vinci PD had been using Dixon to manipulate the investigation. Velcoro returns to Pitlor's clinic and beats Pitlor for information, confirming that Caspere and Chessani were in business together linking influential men with prostitutes at secret parties. They subsequently used pictures taken at the parties to blackmail men like McCandless who attend them. Bezzerides approaches her sister to try to get an invite to an upcoming party before she and Woodrugh, following a previous lead from her old partner, match Vera's last movements to an abandoned house in [[Guerneville, California|Guerneville]]. Deep in the woods behind the house they discover a blood stained shed with a torture chair inside. As Semyon and Jordan reconcile after being at odds over Semyon's return to his old business practices, Jordan's infertility, and their future, Velcoro arrives at their new home and tells Semyon they need to talk.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Church in Ruins\n |DirectedBy = {{nowrap|[[Miguel Sapochnik]]}}\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto & Scott Lasser\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|26}}\n |Viewers = 2.34<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/28/sunday-cable-ratings-i-am-cait-tops-night-naked-afraid-xl-rick-morty-true-detective-nascar-ballers-more/438491/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'I am Cait' Tops Night + 'Naked & Afraid XL', 'Rick & Morty', 'True Detective', NASCAR, 'Ballers' & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Amanda |last=Kondolojy |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Velcoro and Semyon discuss the tip that led Velcoro to his wife's alleged rapist, with both men grasping their guns under the kitchen table. Semyon swears to Velcoro that he thought the information was genuine at the time. Satisfied that Semyon did not intentionally mislead him, Velcoro confronts the man arrested for the rape in prison, promising to kill him. After an awkward supervised visit with his son, Velcoro goes on a cocaine- and alcohol-fueled bender before calling his ex-wife and agreeing to drop the custody case on the condition that she never reveal her son's true parentage. Semyon later meets with Stan's widow and young son to comfort them and question them on possible suspects in his death, with Stan's widow citing Blake. Meanwhile, Woodrugh follows up on the missing diamonds to find that they were part of a cache stolen during a double homicide and robbery in the 1992 riots that orphaned two children, making the diamonds untraceable. Semyon starts searching for Irina, making an agreement with a Mexican cartel that will allow him to meet Irina provided the cartel are allowed to move drugs through his clubs. Irina calls Semyon and reveals that she had been given the items from Caspere's home by a police officer. Semyon arranges to meet her so that she can identify the man from a photo, but arriving at the meeting point finds her dead, having been killed by the Mexicans for dealing with police. Outnumbered and empty-handed, Semyon is forced to accept the deal with the Mexicans. Bezzerides goes undercover, posing as her sister to infiltrate one of the secret elite parties in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. With no phone, transmitter or weapon, she is forced to rely on Woodrugh and Velcoro for support. At the party, she is drugged and taken to the guests with a busload of other girls. Her attempts to search the party are hampered by the male guests (Geldof, Holloway and Tony Chessani among them) and hallucinations of a strange man from her childhood, implying that she was sexually abused. As Woodrugh and Velcoro sneak in, they observe a meeting between McCandless and Osip where McCandless admits that Osip's investment in the rail project was far more lucrative than Semyon's. The two steal a set of contracts from McCandless' office. Bezzerides locates Vera at the party and attempts to get her out, but is forced to kill a guard in the process. She and Vera are found by Woodrugh who escorts them to Velcoro in a waiting car. As the four escape, Woodrugh goes over the stolen contracts and starts to realize the scale of what they are involved in.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = {{nowrap|Black Maps and Motel Rooms}}\n |DirectedBy = [[Dan Attias|Daniel Attias]]\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|2}}\n |Viewers = 2.18<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/08/04/sunday-cable-ratings-rick-and-morty-naked-and-afraid-xl-win-night-true-detective-the-last-ship-ballers-the-strain-ray-donovan-more/442148/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'Rick and Morty' & 'Naked and Afraid XL', Win Night, 'True Detective', 'The Last Ship', 'Ballers', 'The Strain', 'Ray Donovan' & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Sara |last=Bibel |date=August 4, 2015 |accessdate=August 4, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = The task force regroups after the party to allow Vera and Bezzerides to recover from the drugs they were given while Velcoro and Woodrugh go over the documents that link Catalyst and McCandless to Osip. When morning comes, Woodrugh and Bezzerides move their families to safety while Velcoro reports to Semyon. Velcoro approaches Davis with their evidence but finds her shot dead in her car. Woodrugh discovers that Bezzerides is wanted for questioning over the death of the security guard she killed at the party while Velcoro has been named as a suspect in Davis' murder. Woodrugh is contacted by a third party blackmailing him with photos from his night with Gilb. Using information from Semyon, Vera and the police database, the three are able to formulate a theory on Caspere's death: that a group of corrupt police\u2014Holloway, Burris, Dixon and Caspere\u2014used the 1992 riots to steal the diamonds which they used to buy into the Vinci power structure; however, Laura, a child orphaned during the robbery, tracked them down and after posing as Caspere's assistant and killed him after confirming his involvement. Everything from their discovery of the diamonds through to the shoot-out with Ledo Amarilla has been manipulated from behind the scenes by Vinci PD to cover up their involvement in the original crime. Meanwhile, Semyon confronts Blake over his role in Osip's operation; Blake admits that Osip is trying to force Semyon out of business with the help of Chessani's son Tony, who Osip will install as mayor of Vinci to act as his puppet. When pushed further, Blake confesses to having killed Stan and staging the murder to imitate Caspere's death. Semyon kills him and arranges for Jordan to leave town. When approached by Osip, Semyon bows out gracefully and accepts a role as manager of Osip's clubs. However, having learned of a money drop (from Blake, prior to killing him) in which Osip will transfer $12 million to Tony Chessani, Semyon takes his cash reserves and burns the properties to hurt Osip's business. Faced with the realization of just how powerful their enemies are, Velcoro and Bezzerides sleep together. Meanwhile, Woodrugh is lured to a meeting with his blackmailer, Holloway, who demands the documents taken from the party. Woodrugh overpowers him and is drawn into a shootout with the Black Mountain private security accompanying Holloway on behalf of McCandless, killing all of them. As he makes his escape, he is shot twice and killed by Lieutenant Burris.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n |Title = Omega Station\n |DirectedBy = John Crowley\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|9}}\n |Viewers = 2.73<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/08/11/sunday-cable-ratings-true-detective-tops-night-naked-and-afraid-xl-rick-morty-ballers-more/446259/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'True Detective' Tops Night + 'Naked and Afraid XL', 'Rick & Morty', 'Ballers', & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Amanda |last=Kondolojy |date=August 11, 2015 |accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = After a night of sex, Velcoro and Bezzerides recount their respective traumas\u2014Bezzerides' childhood molestation and Velcoro's murder of his wife's supposed rapist. Semyon convinces Jordan to leave the country for Venezuela with his lieutenant Nails, where he will rendezvous with her two weeks later or sooner. He then goes to Chessani's mansion, where he finds the mayor dead, and the mayor's wife Veronica, while high, implicates his son Tony as his murderer. Meanwhile Velcoro and Bezzerides learn of Woodrugh's death and resolve to close the case. They identify Laura, Caspere's secretary, and Lenny, a photographer from the movie set of the stolen prop car, as the Osterman siblings. Visiting Lenny's home they find the bird's head mask from the earlier episodes, identifying him as both the murderer of Caspere and the man who shot Velcoro. The also find Laura handcuffed to the fireplace; she confirms that Lenny murdered Caspere and plans to kill Holloway under the pretense of a public meeting at a train station in [[Anaheim]] to trade Caspere's hard drive for money as the hard drive had been erased. Bezzerides puts Laura on a bus to Seattle while Velcoro intercepts Lenny at the train station and convinces him to entrap Holloway. Velcoro takes Lenny's place, leading Holloway into a discussion of the blue diamond conspiracy with him, while Lenny sits behind them. Holloway reveals that Caspere fathered Laura illegitimately and that their mother was pregnant with Caspere's second child at the time of her murder. This revelation sends Lenny into a rage and he attacks Holloway, thereby starting a shootout between Velcoro, Bezzerides, Burris, and Lenny. Holloway shoots Lenny before both are shot by transit police as the rest make their escape amidst the confusion. Velcoro and Bezzerides meet Semyon at a secret bunker in the Black Rose bar where Velcoro convinces Bezzerides to head to Venezuela while he and Semyon plot a revenge attack on Osip. They then carry out the two-man assault on the money drop at a secret cabin, killing McCandless and Osip. On their way back, both men are ambushed\u2014Semyon is apprehended and driven out to the desert by the cartel members who invested in the clubs he burned, while Velcoro visits his son at school in Laurel Canyon and is spotted by Vinci PD who were searching for him. They place a transponder on his vehicle that Velcoro spots but does not remove, choosing to drive off anyway knowing his fate is sealed. Semyon cooperates with the cartel members and pays them off, but refuses to give one of the men his suit when ordered to, as he has the last of his money liquidated into diamonds in his pocket. Semyon is stabbed and attempts to walk back to civilization, but succumbs to his wounds and dies in the middle of the desert after a series of four hallucinations. Velcoro is still being tailed by Vinci police, and bids Bezzerides goodbye on the phone before making a last stand in the woods. Velcoro accepts his fate, confronting Burris and a tactical team who kill him. In an epilogue, Tony Chessani becomes mayor of Vinci; Geldof is elected governor; the rail project goes ahead as scheduled; Velcoro is remembered as a cop killer; Gena learns from Chad's paternity test that Velcoro is his father; a newly constructed highway is named after Paul Woodrugh, and his girlfriend has given birth to his child. In Venezuela, Bezzerides is revealed to have given birth to Velcoro's second son and is living with Jordan Semyon. She meets with the journalist Velcoro assaulted in Episode 1 and passes all the incriminating evidence, including the Caspere case files, on to him to start a crusade against the corruption in Vinci before she, Jordan and Nails disappear in a crowd.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main cast ===\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Detective Raymond \"Ray\" Velcoro, a mob-affiliated detective from the Vinci Police Department, struggling with his allegiance to his corrupt superiors and the mobster who owns him.\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Detective Sergeant Antigone \"Ani\" Bezzerides, a [[Ventura County Sheriff's Office]] [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] agent who struggles with personal issues within her family and habits such as gambling and drinking.\n* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as Officer Paul Woodrugh, a [[California Highway Patrol]] officer and war veteran, who worked for a private military contractor implied to have involvement with war crimes.\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Jordan Semyon, the wife of Frank Semyon, who must not only struggle with Frank's choices, but her own as well.\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Francis \"Frank\" Semyon, a career criminal and entrepreneur, who is in jeopardy of losing his life's work after his partner's corpse is discovered on the side of a highway.\n\n=== Recurring cast ===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ritchie Coster]] as Mayor Austin Chessani\n* Christopher James Baker as Blake Churchman\n* [[Afemo Omilami]] as Police Chief Holloway<ref name=td3/>\n* [[Michael Irby]] as Detective Elvis Ilinca<ref name=\"s2 casting\">{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/kelly-reilly-michael-irby-abigail-spencer-leven-rambin-cast-true-detective-hbo-1201267990/ |title='True Detective': Kelly Reilly, Michael Irby, Abigail Spencer, Leven Rambin Eye Roles |website=Deadline Hollywood |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=October 30, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Leven Rambin]] as Athena Bezzerides<ref>{{cite news |first=Katherine |last=Bernard |title=Actress Leven Rambin talks Texas, True Detective & her Cinderella style |url=https://www.yahoo.com/style/actress-leven-rambin-talks-texas-c1434946764655.html |publisher=Yahoo!

His corrupt business partner, Frank Semyon ([[Vince Vaughn]]), is forced to make the presentation on his own, in the presence of his mob connections. Vinci Police detective Raymond \"Ray\" Velcoro ([[Colin Farrell]]) is seeking custody of his son, who may be a product of his ex-wife's ([[Abigail Spencer]]) rape, years before. Through flashback, Velcoro is shown meeting Semyon at a bar, where Semyon gives him the name of his wife's rapist. Velcoro is now burned out and unhinged, and also works as an [[mob enforcer|enforcer]] for Semyon. Ventura County detective Antigone \"Ani\" Bezzerides ([[Rachel McAdams]]) conducts a raid on a suspected illegal brothel, which turns out to be a legal porn studio, where she finds her sister Athena working as a [[cam girl]]. Later, the search for Vera Machiado, a missing woman, leads Bezzerides to the woman's last known place of employment, a spiritual retreat run by Bezzerides' estranged father, Eliot, leading to a tense confrontation. A third cop, Highway Patrol officer Paul Woodrugh ([[Taylor Kitsch]]), is put on [[paid leave]] after an actress, Lacey Lindel, tries to seduce him and later falsely accuses him of sexual misconduct when he refuses to look the other way after catching her speeding and violating her parole. While visiting his girlfriend, Emily, Woodrugh secretly takes [[Viagra]] and does not answer her questions about the scars on his body. Late at night, racing his motorcycle without headlights and with near-suicidal ferocity, Woodrugh discovers the corpse of Caspere propped up on a bench, with his eyes burned out.

Lamenting on the news of Caspere's death, Semyon wonders how he'll get out of his financial issues, as he discovers that the money he gave Caspere for the high-speed rail deal was embezzled and he has lost over $5 million \u2013 most of his fortune. Enraged, he begins to investigate Caspere's death in his own way. State investigators still want to push into the rumors of backdoor deals and corruption in Vinci, and recruit Woodrugh as a Special Investigator to gather evidence in exchange for quashing the Lindel solicitation scandal. Bezzerides is warned by her superiors that Velcoro is corrupt and to find a way to make him an informant, while Velcoro is asked by Austin Chessani, the mayor of Vinci, and his own superiors, Police Chief Holloway and Lieutenant Kevin Burris, that the investigation move where they want it. A fourth detective, Teague Dixon, is placed alongside them by the Vinci PD. An autopsy of Caspere's body shows that he was tortured for information and his genitals shot off with a shotgun before being placed at the rest stop. Drunk, Velcoro seeks time with his son and instead gets a cruel backlash from his ex-wife, Gena, who now seeks full custody of their son and threatens a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity test]] to force him away. After an enigmatic visit to his mother, Cynthia, Woodrugh gets into an argument with Emily, who thinks he is cheating, and he leaves her on bad terms. While driving with Velcoro and discussing the case, Bezzerides questions just how compromised he is, a question he leaves unanswered. At the bar, Semyon informs Velcoro about Caspere's secret second house, information which he obtained from a prostitute. As Velcoro enters the home searching for clues, a person in a raven mask appears and shoots him twice with a shotgun, once at [[point blank range]].\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Maybe Tomorrow\n |DirectedBy = [[Janus Metz Pedersen|Janus Metz]]\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|5}}\n |Viewers = 2.62<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/08/sunday-cable-ratings-shark-week-wins-night-true-detective-ballers-the-last-ship-botched-falling-skies-more/427462/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: Shark Week Wins Night, 'True Detective', ' Ballers', 'The Last Ship', 'Botched', 'Falling Skies' & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Sara |last=Bibel |date=July 8, 2015 |accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Velcoro has a dream of a man, later revealed to be his father, in a bar. His father tells Velcoro of a vision of him running out of the woods and being shot to death as Velcoro sees wounds form on his own body. He awakens revealing the shot was non-lethal (the shotgun was loaded with rubber pelleted riot control rounds), and discovers that a hard drive containing footage of Caspere's sexual encounters has been stolen. Semyon begins suffering from [[erectile dysfunction]] for the first time as pressure builds against him while his wife, Jordan, gives him oral sex for [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] which he considers unnatural. Bezzerides and Woodrugh investigate Mayor Chessani's possible connection to Caspere's death by going to his home. They discover his intoxicated young trophy wife, moody daughter and problematic son much to Chessani's dismay who threatens to have Bezzerides and Woodrugh fired. As he recovers, Velcoro meets his father who is also an alcoholic and delivers him ''[[cannabis indica]]'' to help his father sleep. Semyon meets an old business partner in the construction business who already paid his debts, but demands more capital in exchange for new favors. Semyon meets with Osip who hints he is bailing on the deal. Semyon's criminal associate, Blake, enters and reveals his other criminal associate, Stan, was just killed as well. Woodrugh meets an old friend from private security firm Black Mountain, Miguel Gilb, who reminds him of their homosexual encounter during the war. Woodrugh responds by cursing him out and pushing him to the ground. Later Woodrugh uses a gay escort to get into Danny Santos' club for further investigation, where he briefly bumps into Semyon. Semyon tells Santos and other gangsters to find who is murdering his associates. Santos, already having lost respect for Semyon, states he no longer works for him and tells Semyon to leave. Semyon responds by fighting and beating Santos, then removing Santos' golden front teeth with pliers. While Bezzerides and Velcoro share a drink at his house, Gena shows up at his door to inform him he is under investigation by the state for corruption and the prior assault on her rapist; Bezzerides hears the conversation behind the door. Gena attempts to give Velcoro $10,000 to drop the custody battle, which he refuses. A tip from Caspere's assistant Laura leads Bezzerides and Velcoro to investigate a movie set, where they learn that a car had been stolen in the weeks prior, presumably the same car which carried Caspere. As they interrogate a former movie production employee, who quit shortly before the car was stolen, a masked man sets fire to the car which transported Caspere's body right around the corner from the detectives, who chase him. Bezzerides is nearly hit by a truck during the pursuit before Velcoro pulls her out of the way. She thanks Velcoro, who tells her she can thank him by telling him what the state has against him.

Bezzerides and Velcoro follow Caspere's movements, tracking him to vast tracts of land contaminated by the heavy metals dumped in the tailings from decades of mining. A visit to the commune run by Bezzerides's father reveals that Chessani, Caspere and Caspere's psychiatrist Dr. Pitlor have been in business for decades, prompting Velcoro to admit that the State investigation into Vinci is little more than a shakedown. He warns Bezzerides that Chessani did not get to his position without having faced similar pressure in the past, and that he could not survive without powerful friends or amassing power of his own. Political forces\u2014implied to be Chessani's influence\u2014see Bezzerides suspended from her job after a co-worker files a sexual harassment complaint against her, though she is allowed to remain on the special task force. Woodrugh awakens from his investigation into the prostitutes to find that he has slept with Miguel. Refusing to address the issue, Woodrugh leaves to find his motorcycle gone and is later accosted by reporters asking questions about his time with a private military contractor in Iraq. Later meeting with his estranged girlfriend in a diner, where she informs him she is pregnant, Woodrugh desperately proposes marriage to her. Throwing himself back into the investigation, he and Dixon follow up on a lead at a pawn shop where he uncovers a prostitute named Irina had sold a watch owned by Caspere. Velcoro approaches Semyon with this, which Semyon dismisses as unlikely as Stan was killed under similar circumstances and there is no connection to his death. Under pressure from Vinci PD to close the case, Velcoro, Bezzerides and Woodrugh lead a raid against Irina's pimp, Ledo Amarilla, but are ambushed when the building is found to be a methamphetamine lab which promptly explodes when the police open fire. As Amarilla tries to escape, he crashes his SUV into a city bus during a demonstration against the rail project. He and his accomplices open fire on the crowd as the police move in, with Dixon among the dead, and while the gunmen are killed, Velcoro, Bezzerides and Woodrugh are left horrified at the mass civilian and police casualties.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Other Lives\n |DirectedBy = [[John Crowley (director)|John Crowley]]\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|19}}\n |Viewers = 2.42<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/21/sunday-cable-ratings-naked-and-afraid-xl-wins-night-true-detective-balers-the-strain-the-last-ship-more/433961/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'Naked and Afraid XL' Wins Night, 'True Detective', 'Ballers', 'The Strain', 'The Last Ship', 'Tut' & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Sara |last=Bibel |date=July 21, 2015 |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Two months after the shoot-out, the special investigation into Caspere's death has been shut down, with the State Attorney, Geldof, satisfied that Amarilla was responsible. Velcoro has since quit the Vinci PD and works private security for Semyon while fighting his ex-wife and her husband for custody of his son; Bezzerides has been demoted to the sheriff's office evidence lock-up, attending sexual harassment seminars, and has returned to investigating Vera's disappearance in her own time; and Woodrugh has been promoted to detective and investigating insurance fraud while fighting extortion attempts by Lindel. Semyon approaches McCandless, owner of Catalyst\u2014the company holding the lands to be bought for the rail project\u2014with information that the person he sold his waste disposal company to has died under suspicious circumstances. This, combined with McCandless' complicitness in having Semyon use said company prior to its sale to contaminate the lands around the rail project to lower its value before the federal government bought it back are used as blackmail by Semyon to get back into the rail project. McCandless instead gives him the chance to buy back into the project if he can recover the hard drive stolen from Caspere's apartment the night Velcoro was shot. Semyon also has Velcoro tail Blake, whom he no longer trusts. Velcoro spots him and Tony Chessani picking up three girls at Pitlor's clinic then bringing them to Semyon's rival, Osip. Meanwhile, Bezzerides makes a connection between Vera and the cache of blue diamonds found in Caspere's safe deposit box. This prompts Davis to re-open the investigation into Caspere's death under the pretext of finding Irina, bringing Velcoro, Bezzerides, and Woodrugh back together. Davis suspects Geldof colluded with Chessani, using the original investigation to establish an account to fund his campaign for governor and pin the corruption on Caspere. Velcoro is pensive but agrees when Davis offers to help him keep custody of his son. Davis also reveals to Velcoro that Gena's rapist had been arrested six weeks previously. After confirming this with Gena, Velcoro realizes that the tip Semyon gave him years ago was a set-up to corrupt him. Woodrugh follows up on the diamonds and discovers Dixon had been looking for them prior to their discovery but had kept that information to himself during the original investigation. This leads Woodrugh and Bezzerides to conclude that Vinci PD had been using Dixon to manipulate the investigation. Velcoro returns to Pitlor's clinic and beats Pitlor for information, confirming that Caspere and Chessani were in business together linking influential men with prostitutes at secret parties. They subsequently used pictures taken at the parties to blackmail men like McCandless who attend them. Bezzerides approaches her sister to try to get an invite to an upcoming party before she and Woodrugh, following a previous lead from her old partner, match Vera's last movements to an abandoned house in [[Guerneville, California|Guerneville]]. Deep in the woods behind the house they discover a blood stained shed with a torture chair inside. As Semyon and Jordan reconcile after being at odds over Semyon's return to his old business practices, Jordan's infertility, and their future, Velcoro arrives at their new home and tells Semyon they need to talk.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Church in Ruins\n |DirectedBy = {{nowrap|[[Miguel Sapochnik]]}}\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto & Scott Lasser\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|26}}\n |Viewers = 2.34<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/28/sunday-cable-ratings-i-am-cait-tops-night-naked-afraid-xl-rick-morty-true-detective-nascar-ballers-more/438491/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'I am Cait' Tops Night + 'Naked & Afraid XL', 'Rick & Morty', 'True Detective', NASCAR, 'Ballers' & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Amanda |last=Kondolojy |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Velcoro and Semyon discuss the tip that led Velcoro to his wife's alleged rapist, with both men grasping their guns under the kitchen table. Semyon swears to Velcoro that he thought the information was genuine at the time. Satisfied that Semyon did not intentionally mislead him, Velcoro confronts the man arrested for the rape in prison, promising to kill him. After an awkward supervised visit with his son, Velcoro goes on a cocaine- and alcohol-fueled bender before calling his ex-wife and agreeing to drop the custody case on the condition that she never reveal her son's true parentage. Semyon later meets with Stan's widow and young son to comfort them and question them on possible suspects in his death, with Stan's widow citing Blake. Meanwhile, Woodrugh follows up on the missing diamonds to find that they were part of a cache stolen during a double homicide and robbery in the 1992 riots that orphaned two children, making the diamonds untraceable. Semyon starts searching for Irina, making an agreement with a Mexican cartel that will allow him to meet Irina provided the cartel are allowed to move drugs through his clubs. Irina calls Semyon and reveals that she had been given the items from Caspere's home by a police officer. Semyon arranges to meet her so that she can identify the man from a photo, but arriving at the meeting point finds her dead, having been killed by the Mexicans for dealing with police. Outnumbered and empty-handed, Semyon is forced to accept the deal with the Mexicans. Bezzerides goes undercover, posing as her sister to infiltrate one of the secret elite parties in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. With no phone, transmitter or weapon, she is forced to rely on Woodrugh and Velcoro for support. At the party, she is drugged and taken to the guests with a busload of other girls. Her attempts to search the party are hampered by the male guests (Geldof, Holloway and Tony Chessani among them) and hallucinations of a strange man from her childhood, implying that she was sexually abused. As Woodrugh and Velcoro sneak in, they observe a meeting between McCandless and Osip where McCandless admits that Osip's investment in the rail project was far more lucrative than Semyon's. The two steal a set of contracts from McCandless' office. Bezzerides locates Vera at the party and attempts to get her out, but is forced to kill a guard in the process. She and Vera are found by Woodrugh who escorts them to Velcoro in a waiting car. As the four escape, Woodrugh goes over the stolen contracts and starts to realize the scale of what they are involved in.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = {{nowrap|Black Maps and Motel Rooms}}\n |DirectedBy = [[Dan Attias|Daniel Attias]]\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|2}}\n |Viewers = 2.18<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/08/04/sunday-cable-ratings-rick-and-morty-naked-and-afraid-xl-win-night-true-detective-the-last-ship-ballers-the-strain-ray-donovan-more/442148/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'Rick and Morty' & 'Naked and Afraid XL', Win Night, 'True Detective', 'The Last Ship', 'Ballers', 'The Strain', 'Ray Donovan' & More |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Sara |last=Bibel |date=August 4, 2015 |accessdate=August 4, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = The task force regroups after the party to allow Vera and Bezzerides to recover from the drugs they were given while Velcoro and Woodrugh go over the documents that link Catalyst and McCandless to Osip. When morning comes, Woodrugh and Bezzerides move their families to safety while Velcoro reports to Semyon. Velcoro approaches Davis with their evidence but finds her shot dead in her car. Woodrugh discovers that Bezzerides is wanted for questioning over the death of the security guard she killed at the party while Velcoro has been named as a suspect in Davis' murder. Woodrugh is contacted by a third party blackmailing him with photos from his night with Gilb. Using information from Semyon, Vera and the police database, the three are able to formulate a theory on Caspere's death: that a group of corrupt police\u2014Holloway, Burris, Dixon and Caspere\u2014used the 1992 riots to steal the diamonds which they used to buy into the Vinci power structure; however, Laura, a child orphaned during the robbery, tracked them down and after posing as Caspere's assistant and killed him after confirming his involvement. Everything from their discovery of the diamonds through to the shoot-out with Ledo Amarilla has been manipulated from behind the scenes by Vinci PD to cover up their involvement in the original crime. Meanwhile, Semyon confronts Blake over his role in Osip's operation; Blake admits that Osip is trying to force Semyon out of business with the help of Chessani's son Tony, who Osip will install as mayor of Vinci to act as his puppet. When pushed further, Blake confesses to having killed Stan and staging the murder to imitate Caspere's death. Semyon kills him and arranges for Jordan to leave town. When approached by Osip, Semyon bows out gracefully and accepts a role as manager of Osip's clubs. However, having learned of a money drop (from Blake, prior to killing him) in which Osip will transfer $12 million to Tony Chessani, Semyon takes his cash reserves and burns the properties to hurt Osip's business. Faced with the realization of just how powerful their enemies are, Velcoro and Bezzerides sleep together. Meanwhile, Woodrugh is lured to a meeting with his blackmailer, Holloway, who demands the documents taken from the party. Woodrugh overpowers him and is drawn into a shootout with the Black Mountain private security accompanying Holloway on behalf of McCandless, killing all of them.

Semyon convinces Jordan to leave the country for Venezuela with his lieutenant Nails, where he will rendezvous with her two weeks later or sooner. He then goes to Chessani's mansion, where he finds the mayor dead, and the mayor's wife Veronica, while high, implicates his son Tony as his murderer. Meanwhile Velcoro and Bezzerides learn of Woodrugh's death and resolve to close the case. They identify Laura, Caspere's secretary, and Lenny, a photographer from the movie set of the stolen prop car, as the Osterman siblings. Visiting Lenny's home they find the bird's head mask from the earlier episodes, identifying him as both the murderer of Caspere and the man who shot Velcoro. The also find Laura handcuffed to the fireplace; she confirms that Lenny murdered Caspere and plans to kill Holloway under the pretense of a public meeting at a train station in [[Anaheim]] to trade Caspere's hard drive for money as the hard drive had been erased. Bezzerides puts Laura on a bus to Seattle while Velcoro intercepts Lenny at the train station and convinces him to entrap Holloway. Velcoro takes Lenny's place, leading Holloway into a discussion of the blue diamond conspiracy with him, while Lenny sits behind them. Holloway reveals that Caspere fathered Laura illegitimately and that their mother was pregnant with Caspere's second child at the time of her murder. This revelation sends Lenny into a rage and he attacks Holloway, thereby starting a shootout between Velcoro, Bezzerides, Burris, and Lenny. Holloway shoots Lenny before both are shot by transit police as the rest make their escape amidst the confusion. Velcoro and Bezzerides meet Semyon at a secret bunker in the Black Rose bar where Velcoro convinces Bezzerides to head to Venezuela while he and Semyon plot a revenge attack on Osip. They then carry out the two-man assault on the money drop at a secret cabin, killing McCandless and Osip. On their way back, both men are ambushed\u2014Semyon is apprehended and driven out to the desert by the cartel members who invested in the clubs he burned, while Velcoro visits his son at school in Laurel Canyon and is spotted by Vinci PD who were searching for him. They place a transponder on his vehicle that Velcoro spots but does not remove, choosing to drive off anyway knowing his fate is sealed. Semyon cooperates with the cartel members and pays them off, but refuses to give one of the men his suit when ordered to, as he has the last of his money liquidated into diamonds in his pocket. Semyon is stabbed and attempts to walk back to civilization, but succumbs to his wounds and dies in the middle of the desert after a series of four hallucinations. Velcoro is still being tailed by Vinci police, and bids Bezzerides goodbye on the phone before making a last stand in the woods. Velcoro accepts his fate, confronting Burris and a tactical team who kill him. In an epilogue, Tony Chessani becomes mayor of Vinci; Geldof is elected governor; the rail project goes ahead as scheduled; Velcoro is remembered as a cop killer; Gena learns from Chad's paternity test that Velcoro is his father; a newly constructed highway is named after Paul Woodrugh, and his girlfriend has given birth to his child. In Venezuela, Bezzerides is revealed to have given birth to Velcoro's second son and is living with Jordan Semyon. She meets with the journalist Velcoro assaulted in Episode 1 and passes all the incriminating evidence, including the Caspere case files, on to him to start a crusade against the corruption in Vinci before she, Jordan and Nails disappear in a crowd.\n |LineColor = 4f270c\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main cast ===\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Detective Raymond \"Ray\" Velcoro, a mob-affiliated detective from the Vinci Police Department, struggling with his allegiance to his corrupt superiors and the mobster who owns him.\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Detective Sergeant Antigone \"Ani\" Bezzerides, a [[Ventura County Sheriff's Office]] [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] agent who struggles with personal issues within her family and habits such as gambling and drinking.\n* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as Officer Paul Woodrugh, a [[California Highway Patrol]] officer and war veteran, who worked for a private military contractor implied to have involvement with war crimes.\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Jordan Semyon, the wife of Frank Semyon, who must not only struggle with Frank's choices, but her own as well.\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Francis \"Frank\" Semyon, a career criminal and entrepreneur, who is in jeopardy of losing his life's work after his partner's corpse is discovered on the side of a highway.\n\n=== Recurring cast ===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ritchie Coster]] as Mayor Austin Chessani\n* Christopher James Baker as Blake Churchman\n* [[Afemo Omilami]] as Police Chief Holloway<ref name=td3/>\n* [[Michael Irby]] as Detective Elvis Ilinca<ref name=\"s2 casting\">{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/kelly-reilly-michael-irby-abigail-spencer-leven-rambin-cast-true-detective-hbo-1201267990/ |title='True Detective': Kelly Reilly, Michael Irby, Abigail Spencer, Leven Rambin Eye Roles |website=Deadline Hollywood |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=October 30, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Leven Rambin]] as Athena Bezzerides<ref>{{cite news |first=Katherine |last=Bernard |title=Actress Leven Rambin talks Texas, True Detective & her Cinderella style |url=https://www.yahoo.com/style/actress-leven-rambin-talks-texas-c1434946764655.html |publisher=Yahoo!
