He treated&nbsp;0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including [[division by zero|division]]. By this time (the 7th&nbsp;century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as [[Khmer numerals]], and documentation shows the idea later spreading to [[China]] and the [[Islamic world]].\n\n[[File:Khmer Numerals - 605 from the Sambor inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The number 605 in [[Khmer numerals]], from an inscription from 683 AD. Early use of zero as a decimal figure.]]\n\nBrahmagupta's ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'' is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as \"zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number.\" The ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'' is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.\n\nThe use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in [[place-value system]]s. Many ancient texts used&nbsp;0. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word ''nfr'' to denote zero&nbsp;balance in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double entry accounting]]. Indian texts used a [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa-Latn|Shunye}} or {{lang|sa|shunya}} to refer to the concept of ''void''. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |title=Historia Matematica Mailing List Archive: Re: [HM&#93; The Zero Story: a question |publisher=Sunsite.utk.edu |date=1999-04-26 |accessdate=2012-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112073735/http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df=}}</ref> In a similar vein, [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the ''[[Ashtadhyayi]]'', an early example of an [[formal grammar|algebraic grammar]] for the Sanskrit language (also see [[Pingala]]).\n\nThere are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta''.\n\nRecords show that the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] seemed unsure about the status of&nbsp;0 as a number: they asked themselves \"how can 'nothing' be something?\" leading to interesting [[philosophical]] and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of&nbsp;0 and the [[vacuum]]. The [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea]] depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of&nbsp;0. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether&nbsp;{{num|1}} was a number.)\n\nThe late [[Olmec]] people of south-central [[Mexico]] began to use a symbol for zero, a shell [[glyph]], in the New World, possibly by the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} but certainly by 40&nbsp;BC, which became an integral part of [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]]. Mayan arithmetic used base&nbsp;4 and base&nbsp;5 written as base&nbsp;20. Sanchez in 1961 reported a base&nbsp;4, base&nbsp;5 \"finger\" abacus.\n\nBy 130 AD, [[Ptolemy]], influenced by [[Hipparchus]] and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for&nbsp;0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system otherwise using alphabetic [[Greek numerals]]. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this [[Greek numerals#Hellenistic zero|Hellenistic zero]] was the first ''documented'' use of a true zero in the Old World. In later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts of his ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' (''Almagest''), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Omicron]] (otherwise meaning&nbsp;70).\n\nAnother true zero was used in tables alongside [[Roman numerals#Zero|Roman numerals]] by 525 (first known use by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]), but as a word, {{lang|la|nulla}} meaning ''nothing'', not as a symbol. When division produced&nbsp;0 as a remainder, {{lang|la|nihil}}, also meaning ''nothing'', was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of [[Easter]]). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by [[Bede]] or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.\n\n===Negative numbers {{anchor|History of negative numbers}}===\n{{further|History of negative numbers}}\nThe abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100\u201350 BC in China.  ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive [[coefficient]]s, black for negative.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Staszkow |first=Ronald |author2=Robert Bradshaw |title=The Mathematical Palette (3rd ed.) |publisher=Brooks Cole |year=2004 |page=41 |isbn=0-534-40365-4}}</ref> The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd&nbsp;century AD in [[Greece]]. [[Diophantus]] referred to the equation equivalent to {{nowrap|4''x'' + 20 {{=}} 0}} (the solution is negative) in ''[[Arithmetica]]'', saying that the equation gave an absurd result.\n\nDuring the 600s, negative numbers were in use in [[India]] to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], in ''[[Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta]]'' in 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form [[quadratic formula]] that remains in use today. However, in the 12th&nbsp;century in India, [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara]] gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value \"is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.\"\n\n[[Europe]]an mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th&nbsp;century, although [[Fibonacci]] allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter&nbsp;13 of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', 1202) and later as losses (in {{lang|la|Flos}}). At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=David Eugene |authorlink=David_Eugene_Smith |title=History of Modern Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1958 |page=259 |isbn=0-486-20429-4}}</ref> The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by [[Nicolas Chuquet]] during the 15th&nbsp;century. He used them as [[exponent]]s, but referred to them as \"absurd numbers\".\n\nAs recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless, just as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] did with negative solutions in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n===Rational numbers {{anchor|History of rational numbers}}===\nIt is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to [[prehistoric times]]. The [[Ancient Egyptians]] used their [[Egyptian fraction]] notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Kahun Papyrus]]. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of [[number theory]]. The best known of these is [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], dating to roughly 300&nbsp;BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the [[Sthananga Sutra]], which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.\n\nThe concept of [[decimal fraction]]s is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to [[pi]] or the [[square root of 2]]. Similarly, Babylonian math texts used sexagesimal (base&nbsp;60) fractions with great frequency.\n\n===Irrational numbers {{anchor|History of irrational numbers}}===\n{{further|History of irrational numbers}}\nThe earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] [[Sulba Sutras]] composed between 800 and 500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Selin |editor-first=Helaine |editor-link=Helaine Selin |title=Mathematics across cultures: the history of non-Western mathematics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |year=2000 |page=451 |isbn=0-7923-6481-3}}</ref> The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to [[Pythagoras]], more specifically to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Hippasus|Hippasus of Metapontum]], who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the [[square root of 2]]. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.<ref>{{cite book |title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |chapter=Horace and the Monuments: A New Interpretation of the Archytas ''Ode'' |author=Bernard Frischer |editor=D.R.

By the 17th&nbsp; century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook the scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since [[Euclid]]. In 1872, the publication of the theories of [[Karl Weierstrass]] (by his pupil E. Kossak), [[Eduard Heine]] (''[[Crelle's Journal|Crelle]],'' 74), [[Georg Cantor]] (Annalen, 5), and [[Richard Dedekind]] was brought about. In 1869, [[Charles M\u00e9ray]] had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by [[Salvatore Pincherle]] (1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by [[Paul Tannery]] (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a [[Dedekind cut|cut (Schnitt)]] in the system of [[real number]]s, separating all [[rational number]]s into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] (''Crelle'', 101), and M\u00e9ray.\n\nThe search for roots of [[Quintic equation|quintic]] and higher degree equations was an important development, the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]] ([[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] 1799, [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] 1824) showed that they could not be solved by [[nth root|radicals]] (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of [[algebraic numbers]] (all solutions to polynomial equations). [[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]] (1832) linked polynomial equations to [[group theory]] giving rise to the field of [[Galois theory]].\n\n[[Continued fraction]]s, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of [[Euler]], and at the opening of the 19th&nbsp;century were brought into prominence through the writings of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenm\u00fcller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and G\u00fcnther (1872). Ramus (1855) first connected the subject with [[determinant]]s, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius|M\u00f6bius]], and G\u00fcnther, in the theory of {{Lang|deu|Kettenbruchdeterminanten}}.\n\n===Transcendental numbers and reals {{anchor|History of transcendental numbers and reals}}===\n{{further|History of \u03c0}}\n\nThe existence of [[transcendental numbers]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogomolny |first=A. |authorlink=Cut-the-Knot |title=What's a number? |work=Interactive Mathematics Miscellany and Puzzles |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |accessdate=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923231547/http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |archive-date=23 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> was first established by [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] (1844, 1851). [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] proved in 1873 that ''e'' is transcendental and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] proved in 1882 that \u03c0 is transcendental. Finally, [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|Cantor]] showed that the set of all [[real number]]s is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]], so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.\n\n===Infinity and infinitesimals {{anchor|History of infinity and infinitesimals}}===\n{{further|History of infinity}}\nThe earliest known conception of mathematical [[infinity]] appears in the [[Yajur Veda]], an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, \"If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity.\" Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the [[Jain]] mathematicians c. 400&nbsp;BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.\n\n[[Aristotle]] defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between [[actual infinity]] and [[potential infinity]]\u2014the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' discussed the idea of [[bijection|one-to-one correspondences]] between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by [[Georg Cantor]]; in 1895 he published a book about his new [[set theory]], introducing, among other things, [[transfinite number]]s and formulating the [[continuum hypothesis]].\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of [[hyperreal numbers]] represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about [[infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].\n\nA modern geometrical version of infinity is given by [[projective geometry]], which introduces \"ideal points at infinity\", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawing.\n\n===Complex numbers {{anchor|History of complex numbers}}===\n{{further|History of complex numbers}}\nThe earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] in the {{nowrap|1st century AD}}, when he considered the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]]. They became more prominent when in the 16th&nbsp;century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]] and [[Gerolamo Cardano]]. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.\n\nThis was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] coined the term \"imaginary\" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See [[imaginary number]] for a discussion of the \"reality\" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation\n:<math>\\left ( \\sqrt{-1}\\right )^2 =\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math>\nseemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity\n:<math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab},</math>\nwhich is valid for positive real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', and was also used in complex number calculations with one of ''a'', ''b'' positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a}}</math>\nin the case when both ''a'' and ''b'' are negative even bedeviled [[Euler]]. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol ''i'' in place of <math>\\sqrt{-1}</math> to guard against this mistake.\n\nThe 18th century saw the work of [[Abraham de Moivre]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. [[De Moivre's formula]] (1730) states:\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta </math>\nwhile [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]] (1748) gave us:\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta }. </math>\n\nThe existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until [[Caspar Wessel]] described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in [[John Wallis|Wallis]]'s ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nAlso in 1799, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success that is well known.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] studied [[Gaussian integer|complex numbers of the form]] {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, where ''a'' and ''b'' are integral, or rational (and ''i'' is one of the two roots of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}}). His student, [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], studied the type {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b\u03c9''}}, where ''\u03c9'' is a complex root of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0.}} Other such classes (called [[cyclotomic fields]]) of complex numbers derive from the [[roots of unity]] {{nowrap|''x''<sup>''k''</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0}} for higher values of ''k''. This generalization is largely due to [[Ernst Kummer]], who also invented [[ideal number]]s, which were expressed as geometrical entities by [[Felix Klein]] in 1893.\n\nIn 1850 [[Victor Alexandre Puiseux]] took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of [[mathematical singularity|essential singular points]]. This eventually led to the concept of the [[extended complex plane]].\n\n===Prime numbers {{anchor|History of prime numbers}}===\n[[Prime number]]s have been studied throughout recorded history. Euclid devoted one book of the ''Elements'' to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and presented the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.\n\nIn 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] used the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the [[Renaissance]] and later eras.\n\nIn 1796, [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] conjectured the [[prime number theorem]], describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the [[Goldbach conjecture]], which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the [[Riemann hypothesis]], formulated by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1859. The [[prime number theorem]] was finally proved by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.\n\n=={{anchor|Classification|Classification of numbers}}Main classification==\n{{Redirect|Number system|systems for expressing numbers|Numeral system}}\n{{See also|List of types of numbers}}Numbers can be classified into [[set (mathematics)|sets]], called '''number systems''', such as the [[natural numbers]] and the [[real numbers]].<ref>\"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens \u2013 welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden \u2013 zu einem Ganzen.\" [http://www.brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610133240/http://brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm |date=2011-06-10 }} <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</ref> The major categories of numbers are as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 200px; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|+ Main number systems\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{N}</math>\n![[Natural number|Natural]]\n| 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...<br />\n<math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math> or <math>\\mathbb{N}_1</math> are sometimes used.\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>\n![[Integer]]\n|..., \u22125, \u22124, \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>\n![[Rational number|Rational]]\n|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' is not 0\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{R}</math>\n![[Real number|Real]]\n|The limit of a convergent sequence of rational numbers\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{C}</math>\n![[Complex number|Complex]]\n|''a'' + ''bi'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers and ''i'' is a formal square root of&nbsp;\u22121\n|}\n\nThere is generally no problem in identifying each number system with a proper subset of the next one (by [[abuse of notation#Equality vs. isomorphism|abuse of notation]]), because each of these number systems is [[canonical isomorphism|canonically isomorphic]] to a proper subset of the next one.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The resulting hierarchy allows, for example, to talk, formally correctly, about real numbers that are rational numbers, and is expressed symbolically by writing\n:<math>\\mathbb{N} \\subset \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\subset \\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\n===Natural numbers===\n{{Main|Natural number}}\n[[File:Nat num.svg|thumb|The natural numbers, starting with 1]]\nThe most familiar numbers are the [[natural number]]s (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with&nbsp;1 (0 was not even considered a number for the [[Ancient Greeks]].) However, in the 19th&nbsp;century, [[set theory|set theorists]] and other mathematicians started including&nbsp;0 ([[cardinality]] of the [[empty set]], i.e. 0&nbsp;elements, where&nbsp;0 is thus the smallest [[cardinal number]]) in the set of natural numbers.<ref>\n{{MathWorld|title=Natural Number|id=NaturalNumber}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |title=natural number |work=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=4 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213133201/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |archive-date=13 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including&nbsp;0 or not. The [[mathematical symbol]] for the set of all natural numbers is '''N''', also written <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>, and sometimes <math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math> or <math>\\mathbb{N}_1</math> when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.\n\nIn the [[base 10]] numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten [[numerical digit|digits]]: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base&nbsp;10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a [[place value]] of&nbsp;1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.\n\nIn [[set theory]], which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suppes |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick_Suppes |title=Axiomatic Set Theory |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1972 |page=[https://archive.org/details/axiomaticsettheo00supp_0/page/1 1] |isbn=0-486-61630-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/axiomaticsettheo00supp_0/page/1 }}</ref> natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number&nbsp;3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in [[Peano Arithmetic]], the number&nbsp;3 is represented as sss0, where s is the \"successor\" function (i.e.,&nbsp;3 is the third successor of&nbsp;0). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent&nbsp;3 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.\n\n===Integers===\n{{Main|Integer}}\nThe [[negative number|negative]] of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces&nbsp;0 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a [[minus sign]]). As an example, the negative of&nbsp;7 is written&nbsp;\u22127, and {{nowrap|7 + (\u22127) {{=}} 0}}. When the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including&nbsp;0), the result is defined as the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''' also written [[Blackboard bold|<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>.]] Here the letter Z comes {{ety|de|Zahl|number}}. The set of integers forms a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with the operations addition and multiplication.<ref>{{Mathworld|Integer|Integer}}</ref>\n\nThe natural numbers form a [[subset]] of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as '''positive integers''', and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as '''non-negative integers'''.\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{Main|Rational number}}\nA rational number is a number that can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} represents ''m'' parts of a whole divided into ''n'' equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example {{sfrac|1|2}} and {{sfrac|2|4}} are equal, that is:\n: <math>{1 \\over 2} = {2 \\over 4}.</math>\n\nIn general,\n:<math>{a \\over b} = {c \\over d}</math> if and only if <math>{ a \\times d} = {c \\times b}.</math>\n\nIf the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' is greater than ''n'' (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than&nbsp;1. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to&nbsp;1 and can also be positive, negative, or&nbsp;0. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator&nbsp;1. For example&nbsp;\u22127 can be written&nbsp;{{sfrac|\u22127|1}}. The symbol for the rational numbers is '''Q''' (for ''[[quotient]]''), also written [[Blackboard bold|<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>.]]\n\n===Real numbers===\n{{Main|Real number}}\n\nThe symbol for the real numbers is '''R''', also written as <math>\\mathbb{R}.</math> They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the [[number line]]. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a [[minus sign]], e.g. -123.456.\n\nMost real numbers can only be ''approximated'' by [[decimal]] numerals, in which a [[decimal point]] is placed to the right of the digit with place value&nbsp;1. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents {{sfrac|123456|1000}}, or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its [[fractional part]] has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.  Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern.  Such a decimal is called a [[repeating decimal]]. Thus {{sfrac|3}} can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0.{{overline|3}}.\n\nIt turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called [[irrational number|irrational]]. A famous irrational real number is the number [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of any circle to its [[diameter]]. When pi is written as\n:<math>\\pi = 3.14159265358979\\dots,</math>\nas it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that [[proof that pi is irrational|{{pi}} is irrational]]. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is\n:<math>\\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237\\dots,</math>\nthe [[square root of 2]], that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions {{nowrap|( 1 trillion {{=}}  10<sup>12</sup> {{=}} 1,000,000,000,000 )}} of digits.\n\nNot only these prominent examples but [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting [[rounding|rounded]] or [[truncation|truncated]] real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only [[countably many]]. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a [[margin of error]]. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to {{sfrac|1234555|10000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|1234565|10000}} (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number  greater or equal to {{sfrac|123456|1000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|123457|1000}} (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called [[significant digits]]. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001&nbsp; meters. If the sides of a [[rectangle]] are measured as 1.23&nbsp;meters and 4.56&nbsp;meters, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between {{nowrap|5.614591 square meters}} and {{nowrap|5.603011 square meters}}. Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not ''significant''. Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61.\n\nJust as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, [[0.999...]], 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number&nbsp;1. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places.  In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros.  Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000.... Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the decimal place, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing the rightmost -9 digit by one, changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of the decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85.  Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.  For example, 99.999... = 100.\n\nThe real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the [[least upper bound]] property.\n\nIt can be shown that any [[ordered field]], which is also [[completeness of the real numbers|complete]], is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an [[algebraically closed field]], because they do not include a solution (often called a [[square root of minus one]]) to the algebraic equation <math> x^2+1=0</math>.\n\n===Complex numbers===\n{{Main|Complex number}}\nMoving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the [[complex number]]s. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of [[cubic function|cubic]] and [[quadratic function|quadratic]] polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a [[square root]] of&nbsp;\u22121, denoted by ''[[imaginary unit|i]]'', a symbol assigned by [[Leonhard Euler]], and called the [[imaginary unit]]. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form\n:<math>\\,a + b i</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the [[complex plane]], a [[vector space]] of two real [[dimension]]s. In the expression {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, the real number ''a'' is called the [[real part]] and ''b'' is called the [[imaginary part]]. If the real part of a complex number is&nbsp;0, then the number is called an [[imaginary number]] or is referred to as ''purely imaginary''; if the imaginary part is&nbsp;0, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a [[subset]] of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a [[Gaussian integer]]. The symbol for the complex numbers is '''C''' or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\nThe [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that the complex numbers form an [[algebraically closed field]], meaning that every [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has a [[zero of a function|root]] in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], which is [[complete space|complete]], but unlike the real numbers, it is not [[total order|ordered]]. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that '' I'' is greater than&nbsp;1, nor is there any meaning in saying that '' I'' is less than&nbsp;1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a [[total order]] that is [[ordered field|compatible with field operations]].\n\n==Subclasses of the integers==\n\n===Even and odd numbers===\n{{main|Even and odd numbers}}\nAn '''even number''' is an integer that is \"evenly divisible\" by two, that is [[Euclidean division|divisible by two without remainder]]; an '''odd number''' is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term \"evenly divisible\" is now almost always shortened to \"[[divisibility|divisible]]\".) Any odd number ''n'' may be constructed by the formula {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2''k'' + 1,}} for a suitable integer ''k''. Starting with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 0,}} the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number ''m'' has the form {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 2''k''}} where ''k'' is again an [[integer]]. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.\n\n===Prime numbers===\n{{main|Prime number}}\nA '''prime number''' is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.  The study of these questions belongs to [[number theory]].  An example of a still unanswered question is, whether every even number is the sum of two primes.  This is called [[Goldbach's conjecture]].\n\nThe question, whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, has been answered to the positive: this proven claim is called [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. A proof appears in [[Euclid's Elements]].\n\n===Other classes of integers===\nMany subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are [[Fibonacci number]]s and [[perfect number]]s. For more examples, see [[Integer sequence]].\n\n==Subclasses of the complex numbers==\n\n===Algebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers===\n[[Algebraic number]]s are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called [[irrational number]]s. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called [[transcendental number]]s. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a [[monic polynomial]] equation with integer coefficients are called [[algebraic integer]]s.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\nMotivated by the classical problems of [[Straightedge and compass construction|constructions with straightedge and compass]], the [[constructible number]]s are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps.\n\n===Computable numbers===\n{{Main|Computable number}}\nA '''computable number''', also known as ''recursive number'', is a [[real number]] such that there exists an [[algorithm]] which, given a positive number ''n'' as input, produces the first ''n'' digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using [[\u03bc-recursive function]]s, [[Turing machine]]s or [[\u03bb-calculus]]. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a [[polynomial]], and thus form a [[real closed field]] that contains the real [[algebraic number]]s.\n\nThe computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.\n\nThe set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, [[almost all]] real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.\n\n==Extensions of the concept==\n\n===''p''-adic numbers===\n{{main|p-adic number|l1=''p''-adic number}}\nThe ''p''-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what [[radix|base]] is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a [[prime number]] base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the ''p''-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.\n\nThe elements of an [[algebraic function field]] over a [[finite field]] and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see [[Function field analogy]]). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The ''p''-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.\n\n===Hypercomplex numbers===\n{{main|hypercomplex number}}\nSome number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called [[hypercomplex number]]s. They include the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', introduced by Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], in which multiplication is not [[commutative]], the [[octonion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[associative]] in addition to not being commutative, and the [[sedenion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[Alternative algebra|alternative]], neither associative nor commutative.\n\n===Transfinite numbers===\n{{main|transfinite number}}\nFor dealing with infinite [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the natural numbers have been generalized to the [[ordinal number]]s and to the [[cardinal number]]s. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.\n\n===Nonstandard numbers===\n[[Hyperreal number]]s are used in [[non-standard analysis]]. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *'''R'''), denote an [[ordered field]] that is a proper [[Field extension|extension]] of the ordered field of [[real number]]s '''R''' and satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. This principle allows true [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about '''R''' to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *'''R'''.\n\n[[Superreal number|Superreal]] and [[surreal number]]s extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Concrete number]]\n* [[List of numbers]]\n* [[List of numbers in various languages]]\n* [[List of types of numbers]]\n* [[Mathematical constant]]s\n* [[Mythical number]]s\n* [[Numerical cognition]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude]]\n* [[Physical constant]]s\n* [[Pi]]\n* [[Positional notation]]\n* [[Prime number]]\n* [[Subitizing and counting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Tobias Dantzig]], ''Number, the language of science; a critical survey written for the cultured non-mathematician'', New York, The Macmillan company, 1930.\n* Erich Friedman, ''[http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html What's special about this number?]''\n* Steven Galovich, ''Introduction to Mathematical Structures'', Harcourt Brace Javanovich, 23 January 1989, {{isbn|0-15-543468-3}}.\n* [[Paul Halmos]], ''Naive Set Theory'', Springer, 1974, {{isbn|0-387-90092-6}}.\n* [[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', Oxford University Press, 1972.\n* [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' to *56, Cambridge University Press, 1910.\n* George I.

He treated&nbsp;0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including [[division by zero|division]]. By this time (the 7th&nbsp;century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as [[Khmer numerals]], and documentation shows the idea later spreading to [[China]] and the [[Islamic world]].\n\n[[File:Khmer Numerals - 605 from the Sambor inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The number 605 in [[Khmer numerals]], from an inscription from 683 AD. Early use of zero as a decimal figure.]]\n\nBrahmagupta's ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'' is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as \"zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number.\" The ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'' is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.\n\nThe use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in [[place-value system]]s. Many ancient texts used&nbsp;0. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word ''nfr'' to denote zero&nbsp;balance in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double entry accounting]]. Indian texts used a [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa-Latn|Shunye}} or {{lang|sa|shunya}} to refer to the concept of ''void''. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |title=Historia Matematica Mailing List Archive: Re: [HM&#93; The Zero Story: a question |publisher=Sunsite.utk.edu |date=1999-04-26 |accessdate=2012-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112073735/http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df=}}</ref> In a similar vein, [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the ''[[Ashtadhyayi]]'', an early example of an [[formal grammar|algebraic grammar]] for the Sanskrit language (also see [[Pingala]]).\n\nThere are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta''.\n\nRecords show that the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] seemed unsure about the status of&nbsp;0 as a number: they asked themselves \"how can 'nothing' be something?\" leading to interesting [[philosophical]] and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of&nbsp;0 and the [[vacuum]]. The [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea]] depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of&nbsp;0. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether&nbsp;{{num|1}} was a number.)\n\nThe late [[Olmec]] people of south-central [[Mexico]] began to use a symbol for zero, a shell [[glyph]], in the New World, possibly by the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} but certainly by 40&nbsp;BC, which became an integral part of [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]]. Mayan arithmetic used base&nbsp;4 and base&nbsp;5 written as base&nbsp;20. Sanchez in 1961 reported a base&nbsp;4, base&nbsp;5 \"finger\" abacus.\n\nBy 130 AD, [[Ptolemy]], influenced by [[Hipparchus]] and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for&nbsp;0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system otherwise using alphabetic [[Greek numerals]]. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this [[Greek numerals#Hellenistic zero|Hellenistic zero]] was the first ''documented'' use of a true zero in the Old World. In later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts of his ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' (''Almagest''), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Omicron]] (otherwise meaning&nbsp;70).\n\nAnother true zero was used in tables alongside [[Roman numerals#Zero|Roman numerals]] by 525 (first known use by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]), but as a word, {{lang|la|nulla}} meaning ''nothing'', not as a symbol. When division produced&nbsp;0 as a remainder, {{lang|la|nihil}}, also meaning ''nothing'', was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of [[Easter]]). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by [[Bede]] or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.\n\n===Negative numbers {{anchor|History of negative numbers}}===\n{{further|History of negative numbers}}\nThe abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100\u201350 BC in China.  ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive [[coefficient]]s, black for negative.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Staszkow |first=Ronald |author2=Robert Bradshaw |title=The Mathematical Palette (3rd ed.) |publisher=Brooks Cole |year=2004 |page=41 |isbn=0-534-40365-4}}</ref> The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd&nbsp;century AD in [[Greece]]. [[Diophantus]] referred to the equation equivalent to {{nowrap|4''x'' + 20 {{=}} 0}} (the solution is negative) in ''[[Arithmetica]]'', saying that the equation gave an absurd result.\n\nDuring the 600s, negative numbers were in use in [[India]] to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], in ''[[Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta]]'' in 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form [[quadratic formula]] that remains in use today. However, in the 12th&nbsp;century in India, [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara]] gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value \"is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.\"\n\n[[Europe]]an mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th&nbsp;century, although [[Fibonacci]] allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter&nbsp;13 of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', 1202) and later as losses (in {{lang|la|Flos}}). At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=David Eugene |authorlink=David_Eugene_Smith |title=History of Modern Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1958 |page=259 |isbn=0-486-20429-4}}</ref> The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by [[Nicolas Chuquet]] during the 15th&nbsp;century. He used them as [[exponent]]s, but referred to them as \"absurd numbers\".\n\nAs recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless, just as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] did with negative solutions in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n===Rational numbers {{anchor|History of rational numbers}}===\nIt is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to [[prehistoric times]]. The [[Ancient Egyptians]] used their [[Egyptian fraction]] notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Kahun Papyrus]]. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of [[number theory]]. The best known of these is [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], dating to roughly 300&nbsp;BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the [[Sthananga Sutra]], which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.\n\nThe concept of [[decimal fraction]]s is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to [[pi]] or the [[square root of 2]]. Similarly, Babylonian math texts used sexagesimal (base&nbsp;60) fractions with great frequency.\n\n===Irrational numbers {{anchor|History of irrational numbers}}===\n{{further|History of irrational numbers}}\nThe earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] [[Sulba Sutras]] composed between 800 and 500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Selin |editor-first=Helaine |editor-link=Helaine Selin |title=Mathematics across cultures: the history of non-Western mathematics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |year=2000 |page=451 |isbn=0-7923-6481-3}}</ref> The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to [[Pythagoras]], more specifically to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Hippasus|Hippasus of Metapontum]], who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the [[square root of 2]]. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.<ref>{{cite book |title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |chapter=Horace and the Monuments: A New Interpretation of the Archytas ''Ode'' |author=Bernard Frischer |editor=D.R.

By the 17th&nbsp; century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook the scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since [[Euclid]]. In 1872, the publication of the theories of [[Karl Weierstrass]] (by his pupil E. Kossak), [[Eduard Heine]] (''[[Crelle's Journal|Crelle]],'' 74), [[Georg Cantor]] (Annalen, 5), and [[Richard Dedekind]] was brought about. In 1869, [[Charles M\u00e9ray]] had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by [[Salvatore Pincherle]] (1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by [[Paul Tannery]] (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a [[Dedekind cut|cut (Schnitt)]] in the system of [[real number]]s, separating all [[rational number]]s into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] (''Crelle'', 101), and M\u00e9ray.\n\nThe search for roots of [[Quintic equation|quintic]] and higher degree equations was an important development, the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]] ([[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] 1799, [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] 1824) showed that they could not be solved by [[nth root|radicals]] (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of [[algebraic numbers]] (all solutions to polynomial equations). [[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]] (1832) linked polynomial equations to [[group theory]] giving rise to the field of [[Galois theory]].\n\n[[Continued fraction]]s, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of [[Euler]], and at the opening of the 19th&nbsp;century were brought into prominence through the writings of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenm\u00fcller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and G\u00fcnther (1872). Ramus (1855) first connected the subject with [[determinant]]s, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius|M\u00f6bius]], and G\u00fcnther, in the theory of {{Lang|deu|Kettenbruchdeterminanten}}.\n\n===Transcendental numbers and reals {{anchor|History of transcendental numbers and reals}}===\n{{further|History of \u03c0}}\n\nThe existence of [[transcendental numbers]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogomolny |first=A. |authorlink=Cut-the-Knot |title=What's a number? |work=Interactive Mathematics Miscellany and Puzzles |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |accessdate=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923231547/http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |archive-date=23 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> was first established by [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] (1844, 1851). [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] proved in 1873 that ''e'' is transcendental and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] proved in 1882 that \u03c0 is transcendental. Finally, [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|Cantor]] showed that the set of all [[real number]]s is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]], so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.\n\n===Infinity and infinitesimals {{anchor|History of infinity and infinitesimals}}===\n{{further|History of infinity}}\nThe earliest known conception of mathematical [[infinity]] appears in the [[Yajur Veda]], an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, \"If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity.\" Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the [[Jain]] mathematicians c. 400&nbsp;BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.\n\n[[Aristotle]] defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between [[actual infinity]] and [[potential infinity]]\u2014the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' discussed the idea of [[bijection|one-to-one correspondences]] between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by [[Georg Cantor]]; in 1895 he published a book about his new [[set theory]], introducing, among other things, [[transfinite number]]s and formulating the [[continuum hypothesis]].\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of [[hyperreal numbers]] represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about [[infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].\n\nA modern geometrical version of infinity is given by [[projective geometry]], which introduces \"ideal points at infinity\", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawing.\n\n===Complex numbers {{anchor|History of complex numbers}}===\n{{further|History of complex numbers}}\nThe earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] in the {{nowrap|1st century AD}}, when he considered the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]]. They became more prominent when in the 16th&nbsp;century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]] and [[Gerolamo Cardano]]. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.\n\nThis was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] coined the term \"imaginary\" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See [[imaginary number]] for a discussion of the \"reality\" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation\n:<math>\\left ( \\sqrt{-1}\\right )^2 =\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math>\nseemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity\n:<math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab},</math>\nwhich is valid for positive real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', and was also used in complex number calculations with one of ''a'', ''b'' positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a}}</math>\nin the case when both ''a'' and ''b'' are negative even bedeviled [[Euler]]. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol ''i'' in place of <math>\\sqrt{-1}</math> to guard against this mistake.\n\nThe 18th century saw the work of [[Abraham de Moivre]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. [[De Moivre's formula]] (1730) states:\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta </math>\nwhile [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]] (1748) gave us:\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta }. </math>\n\nThe existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until [[Caspar Wessel]] described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in [[John Wallis|Wallis]]'s ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nAlso in 1799, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success that is well known.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] studied [[Gaussian integer|complex numbers of the form]] {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, where ''a'' and ''b'' are integral, or rational (and ''i'' is one of the two roots of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}}). His student, [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], studied the type {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b\u03c9''}}, where ''\u03c9'' is a complex root of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0.}} Other such classes (called [[cyclotomic fields]]) of complex numbers derive from the [[roots of unity]] {{nowrap|''x''<sup>''k''</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0}} for higher values of ''k''. This generalization is largely due to [[Ernst Kummer]], who also invented [[ideal number]]s, which were expressed as geometrical entities by [[Felix Klein]] in 1893.\n\nIn 1850 [[Victor Alexandre Puiseux]] took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of [[mathematical singularity|essential singular points]]. This eventually led to the concept of the [[extended complex plane]].\n\n===Prime numbers {{anchor|History of prime numbers}}===\n[[Prime number]]s have been studied throughout recorded history. Euclid devoted one book of the ''Elements'' to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and presented the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.\n\nIn 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] used the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the [[Renaissance]] and later eras.\n\nIn 1796, [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] conjectured the [[prime number theorem]], describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the [[Goldbach conjecture]], which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the [[Riemann hypothesis]], formulated by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1859. The [[prime number theorem]] was finally proved by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.\n\n=={{anchor|Classification|Classification of numbers}}Main classification==\n{{Redirect|Number system|systems for expressing numbers|Numeral system}}\n{{See also|List of types of numbers}}Numbers can be classified into [[set (mathematics)|sets]], called '''number systems''', such as the [[natural numbers]] and the [[real numbers]].<ref>\"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens \u2013 welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden \u2013 zu einem Ganzen.\" [http://www.brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610133240/http://brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm |date=2011-06-10 }} <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</ref> The major categories of numbers are as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 200px; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|+ Main number systems\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{N}</math>\n![[Natural number|Natural]]\n| 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...<br />\n<math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math> or <math>\\mathbb{N}_1</math> are sometimes used.\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>\n![[Integer]]\n|..., \u22125, \u22124, \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>\n![[Rational number|Rational]]\n|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' is not 0\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{R}</math>\n![[Real number|Real]]\n|The limit of a convergent sequence of rational numbers\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{C}</math>\n![[Complex number|Complex]]\n|''a'' + ''bi'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers and ''i'' is a formal square root of&nbsp;\u22121\n|}\n\nThere is generally no problem in identifying each number system with a proper subset of the next one (by [[abuse of notation#Equality vs. isomorphism|abuse of notation]]), because each of these number systems is [[canonical isomorphism|canonically isomorphic]] to a proper subset of the next one.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The resulting hierarchy allows, for example, to talk, formally correctly, about real numbers that are rational numbers, and is expressed symbolically by writing\n:<math>\\mathbb{N} \\subset \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\subset \\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\n===Natural numbers===\n{{Main|Natural number}}\n[[File:Nat num.svg|thumb|The natural numbers, starting with 1]]\nThe most familiar numbers are the [[natural number]]s (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with&nbsp;1 (0 was not even considered a number for the [[Ancient Greeks]].) However, in the 19th&nbsp;century, [[set theory|set theorists]] and other mathematicians started including&nbsp;0 ([[cardinality]] of the [[empty set]], i.e. 0&nbsp;elements, where&nbsp;0 is thus the smallest [[cardinal number]]) in the set of natural numbers.<ref>\n{{MathWorld|title=Natural Number|id=NaturalNumber}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |title=natural number |work=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=4 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213133201/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |archive-date=13 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including&nbsp;0 or not. The [[mathematical symbol]] for the set of all natural numbers is '''N''', also written <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>, and sometimes <math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math> or <math>\\mathbb{N}_1</math> when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.\n\nIn the [[base 10]] numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten [[numerical digit|digits]]: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base&nbsp;10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a [[place value]] of&nbsp;1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.\n\nIn [[set theory]], which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suppes |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick_Suppes |title=Axiomatic Set Theory |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1972 |page=[https://archive.org/details/axiomaticsettheo00supp_0/page/1 1] |isbn=0-486-61630-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/axiomaticsettheo00supp_0/page/1 }}</ref> natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number&nbsp;3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in [[Peano Arithmetic]], the number&nbsp;3 is represented as sss0, where s is the \"successor\" function (i.e.,&nbsp;3 is the third successor of&nbsp;0). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent&nbsp;3 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.\n\n===Integers===\n{{Main|Integer}}\nThe [[negative number|negative]] of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces&nbsp;0 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a [[minus sign]]). As an example, the negative of&nbsp;7 is written&nbsp;\u22127, and {{nowrap|7 + (\u22127) {{=}} 0}}. When the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including&nbsp;0), the result is defined as the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''' also written [[Blackboard bold|<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>.]] Here the letter Z comes {{ety|de|Zahl|number}}. The set of integers forms a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with the operations addition and multiplication.<ref>{{Mathworld|Integer|Integer}}</ref>\n\nThe natural numbers form a [[subset]] of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as '''positive integers''', and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as '''non-negative integers'''.\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{Main|Rational number}}\nA rational number is a number that can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} represents ''m'' parts of a whole divided into ''n'' equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example {{sfrac|1|2}} and {{sfrac|2|4}} are equal, that is:\n: <math>{1 \\over 2} = {2 \\over 4}.</math>\n\nIn general,\n:<math>{a \\over b} = {c \\over d}</math> if and only if <math>{ a \\times d} = {c \\times b}.</math>\n\nIf the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' is greater than ''n'' (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than&nbsp;1. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to&nbsp;1 and can also be positive, negative, or&nbsp;0. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator&nbsp;1. For example&nbsp;\u22127 can be written&nbsp;{{sfrac|\u22127|1}}. The symbol for the rational numbers is '''Q''' (for ''[[quotient]]''), also written [[Blackboard bold|<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>.]]\n\n===Real numbers===\n{{Main|Real number}}\n\nThe symbol for the real numbers is '''R''', also written as <math>\\mathbb{R}.</math> They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the [[number line]]. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a [[minus sign]], e.g. -123.456.\n\nMost real numbers can only be ''approximated'' by [[decimal]] numerals, in which a [[decimal point]] is placed to the right of the digit with place value&nbsp;1. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents {{sfrac|123456|1000}}, or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its [[fractional part]] has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.  Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern.  Such a decimal is called a [[repeating decimal]]. Thus {{sfrac|3}} can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0.{{overline|3}}.\n\nIt turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called [[irrational number|irrational]]. A famous irrational real number is the number [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of any circle to its [[diameter]]. When pi is written as\n:<math>\\pi = 3.14159265358979\\dots,</math>\nas it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that [[proof that pi is irrational|{{pi}} is irrational]]. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is\n:<math>\\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237\\dots,</math>\nthe [[square root of 2]], that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions {{nowrap|( 1 trillion {{=}}  10<sup>12</sup> {{=}} 1,000,000,000,000 )}} of digits.\n\nNot only these prominent examples but [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting [[rounding|rounded]] or [[truncation|truncated]] real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only [[countably many]]. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a [[margin of error]]. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to {{sfrac|1234555|10000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|1234565|10000}} (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number  greater or equal to {{sfrac|123456|1000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|123457|1000}} (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called [[significant digits]]. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001&nbsp; meters. If the sides of a [[rectangle]] are measured as 1.23&nbsp;meters and 4.56&nbsp;meters, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between {{nowrap|5.614591 square meters}} and {{nowrap|5.603011 square meters}}. Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not ''significant''. Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61.\n\nJust as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, [[0.999...]], 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number&nbsp;1. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places.  In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros.  Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000.... Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the decimal place, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing the rightmost -9 digit by one, changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of the decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85.  Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.  For example, 99.999... = 100.\n\nThe real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the [[least upper bound]] property.\n\nIt can be shown that any [[ordered field]], which is also [[completeness of the real numbers|complete]], is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an [[algebraically closed field]], because they do not include a solution (often called a [[square root of minus one]]) to the algebraic equation <math> x^2+1=0</math>.\n\n===Complex numbers===\n{{Main|Complex number}}\nMoving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the [[complex number]]s. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of [[cubic function|cubic]] and [[quadratic function|quadratic]] polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a [[square root]] of&nbsp;\u22121, denoted by ''[[imaginary unit|i]]'', a symbol assigned by [[Leonhard Euler]], and called the [[imaginary unit]]. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form\n:<math>\\,a + b i</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the [[complex plane]], a [[vector space]] of two real [[dimension]]s. In the expression {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, the real number ''a'' is called the [[real part]] and ''b'' is called the [[imaginary part]]. If the real part of a complex number is&nbsp;0, then the number is called an [[imaginary number]] or is referred to as ''purely imaginary''; if the imaginary part is&nbsp;0, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a [[subset]] of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a [[Gaussian integer]]. The symbol for the complex numbers is '''C''' or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\nThe [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that the complex numbers form an [[algebraically closed field]], meaning that every [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has a [[zero of a function|root]] in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], which is [[complete space|complete]], but unlike the real numbers, it is not [[total order|ordered]]. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that '' I'' is greater than&nbsp;1, nor is there any meaning in saying that '' I'' is less than&nbsp;1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a [[total order]] that is [[ordered field|compatible with field operations]].\n\n==Subclasses of the integers==\n\n===Even and odd numbers===\n{{main|Even and odd numbers}}\nAn '''even number''' is an integer that is \"evenly divisible\" by two, that is [[Euclidean division|divisible by two without remainder]]; an '''odd number''' is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term \"evenly divisible\" is now almost always shortened to \"[[divisibility|divisible]]\".) Any odd number ''n'' may be constructed by the formula {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2''k'' + 1,}} for a suitable integer ''k''. Starting with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 0,}} the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number ''m'' has the form {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 2''k''}} where ''k'' is again an [[integer]]. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.\n\n===Prime numbers===\n{{main|Prime number}}\nA '''prime number''' is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.  The study of these questions belongs to [[number theory]].  An example of a still unanswered question is, whether every even number is the sum of two primes.  This is called [[Goldbach's conjecture]].\n\nThe question, whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, has been answered to the positive: this proven claim is called [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. A proof appears in [[Euclid's Elements]].\n\n===Other classes of integers===\nMany subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are [[Fibonacci number]]s and [[perfect number]]s. For more examples, see [[Integer sequence]].\n\n==Subclasses of the complex numbers==\n\n===Algebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers===\n[[Algebraic number]]s are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called [[irrational number]]s. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called [[transcendental number]]s. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a [[monic polynomial]] equation with integer coefficients are called [[algebraic integer]]s.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\nMotivated by the classical problems of [[Straightedge and compass construction|constructions with straightedge and compass]], the [[constructible number]]s are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps.\n\n===Computable numbers===\n{{Main|Computable number}}\nA '''computable number''', also known as ''recursive number'', is a [[real number]] such that there exists an [[algorithm]] which, given a positive number ''n'' as input, produces the first ''n'' digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using [[\u03bc-recursive function]]s, [[Turing machine]]s or [[\u03bb-calculus]]. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a [[polynomial]], and thus form a [[real closed field]] that contains the real [[algebraic number]]s.\n\nThe computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.\n\nThe set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, [[almost all]] real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.\n\n==Extensions of the concept==\n\n===''p''-adic numbers===\n{{main|p-adic number|l1=''p''-adic number}}\nThe ''p''-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what [[radix|base]] is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a [[prime number]] base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the ''p''-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.\n\nThe elements of an [[algebraic function field]] over a [[finite field]] and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see [[Function field analogy]]). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The ''p''-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.\n\n===Hypercomplex numbers===\n{{main|hypercomplex number}}\nSome number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called [[hypercomplex number]]s. They include the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', introduced by Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], in which multiplication is not [[commutative]], the [[octonion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[associative]] in addition to not being commutative, and the [[sedenion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[Alternative algebra|alternative]], neither associative nor commutative.\n\n===Transfinite numbers===\n{{main|transfinite number}}\nFor dealing with infinite [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the natural numbers have been generalized to the [[ordinal number]]s and to the [[cardinal number]]s. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.\n\n===Nonstandard numbers===\n[[Hyperreal number]]s are used in [[non-standard analysis]]. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *'''R'''), denote an [[ordered field]] that is a proper [[Field extension|extension]] of the ordered field of [[real number]]s '''R''' and satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. This principle allows true [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about '''R''' to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *'''R'''.\n\n[[Superreal number|Superreal]] and [[surreal number]]s extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Concrete number]]\n* [[List of numbers]]\n* [[List of numbers in various languages]]\n* [[List of types of numbers]]\n* [[Mathematical constant]]s\n* [[Mythical number]]s\n* [[Numerical cognition]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude]]\n* [[Physical constant]]s\n* [[Pi]]\n* [[Positional notation]]\n* [[Prime number]]\n* [[Subitizing and counting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Tobias Dantzig]], ''Number, the language of science; a critical survey written for the cultured non-mathematician'', New York, The Macmillan company, 1930.\n* Erich Friedman, ''[http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html What's special about this number?]''\n* Steven Galovich, ''Introduction to Mathematical Structures'', Harcourt Brace Javanovich, 23 January 1989, {{isbn|0-15-543468-3}}.\n* [[Paul Halmos]], ''Naive Set Theory'', Springer, 1974, {{isbn|0-387-90092-6}}.\n* [[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', Oxford University Press, 1972.\n* [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' to *56, Cambridge University Press, 1910.\n* George I.

Confusingly, ''[[Geranium]]'' is the botanical name and common name of a separate genus of related plants (also known as cranesbills). Both genera belong to the [[family (biology)|family]] Geraniaceae. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] originally included all the species in one genus, ''Geranium'', and they were later separated into two genera by [[Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle|Charles L\u2019H\u00e9ritier]] in 1789.\n\n''Pelargonium'' species are evergreen perennials [[native plant|indigenous]] to temperate and tropical regions of the world, with many species in southern Africa. They are drought and heat tolerant, but can tolerate only minor frosts. Some species are extremely popular garden plants, grown as houseplants and [[bedding (horticulture)|bedding]] plants in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions.They have a long flowering period, with flowers mostly in purple, red and orange, or white.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Pelargon.jpg|thumb|One of hundreds of garden and houseplant cultivars]]\nThe name ''Pelargonium'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2|\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2]], ''pelarg\u00f3s'' ([[stork]]), because the seed head looks like a stork's beak. [[Dillenius]] originally suggested the name 'stork', because ''Geranium'' was named after a [[crane (bird)|crane]] \u2014 \"''a'' \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2, ''ciconia, sicuti vocamus Gerania'', \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, ''grus''\" (as ''pelargos'', stork, as we call the ''Gerania'', ''geranos'', crane).{{sfn|Dillenius|1732|loc=[http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/ing/Libro.php?Libro=1386&Pagina=280 De Geraniorum Differentiis]}}{{sfn|Boddy|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=24eoWcnoyfcC&pg=PR2 Introduction p.&nbsp;11]}} Despite the Latin, this should not be confused with the modern-day genus ''[[Ciconia]]'', of birds in the stork family.\n\n== Description ==\n''Pelargonium'' occurs in a large number of [[growth forms]], including [[herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annuals]], [[shrubs]], subshrubs, stem [[succulents]] and [[geophytes]].{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} The erect stems bear five-[[petal]]ed [[flowers]] in [[umbel]]-like clusters, which are occasionally branched. Because not all flowers appear simultaneously but open from the centre outwards, this is a form of inflorescence is referred to as pseudoumbels.\n\nThe flower has a single symmetry plane ([[zygomorphic]]), which distinguishes it from the ''[[Geranium]]'' flower, which has radial symmetry ([[actinomorphic]]). Thus the lower three (anterior) petals are differentiated from the upper two (posterior) petals. The posterior [[sepal]] is fused with the [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] to form a [[hypanthium]] (nectary tube). The nectary tube varies from only a few millimeters, up to several centimeters, and is an important floral characteristic in morphological classification. [[Stamens]] vary from 2 to 7, and their number, position relative to [[staminodes]], and curvature are used to identify individual species. There are five [[stigmata]] in the [[Style (botany)|style]].<ref name=PPage/> For the considerable diversity in flower morphology, see figure 1 of R\u00f6schenbleck ''et al.'' (2014){{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n\n[[Leaf|Leaves]] are usually alternate, and [[leaf shape|palmately]] lobed or [[pinnate]], often on long stalks, and sometimes with light or dark patterns. The leaves of ''[[Pelargonium peltatum]]'' (Ivy-leaved Geranium), have a thick cuticle better adapting them for drought tolerance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Appell|first=Scott D.|title=The Potted Garden: New plants and New approaches for container gardens.|year=2001|isbn=978-1889538228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhGxmyG5HLMC|page={{page needed|date=March 2014}} }}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Dillenius Pellargonium.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dillenius]]' introduction of the term 'Pelargonium' in ''Hortus Elthamensis'' 1732]]\n[[File:P inquinans Dillenius.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium inquinans]]'', (''Geranium Afric. arborescens''), ''Hortus Elthamensis'']]\n''Pelargonium'' is the second largest genus (after ''Geranium'') within the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Geraniaceae]], within which it is [[Sister group|sister]] to the remaining genera of the family in its strict sense,<ref name=Price/> ''[[Erodium]]'', ''[[Geranium]]'', and ''[[Monsonia]]'' including ''Sarcocaulon''.

In 1774, ''[[Pelargonium cordatum|P.&nbsp;cordatum]]'', ''[[Pelargonium crispum|P.&nbsp;crispum]]'', ''[[Pelargonium quercifolium|P.&nbsp;quercifolium]]'' and ''P.&nbsp;radula'' were introduced, followed by ''[[Pelargonium capitatum|P.&nbsp;capitatum]]'' in 1790.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RWuZBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT207 Pelargonium]}}<ref name=CCGS1/>\n\n=== Circumscription ===\n''Pelargonium'' is distinguished from the other genera in the family [[Geraniaceae]] by the presence of a [[hypanthium]], which consists of an [[Adnation|adnate]] nectar spur with one [[nectary]], as well as a generally [[zygomorphic]] floral symmetry.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n[[De Candolle]] first proposed dividing the genus into 12 sections in 1824, based on the diversity of [[growth forms]].<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

Price and Jeffrey D. Palmer. Phylogenetic Relationships of the Geraniaceae and Geraniales from rbcL Sequence Comparisons. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden Vol. 80, No. 3 (1993), pp. 661-671]</ref> However phylogenetic analysis shows only three distinct [[clades]], labelled A, B and C.<ref name=Weng/> In this analysis not all sections were [[monophyletic]] although some were strongly supported including ''Chorisma'', ''Myrrhidium'' and ''Jenkinsonia'', while other sections were more [[paraphyletic]]. This in turn has led to a proposal, informal at this stage of a reformulation of the infrageneric subdivision of ''Pelargonium''.\n\nIn the proposed scheme of Weng ''et al''. there would be two [[subgenera]], based on clades A+B, and C respectively and seven sections based on subclades. Subsequent analysis with an expanded taxa set confirmed this infrageneric subdivision into two groups which also correspond to chromosome length (<1.5 \u03bc, 1.5-3.0\u03bc),{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} but also two subclades within each major clade, suggesting the presence of four subgenera, these correspond to clades A, B, C1 and C2 of the earlier analysis, A being by far the largest clade with 141 taxa. As before the internal structure of the clades supported monophyly of some sections (''Myrrhidium'', ''Chorisma'', ''Reniformia'', ''Pelargonium'', ''Ligularia'' and ''Hoarea'') but paraphyly in others (''Jenkinsonia'', ''Ciconium'', ''Peristera''). A distinct clade could be identified within the paraphyletic ''Polyactium'', designated section ''Magnistipulacea''. As a result, ''Polyactium'' has been split up to provide this new section, which in itself contains two subsections, ''Magnistipulacea'' and ''Schizopetala'', following Knuth's original treatment of ''Polyactium'' as having four subsections.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n[[File:Pelargonium tetragonum.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Magnipetala'' section ''Chorisma'': ''[[Pelargonium tetragonum|P.&nbsp;tetragonum]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium cotyledonis03.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Parvulipetala'' section ''Isopetalum'': ''[[Pelargonium cotyledonis|P.&nbsp;cotyledonis]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium acetosum (9344387742).jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Paucisignata'' section ''Ciconium'': ''[[Pelargonium acetosum|P.&nbsp;acetosum]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium tricolor hh.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Pelargonium'' section ''Campylia'': ''[[Pelargonium tricolor|P.&nbsp;tricolor]]'']]\n[[Image:Pelargonium crithmifolium3.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Pelargonium'' section ''Otidia'': ''[[Pelargonium crithmifolium|P.&nbsp;crithmifolium]]'']]\n\nThus R\u00f6schenbleck ''et al.''

In 1916 the American botanist [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] (1858\u20131954) introduced two new terms for zonal and regal pelargoniums.

In the UK the bulbous double-headed types are preferred whilst on the European continent the balcon single types for large-scale hanging floral displays are favoured. Ivy-leaved pelargoniums embrace all such growth size types including small-leaved varieties and genetic hybrid crosses, which display little or no zonal characteristics.

In addition to \"Regals\" they are also known as \u201cShow Pelargoniums\u201d. In the United States they are often known as the \"Martha Washington\" or \u2018\"Lady Washington\" pelargoniums. They are grown primarily for the beauty and richness of their flower heads, which are large. Most of those cultivars grown currently are the result of hybridization over the last 50 years. They are very short-jointed and compact, which results in their requiring very little work in order to create a floriforous and well-rounded plant.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepags.org.uk/about-us/pelargonium-basics Pelargonium Basics]}} Flowers are single, rarely double, in mauve, pink, purple or white.

Angel pelargoniums (derived from ''Pelargonium crispum'') ====\n[[File:Angeleyes Randy.jpg|thumb|upright|'Angeleyes Randy' (Angel)]]\nAngel pelargoniums are similar to Regal pelargoniums but more closely resemble ''[[Pelargonium crispum|P. crispum]]'' in leaf shape and growth habit. The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between ''P. crispum'' and a Regal variety in the early part of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by specialist nurseries resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with ''P. crispum'' in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called \"pansy-faced\" in the US. Some varieties have bicolour foliage. Other terms include \u2018Langley-Smith Hybrids\u2019.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}\n\n==== E.

Scented-leaved pelargoniums ====\n[[Image:Pelargonium graveolens 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium graveolens]]'' (Scented leaf)]]\nShrubby evergreen perennials grown chiefly for their fragrance, may be species or cultivars but all must have a clear and distinct scented foliage. Scent is emitted when the leaves are touched or bruised with some scents aromatic, others pungent and in a few cases, quite unpleasant. Several of the scented leaved pelargoniums are grown for the oil [[geraniol]], which is extracted from the leaves and is an essential oil much used commercially in perfumery. The scent of some species growing in their natural habitat, acts as a deterrent to grazing animals who appear to dislike the emitted scent. Conversely, it also attracts other insect life to visit the bloom and pollinate the plant. The scented leaves can be used for potpourri and they also have a use as flavourings in cooking. Occasionally scented types can be found in some of the other groups mentioned; for example, the Angels, having ''P. crispum'' in their genetic makeup, can often have a strong citrus scent. Leaves are lobed, toothed, incised or variegated. Growth habit is very variable, but the flowers are less prominent than other groups, and most closely resemble the species they originated from.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}\n\nThese include:\n[[Image:Fair Ellen.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium quercifolium]]'' 'Fair Ellen' (Scented leaf)]]\n[[Image:Pelargonium ionidiflorum 1.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium ionidiflorum]]'' (Scented leaf)]]\n* Almond - ''[[Pelargonium quercifolium]]''\n* Apple - ''[[Pelargonium odoratissimum]]''\n* Apple - ''[[Pelargonium cordifolium]]''\n* Apple/Mint - ''[[Pelargonium album]]''\n* Apricot/Lemon - ''Pelargonium scabrum''\n* Balsam - ''Pelargonium panduriforme''\n* Camphor - ''Pelargonium betulinum'' \n* Celery - ''Pelargonium ionidiflorum''\n* Cinnamon - ''Pelargonium 'Ardwyck Cinnamon'''\n* Coconut - ''[[Pelargonium grossalarioides]]'' (''Pelargonium parriflorum'')\n* Eau de Cologne - ''Pelargonium 'Brilliantine'''\n* Eucalyptus - ''Pelargonium 'Secret Love'''\n* Grapefruit - ''Pelargonium 'Poquita'''\n* Ginger - ''Pelargonium 'Torrento''' or 'Cola Bottles' which is a variety of ''Pelargonium'' x ''nervosum'' \n* Hazelnut - ''Pelargonium 'Odorata Hazelnut''\n* Lavender - ''Pelargonium 'Lavender Lindy'''\n* Lemon - ''[[Pelargonium crispum]]''\n* Lemon - ''Pelargonium citronellum'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium'' 'Mabel Grey')\n* Lemon Balm - ''Pelargonium x melissinum''\n* Lime - ''Pelargonium x nervosum''\n* Myrrh - ''Pelargonium myrrhifolium''\n* Nutmeg - ''[[Pelargonium x fragrans]]'' \n* Old Spice - ''Variety of Pelargonium x fragrans''\n* Orange - ''Pelargonium x citriodorum'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium'' 'Prince of Orange')\n* Peach - ''Pelargonium 'Peaches and Cream'''\n* Peppermint - ''[[Pelargonium tomentosum]]''\n* Pine - ''Pelargonium denticulatum'' \n* Pineapple - ''Pelargonium 'Brilliant'''\n* Raspberry - ''Pelargonium 'Red Raspberry'''\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium graveolens]]'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium roseum'')\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium capitatum]]''\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium radens]]''\n* Southernwood - ''Pelargonium abrotanifolium''\n* Spicy - ''[[Pelargonium exstipulatum]]''\n* Strawberry - ''Pelargonium x scarboroviae''\n\n; Cultivars:\n* 'Attar of Roses' - a cultivar of ''P. capitatum''\n* 'Crowfoot Rose' - a cultivar of ''P. radens''\n* 'Dr. Livingston' - a cultivar of ''P. radens''\n* 'Grey Lady Plymouth' - a cultivar of ''P. graveolens''\n* 'Prince Rupert' - a cultivar of ''P. crispum''\n\n==== G. Species pelargoniums ====\nThe species are the forefathers of all the cultivar groups listed above. In general, the definition of a species is that it breeds true, and is to be found doing this in the \"wild\". Species pelargoniums have a large diversity of characteristics in habit, shape, size and colour, which probably accounts for them having retained their popularity for more than 300 years.\n\n==== H.

Confusingly, ''[[Geranium]]'' is the botanical name and common name of a separate genus of related plants (also known as cranesbills). Both genera belong to the [[family (biology)|family]] Geraniaceae. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] originally included all the species in one genus, ''Geranium'', and they were later separated into two genera by [[Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle|Charles L\u2019H\u00e9ritier]] in 1789.\n\n''Pelargonium'' species are evergreen perennials [[native plant|indigenous]] to temperate and tropical regions of the world, with many species in southern Africa. They are drought and heat tolerant, but can tolerate only minor frosts. Some species are extremely popular garden plants, grown as houseplants and [[bedding (horticulture)|bedding]] plants in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions.They have a long flowering period, with flowers mostly in purple, red and orange, or white.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Pelargon.jpg|thumb|One of hundreds of garden and houseplant cultivars]]\nThe name ''Pelargonium'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2|\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2]], ''pelarg\u00f3s'' ([[stork]]), because the seed head looks like a stork's beak. [[Dillenius]] originally suggested the name 'stork', because ''Geranium'' was named after a [[crane (bird)|crane]] \u2014 \"''a'' \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2, ''ciconia, sicuti vocamus Gerania'', \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, ''grus''\" (as ''pelargos'', stork, as we call the ''Gerania'', ''geranos'', crane).{{sfn|Dillenius|1732|loc=[http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/ing/Libro.php?Libro=1386&Pagina=280 De Geraniorum Differentiis]}}{{sfn|Boddy|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=24eoWcnoyfcC&pg=PR2 Introduction p.&nbsp;11]}} Despite the Latin, this should not be confused with the modern-day genus ''[[Ciconia]]'', of birds in the stork family.\n\n== Description ==\n''Pelargonium'' occurs in a large number of [[growth forms]], including [[herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annuals]], [[shrubs]], subshrubs, stem [[succulents]] and [[geophytes]].{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} The erect stems bear five-[[petal]]ed [[flowers]] in [[umbel]]-like clusters, which are occasionally branched. Because not all flowers appear simultaneously but open from the centre outwards, this is a form of inflorescence is referred to as pseudoumbels.\n\nThe flower has a single symmetry plane ([[zygomorphic]]), which distinguishes it from the ''[[Geranium]]'' flower, which has radial symmetry ([[actinomorphic]]). Thus the lower three (anterior) petals are differentiated from the upper two (posterior) petals. The posterior [[sepal]] is fused with the [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] to form a [[hypanthium]] (nectary tube). The nectary tube varies from only a few millimeters, up to several centimeters, and is an important floral characteristic in morphological classification. [[Stamens]] vary from 2 to 7, and their number, position relative to [[staminodes]], and curvature are used to identify individual species. There are five [[stigmata]] in the [[Style (botany)|style]].<ref name=PPage/> For the considerable diversity in flower morphology, see figure 1 of R\u00f6schenbleck ''et al.'' (2014){{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n\n[[Leaf|Leaves]] are usually alternate, and [[leaf shape|palmately]] lobed or [[pinnate]], often on long stalks, and sometimes with light or dark patterns. The leaves of ''[[Pelargonium peltatum]]'' (Ivy-leaved Geranium), have a thick cuticle better adapting them for drought tolerance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Appell|first=Scott D.|title=The Potted Garden: New plants and New approaches for container gardens.|year=2001|isbn=978-1889538228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhGxmyG5HLMC|page={{page needed|date=March 2014}} }}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Dillenius Pellargonium.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dillenius]]' introduction of the term 'Pelargonium' in ''Hortus Elthamensis'' 1732]]\n[[File:P inquinans Dillenius.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium inquinans]]'', (''Geranium Afric. arborescens''), ''Hortus Elthamensis'']]\n''Pelargonium'' is the second largest genus (after ''Geranium'') within the [[Geraniaceae]] [[family (biology)|family]], within which it is [[Sister group|sister]] to the remaining genera of the family in its strict sense,<ref name=Price/> ''[[Erodium]]'', ''[[Geranium]]'', and ''[[Monsonia]]'' including ''Sarcocaulon''.

Price and Jeffrey D. Palmer. Phylogenetic Relationships of the Geraniaceae and Geraniales from rbcL Sequence Comparisons. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden Vol. 80, No. 3 (1993), pp. 661-671]</ref> However phylogenetic analysis shows only three distinct [[clades]], labelled A, B and C.<ref name=Weng/> In this analysis not all sections were [[monophyletic]] although some were strongly supported including ''Chorisma'', ''Myrrhidium'' and ''Jenkinsonia'', while other sections were more [[paraphyletic]]. This in turn has led to a proposal, informal at this stage of a reformulation of the infrageneric subdivision of ''Pelargonium''.\n\nIn the proposed scheme of Weng ''et al''. there would be two [[subgenera]], based on clades A+B, and C respectively and seven sections based on subclades. Subsequent analysis with an expanded taxa set confirmed this infrageneric subdivision into two groups which also correspond to chromosome length (<1.5 \u03bc, 1.5-3.0\u03bc),{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} but also two subclades within each major clade, suggesting the presence of four subgenera, these correspond to clades A, B, C1 and C2 of the earlier analysis, A being by far the largest clade with 141 taxa. As before the internal structure of the clades supported monophyly of some sections (''Myrrhidium'', ''Chorisma'', ''Reniformia'', ''Pelargonium'', ''Ligularia'' and ''Hoarea'') but paraphyly in others (''Jenkinsonia'', ''Ciconium'', ''Peristera''). A distinct clade could be identified within the paraphyletic ''Polyactium'', designated section ''Magnistipulacea''. As a result, ''Polyactium'' has been split up to provide this new section, which in itself contains two subsections, ''Magnistipulacea'' and ''Schizopetala'', following Knuth's original treatment of ''Polyactium'' as having four subsections.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n[[File:Pelargonium tetragonum.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Magnipetala'' section ''Chorisma'': ''[[Pelargonium tetragonum|P.&nbsp;tetragonum]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium cotyledonis03.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Parvulipetala'' section ''Isopetalum'': ''[[Pelargonium cotyledonis|P.&nbsp;cotyledonis]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium acetosum (9344387742).jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Paucisignata'' section ''Ciconium'': ''[[Pelargonium acetosum|P.&nbsp;acetosum]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium tricolor hh.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Pelargonium'' section ''Campylia'': ''[[Pelargonium tricolor|P.&nbsp;tricolor]]'']]\n[[Image:Pelargonium crithmifolium3.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Pelargonium'' section ''Otidia'': ''[[Pelargonium crithmifolium|P.&nbsp;crithmifolium]]'']]\n\nThus R\u00f6schenbleck ''et al.''

They are grown primarily for the beauty and richness of their flower heads, which are large. Most of those cultivars grown currently are the result of hybridization over the last 50 years.

The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between ''P. crispum'' and a Regal variety in the early part of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by specialist nurseries resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with ''P. crispum'' in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called \"pansy-faced\" in the US. Some varieties have bicolour foliage.

Scent is emitted when the leaves are touched or bruised with some scents aromatic, others pungent and in a few cases, quite unpleasant. Several of the scented leaved pelargoniums are grown for the oil [[geraniol]], which is extracted from the leaves and is an essential oil much used commercially in perfumery. The scent of some species growing in their natural habitat, acts as a deterrent to grazing animals who appear to dislike the emitted scent. Conversely, it also attracts other insect life to visit the bloom and pollinate the plant. The scented leaves can be used for potpourri and they also have a use as flavourings in cooking. Occasionally scented types can be found in some of the other groups mentioned; for example, the Angels, having ''P. crispum'' in their genetic makeup, can often have a strong citrus scent. Leaves are lobed, toothed, incised or variegated. Growth habit is very variable, but the flowers are less prominent than other groups, and most closely resemble the species they originated from.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}\n\nThese include:\n[[Image:Fair Ellen.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium quercifolium]]'' 'Fair Ellen' (Scented leaf)]]\n[[Image:Pelargonium ionidiflorum 1.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium ionidiflorum]]'' (Scented leaf)]]\n* Almond - ''[[Pelargonium quercifolium]]''\n* Apple - ''[[Pelargonium odoratissimum]]''\n* Apple - ''[[Pelargonium cordifolium]]''\n* Apple/Mint - ''[[Pelargonium album]]''\n* Apricot/Lemon - ''Pelargonium scabrum''\n* Balsam - ''Pelargonium panduriforme''\n* Camphor - ''Pelargonium betulinum'' \n* Celery - ''Pelargonium ionidiflorum''\n* Cinnamon - ''Pelargonium 'Ardwyck Cinnamon'''\n* Coconut - ''[[Pelargonium grossalarioides]]'' (''Pelargonium parriflorum'')\n* Eau de Cologne - ''Pelargonium 'Brilliantine'''\n* Eucalyptus - ''Pelargonium 'Secret Love'''\n* Grapefruit - ''Pelargonium 'Poquita'''\n* Ginger - ''Pelargonium 'Torrento''' or 'Cola Bottles' which is a variety of ''Pelargonium'' x ''nervosum'' \n* Hazelnut - ''Pelargonium 'Odorata Hazelnut''\n* Lavender - ''Pelargonium 'Lavender Lindy'''\n* Lemon - ''[[Pelargonium crispum]]''\n* Lemon - ''Pelargonium citronellum'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium'' 'Mabel Grey')\n* Lemon Balm - ''Pelargonium x melissinum''\n* Lime - ''Pelargonium x nervosum''\n* Myrrh - ''Pelargonium myrrhifolium''\n* Nutmeg - ''[[Pelargonium x fragrans]]'' \n* Old Spice - ''Variety of Pelargonium x fragrans''\n* Orange - ''Pelargonium x citriodorum'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium'' 'Prince of Orange')\n* Peach - ''Pelargonium 'Peaches and Cream'''\n* Peppermint - ''[[Pelargonium tomentosum]]''\n* Pine - ''Pelargonium denticulatum'' \n* Pineapple - ''Pelargonium 'Brilliant'''\n* Raspberry - ''Pelargonium 'Red Raspberry'''\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium graveolens]]'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium roseum'')\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium capitatum]]''\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium radens]]''\n* Southernwood - ''Pelargonium abrotanifolium''\n* Spicy - ''[[Pelargonium exstipulatum]]''\n* Strawberry - ''Pelargonium x scarboroviae''\n\n; Cultivars:\n* 'Attar of Roses' - a cultivar of ''P. capitatum''\n* 'Crowfoot Rose' - a cultivar of ''P. radens''\n* 'Dr. Livingston' - a cultivar of ''P. radens''\n* 'Grey Lady Plymouth' - a cultivar of ''P. graveolens''\n* 'Prince Rupert' - a cultivar of ''P. crispum''\n\n==== G.
