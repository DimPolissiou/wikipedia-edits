It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system.

The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"].

In a different basis set, the more general expression is\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\widehat{\\rho} \\log(\\widehat{\\rho})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{\\rho}</math> is the [[density matrix]], <math>\\operatorname{Tr}</math> is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and <math>\\log</math> is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

(Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed.

It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Defining the  entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively the entropy of a state <math>X</math> is defined as the largest number <math>\\lambda</math>  such that <math>X</math> is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount <math>\\lambda</math> in the state <math>X_1</math> and a complementary amount, <math>(1-\\lambda)</math>, in the state <math>X_0</math>. A simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: It is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.\n\n=== Entropy in quantum mechanics ===\n{{Main|von Neumann entropy}}\n\nIn [[quantum statistical mechanics]], the concept of entropy was developed by [[John von Neumann]] and is generally referred to as \"[[von Neumann entropy]]\",\n\n: <math>S = - k_\\mathrm{B}\\operatorname{Tr} ( \\rho \\log \\rho ) \\!</math>\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the [[density matrix]] and Tr is the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] operator.\n\nThis upholds the [[correspondence principle]], because in the [[classical limit]], when the phases between the basis states used for the classical probabilities are purely random, this expression is equivalent to the familiar classical definition of entropy,\n\n: <math>S = - k_\\mathrm{B}\\sum_i p_i \\, \\log \\, p_i,</math>\ni.e. in such a basis the density matrix is diagonal.\n\nVon Neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics with his work ''Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik''. He provided in this work a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of [[wave function collapse]] is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von Neumann or projective measurement). Using this concept, in conjunction with the [[density matrix]] he extended the classical concept of entropy into the quantum domain.\n\n=== Information theory ===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=I thought of calling it \"information\", but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it \"uncertainty\".

It was originally devised by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1948 to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. The definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities ''p<sub>i</sub> so that\n:<math>H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i) \\log p(x_i).</math>\n\nIn the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.<ref name=\"Perplexed\" />\n\nThe question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, U_0, \u039b_{ij}, t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/>). The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD).

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in [[statistical thermodynamics]] has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy ''E'' over ''N'' identical systems.\n[[Carath\u00e9odory]] linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn 1865, Clausius named the concept of {{mvar|S}}, \"the differential of a quantity which depends on the configuration of the system,\" ''[[wikt:entropy|entropy]]'' ({{lang|de|Entropie}}) after the Greek word for 'transformation'.<ref name=Gil399>{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |authorlink1=Charles Coulston Gillispie |title=The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill |url-access=registration |year=1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02350-6 |p=[https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill/page/399 399]}}</ref>  He gives \"transformational content\" ({{lang|de|Verwandlungsinhalt}}) as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" ({{lang|de|W\u00e4rme- und Werkinhalt}}) as the name of [[Internal energy|{{mvar|U}}]], but preferring the term ''entropy'' as a close parallel of the word ''energy'', as he found the concepts nearly \"analogous in their physical significance.\"<ref name=Gil399/> This term was formed by replacing the root of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}} ('work') by that of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae|\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae]]}} ('transformation').<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clausius |first1=Rudolf |date=1865 |title=Ueber verschiedene f\u00fcr die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie (Vorgetragen in der naturforsch.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

According to Carnot's principle, [[work (physics)|work]] can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed ({{math|''Q''<sub>H</sub>}}).

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle. The state function was called the internal energy and it became the [[first law of thermodynamics]].<ref name=\"Clausius1867\">{{cite book|author=Rudolf Clausius|title=The Mechanical Theory of Heat: With Its Applications to the Steam-engine and to the Physical Properties of Bodies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LIEAAAAYAAJ|year=1867|publisher=J.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"].

In a different basis set, the more general expression is\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\widehat{\\rho} \\log(\\widehat{\\rho})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{\\rho}</math> is the [[density matrix]], <math>\\operatorname{Tr}</math> is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and <math>\\log</math> is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

Each dark line on the graph represents constant pressure, and these form a mesh with light gray lines of constant volume. (Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, \u039b_{ij}, U_0, t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume).

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].

There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a peacock). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the seventh century before becoming a tool of the government.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Xiangsheng==\n[[Xiangsheng]] is a style of traditional Chinese comedic performance in the form of a monologue or dialogue.\n[[China|Chinese]] performers usually clap with the audience at the end of a performance; the return applause is a sign of appreciation to the audience.<ref>{{cite book |title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs |author1=Brown, Ju |author2=Brown, John |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston |year=2006 |page=55 |isbn=1-4196-4893-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3r-3YH3t45cC&pg=PA55}}</ref>\n\n==Modern Chinese theatre==\nModern Chinese theatre and drama has changed quite a lot compared to the past. The influences of the modern world affected the form of music/ theatre/ drama the Chinese were having. The rapid development of the country made theater not as important, as it started to pay focus on its economic environment, not its culture. Although some elderly Chinese try to protect and make the old Chinese theater tradition not fade out, but the fading out of the traditional Chinese is unavoidable. The current Chinese theater has been developed to a new form: people do not watch plays from theater, they watch it at homes on their TV.

Since the owners would invest in further training for these people, they did not need much knowledge and skills beforehand.

There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a peacock). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the seventh century before becoming a tool of the government.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Xiangsheng==\n[[Xiangsheng]] is a style of traditional Chinese comedic performance in the form of a monologue or dialogue.\n[[China|Chinese]] performers usually clap with the audience at the end of a performance; the return applause is a sign of appreciation to the audience.<ref>{{cite book |title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs |author1=Brown, Ju |author2=Brown, John |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston |year=2006 |page=55 |isbn=1-4196-4893-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3r-3YH3t45cC&pg=PA55}}</ref>\n\n==Modern Chinese theatre==\nModern Chinese theatre and drama has changed quite a lot compared to the past. The influences of the modern world affected the form of music/ theatre/ drama the Chinese were having. The rapid development of the country made theater not as important, as it started to pay focus on its economic environment, not its culture. Although some elderly Chinese try to protect and make the old Chinese theater tradition not fade out, but the fading out of the traditional Chinese is unavoidable. The current Chinese theater has been developed to a new form: people do not watch plays from theater, they watch it at homes on their TV. In addition to music theater, the modern world inspired new forms of drama, including what became known as the spoken drama ({{zh|s=\u8bdd\u5267|t=\u8a71\u5287|p=Hu\u00e0j\u00f9}}) of the Western stage.<ref>http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199920082/obo-9780199920082-0011.xml</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of theatres in China]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book|chapter=Early Chinese Plays and Theater|last=Dolby|first=William|title=Chinese Theatre: From Its Origins to the Present Day|url=https://archive.org/details/chinesetheater00coli|url-access=registration|editor-last=Mackerras|editor-first=Colin|editor-link=Colin Mackerras|editor2-last=Wichmann|editor2-first=Elizabeth|isbn=0-8248-0813-4|year=1983|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|ref={{harvid|Dolby}}}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Chinese Opera: Images and Stories|last=Siu|first=Wang-Ngai|last2=Lovrick|first2=Peter|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-7748-0592-7|ref={{harvid|Siu and Lovrick}}}}\n* {{cite book|title=Elite Theatre in Ming China, 1368\u20131644|last=Shen|first=Grant Guangren|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2005|isbn=0-415-34326-7|ref={{harvid|Shen}}}}\n* {{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Chinese Theater|last=Ye|first=Tan|year=2008|publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]]|isbn=978-0-8108-5514-4|ref={{harvid|Ye}}}}\n* Fong, Kuang-Yu and Kaplin, Stephen. \"Theatre on a Tabletop: Puppetry for Small Spaces\".

The relatively flat peninsula thus formed is four kilometres in length and two kilometres in width, and is joined to the main part of the [[North Island]] at its southern end. A motorway effectively cuts the peninsula off from the mainland and, with only one road in and out, the area has an almost island-like feel. Its population of about 12,474 (as of 2016)<ref name=\"population\"/> is closely matched by the population of [[Te Atat\u016b South]], the adjoining suburb.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Te Atat\u016b#History|l1=History of the Te Atat\u016b Area}}\n\nUntil the 1950s, Te Atat\u016b Peninsula was mostly rural. The construction of the north-western motorway lead to development on the peninsula.

There are also direct views of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]. \nIn the early 1980s, Emi Groot who moved there and decided that \"Te Atat\u016b Peninsula\" was more fitting, so proceeded to use \"Peninsula\" instead of \"North\".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\nThe name \"Te Atat\u016b Peninsula\" was officially adopted by the New Zealand Geographic Board on 5 May 1994<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gazetteer.linz.govt.nz/place/50901|title=NZGB Gazetteer {{!}} linz.govt.nz|website=gazetteer.linz.govt.nz|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>, and was formally adopted by the Waitakere Council in 1997.

The relatively flat peninsula thus formed is four kilometres in length and two kilometres in width, and is joined to the main part of the [[North Island]] at its southern end. A motorway effectively cuts the peninsula off from the mainland and, with only one road in and out, the area has an almost island-like feel. Its population of about 12,474 (as of 2016)<ref name=\"population\"/> is closely matched by the population of [[Te Atat\u016b South]], the adjoining suburb.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Te Atat\u016b#History|l1=History of the Te Atat\u016b Area}}\n\nUntil the 1950s, Te Atat\u016b Peninsula was mostly rural. The construction of the north-western motorway lead to development on the peninsula.
