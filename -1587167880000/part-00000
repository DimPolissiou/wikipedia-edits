The series takes place in a romanticized [[Stone Age]] setting and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are also their best friends). It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=May 12, 2014|last=VanDerWerff|first=Emily|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref> The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc, though five episodes during the second season (the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth) employed Hanna-Barbera regular [[Daws Butler]] while Blanc was incapacitated by a near-fatal car accident. Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air. But they also told him, 'Do you want to be known as the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air? The guy who took away a show so many kids love and so many parents love, too?'\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Brooks| first = Marla| title = The American family on television: A chronology of 121 shows, 1948\u20132004| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hyTuAAAAMAAJ| year = 2005| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-2074-2| page = 54 }}</ref>\n\nHenry Corden's voice became Fred's after Reed's death in 1977, starting with ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]''.<ref>\"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/28593-Flintstone_Christmas.html A Flintstone Christmas]\".

Since 2000, [[Jeff Bergman]], [[James Arnold Taylor]], and [[Scott Innes]] (performing both Fred and Barney for [[Toshiba]] commercials) have performed the voice of Fred. Since Mel Blanc's death in 1989, Barney has been voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Frank Welker]], and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Various additional character voices were created by [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]], [[Allan Melvin]], [[Janet Waldo]], Daws Butler, and [[Howard Morris]], among others.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Fred Flintstone]] \u2013 [[Alan Reed]] \n* [[Wilma Flintstone]]/[[Pebbles Flintstone]] \u2013 [[Jean Vander Pyl]]\n* [[Barney Rubble]] \u2013 [[Mel Blanc]]; [[Daws Butler]] (season 2; episodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 only)\n* [[Betty Rubble]] \u2013 [[Bea Benaderet]] (seasons 1\u20134); [[Gerry Johnson]] (seasons 5\u20136)\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]/Hoppy/Arnold \u2013 [[Don Messick]]\n* [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] \u2013 [[Mel Blanc]]\n* Mr. Slate \u2013 [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]\n* [[Pearl Slaghoople|Mrs. Slaghoople]] \u2013 [[Verna Felton]] and [[Janet Waldo]]\n* [[The Great Gazoo]] \u2013 [[Harvey Korman]]\n\n===Additional voice cast===\n* [[Howard Morris]]\n* [[Doug Young (actor)|Doug Young]]\n* [[Henry Corden]]\n* [[June Foray]]\n* [[Walker Edmiston]]\n* [[Ginny Tyler]] as Carhop\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Uncle Tex and Santa Claus\n* [[Allan Melvin]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Flintstones episodes}}\n{{:List of The Flintstones episodes}}\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Meet the Flintstones}}\nThe opening and closing credits theme during the first two seasons was called \"Rise and Shine\", a lively instrumental underscore accompanying Fred on his drive home from work.

The musical underscores were credited to [[Hoyt Curtin]] for the show's first five seasons; [[Ted Nichols]] took over in 1965 for the final season.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>  Many early episodes used the underscores composed for \"Top Cat\" and \"The Jetsons.\"   Episodes of the last two seasons used the underscore of \"Jonny Quest\" for the more adventurous stories.\n\n==History and production==\nThe idea of ''The Flintstones'' started after Hanna-Barbera produced ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' and ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]''. Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show.

And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''. After spending a brief period in development as ''The Gladstones'' (GLadstone<!-- not a typo; see the succeeding link --> being a Los Angeles [[Telephone exchange names|telephone exchange]] at the time),<ref name=\"DreamTeam\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237649.stm|title=The cartoon dream team|date=March 21, 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> Hanna-Barbera settled upon ''The Flintstones'', and the idea of the Flintstones having a child from the start was discarded, with Fred and Wilma starting out as a childless couple. However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018. Online, the series was made available on the [[In2TV]] service beginning in 2006, then the online version of [[Kids' WB]] until that service was discontinued in 2015. As of 2017, full episodes are only available in the U.S. on Boomerang's subscription [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]] service, with select clips made available on the official [[YouTube]] account tied to the revamped Kids' WB website. In 2019, [[MeTV]] acquired rerun rights to the series, returning the show to broadcast television for the first time in over 20 years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/metv-grabs-the-flintstones |title = MeTV Grabs 'The Flintstones'}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe night after ''The Flintstones'' premiered, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine called it \"a pen and ink disaster\",<ref>Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera-1997</ref> and the series was among many that debuted in a \"[[Television and the Public Interest|vast wasteland]]\" of a [[1960\u201361 United States network television schedule|1960\u201361 television season]] considered one of the worst in television history up to that point.<ref>https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2012/06/vast-wasteland/</ref> As late as the 1980s, highbrow critics derided the show's limited animation and derivative plots.<ref>For example, an episode of the 1987 series ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'' (\"Don't Touch That Dial!\") has [[Mighty Mouse|the title character]] mocking ''The Flintstones'', which appears in a satirical crossover with ''[[The Jetsons]]'', as stupid.</ref> Despite the mixed critical reviews at first, ''The Flintstones'' has generally been considered a television classic and was rerun continuously for five decades after its end. In 1961, ''The Flintstones'' became the first animated series to be nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]], but lost out to ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''.

It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V.

Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air.

Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''.

However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018.

He was the second son of [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]], and his mother was [[Queen Munjeong]], who was Jungjong's third queen.\n\nHe became king in 1545 at the age of 12 following the death of his half-brother, [[Injong of Joseon|Injong]]. Since he was too young to rule the kingdom, Queen Munjeong governed the nation in his name.\n\n==Biography==\n===Political factions===\nThere were two political factions at the time Myeongjong came to power; Greater Yun, headed by [[Yun Im]], [[Injong of Joseon|Injong]]'s maternal uncle,<ref>Yun Im is the older brother of Queen Janggyeong (Injong's mother).</ref> and Lesser Yun, headed by Myeongjong's maternal uncles, [[Yun Won-hyeong]] and Yun Wonro.<ref>They were Queen Munjeong's older brother.</ref> (Yun Im and Yun Brothers were close relatives by that period's standards - Yun Im's great-grandfather was older brother of Yun Brothers' great-great-grandfather.)  Greater Yun took power in 1544, when Injong succeeded Jungjong; but they failed to wipe out their opposition, since [[Queen Munjeong]] protected the Lesser Yun faction and other opposition officials.\n\nAfter the death of Injong in 1545, Lesser Yun replaced Greater Yun as the majority in the royal court and brutally ousted their adversaries in the [[Korean Literati Purges|Fourth Literati Purge of 1545]]. Yun Im was executed, as were many of his followers.\n\n===Rise of Yun Won-hyeong===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Lesser Yun faction continued to attack their opposition. In 1546, Yun Won-hyeong impeached his older brother, Yun Won-ro, who was executed a few days later along with his followers. Facing no opposition from the government, Yun Won-hyeong became Minister of Personnel \uc774\uc870\ud310\uc11c in 1548, Left State Councilor in 1551 and ultimately [[Yeonguijeong|Chief State Councilor]] \uc601\uc758\uc815  in 1563.\n\nDespite Yun Won-hyeong's violent rule, [[Queen Munjeong]] was an effective administrator, distributing to the common people land formerly owned by the nobility.

He was the second son of [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]], and his mother was [[Queen Munjeong]], who was Jungjong's third queen.\n\nHe became king in 1545 at the age of 12 following the death of his half-brother, [[Injong of Joseon|Injong]]. Since he was too young to rule the kingdom, Queen Munjeong governed the nation in his name.\n\n==Biography==\n===Political factions===\nThere were two political factions at the time Myeongjong came to power; Greater Yun, headed by [[Yun Im]], [[Injong of Joseon|Injong]]'s maternal uncle,<ref>Yun Im is the older brother of Queen Janggyeong (Injong's mother).</ref> and Lesser Yun, headed by Myeongjong's maternal uncles, [[Yun Won-hyeong]] and Yun Wonro.<ref>They were Queen Munjeong's older brother.</ref> (Yun Im and Yun Brothers were close relatives by that period's standards - Yun Im's great-grandfather was older brother of Yun Brothers' great-great-grandfather.)  Greater Yun took power in 1544, when Injong succeeded Jungjong; but they failed to wipe out their opposition, since [[Queen Munjeong]] protected the Lesser Yun faction and other opposition officials.\n\nAfter the death of Injong in 1545, Lesser Yun replaced Greater Yun as the majority in the royal court and brutally ousted their adversaries in the [[Korean Literati Purges|Fourth Literati Purge of 1545]]. Yun Im was executed, as were many of his followers.\n\n===Rise of Yun Won-hyeong===\n{{unrferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Lesser Yun faction continued to attack their opposition. In 1546, Yun Won-hyeong impeached his older brother, Yun Won-ro, who was executed a few days later along with his followers. Facing no opposition from the government, Yun Won-hyeong became Minister of Personnel \uc774\uc870\ud310\uc11c in 1548, Left State Councilor in 1551 and ultimately [[Yeonguijeong|Chief State Councilor]] \uc601\uc758\uc815  in 1563.\n\nDespite Yun Won-hyeong's violent rule, [[Queen Munjeong]] was an effective administrator, distributing to the common people land formerly owned by the nobility. However, she held on to rule even after the king reached his majority at the age of 20.\n\n===Death of Queen Munjeong===\nAfter the death of Queen Munjeong in 1565, the king decided to rule the kingdom by himself and had his uncle Yun Won-hyeong put to death, along with his second wife<ref>Originally his concubine, [[Chung Nanjung]] had the first wife, Lady Kim, poisoned to death.</ref> Jeong Nan-jeong, who also rose to power due to her close friendship and being second sister-in-law to Queen Munjeong.<ref>She became a dictator; the real power behind the veil of Queen Munjeong's regency.</ref><ref>Actually, Jeong Nan-jeong committed suicide as a domino effect of misfortunes: Queen Munjeong's death, and her loss of control of the government.</ref> Yun Won-hyeong allowed corruption to flourish in the government; while the kingdom was unstable, [[Jurchens]], [[Japan]]ese, and rebellious troops rampaged at will and threatened the government itself.

He had avery large beard. He loved playing the drums with beat boxes. He played an important role in the establishment of the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the first permanent [[English colonial empire|English settlement]] in America in the early 17th century. He was a leader of the [[Virginia Colony]] between September 1608 and August 1609, and he led an exploration along the rivers of Virginia and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], during which he became the first English explorer to map the Chesapeake Bay area. Later, he explored and mapped the coast of New England. He was knighted for his services to [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], Prince of [[Transylvania]], and his friend [[M\u00f3zes Sz\u00e9kely]].\n\nChocolate was his favorite stress food and he was known for overeating. He owned a turkey named Hut due to his favorite toy \"Hutman\". Jamestown was established in 1607, and Smith trained the first settlers to farm and work, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated, \"[[He who does not work, neither shall he eat|He that will not work, shall not eat]]\", alluding to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/2 Thessalonians#3:10|2 Thessalonians 3:10]].<ref name=SnellCh4>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4}}</ref> Harsh weather, lack of food and water, the surrounding swampy wilderness, and Indian attacks almost destroyed the colony. With Smith's leadership, however, Jamestown survived and eventually flourished. Smith was forced to return to England after being injured by an accidental explosion of gunpowder in a canoe.\n\nJohn Smith fell in love with Pocahontus and he called her Pokey in his free time. Smith's books and maps were important in encouraging and supporting English colonization of the [[New World]]. He named the region of New England and noted: \"Here every man may be master and owner of his owne labour and land.&nbsp;... If he have nothing but his hands, he may&nbsp;... by industries quickly grow rich.\"<ref>David Cressy (1987). \"Coming Over: Migration and Communication Between England and New England in the Seventeenth Century\". p. 99.

He served as a mercenary in the army of [[Henry IV of France]] against the Spaniards, fighting for [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch independence]] from King [[Philip II of Spain]]. He then went to the Mediterranean where he engaged in trade and piracy, and later fought against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the [[Long Turkish War]]. He was promoted to a cavalry captain while fighting for the Austrian [[Habsburgs]] in Hungary in the campaign of [[Michael the Brave]] in 1600 and 1601.

The search for a suitable site ended on 14 May 1607 when Captain [[Edward Maria Wingfield]], president of the council, chose the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] site as the location for the colony. After the four-month ocean trip, their food stores were sufficient only for each to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day, and someone died almost every day due to swampy conditions and widespread disease.

Smith feared for his life, but he was eventually released without harm and later attributed this in part to the chief's daughter [[Pocahontas]] who threw herself across his body:<ref>Smith, ''Generall Historie''</ref> \"at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown\".<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Caleb|title=John Smith's Letter to Queen Anne regarding Pocahontas|url=http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|website=Mayflower Web Pages|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616092056/http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|archivedate=June 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\n He LOVES her. In 1860, Boston businessman and historian Charles Deane was the first scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] to treat Pocahontas with dignity.<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\"/> The time gap in publishing his story raises the possibility that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there was no reason for him to write down the story until this point.<ref>Lemay, J. A. Leo. ''Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?'' Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1992, p. 25. Lemay's other arguments in favour of Smith are summarized in Birchfield, [http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html 'Did Pocahontas'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626175132/http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html |date=26 June 2012 }}.</ref>\n\n[[Henry Brooks Adams]] attempted to debunk Smith's claims of heroism. He said that Smith's recounting of the story of Pocahontas had been progressively embellished, made up of \"falsehoods of an effrontery seldom equaled in modern times\".

As the colonists expanded farther, some of the tribes felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.\n\nIn 1608, Pocahontas is said to have saved Smith a second time. Chief Powhatan invited Smith and some other colonists to Werowocomoco on friendly terms, but Pocahontas came to the hut where they were staying and warned them that Powhatan was planning to kill them. They stayed on their guard and the attack never came.<ref>Symonds, ''Proceedings'', pp. 251\u20132; Smith, ''Generall Historie'', pp. 198\u20139, 259.</ref> Also in 1608, Polish craftsmen were brought to the colony to help it develop.

These explorations are commemorated in the [[Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail]], established in 2006. In his absence, Smith left his friend [[Matthew Scrivener]] as governor in his place, a young gentleman adventurer from Sibton [[Suffolk]] who was related by marriage to the Wingfield family, but he was not capable of leading the people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===Influx of settlers=== He had an influx.\nSome of the settlers eventually wanted Smith to abandon Jamestown, but he refused. Some deserted to the Indian villages, but Powhatan's people also followed Smith's law of \"he who works not, eats not\". This lasted \"till they were near starved indeed\", in Smith's words, and they returned home.<ref name=SnellCh4 />\n\nIn the spring of 1609, Jamestown was beginning to prosper, with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, they experienced an infestation of rats, along with dampness which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n\nThe weeks-long emergency was relieved by the arrival of an unexpected ship captained by [[Samuel Argall]]. He had items of food and wine which Smith bought on credit. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company of London was being reorganized and was [[Jamestown supply missions|sending more supplies and settlers]] to Jamestown, along with [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De la Warr]] to become the new governor.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n[[File:John Smith taking the King of Pamavnkee prisoner - etching.jpg|thumb|right|John Smith taking the King of Pamunkey prisoner (1624 history)]]\n\nIn a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Virginia Company treasurer [[Thomas Smythe|Sir Thomas Smith]] arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbour, and the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' wrecked on the Bermuda Islands with flotilla admiral Sir [[George Somers]] aboard. They finally made their way to Jamestown in May 1610 after building the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' to take most of the passengers and crew of the ''Sea Venture'' off Bermuda, with the new governor [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] on board.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4|p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1609, Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the ''Sea Venture''. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown.<ref name=\"SnellCh4\" /> Somers returned to Bermuda with the ''Patience'' to gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The ''Patience'' then sailed for England instead of Virginia, captained by his nephew.\n\nSmith was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion in his canoe, and he sailed to England for treatment in mid-October 1609. He never returned to Virginia.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 surviving that winter out of 500 residents. The Virginia Company, however, continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, Governors Gates and Sir [[Thomas Dale]] continued to keep strict discipline, with Sir Thomas Smith in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4|pp=93\u201394}}</ref>\n\n==New England== Toodaloo\n[[File:New England (1).jpg|thumb|right|New England (1)|Smith's 1616 Map of New England]]\nIn 1614, Smith returned to America in a voyage to the coasts of [[Maine]] and [[Massachusetts Bay]].

He remained in England for the rest of his life.\n\nSmith compared his experiences in Virginia with his observations of New England and offered a theory of why some English colonial projects had failed. He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control.

Most of the skepticism is a result of the differences between his narratives. His earliest text is ''A True Relation of Virginia'', which was submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second was ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', published in 1624. Publishing letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that they must go \"directly to the company\" because no one was to \"write any letter of anything that may discourage others\". Smith violated this regulation by first publishing ''A True Relation'' as an unknown author.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=40}} Leo Lemay theorizes that the editor of ''The Generall Historie'' might have cut out \"references to the Indians' hostility, to bickering among the leaders of Virginia Company, and to the early supposed mutiny\" of Smith on the voyage to Virginia.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' by Capt. John Smith, 1624]] \n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|Smith's 1624 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) showing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] and related fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]]]\n\nThe Pocahontas episode is subject to the most scrutiny by critics, for it does not appear in ''A True Relation'' but does in ''The Generall Historie''. According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith's credibility is the fact that \"no one in Smith's day ever expressed doubt\" concerning the story's veracity, and many people who would have known the truth \"were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen\", including Pocahontas herself.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=51}}\n\nSmith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World. His relationship with the Powhatan tribe was an important factor in preserving the Jamestown colony from sharing the fate of the [[Roanoke colony]].\n\n<blockquote>Realizing that the very existence of the colony depended on peace, he never thought of trying to exterminate the natives. Only after his departure were there bitter wars and massacres, the natural results of a more hostile policy. In his writings, Smith reveals the attitudes behind his actions.<ref>Randel, William. \"Captain John Smith's Attitudes toward the Indians\". The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1939): 218\u2013229. p. 219</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Promoter of American colonization===\n{{one source|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Smith's map of Virginia from ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', 1624]]\nOne of Smith's main incentives in writing about his New World experiences and observances was to promote English colonization. Lemay claims that many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but he argues that Smith was not one to exaggerate the facts. He argues that Smith was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that there was abundant monetary opportunity in the form of industry.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=80}} Lemay argues that no motive except wealth would attract potential colonists away from \"their ease and humours at home\".<ref>Smith, John. \"A Description of New England\". ''The Heath Anthology of American Literature''. Ed. Paul Lauter. 6th Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 [1616]. p. 282</ref> \"Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=91}}\n\nSmith insists, however, that only hard workers would be able to reap the benefits of wealth which the New World afforded. He did not understate the dangers and toil associated with colonization. He declared that only those with a strong work ethic would be able to \"live and succeed in America\" in the face of such dangers.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=81}}\n\n===Additional works===\n''A Map of Virginia'' is focused centrally on the observations that Smith made about the Native Americans, particularly regarding their religion and government. This specific focus would have been Smith's way of adapting to the New World by assimilating the best parts of their culture and incorporating them into the colony. ''A Map of Virginia'' was not just a pamphlet discussing the observations that Smith made, but also a map which Smith had drawn himself, to help make the Americas seem more domestic. As Lemay remarks, \"maps tamed the unknown, reduced it to civilisation and harnessed it for Western consciousness,\" promoting Smith's central theme of encouraging the settlement of America.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=42}} Many \"naysayers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century\" have made the argument that Smith's maps were not reliable because he \"lacked a formal education in cartography\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}} That allegation, however, was proved false by the fact that Smith was a \"master in his chosen fields of experience\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}}\n\n''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105044/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_civ/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_2/john_smith.html The Proceedings of the English Colony In Virginia]'' was a compilation of other writings; it narrates the colony's history from December 1609 to the summer of 1610, and Smith left the colony in October 1609 due to a gunpowder accident.

He played an important role in the establishment of the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the first permanent [[English colonial empire|English settlement]] in America in the early 17th century. He was a leader of the [[Virginia Colony]] between September 1608 and August 1609, and he led an exploration along the rivers of Virginia and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], during which he became the first English explorer to map the Chesapeake Bay area. Later, he explored and mapped the coast of New England. He was knighted for his services to [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], Prince of [[Transylvania]], and his friend [[M\u00f3zes Sz\u00e9kely]].\n\nJamestown was established in 1607, and Smith trained the first settlers to farm and work, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated, \"[[He who does not work, neither shall he eat|He that will not work, shall not eat]]\", alluding to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/2 Thessalonians#3:10|2 Thessalonians 3:10]].<ref name=SnellCh4>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4}}</ref> Harsh weather, lack of food and water, the surrounding swampy wilderness, and Indian attacks almost destroyed the colony. With Smith's leadership, however, Jamestown survived and eventually flourished. Smith was forced to return to England after being injured by an accidental explosion of gunpowder in a canoe.\n\nSmith's books and maps were important in encouraging and supporting English colonization of the [[New World]]. He named the region of New England and noted: \"Here every man may be master and owner of his owne labour and land.&nbsp;... If he have nothing but his hands, he may&nbsp;... by industries quickly grow rich.\"<ref>David Cressy (1987). \"Coming Over: Migration and Communication Between England and New England in the Seventeenth Century\". p. 99.

The village was on the north shore of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] about 15 miles north of Jamestown and 25 miles downstream from where the river forms from the [[Pamunkey River]] and the [[Mattaponi River]] at [[West Point, Virginia]]. Smith feared for his life, but he was eventually released without harm and later attributed this in part to the chief's daughter [[Pocahontas]] who threw herself across his body:<ref>Smith, ''Generall Historie''</ref> \"at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown\".<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Caleb|title=John Smith's Letter to Queen Anne regarding Pocahontas|url=http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|website=Mayflower Web Pages|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616092056/http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|archivedate=June 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, Boston businessman and historian Charles Deane was the first scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] to treat Pocahontas with dignity.<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\"/> The time gap in publishing his story raises the possibility that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there was no reason for him to write down the story until this point.<ref>Lemay, J. A. Leo. ''Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?'' Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1992, p. 25. Lemay's other arguments in favour of Smith are summarized in Birchfield, [http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html 'Did Pocahontas'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626175132/http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html |date=26 June 2012 }}.</ref>\n\n[[Henry Brooks Adams]] attempted to debunk Smith's claims of heroism. He said that Smith's recounting of the story of Pocahontas had been progressively embellished, made up of \"falsehoods of an effrontery seldom equaled in modern times\". There is consensus among historians that Smith tended to exaggerate, but his account is consistent with the basic facts of his life.<ref>[[Jill Lepore|Lepore, Jill]], \"The New Yorker\", 2 April 2007, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Some have suggested that Smith believed that he had been rescued, when he had in fact been involved in a ritual intended to symbolize his death and rebirth as a member of the tribe.<ref>Gleach, ''Powhatan's World'', pp. 118\u201321.; Kupperman, ''Indians and English'', pp. 114, 174.</ref><ref>{{Cite book | author=Horwitz, Tony | title=A Voyage Long and Strange: Rediscovering the New World | publisher=Henry Holt and Co. | isbn=978-0-8050-7603-5 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/voyagelongstrang00horw/page/336 336] | url=https://archive.org/details/voyagelongstrang00horw/page/336 | date=29 April 2008 }}</ref> David A.

As the colonists expanded farther, some of the tribes felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.\n\nIn 1608, Pocahontas is said to have saved Smith a second time. Chief Powhatan invited Smith and some other colonists to Werowocomoco on friendly terms, but Pocahontas came to the hut where they were staying and warned them that Powhatan was planning to kill them. They stayed on their guard and the attack never came.<ref>Symonds, ''Proceedings'', pp. 251\u20132; Smith, ''Generall Historie'', pp. 198\u20139, 259.</ref> Also in 1608, Polish craftsmen were brought to the colony to help it develop.

These explorations are commemorated in the [[Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail]], established in 2006. In his absence, Smith left his friend [[Matthew Scrivener]] as governor in his place, a young gentleman adventurer from Sibton [[Suffolk]] who was related by marriage to the Wingfield family, but he was not capable of leading the people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===Influx of settlers===\nSome of the settlers eventually wanted Smith to abandon Jamestown, but he refused. Some deserted to the Indian villages, but Powhatan's people also followed Smith's law of \"he who works not, eats not\". This lasted \"till they were near starved indeed\", in Smith's words, and they returned home.<ref name=SnellCh4 />\n\nIn the spring of 1609, Jamestown was beginning to prosper, with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, they experienced an infestation of rats, along with dampness which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n\nThe weeks-long emergency was relieved by the arrival of an unexpected ship captained by [[Samuel Argall]]. He had items of food and wine which Smith bought on credit. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company of London was being reorganized and was [[Jamestown supply missions|sending more supplies and settlers]] to Jamestown, along with [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De la Warr]] to become the new governor.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n[[File:John Smith taking the King of Pamavnkee prisoner - etching.jpg|thumb|right|John Smith taking the King of Pamunkey prisoner (1624 history)]]\n\nIn a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Virginia Company treasurer [[Thomas Smythe|Sir Thomas Smith]] arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbour, and the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' wrecked on the Bermuda Islands with flotilla admiral Sir [[George Somers]] aboard. They finally made their way to Jamestown in May 1610 after building the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' to take most of the passengers and crew of the ''Sea Venture'' off Bermuda, with the new governor [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] on board.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4|p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1609, Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the ''Sea Venture''. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown.<ref name=\"SnellCh4\" /> Somers returned to Bermuda with the ''Patience'' to gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The ''Patience'' then sailed for England instead of Virginia, captained by his nephew.\n\nSmith was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion in his canoe, and he sailed to England for treatment in mid-October 1609. He never returned to Virginia.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 surviving that winter out of 500 residents. The Virginia Company, however, continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, Governors Gates and Sir [[Thomas Dale]] continued to keep strict discipline, with Sir Thomas Smith in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4|pp=93\u201394}}</ref>\n\n==New England==\n[[File:New England (1).jpg|thumb|right|New England (1)|Smith's 1616 Map of New England]]\nIn 1614, Smith returned to America in a voyage to the coasts of [[Maine]] and [[Massachusetts Bay]].

He remained in England for the rest of his life.\n\nSmith compared his experiences in Virginia with his observations of New England and offered a theory of why some English colonial projects had failed. He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control.

Most of the skepticism is a result of the differences between his narratives. His earliest text is ''A True Relation of Virginia'', which was submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second was ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', published in 1624. Publishing letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that they must go \"directly to the company\" because no one was to \"write any letter of anything that may discourage others\". Smith violated this regulation by first publishing ''A True Relation'' as an unknown author.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=40}} Leo Lemay theorizes that the editor of ''The Generall Historie'' might have cut out \"references to the Indians' hostility, to bickering among the leaders of Virginia Company, and to the early supposed mutiny\" of Smith on the voyage to Virginia.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' by Capt. John Smith, 1624]] \n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|Smith's 1624 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) showing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] and related fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]]]\n\nThe Pocahontas episode is subject to the most scrutiny by critics, for it does not appear in ''A True Relation'' but does in ''The Generall Historie''. According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith's credibility is the fact that \"no one in Smith's day ever expressed doubt\" concerning the story's veracity, and many people who would have known the truth \"were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen\", including Pocahontas herself.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=51}}\n\nSmith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World. His relationship with the Powhatan tribe was an important factor in preserving the Jamestown colony from sharing the fate of the [[Roanoke colony]].\n\n<blockquote>Realizing that the very existence of the colony depended on peace, he never thought of trying to exterminate the natives. Only after his departure were there bitter wars and massacres, the natural results of a more hostile policy. In his writings, Smith reveals the attitudes behind his actions.<ref>Randel, William. \"Captain John Smith's Attitudes toward the Indians\". The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1939): 218\u2013229. p. 219</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Promoter of American colonization===\n{{one source|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Smith's map of Virginia from ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', 1624]]\nOne of Smith's main incentives in writing about his New World experiences and observances was to promote English colonization. Lemay claims that many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but he argues that Smith was not one to exaggerate the facts. He argues that Smith was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that there was abundant monetary opportunity in the form of industry.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=80}} Lemay argues that no motive except wealth would attract potential colonists away from \"their ease and humours at home\".<ref>Smith, John. \"A Description of New England\". ''The Heath Anthology of American Literature''. Ed. Paul Lauter. 6th Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 [1616]. p. 282</ref> \"Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=91}}\n\nSmith insists, however, that only hard workers would be able to reap the benefits of wealth which the New World afforded. He did not understate the dangers and toil associated with colonization. He declared that only those with a strong work ethic would be able to \"live and succeed in America\" in the face of such dangers.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=81}}\n\n===Additional works===\n''A Map of Virginia'' is focused centrally on the observations that Smith made about the Native Americans, particularly regarding their religion and government. This specific focus would have been Smith's way of adapting to the New World by assimilating the best parts of their culture and incorporating them into the colony. ''A Map of Virginia'' was not just a pamphlet discussing the observations that Smith made, but also a map which Smith had drawn himself, to help make the Americas seem more domestic. As Lemay remarks, \"maps tamed the unknown, reduced it to civilisation and harnessed it for Western consciousness,\" promoting Smith's central theme of encouraging the settlement of America.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=42}} Many \"naysayers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century\" have made the argument that Smith's maps were not reliable because he \"lacked a formal education in cartography\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}} That allegation, however, was proved false by the fact that Smith was a \"master in his chosen fields of experience\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}}\n\n''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105044/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_civ/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_2/john_smith.html The Proceedings of the English Colony In Virginia]'' was a compilation of other writings; it narrates the colony's history from December 1609 to the summer of 1610, and Smith left the colony in October 1609 due to a gunpowder accident.

Adams was born ten years after [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]], and his writing is more developmental and directionalized, containing climaxes and other elements of [[Romanticism]]. Comparing ''Shaker Loops'' to the minimalist composer [[Terry Riley]]'s piece ''[[In C]]'', Adams remarked:\n\n{{quote|rather than set up small engines of motivic materials and let them run free in a kind of random play of counterpoint, I used the fabric of continually repeating cells to forge large architectonic shapes, creating a web of activity that, even within the course of a single movement, was more detailed, more varied, and knew both light and dark, serenity and turbulence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earbox.com/W-harmonium.html |title=John Adams on Harmonium |publisher=Earbox.xom |accessdate=September 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117202009/http://www.earbox.com/W-harmonium.html |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nMany of Adams's ideas in composition are a reaction to the philosophy of [[serialism]] and its depictions of \"the composer as scientist.\"<ref>Thomas May, pp. 7\u201310.</ref> The [[Darmstadt school]] of [[twelve tone]] composition was dominant during the time that Adams was receiving his college education, and he compared class to a \"mausoleum where we would sit and count tone-rows in [[Anton Webern|Webern]].\"<ref>Michael Broyles, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9-xeF0QYhgC ''Mavericks and other traditions in American music''], Yale University Press, 2004; {{ISBN|0-300-10045-0|978-0-300-10045-7}} pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nAdams experienced a musical epiphany after reading [[John Cage]]'s book ''Silence'' (1973), which he claimed \"dropped into [his] psyche like a time bomb.\"<ref>K. Robert Schwarz, ''Minimalists'', p. 175.</ref> Cage posed fundamental questions about what music was, and regarded all types of sounds as viable sources of music. This perspective offered to Adams a liberating alternative to the rule-based techniques of serialism. At this point Adams began to experiment with [[electronic music]], and his experiences are reflected in the writing of ''Phrygian Gates'' (1977\u201378), in which the constant shifting between modules in [[Lydian mode]] and [[Phrygian mode]] refers to activating [[electronic gate]]s rather than architectural ones. Adams explained that working with synthesizers caused a \"diatonic conversion,\" a reversion to the belief that [[tonality]] was a force of nature.<ref>Elliott Schwartz, Daniel Godfrey [https://books.google.com/books?id=uGQXAQAAIAAJ ''Music since 1945: issues, materials, and literature''], Schirmer Books, 1993, pp. 336; {{ISBN|0-02-873040-2|978-0-02-873040-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Phrygian Gates, mm 21-40.JPG|thumb|John Adams, ''Phrygian Gates, mm 21\u201340 (1977)]]\n\nSome of Adams's compositions are an amalgamation of different styles. One example is ''Grand Pianola Music (1981\u201382)'', a humorous piece that purposely draws its content from musical cliches. In ''The Dharma at Big Sur,'' Adams draws from literary texts such as Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder and Henry Miller to illustrate the California landscape. Adams professes his love of other genres other than classical music; his parents were jazz musicians, and he has also listened to rock music, albeit only passively. Adams once claimed that originality wasn't an urgent concern for him the way it was necessary for the minimalists, and compared his position to that of [[Gustav Mahler]], [[J. S. Bach]], and [[Johannes Brahms]], who \"were standing at the end of an era and were embracing all of the evolutions that occurred over the previous thirty to fifty years.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwarz|first1=K.

The pulse was best known from [[Terry Riley]]'s early composition ''[[In C]]'', and slowly more and more composers used it as a common practice. Jonathan Bernard highlighted this adoption by comparing ''[[Phrygian Gates]]'', written in 1977, and ''Fearful Symmetries'' written eleven years later in 1988.<ref>Jonathan W.

III \"Toccare\"====\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Adams started to add a new character to his music, something he called \"the Trickster.\" The Trickster allowed Adams to use the repetitive style and rhythmic drive of minimalism, yet poke fun at it at the same time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stayton |first=Richard |title=The Trickster of Modern Music : Composer John Adams Keeps Reinventing Himself, to Wilder and Wilder Applause |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 16, 1991 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-16/magazine/tm-1335_1_composer-john-adams |accessdate=July 31, 2016}}</ref> When Adams commented on his own characterization of particular minimalist music, he stated that he went joyriding on \"those Great Prairies of non-event.\"<ref>Heisinger, Brent.

Adams was born ten years after [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]], and his writing is more developmental and directionalized, containing climaxes and other elements of [[Romanticism]]. Comparing ''Shaker Loops'' to the minimalist composer [[Terry Riley]]'s piece ''[[In C]]'', Adams remarked:\n\n{{quote|rather than set up small engines of motivic materials and let them run free in a kind of random play of counterpoint, I used the fabric of continually repeating cells to forge large architectonic shapes, creating a web of activity that, even within the course of a single movement, was more detailed, more varied, and knew both light and dark, serenity and turbulence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earbox.com/W-harmonium.html |title=John Adams on Harmonium |publisher=Earbox.xom |accessdate=September 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117202009/http://www.earbox.com/W-harmonium.html |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nMany of Adams's ideas in composition are a reaction to the philosophy of [[serialism]] and its depictions of \"the composer as scientist.\"<ref>Thomas May, pp. 7\u201310.</ref> The [[Darmstadt school]] of [[twelve tone]] composition was dominant during the time that Adams was receiving his college education, and he compared class to a \"mausoleum where we would sit and count tone-rows in [[Anton Webern|Webern]].\"<ref>Michael Broyles, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9-xeF0QYhgC ''Mavericks and other traditions in American music''], Yale University Press, 2004; {{ISBN|0-300-10045-0|978-0-300-10045-7}} pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nAdams experienced a musical epiphany after reading [[John Cage]]'s book ''Silence'' (1973), which he claimed \"dropped into [his] psyche like a time bomb.\"<ref>K. Robert Schwarz, ''Minimalists'', p. 175.</ref> Cage posed fundamental questions about what music was, and regarded all types of sounds as viable sources of music. This perspective offered to Adams a liberating alternative to the rule-based techniques of serialism. At this point Adams began to experiment with [[electronic music]], and his experiences are reflected in the writing of ''Phrygian Gates'' (1977\u201378), in which the constant shifting between modules in [[Lydian mode]] and [[Phrygian mode]] refers to activating [[electronic gate]]s rather than architectural ones. Adams explained that working with synthesizers caused a \"diatonic conversion,\" a reversion to the belief that [[tonality]] was a force of nature.<ref>Elliott Schwartz, Daniel Godfrey [https://books.google.com/books?id=uGQXAQAAIAAJ ''Music since 1945: issues, materials, and literature''], Schirmer Books, 1993, pp. 336; {{ISBN|0-02-873040-2|978-0-02-873040-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Phrygian Gates, mm 21-40.JPG|thumb|John Adams, ''Phrygian Gates, mm 21\u201340 (1977)]]\n\nSome of Adams's compositions are an amalgamation of different styles. One example is ''Grand Pianola Music (1981\u201382)'', a humorous piece that purposely draws its content from musical cliches. In ''The Dharma at Big Sur,'' Adams draws from literary texts such as Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder and Henry Miller to illustrate the California landscape. Adams professes his love of other genres other than classical music; his parents were jazz musicians, and he has also listened to rock music, albeit only passively. Adams once claimed that originality wasn't an urgent concern for him the way it was necessary for the minimalists, and compared his position to that of [[Gustav Mahler]], [[J. S. Bach]], and [[Johannes Brahms]], who \"were standing at the end of an era and were embracing all of the evolutions that occurred over the previous thirty to fifty years.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwarz|first1=K.

The pulse was best known from [[Terry Riley]]'s early composition ''[[In C]]'', and slowly more and more composers used it as a common practice. Jonathan Bernard highlighted this adoption by comparing ''[[Phrygian Gates]]'', written in 1977, and ''Fearful Symmetries'' written eleven years later in 1988.<ref>Jonathan W.

III \"Toccare\"====\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Adams started to add a new character to his music, something he called \"the Trickster.\" The Trickster allowed Adams to use the repetitive style and rhythmic drive of minimalism, yet poke fun at it at the same time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stayton |first=Richard |title=The Trickster of Modern Music : Composer John Adams Keeps Reinventing Himself, to Wilder and Wilder Applause |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 16, 1991 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-16/magazine/tm-1335_1_composer-john-adams |accessdate=July 31, 2016}}</ref> When Adams commented on his own characterization of particular minimalist music, he stated that he went joyriding on \"those Great Prairies of non-event.\"<ref>Heisinger, Brent.
