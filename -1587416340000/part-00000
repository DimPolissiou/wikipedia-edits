A [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;4 hurricane]] upon [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in Texas, it was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the United States in three decades. Throughout its eight-day trek across the [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]], the hurricane caused 37&nbsp;fatalities and inflicted $11.8&nbsp;million in damage.{{#tag:ref|All monetary values are in 1916&nbsp;[[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group=nb}}\n\nWeather observations were limited for most of the storm's history, so much of its evolution has been inferred from scant data analyzed by the [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project]] in 2008. The precursor disturbance organized into a small [[tropical storm]] by August&nbsp;12, shortly before crossing the [[Lesser Antilles]] into the Caribbean Sea. The storm skirted the southern coast of Jamaica as a hurricane on August&nbsp;15, killing 17&nbsp;people. No banana plantation was left unscathed by the hours-long onslaught of strong winds. Coconut and cocoa trees also sustained severe losses. The southern [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]] saw the severest effects, incurring extensive damage to crops and buildings; damage in Jamaica amounted to $10&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|10|1916|r=0}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}). The storm then traversed the [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] into the Gulf of Mexico and intensified further into the equivalent of a [[major hurricane]] on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]].{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a storm that ranks as Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale]].<ref name=BASIC>{{cite book|last1=Goldenburg|first1=Stan|chapter=A3) What is a super-typhoon?

Buildings were razed at many coastal cities, with the worst impacts felt in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] and surrounding communities. Beachfront structures were destroyed by a {{convert|9.2|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[storm surge]]. Strong gusts and heavy rainfall spread farther inland across mainly rural sectors of South Texas, damaging towns and their outlying agricultural districts alike. Railroads and other public utilities were disrupted across the region, with widespread [[power outage]]s. Eight locations set 24-hour rainfall records; among them was [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]], which recorded the storm's rainfall maximum with {{cvt|6|in|mm}} of precipitation. The deluge wrought havoc on military camps along the U.S.-[[Mexico]] border, forcing 30,000&nbsp;garrisoned militiamen to evacuate. Aggregate property damage across Texas reached $1.8&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1.8|1916|r=0}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), and 20&nbsp;people were killed.

Throughout its eight-day trek across the [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]], the hurricane caused 37&nbsp;fatalities and inflicted $11.8&nbsp;million in damage.{{#tag:ref|All monetary values are in 1916&nbsp;[[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group=nb}}\n\nWeather observations were limited for most of the storm's history, so much of its evolution has been inferred from scant data analyzed by the [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project]] in 2008. The precursor disturbance organized into a small [[tropical storm]] by August&nbsp;12, shortly before crossing the [[Lesser Antilles]] into the Caribbean Sea. The storm skirted the southern coast of Jamaica as a hurricane on August&nbsp;15, killing 17&nbsp;people. No banana plantation was left unscathed by the hours-long onslaught of strong winds. Coconut and cocoa trees also sustained severe losses. The southern [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]] saw the severest effects, incurring extensive damage to crops and buildings; damage in Jamaica amounted to $10&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|10|1916|r=0}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}). The storm then traversed the [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] into the Gulf of Mexico and intensified further into the equivalent of a [[major hurricane]] on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]].{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a storm that ranks as Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale]].<ref name=BASIC>{{cite book|last1=Goldenburg|first1=Stan|chapter=A3) What is a super-typhoon?

Buildings were razed at many coastal cities, with the worst impacts felt in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] and surrounding communities. Beachfront structures were destroyed by a {{convert|9.2|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[storm surge]]. Strong gusts and heavy rainfall spread farther inland across mainly rural sectors of South Texas, damaging towns and their outlying agricultural districts alike. Railroads and other public utilities were disrupted across the region, with widespread [[power outage]]s. Eight locations set 24-hour rainfall records; among them was [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]], which recorded the storm's rainfall maximum with {{cvt|6|in|mm}} of precipitation. The deluge wrought havoc on military camps along the U.S.-[[Mexico]] border, forcing 30,000&nbsp;garrisoned militiamen to evacuate. Aggregate property damage across Texas reached $1.8&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1.8|1916|r=0}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), and 20&nbsp;people lost their lives.

After the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) had captured substantial territory, President [[Julius Nyerere]] of Tanzania ordered it to halt to give time for the Ugandan rebels to convene and reorganise. The Ugandan rebels made due preparations, primarily led by former president [[Milton Obote]] and leftist intellectual [[Dani Wadada Nabudere]] in their own respective circles.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=96\u201398}} As the Tanzanians began organising a conference for the rebels and exiles, Nyerere was reconsidering Obote's role in the movement. He did not want to give the impression that Tanzania was going to install a government of its own choice in Uganda by facilitating Obote's assumption of leadership of the rebel movement, and there was hostility to Obote from the [[Baganda]] people in southern Uganda as well as other countries such as Kenya.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=102\u2013104}} Nyerere also feared that Obote would stifle cooperation at the meeting and cause it to break up without success. He ultimately convinced Obote to refrain from attending.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=105}} In place of Obote, many Ugandan exiles began favouring Lule, who was a Muganda and had the reputation of being a political moderate{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=106}} as well as a civil servant who was not tarnished by scandal or corrupt service in a past Ugandan regime.<ref name= womakuyu>{{cite web| url = https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1299060/lule-president-68-days| title = Lule, the president for 68 days| last = Womakuyu| first = Frederick| date = 19 January 2012| website = New Vision| access-date = 27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moshi Conference]] opened on 24 March 1979 in the Tanzanian town of [[Moshi, Kilimanjaro|Moshi]], following an intense debate over which factions and persons could be admitted.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=110\u2013114}} That afternoon the delegates announced the formation of the [[Uganda National Liberation Front]] (UNLF), which was to be governed by a 30-strong National Consultative Committee (NCC) and an 11-strong National Executive Committee, the latter including three special commissions\u2014Finance and Administration, Political and Diplomatic Affairs, and Military Affairs.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=115}} The next two days were spent debating the balance of power among the governing bodies and the selection of a chairman for the organisation, which was hotly contested between Lule and [[Paulo Muwanga]], an Obote supporter. After heated argument a consensus was reached whereby Lule would be given the chair and Muwanga would be made head of the Military Affairs Commission.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n==President of Uganda==\n=== Inauguration ===\nCaught unprepared by the [[fall of Kampala]], Lule hurriedly compiled a list of ministers meant to represent the ethnic balances of Uganda's population.{{sfn|Ingham|1994|p=155}} On 12 April 1979 Lule and his cabinet boarded a flight from [[Dar es Salaam]] to Entebbe to fly in for his inauguration. While the plane was stopped in [[Mwanza]], Tanzanian officials decided to delay it there until they could ensure better security for a ceremony in Kampala. The next day Lule and his ministers reached Entebbe and were brought into Kampala in a TPDF motorcade in the late afternoon. Lule was then sworn-in as President of Uganda in front of the Parliament building and gave a brief speech pledging to bring a return of law and order. Lule concluded by saying in [[Luganda]], \"Now it is our turn.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=152\u2013153}} Still feeling that Kampala was unsafe, Tanzanian officials quickly took Lule from Parliament and installed him in the Entebbe State House.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=153}}\n\n=== Tenure ===\nLule assumed office at a time when Uganda's national institutions were dysfunctional and the country was plagued by lawlessness and violence; he presided over a [[failed state]].{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=37}} Lule disregarded the Moshi Conference agreements stipulating a weak presidential authority and attempted to assert his ability to operate under stronger powers provided by the constitution operative in Uganda before Amin's coup.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=197}} Within days of assuming office Lule and his advisers began taking major decisions without consulting the NCC. He also snubbed the committee members by first missing their formal inauguration and, when the ceremony was rescheduled so he could be present, he gave a speech and departed before swearing them in, much to their displeasure.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=197}} Lule then appointed ministers and deputy ministers to his cabinet without the NCC's approval. The members of the cabinet joined the NCC ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'', and he ultimately appointed 24 ministers and 20 deputies, which then outnumbered the original councilors. Despite complaints from the NCC, Lule carried on making appointments and revising the structure of his cabinet.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=198}}\n\nLule further infuriated the NCC when his cabinet awarded its own members $5,000 worth of foreign exchange as a \"rehabilitation allowance\" despite the treasury having very little money. Lule responded to the councilors' anger by offering them the same allowance, which they rejected.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=198}} He also distrusted the UNLA, which he considered to be made up of loyal Obote and Museveni partisans. Lule's government withheld money to the army for this reason, and it played no role in overseeing the defeat of the remnants of Amin's forces.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=197}} He planned on disbanding the UNLA and replacing it with a new \"National Army\", which angered the leaders of the former.<ref name= womakuyu/> The army was to be proportionately representative of all of Uganda's regions and stipulate education requirements for applicants.{{sfn|Tindigarukayo|1988|p=610}}\n\nLule secured a \u00a3100 million aid programme from Western countries, alienating leftists who feared he would sellout the county to international business interests.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=41}} His government's efforts to stifle inflation and curb the black market were minimal and unsuccessful, and during his tenure the economic situation of Ugandan continued its decline from Amin's rule.{{sfn|Tindigarukayo|1988|p=609}}\n\nMany Baganda were elated by Lule's elevation to the presidency, hoping that he would preserve the [[Buganda]] region's interests and keep Obote from returning to power. Lule ultimately did take measures that pleased the Buganda, such as restoring administrative unity to Buganda, conferring more powers to Buganda's government, frequently delivering public statements in Luganda, appointing prominent Baganda monarchists to high office, and granting some state contracts to Baganda businessmen.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=34}} In redistributing properties and enterprises seized from Amin's associates, Lule's government allocated a disproportionate amount to Baganda and his close associates.{{sfn|Tindigarukayo|1988|pp=609\u2013610}} Members of other ethnic groups in Uganda did not trust Lule or accord him much respect, since they felt he would promote Buganda at other region's expense.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|pp=34\u201335}} Some Ugandans feared that his army plan would lead to the creation of a force dominated by Baganda, since Buganda had a larger population than any other region in the country.{{sfn|Tindigarukayo|1988|p=610}}\n\n=== Demise and removal from office ===\nLule's handling of his cabinet provoked outrage in the NCC, especially when he dismissed Muwanga from office. President Nyerere of Tanzania informed Lule that Tanzania would uphold the agreements regarding powers among Ugandan authorities made at Moshi.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=198\u2013199}} Lule felt that Tanzania afforded key support to his political opponents, and thus sought to reduce its influence in the country by deprecating the standing of the TPDF, which remained after the elimination of Amin's forces to provide order. He encouraged Ugandan publications to criticise the Tanzanian army, angering some Ugandan circles and the UNLA which thought it was unfair to attack the army which had \"liberated\" the country.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=41}} On 8 June disgruntled members of the NCC convened in Kampala and passed a resolution demanding Lule present all of his political appointments to the committee for review. Lule did not respond, so on 12 June the NCC reconvened and declared that he had seven days to comply with their demands. The President once again failed to reply, so on the afternoon of 19 June the NCC met at the Entebbe State House in Lule's presence. NCC Chairman [[Edward Rugumayo]] opened the meeting by reviewing the body's unsuccessful entreaties to the President to submit his appointments for its ratification. Lule responded by stating that he was not prepared to take a stance involving such \"important constitutional matters\" by agreeing to submit the appointments to the NCC. He also said that his cabinet appointments were publicly known and that the committee could \"treat the appointments as you wish\".{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=199}}\n\nLule's statement was followed by hours of debate by the NCC concerning the division of powers agreed upon in Moshi. Later, Lule rose to say that he had not contravened the agreements made in Moshi and said that he had not received key directives supposedly dispatched to him from the NCC. Rugumayo retorted that the communications in question had been personally given to the President's secretary. Shortly after the exchange councilor Paulo Wangoola rose and delivered a long speech. He declared that Lule was not willing to accept the supremacy of UNLF governance and concluded by formally tabling a [[motion of no confidence]] in the President. This was followed by an intense debate in which different councilors gave impassioned defences and criticisms of Lule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=199}} At 1:00 on 20 June the NCC voted on the motion via secret ballot. The results were announced 35 minutes later with 18 councilors voting in favour and 14 against. Lule was thus removed from the presidency, and he walked out of the room with nine other councilors when Rugumayo said that his dismissal also triggered the removal of his cabinet.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=200}} \n\nLule held the Ugandan Presidency for just 68 days, the shortest tenure of any President of Uganda.<ref name=statehouse>{{cite web| url = https://www.statehouse.go.ug/past-presidents/president-yusuf-kironde-lule| title = President Yusuf Kironde Lule| website = The State House of Uganda| publisher = Presidency of Uganda| access-date = 27 March 2020}}</ref> [[Godfrey Binaisa]], the former Attorney General of Uganda under Obote who had come to oppose both him and Amin and had no prior role in the committee, was then elected President.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=201}} Binaisa retained some of Lule's ministers but removed his key supporters from the cabinet and reversed his administrative changes in Buganda.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=42}}{{sfn|Tindigarukayo|1988|p=611}}\n\nMany Baganda felt that Lule had been removed from power because he had preserved legitimate interests of Buganda.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=42}} His ouster instigated large protests in Kampala and clashes between demonstrators and Tanzanian troops attempting to maintain order.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=203}} Buganda protesters blocked streets and destroyed trucks while transportation workers went on strike and merchants deliberately [[Price gouging|gouged prices]] of basic commodities. Some armed Baganda groups formed after Lule's departure and attacked police and soldiers, rendering Buganda ungovernable.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|pp=43\u201344}} On 21 October 1980 the [[Court of Appeal of Uganda|Ugandan Court of Appeal]] ruled that Lule's removal had been unlawful, stating that Lule had the authority to appoint ministers without the NCC's approval. Though the ruling technically meant Lule could still claim to be President of Uganda, most nationals chose to ignore the decision, since the political situation in the country had rapidly developed since Lule's removal.<ref>{{cite news| title = Court Rules for Lule| newspaper = Africa Contemporary Record| date = October 1980| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DHsEAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nOut of office, he led the [[Uganda Freedom Fighters]] (UFF), a resistance group which joined with [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[Popular Resistance Army]] (PRA) in 1981.

Lule ultimately did take measures that pleased the Buganda, such as restoring administrative unity to Buganda, conferring more powers to Buganda's government, frequently delivering public statements in Luganda, appointing prominent Baganda monarchists to high office, and granting some state contracts to Baganda businessmen.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=34}} In redistributing properties and enterprises seized from Amin's associates, Lule's government allocated a disproportionate amount to Baganda and his close associates.{{sfn|Tindigarukayo|1988|pp=609\u2013610}} Members of other ethnic groups in Uganda did not trust Lule or accord him much respect, since they felt he would promote Buganda at other region's expense.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|pp=34\u201335}} Some Ugandans feared that his army plan would lead to the creation of a force dominated by Baganda, since Buganda had a larger population than any other region in the country.{{sfn|Tindigarukayo|1988|p=610}}\n\n=== Demise and removal from office ===\nLule's handling of his cabinet provoked outrage in the NCC, especially when he dismissed Muwanga from office. President Nyerere of Tanzania informed Lule that Tanzania would uphold the agreements regarding powers among Ugandan authorities made at Moshi.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=198\u2013199}} Lule felt that Tanzania afforded key support to his political opponents, and thus sought to reduce its influence in the country by deprecating the standing of the TPDF, which remained after the elimination of Amin's forces to provide order. He encouraged Ugandan publications to criticise the Tanzanian army, angering Ugandan circles and the UNLA which though it was unfair to attack the army which had \"liberated\" the country.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=41}} On 8 June disgruntled members of the NCC convened in Kampala and passed a resolution demanding Lule present all of his political appointments to the committee for review. Lule did not respond, so on 12 June the NCC reconvened and declared that he had seven days to comply with their demands. The President once again failed to reply, so on the afternoon of 19 June the NCC met at the Entebbe State House in Lule's presence. NCC Chairman [[Edward Rugumayo]] opened the meeting by reviewing the body's unsuccessful entreaties to the President to submit his appointments for its ratification. Lule responded by stating that he was not prepared to take a stance involving such \"important constitutional matters\" by agreeing to submit the appointments to the NCC. He also said that his cabinet appointments were publicly known and that the committee could \"treat the appointments as you wish\".{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=199}}\n\nLule's statement was followed by hours of debate by the NCC concerning the division of powers agreed upon in Moshi. Later, Lule rose to say that he had not contravened the agreements made in Moshi and said that he had not received key directives supposedly dispatched to him from the NCC. Rugumayo retorted that the communications in question had been personally given to the President's secretary. Shortly after the exchange councilor Paulo Wangoola rose and delivered a long speech. He declared that Lule was not willing to accept the supremacy of UNLF governance and concluded by formally tabling a [[motion of no confidence]] in the President. This was followed by an intense debate in which different councilors gave impassioned defences and criticisms of Lule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=199}} At 1:00 on 20 June the NCC voted on the motion via secret ballot. The results were announced 35 minutes later with 18 councilors voting in favour and 14 against. Lule was thus removed from the presidency, and he walked out of the room with nine other councilors when Rugumayo said that his dismissal also triggered the removal of his cabinet.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=200}} \n\nLule held the Ugandan Presidency for just 68 days, the shortest tenure of any President of Uganda.<ref name=statehouse>{{cite web| url = https://www.statehouse.go.ug/past-presidents/president-yusuf-kironde-lule| title = President Yusuf Kironde Lule| website = The State House of Uganda| publisher = Presidency of Uganda| access-date = 27 March 2020}}</ref> [[Godfrey Binaisa]], the former Attorney General of Uganda under Obote who had come to oppose both him and Amin and had no prior role in the committee, was then elected President.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=201}} Binaisa retained some of Lule's ministers but removed his key supporters from the cabinet and reversed his administrative changes in Buganda.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=42}}{{sfn|Tindigarukayo|1988|p=611}}\n\nMany Baganda felt that Lule had been removed from power because he had preserved legitimate interests of Buganda.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|p=42}} His ouster instigated large protests in Kampala and clashes between demonstrators and Tanzanian troops attempting to maintain order.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=203}} Buganda protesters blocked streets and destroyed trucks while transportation workers went on strike and merchants deliberately [[Price gouging|gouged prices]] of basic commodities. Some armed Baganda groups formed after Lule's departure and attacked police and soldiers, rendering Buganda ungovernable.{{sfn|Otunnu|2017|pp=43\u201344}} On 21 October 1980 the [[Court of Appeal of Uganda|Ugandan Court of Appeal]] ruled that Lule's removal had been unlawful, stating that Lule had the authority to appoint ministers without the NCC's approval. Though the ruling technically meant Lule could still claim to be President of Uganda, most nationals chose to ignore the decision, since the political situation in the country had rapidly developed since Lule's removal.<ref>{{cite news| title = Court Rules for Lule| newspaper = Africa Contemporary Record| date = October 1980| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DHsEAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nOut of office, he led the [[Uganda Freedom Fighters]] (UFF), a resistance group which joined with [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[Popular Resistance Army]] (PRA) in 1981.
