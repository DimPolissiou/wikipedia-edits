When he cut it open, he was surprised to find an infant the size of his thumb sitting inside. The man and his wife, who had no children of their own, decided to raise the infant as their daughter, naming her {{Nihongo|Nayotake no Kaguya-hime|\u306a\u3088\u305f\u3051\u306e\u304b\u3050\u3084\u59eb||\"Shining Princess of the Young Bamboo\"}}.

The family became rich, and in the span of three months, Kaguya-hime grew from a small baby into a woman of ordinary size and extraordinary beauty. At first, the old man tried to keep Kaguya-hime away from outsiders, but news of her beauty spread across the land, attracting many suitors who sought her hand in marriage.\n\nAmong them were five nobles: {{Nihongo|Prince Ishitsukuri|\u77f3\u4f5c\u7687\u5b50}}, {{Nihongo|Prince Kuramochi|\u8eca\u6301\u7687\u5b50}}, {{Nihongo|the [[Minister of the Right]] Abe no Mimuraji|\u53f3\u5927\u81e3\u963f\u500d\u5fa1\u4e3b\u4eba}}, {{Nihongo|the [[Dainagon|Grand Counselor]] \u014ctomo no Miyuki|\u5927\u7d0d\u8a00\u5927\u4f34\u5fa1\u884c}}, and {{Nihongo|the [[Ch\u016bnagon|Middle Counselor]] Isonokami no Marotari|\u4e2d\u7d0d\u8a00\u77f3\u4e0a\u9ebb\u5442}}, who eventually persuaded the old man to tell Kaguya-hime to choose from among them. Uninterested, Kaguya-hime devised five impossible tasks, agreeing to marry the noble who could bring her his specified item: the stone begging bowl of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], a jeweled branch from the island of [[Mount Penglai|H\u014drai]], the hide of a [[Rat_(zodiac)|Chinese fire-rat]], a colored jewel from a [[Japanese dragon|dragon]]'s neck, and a [[cowry|cowry shell]] born from a [[swallow]].\n\nRealizing the impossibility of his task, the first noble presented a fake stone bowl made from a blackened pot, but was exposed when Kaguya-hime noticed that it did not glow with holy light. The second noble presented a branch crafted by the finest jewelers in the land, but his deception was revealed when the craftsmen arrived at Kaguya-hime's house to collect payment. The third noble was deceived by a merchant from China, who sold him a false hide that burned when it was tested with fire. The fourth noble attempted to find a dragon at sea, but abandoned his plans after encountering a storm. The final noble fell from a great height when he tried to reach into a swallow's nest.\n\nAfter this, the [[Emperor of Japan]] came to see Kaguya-hime and, upon falling in love, asked her to marry him. Although he was not subjected to the impossible trials that had thwarted the nobles, Kaguya-hime rejected his request for marriage as well, telling him that she was not of his country and thus could not go to the palace with him. She stayed in contact with the Emperor, but continued to rebuff his requests and marriage proposals. Three years passed as they continued to communicate by letter.\n\n[[File:Japanese Fairy Book - Ozaki - P118.png|thumb|right|The receding Princess]]\nThat summer, whenever Kaguya-hime saw the full moon, her eyes filled with tears. Though her adoptive parents worried greatly and questioned her, she was unable to tell them what was wrong. Her behaviour became increasingly erratic until she revealed that she was not of this world and must return to her people on the Moon. In some versions, it is said that she was sent to the Earth, where she would inevitably form [[Up\u0101d\u0101na|material attachment]], as a temporary [[punishment]] for some crime, while in others, she was sent to Earth for her safety during a celestial war. The gold that the old man had found had been a [[stipend]] from the people of the Moon, sent to pay for Kaguya-hime's upkeep.\n\n[[Image:Taketori Monogatari 2.jpg|thumb|left|Kaguya-hime returns to the Moon]]\nAs the day of her return approached, the Emperor sent many guards to protect her from the Moon people, but when an embassy of heavenly beings descended upon the bamboo cutter's house, the guards were blinded by a strange light. Kaguya-hime announced that, though she loved her many friends on Earth, she must return with the beings to her true home on the Moon. She wrote sad notes of apology to her parents and to the Emperor, then gave her parents her own robe as a memento. She then took a little of the [[elixir of immortality]], attached it to her letter to the Emperor, and gave it to a guard officer. As she handed it to him, a feather robe was placed on her shoulders, and all of her sadness and compassion for the people of the Earth were apparently forgotten. The entourage ascended into the sky, taking Kaguya-hime back to {{Nihongo|''Tsuki no Miyako''|\u6708\u306e\u90fd||\"the Capital of the Moon\"}} and leaving her earthly foster parents in tears.\n\nThe parents became very sad and were soon put to bed sick. The officer returned to the Emperor with the items Kaguya-hime had given him as her last mortal act, and reported what had happened. The Emperor read her letter and was overcome with sadness. He asked his servants, \"Which mountain is the closest place to [[Heaven]]?\", to which one replied the Great Mountain of [[Suruga Province]]. The Emperor ordered his men to take the letter to the summit of the mountain and burn it, in the hope that his message would reach the distant princess. The men were also commanded to burn the elixir of immortality, since the Emperor did not wish to live forever without being able to see her.\n\nThe legend has it that the word ''immortality'', \u4e0d\u6b7b (''fushi''), became the name of the mountain, [[Mount Fuji]]. It is also said that the [[kanji]] for the mountain, \u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 (literally \"mountain abounding with warriors\"), are derived from the Emperor's army ascending the slopes to carry out his order. It is said that the smoke from the burning still rises to this day. (In the past, Mount Fuji was much more volcanically active and therefore produced more smoke.)\n\n==Literary connections==\n\nElements of the tale were drawn from earlier stories.

When he cut it open, he was surprised to find an infant the size of his thumb sitting inside.

{"title_page": "International Sound Version", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=April 2013}}\n\n'''''International Sound Version''''' is a term for a film in which all dialogue is replaced with music and foreign inter-titles. It was a method used by movie studios during the early talkie period (1928-1931) to make sound films for foreign markets. This method was much cheaper than the alternative, the \"[[Foreign Language Version]]\", in which the entire film was re-shot with a cast that was fluent in the appropriate language (e.g. Spanish version of [[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]] 1931, Laurel & Hardy shorts in Spanish, French and German).\n\nTo make an international version, the studio would simply insert (on the soundtrack) music over any dialogue in the film and splice in intertitles (which would be replaced with the appropriate language of the country). Singing sequences were left intact as well as any sound sequences that did not involve speaking.\n\nInternational versions were sound versions of films which the producing company did not feel were worth the expense of re-shooting in a foreign language. They were meant to cash in on the talkie craze; by 1930 anything with sound did well at the box-office while silent films were largely ignored by the public. These \"international sound versions\" were basically part-talkies and were largely silent except for musical sequences. Since the film included a synchronized music and a sound effect track, it could be advertised as a sound picture and could therefore capitalize on the talkie craze in foreign markets (instead of the more expensive method of actually re-filming talking sequences in foreign languages).\n\n[[Warner Bros.]] was the first to begin issuing these \"International Sound Versions.\" In 1928, they began to release their part-talkies and all-talkies in this format. They would always leave musical interludes and non-dialogue sound sequences intact. On occasion, they would dub the theme song into Spanish, French or German in order to further popularize the music.\n\nStarting in 1931, studios began to subtitle films, a method still in widespread use today and both \"International Sound Versions\" and \"Foreign Language Versions\" quietly disappeared, although the latter method continued to be employed until the mid-1930s for special productions until it became feasible to dub films into foreign languages. Such films as [[My Man (1928 film)|\"My Man\"]] 1928, [[Honky Tonk (1929 film)|\"Honky Tonk\"]]  1929, and [[Is Everybody Happy? (1929 film)|\"Is Everybody Happy?\"]] 1929 were seen throughout the world in \"International Sound Versions\".

This method was much cheaper than the alternative, the \"[[Foreign Language Version]]\", in which the entire film was re-shot with a cast that was fluent in the appropriate language (e.g. Spanish version of [[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]] 1931, Laurel & Hardy shorts in Spanish, French and German).\n\nTo make an international version, the studio would simply insert (on the soundtrack) music over any dialogue in the film and splice in intertitles (which would be replaced with the appropriate language of the country). Singing sequences were left intact as well as any sound sequences that did not involve speaking.\n\nInternational versions were sound versions of films which the producing company did not feel were worth the expense of re-shooting in a foreign language. They were meant to cash in on the talkie craze; by 1930 anything with sound did well at the box-office while silent films were largely ignored by the public. These \"international sound versions\" were basically part-talkies and were largely silent except for musical sequences. Since the film included a synchronized music and a sound effect track, it could be advertised as a sound picture and could therefore capitalize on the talkie craze in foreign markets (instead of the more expensive method of actually re-filming talking sequences in foreign languages).\n\n[[Warner Bros.]] was the first to begin issuing these \"International Sound Versions.\" In 1928, they began to release their part-talkies and all-talkies in this format. They would always leave musical interludes and non-dialogue sound sequences intact. On occasion, they would dub the theme song into Spanish, French or German in order to further popularize the music.\n\nStarting in 1931, studios began to subtitle films, a method still in widespread use today and both \"International Sound Versions\" and \"Foreign Language Versions\" quietly disappeared, although the latter method continued to be employed until the mid-1930s for special productions until it became feasible to dub films into foreign languages. Such films as [[My Man (1928 film)|\"My Man\"]] 1928, [[Honky Tonk (1929 film)|\"Honky Tonk\"]]  1929, and [[Is Everybody Happy? (1929 film)|\"Is Everybody Happy?\"]] 1929 were seen throughout the world in \"International Sound Versions\". In the \"International Sound Version\" of [[Paris (1929 film)|\"Paris\"]] 1929, which was especially prepared for French markets, the Warner Bros. had [[Irene Bordoni]] sing several of her songs in French. \n\nSurviving examples of \"International Sound Versions\" include \"Song O' My Heart\" 1930, [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|\"Phantom Of The Opera\" 1929]], [[Men Without Women (film)|\"Men Without Women\"]] 1930, [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|\"All Quiet On The Western Front\"]] 1930, [[Rain or Shine (film)|Rain or Shine]] 1930, etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Part-talkie]]\n* [[Sound film]]\n* [[History of film]]\n* [[List of early Warner Bros. talking features]]\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Sound Version}}\n[[Category:1920s in film]]\n[[Category:Sound recording]]\n[[Category:Transitional sound films| ]]\n[[Category:Alternate versions of films| International Sound Version]]\n\n[[de:Internationale Tonspur]]\n", "name_user": "TMProofreader", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Sound_Version"}
