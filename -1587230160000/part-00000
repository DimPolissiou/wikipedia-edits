Such a function is called a [[2-valued morphism]]. Then ''m'' is [[finitely additive]], and hence a ''[[Content (measure theory)|content]]'' on \u2118(''X''), and every property of elements of ''X'' is either true [[almost everywhere]] or false almost everywhere. However, ''m'' is usually not ''countably additive'', and hence does not define a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] in the usual sense.\n\nFor a filter ''F'' that is not an ultrafilter, one would say ''m''(''A'') = 1 if ''A''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''F'' and ''m''(''A'') = 0 if ''X'' \\ ''A''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''F'', leaving ''m'' undefined elsewhere.{{cn|date=July 2016}}{{clarify|reason=A function m can certainly be defined in that way. However, this is pointless unless such an m can be shown to have some useful properties (e.g. being a 'content'). They should be stated here.|date=July 2016}}\n\n=={{vanchor|Types and existence of ultrafilters|Types}}==\nThere are two very different types of ultrafilter: principal and free. A '''principal''' (or '''fixed''', or '''trivial''') ultrafilter is a filter containing a [[least element]]. Consequently, principal ultrafilters are of the form ''F''<sub>''a''</sub> = {''x'' | ''a'' \u2264 ''x''} for some (but not all) elements ''a'' of the given poset. In this case ''a'' is called the ''principal element'' of the ultrafilter. Any ultrafilter that is not principal is called a '''free''' (or '''non-principal''') ultrafilter. \n\nFor ultrafilters on a powerset \u2118(''S''), a principal ultrafilter consists of all subsets of ''S'' that contain a given element ''s'' of ''S''. Each ultrafilter on \u2118(''S'') that is also a [[principal filter]] is of this form.<ref name=\"Davey.Priestley.1990\"/>{{rp|187}} Therefore, an ultrafilter ''U'' on \u2118(''S'') is principal if and only if it contains a finite set.<ref group=note>To see the \"if\" direction: If {''s''<sub>1</sub>,...,''s''<sub>''n''</sub>} \u2208 ''U'', then {''s''<sub>1</sub>} \u2208 ''U'', or ..., or {''s''<sub>''n''</sub>} \u2208 ''U'' by induction on ''n'', using Nr.2 of the [[#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|above]] characterization theorem. That is, some {''s''<sub>''i''</sub>} is the principal element of ''U''.</ref> If ''S'' is infinite, an ultrafilter ''U'' on \u2118(''S'') is hence non-principal if and only if it contains the [[Fr\u00e9chet filter]] of [[cofinite subset]]s of ''S''.<ref group=note>''U'' is non-principal iff it contains no finite set, i.e. (by Nr.3 of the [[#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|above]] characterization theorem) iff it contains every cofinite set, i.e. every member of the Fr\u00e9chet filter.</ref>{{cn|date=July 2016}} If ''S'' is finite, each ultrafilter is principal.<ref name=\"Davey.Priestley.1990\"/>{{rp|187}}\n\nOne can show that every filter on a Boolean algebra (or more generally, any subset with the [[finite intersection property]]) is contained in an ultrafilter (see [[Ultrafilter lemma]]) and that free ultrafilters therefore exist, but the proofs involve the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) in the form of [[Zorn's lemma]]. On the other hand, the statement that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter does not imply AC. Indeed, it is equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] (BPIT), a well-known intermediate point between the axioms of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) and the ZF theory augmented by the axiom of choice (ZFC). In general, proofs involving the axiom of choice do not produce explicit examples of free ultrafilters, though it is possible to find explicit examples in some models of ZFC;  for example, [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] showed that this can be done in the [[constructible universe]] where one can write down an explicit global choice function.  <!---commented out: \"almost all\" is vague in absence of a measure, \"all UFs principal on finite sets\" has been said above---Nonetheless, almost all ultrafilters on the powerset of an infinite set are free. By contrast, every ultrafilter of a finite poset (or ''on'' a finite set) is principal, since any finite filter has a least element.---> In ZF without the axiom of choice, it is possible that every ultrafilter is principal. <ref name=\"Halbeisen2012>{{cite book|author=L.J. Halbeisen|title=Combinatorial Set Theory|publisher=Springer|year=2012|series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nUltrafilters on powersets are useful in [[topology]], especially in relation to [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] spaces, and in [[model theory]] in the construction of [[ultraproduct|ultraproducts and ultrapowers]]. Every ultrafilter on a compact Hausdorff space converges to exactly one point. Likewise, ultrafilters on Boolean algebras play a central role in [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|Stone's representation theorem]].\n\nThe set ''G'' of all ultrafilters of a poset ''P'' can be topologized in a natural way, that is in fact closely related to the above-mentioned representation theorem. For any element ''a'' of ''P'', let ''D''<sub>''a''</sub> = {''U'' \u2208 ''G'' | ''a'' \u2208 ''U''}. This is most useful when ''P'' is again a Boolean algebra, since in this situation the set of all ''D''<sub>''a''</sub> is a base for a compact Hausdorff topology on ''G''. Especially, when considering the ultrafilters on a powerset \u2118(''S''), the resulting [[topological space]] is the [[Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification]] of a [[discrete space]] of cardinality |''S''|.\n\nThe [[ultraproduct]] construction in [[model theory]] uses ultrafilters to produce [[elementary extension]]s of structures. For example, in constructing [[hyperreal number]]s as an ultraproduct of the [[real numbers]], the [[domain of discourse]] is extended from real numbers to sequences of real numbers. This sequence space is regarded as a [[superset]] of the reals by identifying each real with the corresponding constant sequence. To extend the familiar functions and relations (e.g., + and <) from the reals to the hyperreals, the natural idea is to define them pointwise. But this would lose important logical properties of the reals; for example, pointwise < is not a total ordering. So instead the functions and relations are defined \"[[ultraproduct#Definition|pointwise modulo ''U'']]\", where ''U'' is an ultrafilter on the [[index set]] of the sequences; by [[\u0141o\u015b' theorem]], this preserves all properties of the reals that can be stated in [[first-order logic]]. If ''U'' is nonprincipal, then the extension thereby obtained is nontrivial.\n\nIn [[geometric group theory]], non-principal ultrafilters are used to define the [[ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]] of a group. This construction yields a rigorous way to consider ''looking at the group from infinity'', that is the large scale geometry of the group. Asymptotic cones are particular examples of [[ultralimit]]s of [[metric space]]s.\n\n[[G\u00f6del's ontological proof]] of God's existence uses as an axiom that the set of all \"positive properties\" is an ultrafilter.\n\nIn [[social choice theory]], non-principal ultrafilters are used to define a rule (called a ''social welfare function'') for aggregating the preferences of ''infinitely'' many individuals. Contrary to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] for ''finitely'' many individuals, such a rule satisfies the conditions (properties) that Arrow proposes\n(e.g., Kirman and Sondermann, 1972<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Kirman | first1 = A.| last2 = Sondermann | first2 = D.| title = Arrow's theorem, many agents, and invisible dictators| journal = Journal of Economic Theory| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 267\u2013277| year = 1972| doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90106-8}}</ref>).\nMihara (1997,<ref name=mihara97>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mihara | first1 = H.

Such a function is called a [[2-valued morphism]]. Then ''m'' is [[finitely additive]], and hence a ''[[Content (measure theory)|content]]'' on \u2118(''X''), and every property of elements of ''X'' is either true [[almost everywhere]] or false almost everywhere. However, ''m'' is usually not ''countably additive'', and hence does not define a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] in the usual sense.\n\nFor a filter ''F'' that is not an ultrafilter, one would say ''m''(''A'') = 1 if ''A''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''F'' and ''m''(''A'') = 0 if ''X'' \\ ''A''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''F'', leaving ''m'' undefined elsewhere.{{cn|date=July 2016}}{{clarify|reason=A function m can certainly be defined in that way. However, this is pointless unless such an m can be shown to have some useful properties (e.g. being a 'content'). They should be stated here.|date=July 2016}}\n\n=={{vanchor|Types and existence of ultrafilters|Types}}==\nThere are two very different types of ultrafilter: principal and free. A '''principal''' (or '''fixed''', or '''trivial''') ultrafilter is a filter containing a [[least element]]. Consequently, principal ultrafilters are of the form ''F''<sub>''a''</sub> = {''x'' | ''a'' \u2264 ''x''} for some (but not all) elements ''a'' of the given poset. In this case ''a'' is called the ''principal element'' of the ultrafilter. Any ultrafilter that is not principal is called a '''free''' (or '''non-principal''') ultrafilter. \n\nFor ultrafilters on a powerset \u2118(''S''), a principal ultrafilter consists of all subsets of ''S'' that contain a given element ''s'' of ''S''. Each ultrafilter on \u2118(''S'') that is also a [[principal filter]] is of this form.<ref name=\"Davey.Priestley.1990\"/>{{rp|187}} Therefore, an ultrafilter ''U'' on \u2118(''S'') is principal if and only if it contains a finite set.<ref group=note>To see the \"if\" direction: If {''s''<sub>1</sub>,...,''s''<sub>''n''</sub>} \u2208 ''U'', then {''s''<sub>1</sub>} \u2208 ''U'', or ..., or {''s''<sub>''n''</sub>} \u2208 ''U'' by induction on ''n'', using Nr.2 of the [[#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|above]] characterization theorem. That is, some {''s''<sub>''i''</sub>} is the principal element of ''U''.</ref> If ''S'' is infinite, an ultrafilter ''U'' on \u2118(''S'') is hence non-principal if and only if it contains the [[Fr\u00e9chet filter]] of [[cofinite subset]]s of ''S''.<ref group=note>''U'' is non-principal iff it contains no finite set, i.e. (by Nr.3 of the [[#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|above]] characterization theorem) iff it contains every cofinite set, i.e. every member of the Fr\u00e9chet filter.</ref>{{cn|date=July 2016}} If ''S'' is finite, each ultrafilter is principal.<ref name=\"Davey.Priestley.1990\"/>{{rp|187}}\n\nOne can show that every filter on a Boolean algebra (or more generally, any subset with the [[finite intersection property]]) is contained in an ultrafilter (see [[Ultrafilter lemma]]) and that free ultrafilters therefore exist, but the proofs involve the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) in the form of [[Zorn's lemma]]. On the other hand, the statement that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter does not imply AC. Indeed, it is equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] (BPIT), a well-known intermediate point between the axioms of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) and the ZF theory augmented by the axiom of choice (ZFC). In general, proofs involving the axiom of choice do not produce explicit examples of free ultrafilters, though it is possible to find explicit examples in some models of ZFC;  for example, [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] showed that this can be done in the [[constructible universe]] where one can write down an explicit global choice function.  <!---commented out: \"almost all\" is vague in absence of a measure, \"all UFs principal on finite sets\" has been said above---Nonetheless, almost all ultrafilters on the powerset of an infinite set are free. By contrast, every ultrafilter of a finite poset (or ''on'' a finite set) is principal, since any finite filter has a least element.---> In ZF without the axiom of choice, it is possible that every ultrafilter is principal. (see p.316, [Halbeisen, L.J.] \"Combinatorial Set Theory\", Springer 2012)\n\n==Applications==\nUltrafilters on powersets are useful in [[topology]], especially in relation to [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] spaces, and in [[model theory]] in the construction of [[ultraproduct|ultraproducts and ultrapowers]]. Every ultrafilter on a compact Hausdorff space converges to exactly one point. Likewise, ultrafilters on Boolean algebras play a central role in [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|Stone's representation theorem]].\n\nThe set ''G'' of all ultrafilters of a poset ''P'' can be topologized in a natural way, that is in fact closely related to the above-mentioned representation theorem. For any element ''a'' of ''P'', let ''D''<sub>''a''</sub> = {''U'' \u2208 ''G'' | ''a'' \u2208 ''U''}. This is most useful when ''P'' is again a Boolean algebra, since in this situation the set of all ''D''<sub>''a''</sub> is a base for a compact Hausdorff topology on ''G''. Especially, when considering the ultrafilters on a powerset \u2118(''S''), the resulting [[topological space]] is the [[Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification]] of a [[discrete space]] of cardinality |''S''|.\n\nThe [[ultraproduct]] construction in [[model theory]] uses ultrafilters to produce [[elementary extension]]s of structures. For example, in constructing [[hyperreal number]]s as an ultraproduct of the [[real numbers]], the [[domain of discourse]] is extended from real numbers to sequences of real numbers. This sequence space is regarded as a [[superset]] of the reals by identifying each real with the corresponding constant sequence. To extend the familiar functions and relations (e.g., + and <) from the reals to the hyperreals, the natural idea is to define them pointwise. But this would lose important logical properties of the reals; for example, pointwise < is not a total ordering. So instead the functions and relations are defined \"[[ultraproduct#Definition|pointwise modulo ''U'']]\", where ''U'' is an ultrafilter on the [[index set]] of the sequences; by [[\u0141o\u015b' theorem]], this preserves all properties of the reals that can be stated in [[first-order logic]]. If ''U'' is nonprincipal, then the extension thereby obtained is nontrivial.\n\nIn [[geometric group theory]], non-principal ultrafilters are used to define the [[ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]] of a group. This construction yields a rigorous way to consider ''looking at the group from infinity'', that is the large scale geometry of the group. Asymptotic cones are particular examples of [[ultralimit]]s of [[metric space]]s.\n\n[[G\u00f6del's ontological proof]] of God's existence uses as an axiom that the set of all \"positive properties\" is an ultrafilter.\n\nIn [[social choice theory]], non-principal ultrafilters are used to define a rule (called a ''social welfare function'') for aggregating the preferences of ''infinitely'' many individuals. Contrary to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] for ''finitely'' many individuals, such a rule satisfies the conditions (properties) that Arrow proposes\n(e.g., Kirman and Sondermann, 1972<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Kirman | first1 = A.| last2 = Sondermann | first2 = D.| title = Arrow's theorem, many agents, and invisible dictators| journal = Journal of Economic Theory| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 267\u2013277| year = 1972| doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90106-8}}</ref>).\nMihara (1997,<ref name=mihara97>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mihara | first1 = H.

He uses a [[definitions of terrorism|definition of terrorism]] from a [[US army]] manual, which defines it as \"the calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature. This is done through intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear.\"<ref>US Army Operational Concept for Terrorism Counteraction_ (TRADOC Pamphlet No. 525-37), 1984.</ref> In relation to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]] he stated:\n\n{{quote|Wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism, not a war against terrorism. (''9-11'', p. 76)}}\n\nOn the efficacy of terrorism:\n\n{{quote|One is the fact that terrorism works. It doesn't fail. It works. Violence usually works. That's world history. Secondly, it's a very serious analytic error to say, as is commonly done, that terrorism is the weapon of the weak. Like other means of violence, it's primarily a weapon of the strong, overwhelmingly, in fact. It is held to be a weapon of the weak because the strong also control the doctrinal systems and their terror doesn't count as terror. Now that's close to universal. I can't think of a historical exception; even the worst mass murderers view the world that way. So take the Nazis. They weren't carrying out terror in occupied Europe. They were protecting the local population from the terrorisms of the partisans. And like other resistance movements, there was terrorism. The Nazis were carrying out counter terror.<ref name=\"chomsky011018\">{{cite web|url=https://chomsky.info/20011018-2/|title=The New War Against Terror |last=Chomsky|first=Noam|date=October 18, 2001|publisher=chomsky.info // Delivered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n}}\nAs regards support for condemnation of terrorism, Chomsky opines that terrorism (and violence/authority in general) is generally bad and can only be justified in those cases where it is clear that greater terrorism (or violence, or abuse of authority) is thus avoided. In a debate on the legitimacy of political violence in 1967, Chomsky argued that the \"terror\" of the [[Vietnam National Liberation Front]] (Viet Cong) was not justified, but that terror could in theory be justified under certain circumstances:\n\n{{quote|I don't accept the view that we can just condemn the NLF terror, period, because it was so horrible.

And if we are going to take a moral position on this\u2014 and I think we should\u2014we have to ask both what the consequences were of using terror and not using terror. If it were true that the consequences of not using terror would be that the peasantry in Vietnam would continue to live in the state of the peasantry of the Philippines, then I think the use of terror would be justified.

Chomsky gives reasons for directing his activist efforts to the state of which he is a citizen. He believes that his work can have more impact when directed at his own government, and that he holds a responsibility as a member of a particular country of origin to work to stop that country from committing crimes. He expresses this idea often with a comparison of other countries holding that every country has flexibility to address crimes by unfavored countries, but is always unwilling to deal with their own. Speaking in Nicaragua in 1986, Chomsky was asked \"We feel that through what you say and write you are our friend but at the same time you talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath. I ask you how you can use the same arguments as reactionaries?\" to which Chomsky responded,\n\n{{quote|I have been accused of everything and that therefore includes being a reactionary. From my personal experience there are two countries in which my political writings can basically not appear. One is the U.S. within the mainstream with very rare exceptions. The other is the USSR. I think what we ought to do is to try to understand the truth about the world. And the truth about the world is usually quite unpleasant. My own concern is primarily the terror and violence carried out by my own state, for two reasons. For one thing, because it happens to be the larger component of international violence. But also for a much more important reason than that; namely, I can do something about it. So even if the U.S. was responsible for 2 percent of the violence in the world instead of the majority of it, it would be that 2 percent I would be primarily responsible for. And that is a simple ethical judgment. That is, the ethical value of one's actions depends on their anticipated and predictable consequences. It is very easy to denounce the atrocities of someone else. That has about as much ethical value as denouncing atrocities that took place in the 18th century.}}\n\n{{quote|The point is that the useful and significant political actions are those that have consequences for human beings. And those are overwhelmingly the actions which you have some way of influencing and controlling, which mean for me, American actions.

One of the key things superpowers do, Chomsky argues, is try to organize the world according to the interests of their establishment, using military and economic means. Chomsky has repeatedly emphasized that the overall framework of US foreign policy can be explained by the domestic dominance of US business interests and a drive to secure the [[state capitalist]] system. Those interests set the political agenda and the economic goals that aim primarily at US economic dominance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chomsky |first=Noam |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200310--.htm |title=Dominance and its Dilemmas, by Noam Chomsky |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref>\n\nHis conclusion is that a consistent part of the United States' foreign policy is based on stemming the \"threat of a good example.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Chomsky |first=Noam |url=http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm |title=The Threat of a Good Example, by Noam Chomsky (Excerpted from What Uncle Sam Really Wants) |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref> This 'threat' refers to the possibility that a country could successfully develop outside the US-managed global system, thus presenting a model for other countries, including countries in which the United States has strong economic interests. This, Chomsky says, has prompted the United States to repeatedly intervene to quell \"independent development, regardless of ideology\" in regions of the world where it has little economic or safety interests. In one of his works, ''What Uncle Sam Really Wants'', Chomsky argues that this particular explanation accounts in part for the United States' interventions in [[Operation PBSUCCESS|Guatemala]], [[Laos]], [[Contras|Nicaragua]], and [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]], countries that pose no military threat to the US and have economic resources that are not important to the US establishment.<ref>{{cite book |title= What Uncle Sam Really Wants |last= Chomsky |first= Noam |authorlink= Noam Chomsky |year= 1992 |publisher= Odonian Press |isbn= 1-878825-01-1 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/whatunclesamreal00chom/page/22 22\u201325] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/whatunclesamreal00chom/page/22 }}</ref>\n\nChomsky claims that the US government's [[Cold War]] policies were not primarily shaped by anti-Soviet paranoia, but rather toward preserving the United States' ideological and economic dominance in the world.  In his book ''[[Deterring Democracy]]'' he argues that the conventional understanding of the Cold War as a confrontation of two superpowers is an \"ideological construct.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zcomm.org/deterring-democracy/ |title=ZCommunications \u00bb Deterring Democracy |publisher=Zcomm.org |date=2013-02-07 |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref> He insists that to truly understand the Cold War one must examine the underlying motives of the major powers.  Those underlying motives can only be discovered by analyzing the domestic politics, especially the goals of the domestic elites in each country:\n\n{{quote|Putting second order complexities to the side, for the USSR the Cold War has been primarily a war against its satellites, and for the U.S. a war against the Third World. For each, it has served to entrench a particular system of domestic privilege and coercion. The policies pursued within the Cold War framework have been unattractive to the general population, which accepts them only under duress. Throughout history, the standard device to mobilize a reluctant population has been the fear of an evil enemy, dedicated to its destruction. The superpower conflict served the purpose admirably, both for internal needs, as we see in the fevered rhetoric of top planning documents such as [[NSC 68]], and in public propaganda. The Cold War had a functional utility for the superpowers, one reason why it persisted.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/CHOMSKY/dd/dd-c01-s07.html Deterring Democracy: Chapter 1 [7/20&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20020328110834/http://www.zmag.org/CHOMSKY/dd/dd-c01-s07.html |date=2002-03-28 }}</ref>}}\n\nChomsky says the [[Economy of the United States|US economic system]] is primarily a state capitalist system, in which public funds are used to research and develop pioneering technology (the computer, the internet, radar, the jet plane etc.) largely in the form of defense spending, and once developed and mature these technologies are turned over to the corporate sector where civilian uses are developed for private control and profit.<ref>Z Magazine February 1993, \"The Pentagon System\"</ref>\n\nChomsky often expresses his admiration for the [[civil liberties]] enjoyed by US citizens. According to Chomsky, other Western democracies such as France and Canada are less liberal in their defense of controversial speech than the US. However, he does not credit the American government for these freedoms but rather mass social movements in the United States that fought for them. The movements he most often credits are the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement, the movements for [[workers' rights]] and [[trade union]] organization, and the fight for [[African-American]] [[civil rights]]. Chomsky is often sharply critical of other governments who suppress [[free speech]], most controversially in the [[Faurisson affair]] but also of the suppression of free speech in Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chomsky |first=Noam |url=http://www.chomsky.info/talks/20101010.htm |title=Final Remarks, Istanbul Conference on Freedom of Speech |publisher=Chomsky.info |date=2010-04-10 |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref>\n\nAt the fifth annual Edward W.

He contrasted the US' \"self-congratulation\" of the Berlin Wall destruction with the \"resounding silence\" that surrounds the assassination of these priests, contending that the US sacrifices democratic principles for its own self-interest, and without any self-criticism it tends to \"focus a laser light on the crimes of enemies, but crucially we make sure to never look at ourselves.\"<ref>[http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2009/12/04/chomsky-speaks-us-imperialism Claire Luchette \"Chomsky speaks on U.S. imperialism \u2013 Noam Chomsky delivered the Edward W.

In the early 30s in Germany, the communist party, following the Stalinist line at the time, took the position that everybody but us is a social fascist so there's no difference between the social democrats and the Nazis. So therefore we're not going to join with the social democrats to stop the Nazi plague. We know where that led. And there are many other cases like that. And I think we're seeing a rerun of that. So let's take the position \"Never Biden, I'm not going to vote for Biden\". There is a thing called arithmetic. You can debate a lot of things but not arithmetic. Failure to vote for Biden in this election in a swing state amounts to voting for Trump. It takes one vote away from the opposition, the same as voting for Trump. So if you decide you want to vote for the destruction of organized human life on earth, for a sharp increase in the threat of nuclear war, for stuffing the judiciary with young lawyers who will make it impossible to do anything for a generation, then do it openly, say, \"yeah that's what I want\".

He summarized the process with the phrase \"old wine, new bottles\", maintaining that the motive of the \u00e9lites is the same as always: they seek to isolate the general population from important decision-making processes, the difference being that the centers of power are now [[transnational corporation]]s and supranational banks. Chomsky argues that transnational corporate power is \"developing its own governing institutions\" reflective of their global reach.<ref name=autogenerated9>[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/talks/9302-uva.html Old Wine, New Bottles<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010916112914/http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/talks/9302-uva.html |date=2001-09-16 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Chomsky, a primary ploy has been the co-opting of the global economic institutions established at the end of World War II, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]], which have increasingly adhered to the \"[[Washington Consensus]]\", requiring [[developing countries]] to adhere to limits on spending and make structural adjustments that often involve cutbacks in social and welfare programs. IMF aid and loans are normally contingent upon such reforms. Chomsky claims that the construction of global institutions and agreements such as the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] constitute new ways of securing \u00e9lite privileges while undermining democracy.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/9303-nation-nafta.html Notes of NAFTA: The Masters of Man<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020918110938/http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/9303-nation-nafta.html |date=2002-09-18 }}</ref>\nChomsky believes that these austere and [[neoliberal]] measures ensure that poorer countries merely fulfill a service role by providing cheap labor, raw materials and investment opportunities for the [[developed world]]. Additionally, this means that corporations can threaten to relocate to poorer countries, and Chomsky sees this as a powerful weapon to keep workers in richer countries in line.\n\nChomsky takes issue with the terms used in discourse on globalization, beginning with the term \"globalization\" itself, which he maintains refers to a corporate-sponsored economic integration rather than being a general term for things becoming international. He dislikes the term [[anti-globalization]] being used to describe what he regards as a movement for globalization of [[Social justice|social]] and [[environmental justice]]. Chomsky understands what is popularly called \"[[free trade]]\" as a \"mixture of liberalization and protection designed by the principal architects of policy in the service of their interests, which happen to be whatever they are in any particular period.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 />\nIn his writings, Chomsky has drawn attention to globalization resistance movements. He described [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] defiance of NAFTA in his essay \"The Zapatista Uprising.\" He also criticized the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, and reported on the activist efforts that led to its defeat. Chomsky's voice was an important part of the critics who provided the theoretical backbone for the disparate groups who united for the [[demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle]] in November 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/july00barsamian.htm |title=The Meaning of Seattle: An Interview With Noam Chomsky |last1=Barsamian |first1=David |date=July 2000 |website=www.zmag.org |access-date=July 31, 2016 |quote=What was interesting in Seattle was, first of all, the events reflected very extensive programs of education and organizing ...

He supports many of [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s anarchist (or [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]]) ideas. Chomsky has identified Bakunin's comments regarding the totalitarian state as predictions for the brutal Soviet [[police state]] that would come in essays like ''[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1986----.htm The Soviet Union Versus Socialism]''.  He has also defined [[Soviet communism]] as \"fake socialism\", particularly because any socialism worthy of the name requires authentic democratic control of production and resources as well as public ownership. He has said that contrary to what many in America claim, the collapse of the Soviet Union should be regarded as \"a small victory for socialism\", not capitalism.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/86-soviet-socialism.html Soviet Union Versus Socialism<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020918110940/http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/86-soviet-socialism.html |date=2002-09-18 }}</ref> Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chomsky explicitly condemned Soviet imperialism; for example in 1986 during a question/answer following a lecture he gave at Universidad Centroamericana in Nicaragua, when challenged by an audience member about how he could \"talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath\", Chomsky responded: \"One of the truths about the world is that there are two superpowers, one a\nhuge power which happens to have its boot on your neck, another, a smaller power which happens to have its boot on other people's necks. And I think that anyone in the Third World would be making a grave error if they succumbed to illusions about these matters.\"<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nChomsky was also impressed with socialism as practiced in Vietnam. In a speech given in [[Hanoi]] on April 13, 1970, and broadcast by [[Radio Hanoi]] the next day, Chomsky spoke of his \"admiration for the people of Vietnam who have been able to defend themselves against the ferocious attack, and at the same time take great strides forward toward the socialist society.\" Chomsky praised the North Vietnamese for their efforts in building material prosperity, social justice, and cultural progress. He also went on to discuss and support the political writing of [[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n]].<ref>-Pacific Daily Report of the U.S. government's Foreign Broadcast Information Service, April 16, 1970, pages K2-K3</ref>\n\nIn his 1973 book ''For Reasons of State'', Chomsky argues that instead of a capitalist system in which people are \"[[wage slavery|wage slaves]]\" or an authoritarian system in which decisions are made by a centralized committee, a society could function with no paid labor.  He argues that a nation's populace should be free to pursue jobs of their choosing. People will be free to do as they like, and the work they voluntarily choose will be both \"rewarding in itself\" and \"socially useful.\" Society would be run under a system of peaceful [[anarchism]], with no state or other authoritarian institutions. Work that was fundamentally distasteful to all, if any existed, would be distributed equally among everyone.<ref name=Peter-1976>Chomsky explains anarchism (5 parts): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW7nnLNANtQ 1] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnBnloqzGkE 2] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NFdmqxisfQ 3] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8M0UTtfkAI 4] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6HTQ6mtFqQ 5]</ref>\n\nChomsky was always critical of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, in the tens of millions'.<ref>Truth-out.org interview with C.J.Polychroniou, 17/7/16</ref> However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less critical of the communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, \"I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There are many things to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable.\" Chomsky continued: \"There are even better examples than China. But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which a good deal of the collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step.\"<ref name=autogenerated5 /> He said of Vietnam: \"Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10869|title=A Special Supplement: In North Vietnam by Noam Chomsky|work=nybooks.com|date=13 August 1970|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam}}</ref>\nIn the context of remarks on the topic of [[peak oil]] in April 2005, Chomsky stated \"China is probably the most polluted country in the world \u2013 you can't see.

He has been reticent about theorizing an anarchist society in detail, although he has outlined its likely value systems and institutional framework in broad terms. According to Chomsky, the variety of [[anarchism]] which he favors is:<ref name=\"Peter-1976\" />\n{{quote|... a kind of voluntary socialism, that is, as libertarian socialist or anarcho-syndicalist or communist anarchist, in the tradition of, say, Bakunin and Kropotkin and others. They had in mind a highly organized form of society, but a society that was organized on the basis of organic units, organic communities. And generally, they meant by that the workplace and the neighborhood, and from those two basic units there could derive through federal arrangements a highly integrated kind of social organization which might be national or even international in scope. And these decisions could be made over a substantial range, but by delegates who are always part of the organic community from which they come, to which they return, and in which, in fact, they live.}}On the question of the government of political and economic institutions, Chomsky has consistently emphasized the importance of grassroots democratic forms. Accordingly, current Anglo-American institutions of representative democracy \"would be criticized by an anarchist of this school on two grounds. First of all because there is a monopoly of power centralized in the state, and secondly \u2013 and critically \u2013 because the representative democracy is limited to the political sphere and in no serious way encroaches on the economic sphere.\" <ref name=\"Peter-1976\" /><ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19760725.htm \"The Relevance of Anarcho-syndicalism\"],\nNoam Chomsky interviewed by Peter Jay, ''The Jay Interview'', July 25, 1976.</ref>\n\nChomsky believes anarchism is a direct descendant of liberalism, perfecting the ideals of personal liberty and minimal government of the Enlightenment.<ref>''Chomsky on Anarchism'', AK Press, 2005.</ref> He views libertarian socialism thus as the logical conclusion of liberalism, extending its democratic ideals into the economy, making anarchism an inherently socialist philosophy.\n\n===Views on American libertarianism===\nNoam Chomsky has described [[libertarianism]], as it is understood [[Libertarianism in the United States|in the United States]], as, \"extreme advocation of total tyranny\" and \"the extreme opposite of what's been called libertarian in every other part of the world since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\" <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxPUvQZ3rcQ], Noam Chomsky speech, February 5, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Views on the welfare state===\nChomsky is scathing in his opposition to the view that anarchism is inconsistent with support for '[[welfare state]]' measures, stating in part that\n{{quote|One can, of course, take the position that we don't care about the problems people face today, and want to think about a possible tomorrow.

Herman]] and Chomsky's book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'' explores this topic and presents their \"[[propaganda model]]\" hypothesis as a basis to understand the news media with several case studies to support it. According to their propaganda model, more democratic societies like the U.S. use subtle, non-violent means of control, unlike totalitarian societies, where physical force can readily be used to coerce the general population. Chomsky asserts that \"propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state\" (''Media Control'').\n\nThe model attempts to explain such a [[systemic bias]] in terms of structural economic causes rather than a conspiracy of people. It argues the bias derives from five \"filters\" that all published news must pass through which combine to systematically distort news coverage.\n\n# The first filter, ownership, notes that most major media outlets are owned by large corporations.\n# The second, funding, notes that the outlets derive the majority of their funding from advertising, not readers. Thus, since they are profit-oriented businesses selling a product\u2014readers and audiences\u2014to other businesses (advertisers), the model would expect them to publish news which would reflect the desires and values of those businesses.\n# In addition, the news media are dependent on government institutions and major businesses with strong biases as sources (the third filter) for much of their information.\n# Flak, the fourth filter, refers to the various [[pressure group]]s which go after the media for supposed bias and so on when they go out of line.\n# Norms, the fifth filter, refer to the common conceptions shared by those in the profession of journalism.<ref>In the original text, published in 1988, the fifth filter was \"anticommunism\". However, with the fall of the Soviet Union, it has been broadened to allow for shifts in public opinion.\n</ref>\nThe model therefore attempts to describe how the media form a decentralized and non-conspiratorial but nonetheless very powerful propaganda system that is able to mobilize an \"\u00e9lite\" consensus, frame public debate within \"\u00e9lite\" perspectives and at the same time give the appearance of democratic consent.\n\n=== Views on the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn ===\nIn May 2017, Chomsky endorsed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the forthcoming [[2017 United Kingdom general election|UK general election]] saying, \"If I were a voter in Britain, I would vote for him [Jeremy Corbyn].\" He claimed that Corbyn would be doing better in opinion polls if it was not for the \"bitter\" hostility of the mainstream media, he said, \"If he had a fair treatment from the media \u2013 that would make a big difference.\"<ref name=\"theguardian1\">{{cite news |last=Asthana|first=Anushka|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/19/russell-brand-backs-jeremy-corbyn-in-labour-leadership-race|title=Labour party's future lies with Momentum, says Noam Chomsky|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 May 2017|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2019, along with other public figures, Chomsky signed a letter supporting Corbyn describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\" and endorsed him in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 UK general election]].<ref name=\"nme\">{{cite news |last=Neale|first=Matthew|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/new-letter-supporting-jeremy-corbyn-2568734|title=Exclusive: New letter supporting Jeremy Corbyn signed by Roger Waters, Robert Del Naja and more |work=[[NME]]|location= |date=16 November 2019|accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election.

His father was one of the foremost scholars of the [[Hebrew language]] and taught at a religious school. Chomsky has also had a long fascination with and involvement in [[Zionism|Zionist]] politics. As he described:\n{{quote|I was deeply interested in ... Zionist affairs and activities \u2013 or what was then called 'Zionist,' though the same ideas and concerns are now called 'anti-Zionist.'  I was interested in socialist, binationalist options for Palestine, and in the kibbutzim and the whole cooperative labor system that had developed in the Jewish settlement there (the Yishuv) ... The vague ideas I had at the time [1947] were to go to Palestine, perhaps to a kibbutz, to try to become involved in efforts at Arab-Jewish cooperation within a socialist framework, opposed to the deeply antidemocratic concept of a Jewish state (a position that was considered well within the mainstream of Zionism).<ref>Peck, p. 7</ref>}}\n\nHe is highly critical of the policies of Israel towards the [[Palestinians]] and its Arab neighbors. His book ''[[The Fateful Triangle]]'' is considered one of the premier texts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict among those who oppose Israel's policies in regard to the Palestinians as well as American support for the state of Israel. He has also accused Israel of \"guiding state terrorism\" for [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction#Alleged collaboration with Israel|selling weapons to apartheid South Africa]] and Latin American countries that he characterizes as U.S. [[puppet state]]s, e.g. [[Guatemala]] in the 1980s, as well as U.S.-backed paramilitaries (or, according to Chomsky, [[terrorist]]s) such as the Nicaraguan [[Contras]]. (''What Uncle Sam Really Wants'', Chapter 2.4) Chomsky characterizes Israel as a \"mercenary state\", \"an Israeli Sparta\", and a militarized dependency within a U.S. system of [[hegemony]]. He has also fiercely criticized sectors of the American Jewish community for their role in obtaining U.S. support, stating that \"they should more properly be called 'supporters of the moral degeneration and ultimate destruction of Israel'\" (''Fateful Triangle'', p. &nbsp;4). He says of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL):\n{{quote|The leading official monitor of anti-Semitism, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, interprets anti-Semitism as unwillingness to conform to its requirements with regard to support for Israeli authorities. ... The logic is straightforward: Anti-Semitism is opposition to the interests of Israel (as the ADL sees them). ...  The ADL has virtually abandoned its earlier role as a civil rights organization, becoming 'one of the main pillars' of Israeli propaganda in the U.S., as the Israeli press casually describes it, engaged in surveillance, blacklisting, compilation of FBI-style files circulated to adherents for the purpose of defamation, angry public responses to criticism of Israeli actions, and so on. These efforts, buttressed by insinuations of anti-Semitism or direct accusations, are intended to deflect or undermine opposition to Israeli policies, including Israel's refusal, with U.S. support, to move towards a general political settlement.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/ni/ni-c10-s20.html Necessary Illusions: Appendix V [20/33&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20000308023847/http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/ni/ni-c10-s20.html |date=2000-03-08 }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a 2004 interview with Jennifer Bleyer published The Ugly Planet, issue two<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.uglyplanet.com/issue2.html|title=UGLY PLANET|work=uglyplanet.com}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated4>[http://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/46362.html publish.nyc.indymedia.org | Noam Chomsky Interview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntimc.org/newswire.php?story_id=1348&topic=warandpeace&results_offset=390|title=Replacement Windows Reviews|work=ntimc.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419024705/http://www.ntimc.org/newswire.php?story_id=1348&topic=warandpeace&results_offset=390|archivedate=2012-04-19}}</ref> and in Heeb magazine,<ref name=autogenerated7>[http://www.heebmagazine.com/articles/view/54 Heeb: The Guilt Issue: Weapons of Mass Delusion<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226033528/http://www.heebmagazine.com/articles/view/54 |date=2007-12-26 }}</ref> Chomsky stated:\n\n{{quote|It ends up that about 90% of the land [in Israel] is reserved for people of Jewish race, religion and origin.

There can be no disagreement among decent people on the first two goals: achieving them is an occasion for rejoicing. ... The second goal could surely have been achieved, and possibly the first as well, without undermining the third.

You've written that you don't perceive anti-Semitism as a problem anymore, at least in this country, since its institutional applications and casual manifestations have basically disappeared. Do you still believe that?}}\n{{quote|\nI grew up with anti-Semitism in the United States. We were the only Jewish family in a mostly Irish- and German-Catholic neighborhood, which was very anti-Semitic and pretty pro-Nazi. For a young boy in the streets, you got to know what that meant. When my father was first able to get a secondhand car in the late 30s, we drove to the local mountains and passed hotels that said \"restricted\" meaning \"no Jews\". That was just part of life. When I got to Harvard in the 1950s, the anti-Semitism was so thick you could cut it with a knife. In fact, one of the reasons MIT is a great university is that people like Norbert Wiener couldn't get jobs at Harvard\u2014it was too anti-Semitic\u2014so they came to the engineering school down the street. That was anti-Semitism. Now, it's a very marginal issue. There is still racism, but it's anti-Arab racism which is extreme. Distinguished Harvard professors write that Palestinians are people who bleed and breed their misery in order to drive the Jews into the sea, and that's considered acceptable. If some distinguished Harvard professor were to write that Jews are people who bleed and breed and advertise their misery in order to drive Palestinians into the desert, the cry of outrage would be enormous. When Jewish intellectuals who are regarded as humanist leaders say that Israel ought to settle the underpopulated Galilee\u2014meaning too many Arabs, not enough Jews\u2014that's considered wonderful. Violent anti-Arab racism is so prevalent that we don't even notice it. That's what we should be worried about. It's in the cinema, advertising, everywhere.

The Clinton administration gave crucial support throughout, providing Turkey lavishly with means of destruction. In the single year 1997, Clinton sent more arms to Turkey than the US sent to this major ally during the entire Cold War period combined up to the onset of the counterinsurgency operations. Turkey became the leading recipient of US arms, apart from Israel-Egypt, a separate category. Clinton provided 80% of Turkish arms, doing his utmost to ensure that Turkish violence would succeed. Virtual media silence made a significant contribution to these efforts.| Noam Chomsky, August 9, 2008<ref>[http://globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/185/40706.html Status of Forces Agreement] by Noam Chomsky, August 9, 2008</ref>}}\n\nChomsky has been very critical of Turkey's [[Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey|policies]] in regards to their Kurdish population, while also denouncing the military aid given to the Turkish government by the United States. Such aid Chomsky states allowed Turkey during the 1990s to conduct \"US-backed terrorist campaigns\" in [[Turkish Kurdistan|southeast Turkey]], which Chomsky believes \"rank among the most terrible crimes of the grisly 1990s\", featuring \"tens of thousands dead\" and \"every imaginable form of barbaric torture.\"<ref name = \"HRW02\">[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021228.htm Human Rights Week 2002] by Noam Chomsky, ''[[ZNet]]'', December 28, 2002</ref>\n\n=== Criticism of intellectual communities ===\nChomsky has at times been outspokenly critical of scholars and other public intellectuals; while his views sometimes place him at odds with individuals on particular points, he has also denounced intellectual sub-communities for what he sees as systemic failings. Chomsky sees two broad problems with academic intellectuals generally:\n\n# They largely function as a distinct class, and so distinguish themselves by using language inaccessible to people outside the academy, with more or less deliberately exclusionary effects. In Chomsky's view there is little reason to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation \"intellectual\" obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: \"These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities.  There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine\u2014in fact, I think the opposite. ... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people who are using their minds, then it's all over society\" (''Understanding Power'', p.&nbsp;96).\n# The corollary of this argument is that the privileges enjoyed by intellectuals make them more ideologised and obedient than the rest of society: \"If by 'intellectual' you mean people who are a special class who are in the business of imposing thoughts, and framing ideas for people in power, and telling everyone what they should believe, and so on, well, yeah, that's different. These people are called 'intellectuals'\u2014but they're really more a kind of secular priesthood, whose task is to uphold the doctrinal truths of the society. And the population ''should'' be anti-intellectual in that respect, I think that's a healthy reaction\" (ibid, p.&nbsp;96; this statement continues the previous quotation).\n\nChomsky is elsewhere asked what \"theoretical\" tools he feels can be produced to provide a strong intellectual basis for challenging hegemonic power, and he replies: \"if there is a body of theory, well tested and verified, that applies to the conduct of foreign affairs or the resolution of domestic or international conflict, its existence has been kept a well-guarded secret\", despite much \"pseudo-scientific posturing.\" Chomsky's general preference is, therefore, to use plain language in speaking with a non-elite audience.\n\nThe American Intellectual climate is the focus of \"[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]\", the essay which established Chomsky as one of the leading political philosophers in the second half of the 20th century. Chomsky's extensive criticisms of a new type of post-WW2 intellectual he saw arising in the United States were the focus of his book ''American Power and the New Mandarins''. There he described what he saw as the betrayal of the duties of an intellectual to challenge received opinion. The \"new [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarins]]\", who he saw as responsible in part for the Vietnam War, were apologists for [[American imperialism|United States as an imperial power]]; he wrote that their ideology demonstrated\n\n{{quote|the mentality of the colonial civil servant, persuaded of the benevolence of the mother country and the correctness of its vision of world order, and convinced that he understands the true interests of the backward peoples whose welfare he is to administer.}}\n\nChomsky has shown cynicism towards the credibility of [[postmodernism]] and [[poststructuralism]]. In particular he has criticised the Parisian intellectual community; the following disclaimer may be taken as indicative: \"I wouldn't say this if I hadn't been explicitly asked for my opinion \u2013 and if asked to back it up, I'm going to respond that I don't think it merits the time to do so\" (''ibid''). Chomsky's lack of interest arises from what he sees as a combination of difficult language and limited intellectual or \"real world\" value, especially in Parisian academe: \"Sometimes it gets kind of comical, say in post-modern discourse. Especially around Paris, it has become a comic strip, I mean it's all gibberish ... they try to decode it and see what is the actual meaning behind it, things that you could explain to an eight-year old child. There's nothing there.\" (Chomsky on Anarchism, pg. 216). This is exacerbated, in his view, by the attention paid to academics by the French press: \"in France if you're part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there's a front-page story in ''[[Le Monde]]''. That's one of the reasons why French intellectual culture is so farcical \u2013 it's like [[Hollywood]]\" (Understanding Power, pg. 96).\n\nChomsky made a 1971 appearance on Dutch television with [[Michel Foucault]], the full text of which can be found in ''Foucault and his Interlocutors'', Arnold Davidson (ed.), 1997 ({{ISBN|0-226-13714-7}}). Of Foucault, Chomsky wrote that:\n\n{{quote|... with enough effort, one can extract from his writings some interesting insights and observations, peeling away the framework of obfuscation that is required for respectability in the strange world of intellectuals, which takes on extreme forms in the weird culture of postwar Paris. Foucault is unusual among Paris intellectuals in that at least something is left when one peels this away.<ref>quoted in {{cite web|url=http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/5/8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104202047/http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/5/8.html |archivedate=2006-01-04 }} ''Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent''</ref>}}\n\n===Views on the Sri Lanka conflict===\nChomsky supports the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamils]]' right to self-determination in [[Tamil Eelam]], their homeland in the North and East of Sri Lanka. In a February 2009 interview, he said of the Tamil Eelam struggle: \"Parts of Europe, for example, are moving towards more federal arrangements. In Spain, for example, Catalonia by now has a high degree of autonomy within the Spanish state. The Basque Country also has a high degree of autonomy. In England, Wales and Scotland in the United Kingdom are moving towards a form of autonomy and self-determination and I think there are similar developments throughout Europe. Though they're mixed with a lot of pros and cons, but by and large I think it is a generally healthy development. I mean, the people have different interests, different cultural backgrounds, different concerns, and there should be special arrangements to allow them to pursue their special interests and concerns in harmony with others.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2009/feb/19noam-chomsky-talks-on-lanka-ltte-obama-and-bush.htm|title=What Noam Chomsky says about Lankan conflict|work=rediff.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a September 2009 submitted Sri Lankan Crisis Statement, Chomsky was one of several signatories calling for full access to [[internment camps]] holding Tamils, the respect of international law concerning prisoners of war and media freedom, the condemnation of discrimination against Tamils by the state since independence from Britain, and to urge the international community to support and facilitate a political solution that addresses the self-determination aspirations of Tamils and protection of the human rights of all Sri Lankans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fastuntoaction.wordpress.com/sri-lanka-crisis-statement-of-support/|title=SLCS signed by Noam Chomsky|work=Australians for Tamil Justice|date=28 May 2009}}</ref> A major offensive against the Tamils in the [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] region of their homeland in 2009 resulted in the deaths of at least 20,000 Tamil civilians in 5 months, amid widespread concerns war crimes were committed against the Tamil population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6391265.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk}}</ref> At a United Nations forum on [[R2P]], the [[Responsibility to Protect]] doctrine established by the UN in 2005, Chomsky said:\n\n{{quote|...

When asked his opinion on capital punishment in [[Noam Chomsky bibliography|''Secrets, Lies, and Democracy'']], he stated:\n{{quote|It's a crime.

On copyright he argued in a 2009 interview:\n\n{{quote|[T]here are better ways. For example, it should be, in a free democratic society, a sort of responsibility arrived at by democratic decision to maintain adequate support for creative arts as we do for science.

As Chomsky says: \"[MIT] was a Pentagon-based university. And I was at a military-funded lab.\"<ref>Noam Chomsky (1996). ''Class Warfare: Interviews with David Barsamian''. Pluto Press. p. 102. Chomsky says, referring to the 1960s, that MIT was \"about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was right in the middle of it. I was in a military lab. If you take a look at my early publications, they all say something about Air Force, Navy, and so on, because I was in a military lab, the Research Lab for Electronics.\" G.D. White (2000). ''Campus Inc.: Corporate power in the ivory tower''. Prometheus Books. pp. 445-6.</ref> Having kept quiet about his anti-militarist views in the early years of his career at MIT, Chomsky became more vocal as the war in Vietnam intensified.

In the first, he wrote that he had \"given a good bit of thought to ... resigning from MIT, which is, more than any other university associated with the activities of the Department of 'Defense'.\" He also stated that MIT's \"involvement in the [Vietnam] war effort is tragic and indefensible.\" Then, in the second letter written to clarify the first, Chomsky said that \"MIT as an institution has no involvement in the war effort. Individuals at MIT, as elsewhere, have direct involvement and that is what I had in mind.\"<ref>Chris Knight (2016). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''.

Barsky'], ''New Politics'', Vol.6(3), Issue 23. Retrieved 2016-10-7.</ref> Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but disagreed with their immediate aims. In opposition to the radical students, he argued that it was best to keep military research on campus rather than having it moved away. Against the students' campaign to close down all war-related research, he argued for restricting such research to \"systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character\".<ref>Barsky 1997, pp. 121-2, 140-1; Albert 2006, p. 98; Knight 2016, p. 34.</ref> MIT's student president at this time, [[Michael Albert]], has described this position as, in effect, \"preserving war research with modest amendments\".<ref>Albert 2006, p. 98.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, MIT had six students sentenced to prison terms, prompting Chomsky to say that MIT's students suffered things that \"should not have happened\". Despite this, he has described MIT as \"the freest and the most honest and has the best relations between faculty and students than at any other ... [with] quite a good record on civil liberties.\"<ref>Albert 2006, pp. 107-8; Knight 2016, pp. 36-8, 249.</ref> Chomsky's differences with student activists at this time led to what he has called \"considerable conflict\". He described the rebellions across US campuses as \"largely misguided\" and he was unimpressed by the student uprising of May 1968 in Paris, saying, \"I paid virtually no attention to what was going on in Paris as you can see from what I wrote - rightly, I think.\"<ref>Barsky 1997, pp. 121-2, 131.</ref> On the other hand, Chomsky was also very grateful to the students for raising the issue of the war in Vietnam.\n\nChomsky's particular interpretation of academic freedom led him to give support to some of MIT's more militaristic academics, even though he disagreed with their actions. For example, in 1969, when he heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at the university, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was \"denied a position at MIT.\" In 1989, Chomsky then gave support to a long-standing Pentagon adviser, John Deutch, by backing his candidacy for President of MIT.

The government was unmoved by protest, the people were uninformed and apathetic, and American technology was tearing Vietnam apart. What, then, was their responsibility? Noam Chomsky explored this problem in February 1967 in the ''New York Review'', which had become the favorite journal of the radicals. By virtue of their training and leisure, intellectuals had a greater responsibility than ordinary citizens for the actions of the state, Chomsky said. It was their special responsibility 'to speak the truth and expose lies' ... [Chomsky] concluded by quoting an essay written twenty years before by Dwight Macdonald, an essay that implied that in time of crisis exposing lies might not be enough. 'Only those who are willing to resist authority themselves when it conflicts too intolerably with their personal moral code', Macdonald had written, 'only they have the right to condemn'. Chomsky's article was immediately recognized as an important intellectual event. Along with the radical students, radical intellectuals were moving 'from protest to resistance.'}}\n\nA contemporary reaction came from New York University Professor of Philosophy Emeritus Raziel Abielson:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/12102|title=The Responsibility of Intellectuals by Raziel Abelson|work=nybooks.com}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...

William Fulbright]].\n\nChomsky's view of the war is different from orthodox anti-war opinion which holds the war as a tragic mistake. He argues that the war was a success from the US point of view. According to Chomsky's view the main aim of US policy was the destruction of the nationalist movements in the Vietnamese peasantry. In particular he argues that US attacks were not a defense of South Vietnam against the North but began directly in the early 1960s (covert US intervention from the 1950s) and at that time were mostly aimed at South Vietnam. He agrees with the view of orthodox historians that the US government was concerned about the possibility of a \"domino effect\" in South-East Asia. At this point Chomsky diverts from orthodox opinion \u2013 he holds that the US government was not so concerned with the spread of state Communism and authoritarianism but rather of nationalist movements that would not be sufficiently subservient to US economic interests.\n\n===Doubting genocide in Cambodia===\n{{main|Cambodian genocide denial}}\nThe [[Khmer Rouge]] (KR) communists took power in Cambodia in April 1975 and expelled all citizens of Western countries. The only sources of information about the country were a few thousand refugees who escaped to Thailand and the official pronouncements of the KR government. The refugees told stories of mass murders perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge and widespread starvation. Many leftist academics praised the Khmer Rouge and discounted the stories of the refugees.\n\nIn July 1978, Chomsky and his collaborator, Edward S. Herman jumped into the controversy. Chomsky and Herman reviewed three books about Cambodia. Two of the books by [[John Barron (journalist)|John Barron]] (and [[Anthony Paul]]) and [[Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud]] were based on interviews with Cambodian refugees and concluded that the Khmer Rouge had killed or been responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians. The third book, by scholars [[Gareth Porter]] and [[George Hildebrand]], described the KR in highly favorable terms. Chomsky and Herman called Barron and Paul's book \"third rate propaganda\" and part of a \"vast and unprecedented propaganda campaign\" against the KR. He said Ponchaud was \"worth reading\" but unreliable. Chomsky said that refugee stories of KR atrocities should be treated with great \"care and caution\" as no independent verification was available. By contrast, Chomsky was highly favorable toward the book by Porter and Hildebrand, which portrayed Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge as a \"bucolic idyll.\" Chomsky also opined that the documentation of Gareth Porter's book was superior to that of Ponchaud's, despite almost all of the references cited by Porter coming from Khmer Rouge documents while Ponchaud's came from speaking to Cambodian refugees.<ref>\"An Exchange on Cambodia\" New York Review of Books, July 20, 1978, http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1978/jul/20/an-exchange-on-cambodia/?pagination=false, accessed 25 May 2013</ref>\n\nChomsky and Herman later co-authored a book about Cambodia titled ''After the Cataclysm'' (1979), which appeared after the Khmer Rouge regime had been deposed. The book was described by Cambodian scholar [[Sophal Ear]] as \"one of the most supportive books of the Khmer revolution\" in which they \"perform what amounts to a defense of the Khmer Rouge cloaked in an attack on the media\".<ref name=\"Sear\">Sophal Ear [http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~sophal/canon.pdf \"The Kymer Rouge Canon 1975-1979: The Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122012256/http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~sophal/canon.pdf |date=2012-01-22 }}, Undergraduate Political Science Honor Thesis, Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley, May 1995, p.42, 63</ref> In the book, Chomsky and Herman acknowledged that \"The record of atrocities in Cambodia is substantial and often gruesome\", but questioned their scale, which may have been inflated \"by a factor of 100\". Khmer Rouge agricultural policies reportedly produced \"spectacular\" results.\"<ref>Chomsky and Herman (1979), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EH00v6lNzb4C&q=138#v=snippet&q=138&f=false ''After the Cataclysm''], South End Press, pp. 136, 138-9, 160, 287, 158, 152.</ref>\n\nContrary to Chomsky and Herman, the reports of massive Khmer Rouge atrocities and starvation in Cambodia proved to be accurate and uninflated. Many deniers or doubters of the Cambodian genocide recanted their previous opinions, but Chomsky continued to insist that his analysis of Cambodia was without error based on the information available to him at the time.<ref>Sharp, Bruce \"Averaging Wrong Answers: Noam Chomsky and the Cambodian Controversy\" http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm#chx, accessed 25 May 2013</ref>  Herman addressed critics in 2001: \"Chomsky and I found that the very asking of questions about ... the victims in the anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda campaign of 1975\u20131979 was unacceptable, and was treated almost without exception as 'apologetics for Pol Pot'.\"<ref>Edward S. Herman [http://www.zcommunications.org/propaganda-system-number-one-by-edward-herman \"Propaganda System Number One: From Diem and Arbenz to Milosevic\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416061343/http://www.zcommunications.org/propaganda-system-number-one-by-edward-herman |date=2013-04-16 }}, ''Z magazine'' (Z communications website), September 2001</ref>\n\nChomsky's biographers look at this issue in different ways. In ''Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent'', [[Robert Barsky]] focuses on [[Steven Lukes]]' critique of Chomsky in ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]''. Barsky cites Lukes' claim that, obsessed by his opposition to the United States' role in [[Indochina]], Chomsky had \"lost all sense of perspective\" when it came to Pol Pot's Cambodia.\n\nBarsky responds to this by pointing out that Lukes ignores the fact that the references to Pol Pot in ''After the Cataclysm'' were primarily about comparing Pol Pot's mass killings to the contemporaneous mass killings in East Timor. Barsky then cites a rather harsh comment by Chomsky in which he says that, by making no mention of this, Lukes is demonstrating himself to be an apologist for the crimes in Timor. That is elementary logic: if a comparison of Pol Pot to Timor is apologetics for Pol Pot, as Lukes claims, then it must be that the crimes in Timor were insignificant. Lukes, then, is an apologist for the worst slaughter relative to population since the Holocaust. Barsky concludes that the vigor of Chomsky's remarks \"reflects the contempt that he feels\" for all such arguments.'<ref>Robert Barsky, (1997). ''Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent''. MIT Press. pp. 187-8.</ref>\n\nIn ''Decoding Chomsky'', [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] takes a rather different approach. He claims that because Chomsky never felt comfortable about working in a military-funded laboratory at MIT, he was reluctant to be too critical of any regime that was being targeted by that same military. Knight writes that \"while Chomsky has denounced the Russian Bolsheviks of 1917, he has been less hostile towards the so-called communist regimes which later took power in Asia. ... He also seemed reluctant to acknowledge the full horror of the 'communist' regime in Cambodia. The explanation I favour is that it pained Chomsky's conscience to denounce people anywhere who were being threatened by the very war machine that was funding his research.\"<ref>Chris Knight (2016). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''. Yale University Press. pp. 261.</ref>\n\nScholar and former Cambodia refugee, [[Sophal Ear]], has reacted personally to Chomsky's views about Cambodia. \"While my family worked and died in rice fields,\" Ear said, \"Chomsky sharpened his theories and amended his arguments while seated in his armchair in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] ... the peasants of Indochina, will write no memoirs and will be forgotten ... For decades, Chomsky has vilified his critics as only a world class linguist can. However, for me and the surviving members of my family, questions about life under the Khmer Rouge are not intellectual parlour games.\"<ref>{{cite web| title =Cambodian Refugee Sophal Ear vs. Noam Chomsky| work =Arguments Worth Having| url =http://argumentsworthhaving.com/2014/03/09/cambodian-refugee-sophal-ear-vs-noam-chomsky/ |url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140310024018/http://argumentsworthhaving.com/2014/03/09/cambodian-refugee-sophal-ear-vs-noam-chomsky/| archivedate= 10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== East Timor activism ===\nIn 1975, the Indonesian army, under the command of President [[Suharto]], invaded [[East Timor]], occupying it until 1999, which resulted in between 80,000 and 200,000 East Timorese deaths.<ref name=\"hrdag\">{{cite web\n |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group \n |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 \n |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste \n |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) \n |date=9 February 2006 \n |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml \n |archivedate=22 February 2012 \n}}</ref> A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] cited a lower range of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974\u20131999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness.<ref name=\"hrdag\" /> The former figure is considered \"proportionately comparable\" to the [[Cambodian genocide]] though the total deaths in the latter were incomparably more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/gsp/publications/KiernanRevised1.pdf |title=Welcome &#124; Genocide Studies Program |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref>\n\nChomsky argued that decisive military, financial and diplomatic support was provided to Suharto's regime, by successive U.S. administrations; beginning with [[Gerald Ford]] who, with [[Henry Kissinger]] as Secretary of State, provided a 'green light' to the invasion.

At this time Chomsky chose to remind Americans of the three principal reasons why he felt they should care about East Timor:\n\n{{quote|First, since the Indonesian invasion of December 1975, East Timor has been the site of some of the worst atrocities of the modern era \u2013 atrocities which are mounting again right now. Second, the US government has played a decisive role in escalating these atrocities and can easily act to mitigate or terminate them. It is not necessary to bomb Jakarta or impose economic sanctions. Throughout, it would have sufficed for Washington to withdraw support and to inform its Indonesian client that the game was over. That remains true as the situation reaches a crucial turning point \u2013 the third reason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19990826.htm|title=Why Americans Should Care about East Timor, by Noam Chomsky|work=chomsky.info}}</ref>}}\n\nWeeks later, following the independence vote, the Indonesian military drove \"hundreds of thousands from their homes and destroying most of the country.

His speeches and publications on this topic were prodigious and widely read, but his financial support is less well known. When the US media were refusing to interview Timorese refugees, claiming that they had no access to them, Chomsky personally paid for the airfares of several refugees, bringing them from [[Lisbon]] to the US, where he tried to get them into the editorial offices of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other outlets. Most of his financial commitment to such causes has \u2013 because of his own reticence \u2013 gone unnoticed.

Prosecutors cited the following passages as particularly offensive:\n\n{{quote|In 1984, the Turkish government launched a major war in the Southeast against the Kurdish population. And that continued. In fact it's still continuing.}}\n\n{{quote|If we look at US military aid to Turkey-which is usually a pretty good index of policy-Turkey was of course a strategic ally so it always had a fairly high level of military aid. But the aid shot up in 1984, at the time that the counterinsurgency war began. This had nothing to do with Cold War, transparently. It was because of the counterinsurgency war. The aid remained high, peaking through the 1990s as the atrocities increased. The peak year was 1997. In fact in the single year 1997, US military aid to Turkey was greater than in the entire period of 1950 to 1983 when there were allegedly Cold War issues. The end result was pretty awesome: tens of thousands of people killed, two to three million refugees, massive ethnic cleansing with some 3500 villages destroyed-about seven times Kosovo under NATO bombing, and there's nobody bombing in this case, except for the Turkish air forces using planes that Clinton sent to them with the certain knowledge that that's how they would be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/talks/20010304.htm|title=Prospects for Peace in the Middle East, by Noam Chomsky (Talk delivered at the University of Toledo)|work=chomsky.info}}</ref>}}\n\nAt the request of Turkish activists, Chomsky petitioned the Turkish courts to name him as a co-defendant.

However, his recorded lectures are regularly replayed by NPR stations in the United States that carry the broadcasts of Alternative Radio, a syndicator of progressive lectures. Critics of Chomsky have argued his mainstream media coverage is adequate, and not unusual considering the fact that academics in general often receive low priority in the American media.\n\nWhen CNN presenter [[Jeff Greenfield]] was asked why Chomsky was never on his show, he claimed that Chomsky might \"be one of the leading intellectuals who can't talk on television.  ... If you['ve] got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, ... he's out\".<ref>\"He may be one of the leading intellectuals who can't talk on television.

One of the reasons why Nightline has the \"usual suspects\" is that one of the things you have to do when you book a show is know that the person can make the point within the framework of television.  And if people don't like that, they should understand that it's about as sensible to book somebody who will take eight minutes to give an answer as it is to book somebody who doesn't speak English.\" {{cite web|url=http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter9.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923193416/http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter9.htm |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}</ref> Greenfield described this need to \"say things between two commercials\" as the media's requirement for \"[[concision]]\". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that \"the beauty of [concision] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, and a whole lot of it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical.\" He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they \"would sound like they were from Neptune.\" For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.\n\nSince his book ''9-11'' became a bestseller in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Chomsky has attracted more attention from the mainstream American media.

He uses a [[definitions of terrorism|definition of terrorism]] from a [[US army]] manual, which defines it as \"the calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature. This is done through intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear.\"<ref>US Army Operational Concept for Terrorism Counteraction_ (TRADOC Pamphlet No. 525-37), 1984.</ref> In relation to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]] he stated:\n\n{{quote|Wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism, not a war against terrorism.

Secondly, it's a very serious analytic error to say, as is commonly done, that terrorism is the weapon of the weak. Like other means of violence, it's primarily a weapon of the strong, overwhelmingly, in fact. It is held to be a weapon of the weak because the strong also control the doctrinal systems and their terror doesn't count as terror. Now that's close to universal. I can't think of a historical exception; even the worst mass murderers view the world that way. So take the Nazis. They weren't carrying out terror in occupied Europe. They were protecting the local population from the terrorisms of the partisans. And like other resistance movements, there was terrorism. The Nazis were carrying out counter terror.<ref name=\"chomsky011018\">{{cite web|url=https://chomsky.info/20011018-2/|title=The New War Against Terror |last=Chomsky|first=Noam|date=October 18, 2001|publisher=chomsky.info // Delivered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n}}\nAs regards support for condemnation of terrorism, Chomsky opines that terrorism (and violence/authority in general) is generally bad and can only be justified in those cases where it is clear that greater terrorism (or violence, or abuse of authority) is thus avoided. In a debate on the legitimacy of political violence in 1967, Chomsky argued that the \"terror\" of the [[Vietnam National Liberation Front]] (Viet Cong) was not justified, but that terror could in theory be justified under certain circumstances:\n\n{{quote|I don't accept the view that we can just condemn the NLF terror, period, because it was so horrible.

And if we are going to take a moral position on this\u2014 and I think we should\u2014we have to ask both what the consequences were of using terror and not using terror. If it were true that the consequences of not using terror would be that the peasantry in Vietnam would continue to live in the state of the peasantry of the Philippines, then I think the use of terror would be justified.

Chomsky gives reasons for directing his activist efforts to the state of which he is a citizen. He believes that his work can have more impact when directed at his own government, and that he holds a responsibility as a member of a particular country of origin to work to stop that country from committing crimes. He expresses this idea often with a comparison of other countries holding that every country has flexibility to address crimes by unfavored countries, but is always unwilling to deal with their own. Speaking in Nicaragua in 1986, Chomsky was asked \"We feel that through what you say and write you are our friend but at the same time you talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath. I ask you how you can use the same arguments as reactionaries?\" to which Chomsky responded,\n\n{{quote|I have been accused of everything and that therefore includes being a reactionary. From my personal experience there are two countries in which my political writings can basically not appear. One is the U.S. within the mainstream with very rare exceptions. The other is the USSR. I think what we ought to do is to try to understand the truth about the world. And the truth about the world is usually quite unpleasant. My own concern is primarily the terror and violence carried out by my own state, for two reasons. For one thing, because it happens to be the larger component of international violence. But also for a much more important reason than that; namely, I can do something about it. So even if the U.S. was responsible for 2 percent of the violence in the world instead of the majority of it, it would be that 2 percent I would be primarily responsible for. And that is a simple ethical judgment. That is, the ethical value of one's actions depends on their anticipated and predictable consequences. It is very easy to denounce the atrocities of someone else. That has about as much ethical value as denouncing atrocities that took place in the 18th century.}}\n\n{{quote|The point is that the useful and significant political actions are those that have consequences for human beings. And those are overwhelmingly the actions which you have some way of influencing and controlling, which mean for me, American actions.

One of the key things superpowers do, Chomsky argues, is try to organize the world according to the interests of their establishment, using military and economic means. Chomsky has repeatedly emphasized that the overall framework of US foreign policy can be explained by the domestic dominance of US business interests and a drive to secure the [[state capitalist]] system. Those interests set the political agenda and the economic goals that aim primarily at US economic dominance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chomsky |first=Noam |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200310--.htm |title=Dominance and its Dilemmas, by Noam Chomsky |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref>\n\nHis conclusion is that a consistent part of the United States' foreign policy is based on stemming the \"threat of a good example.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Chomsky |first=Noam |url=http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm |title=The Threat of a Good Example, by Noam Chomsky (Excerpted from What Uncle Sam Really Wants) |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref> This 'threat' refers to the possibility that a country could successfully develop outside the US-managed global system, thus presenting a model for other countries, including countries in which the United States has strong economic interests. This, Chomsky says, has prompted the United States to repeatedly intervene to quell \"independent development, regardless of ideology\" in regions of the world where it has little economic or safety interests. In one of his works, ''What Uncle Sam Really Wants'', Chomsky argues that this particular explanation accounts in part for the United States' interventions in [[Operation PBSUCCESS|Guatemala]], [[Laos]], [[Contras|Nicaragua]], and [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]], countries that pose no military threat to the US and have economic resources that are not important to the US establishment.<ref>{{cite book |title= What Uncle Sam Really Wants |last= Chomsky |first= Noam |authorlink= Noam Chomsky |year= 1992 |publisher= Odonian Press |isbn= 1-878825-01-1 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/whatunclesamreal00chom/page/22 22\u201325] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/whatunclesamreal00chom/page/22 }}</ref>\n\nChomsky claims that the US government's [[Cold War]] policies were not primarily shaped by anti-Soviet paranoia, but rather toward preserving the United States' ideological and economic dominance in the world.  In his book ''[[Deterring Democracy]]'' he argues that the conventional understanding of the Cold War as a confrontation of two superpowers is an \"ideological construct.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zcomm.org/deterring-democracy/ |title=ZCommunications \u00bb Deterring Democracy |publisher=Zcomm.org |date=2013-02-07 |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref> He insists that to truly understand the Cold War one must examine the underlying motives of the major powers.  Those underlying motives can only be discovered by analyzing the domestic politics, especially the goals of the domestic elites in each country:\n\n{{quote|Putting second order complexities to the side, for the USSR the Cold War has been primarily a war against its satellites, and for the U.S. a war against the Third World. For each, it has served to entrench a particular system of domestic privilege and coercion. The policies pursued within the Cold War framework have been unattractive to the general population, which accepts them only under duress. Throughout history, the standard device to mobilize a reluctant population has been the fear of an evil enemy, dedicated to its destruction. The superpower conflict served the purpose admirably, both for internal needs, as we see in the fevered rhetoric of top planning documents such as [[NSC 68]], and in public propaganda. The Cold War had a functional utility for the superpowers, one reason why it persisted.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/CHOMSKY/dd/dd-c01-s07.html Deterring Democracy: Chapter 1 [7/20&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20020328110834/http://www.zmag.org/CHOMSKY/dd/dd-c01-s07.html |date=2002-03-28 }}</ref>}}\n\nChomsky says the [[Economy of the United States|US economic system]] is primarily a state capitalist system, in which public funds are used to research and develop pioneering technology (the computer, the internet, radar, the jet plane etc.) largely in the form of defense spending, and once developed and mature these technologies are turned over to the corporate sector where civilian uses are developed for private control and profit.<ref>Z Magazine February 1993, \"The Pentagon System\"</ref>\n\nChomsky often expresses his admiration for the [[civil liberties]] enjoyed by US citizens. According to Chomsky, other Western democracies such as France and Canada are less liberal in their defense of controversial speech than the US. However, he does not credit the American government for these freedoms but rather mass social movements in the United States that fought for them. The movements he most often credits are the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement, the movements for [[workers' rights]] and [[trade union]] organization, and the fight for [[African-American]] [[civil rights]]. Chomsky is often sharply critical of other governments who suppress [[free speech]], most controversially in the [[Faurisson affair]] but also of the suppression of free speech in Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chomsky |first=Noam |url=http://www.chomsky.info/talks/20101010.htm |title=Final Remarks, Istanbul Conference on Freedom of Speech |publisher=Chomsky.info |date=2010-04-10 |accessdate=2015-04-25}}</ref>\n\nAt the fifth annual Edward W.

On November 16, 1989, the US-armed [[Atlacatl Battalion]] in [[El Salvador]] assassinated six leading Latin American Jesuit priests, he explained. He contrasted the US' \"self-congratulation\" of the Berlin Wall destruction with the \"resounding silence\" that surrounds the assassination of these priests, contending that the US sacrifices democratic principles for its own self-interest, and without any self-criticism it tends to \"focus a laser light on the crimes of enemies, but crucially we make sure to never look at ourselves.\"<ref>[http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2009/12/04/chomsky-speaks-us-imperialism Claire Luchette \"Chomsky speaks on U.S. imperialism \u2013 Noam Chomsky delivered the Edward W.

He summarized the process with the phrase \"old wine, new bottles\", maintaining that the motive of the \u00e9lites is the same as always: they seek to isolate the general population from important decision-making processes, the difference being that the centers of power are now [[transnational corporation]]s and supranational banks. Chomsky argues that transnational corporate power is \"developing its own governing institutions\" reflective of their global reach.<ref name=autogenerated9>[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/talks/9302-uva.html Old Wine, New Bottles<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010916112914/http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/talks/9302-uva.html |date=2001-09-16 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Chomsky, a primary ploy has been the co-opting of the global economic institutions established at the end of World War II, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]], which have increasingly adhered to the \"[[Washington Consensus]]\", requiring [[developing countries]] to adhere to limits on spending and make structural adjustments that often involve cutbacks in social and welfare programs. IMF aid and loans are normally contingent upon such reforms. Chomsky claims that the construction of global institutions and agreements such as the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] constitute new ways of securing \u00e9lite privileges while undermining democracy.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/9303-nation-nafta.html Notes of NAFTA: The Masters of Man<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020918110938/http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/9303-nation-nafta.html |date=2002-09-18 }}</ref>\nChomsky believes that these austere and [[neoliberal]] measures ensure that poorer countries merely fulfill a service role by providing cheap labor, raw materials and investment opportunities for the [[developed world]]. Additionally, this means that corporations can threaten to relocate to poorer countries, and Chomsky sees this as a powerful weapon to keep workers in richer countries in line.\n\nChomsky takes issue with the terms used in discourse on globalization, beginning with the term \"globalization\" itself, which he maintains refers to a corporate-sponsored economic integration rather than being a general term for things becoming international. He dislikes the term [[anti-globalization]] being used to describe what he regards as a movement for globalization of [[Social justice|social]] and [[environmental justice]]. Chomsky understands what is popularly called \"[[free trade]]\" as a \"mixture of liberalization and protection designed by the principal architects of policy in the service of their interests, which happen to be whatever they are in any particular period.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 />\nIn his writings, Chomsky has drawn attention to globalization resistance movements. He described [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] defiance of NAFTA in his essay \"The Zapatista Uprising.\" He also criticized the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, and reported on the activist efforts that led to its defeat. Chomsky's voice was an important part of the critics who provided the theoretical backbone for the disparate groups who united for the [[demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle]] in November 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/july00barsamian.htm |title=The Meaning of Seattle: An Interview With Noam Chomsky |last1=Barsamian |first1=David |date=July 2000 |website=www.zmag.org |access-date=July 31, 2016 |quote=What was interesting in Seattle was, first of all, the events reflected very extensive programs of education and organizing ...

He supports many of [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s anarchist (or [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]]) ideas. Chomsky has identified Bakunin's comments regarding the totalitarian state as predictions for the brutal Soviet [[police state]] that would come in essays like ''[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1986----.htm The Soviet Union Versus Socialism]''.  He has also defined [[Soviet communism]] as \"fake socialism\", particularly because any socialism worthy of the name requires authentic democratic control of production and resources as well as public ownership. He has said that contrary to what many in America claim, the collapse of the Soviet Union should be regarded as \"a small victory for socialism\", not capitalism.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/86-soviet-socialism.html Soviet Union Versus Socialism<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020918110940/http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/86-soviet-socialism.html |date=2002-09-18 }}</ref> Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chomsky explicitly condemned Soviet imperialism; for example in 1986 during a question/answer following a lecture he gave at Universidad Centroamericana in Nicaragua, when challenged by an audience member about how he could \"talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath\", Chomsky responded: \"One of the truths about the world is that there are two superpowers, one a\nhuge power which happens to have its boot on your neck, another, a smaller power which happens to have its boot on other people's necks. And I think that anyone in the Third World would be making a grave error if they succumbed to illusions about these matters.\"<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nChomsky was also impressed with socialism as practiced in Vietnam. In a speech given in [[Hanoi]] on April 13, 1970, and broadcast by [[Radio Hanoi]] the next day, Chomsky spoke of his \"admiration for the people of Vietnam who have been able to defend themselves against the ferocious attack, and at the same time take great strides forward toward the socialist society.\" Chomsky praised the North Vietnamese for their efforts in building material prosperity, social justice, and cultural progress. He also went on to discuss and support the political writing of [[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n]].<ref>-Pacific Daily Report of the U.S. government's Foreign Broadcast Information Service, April 16, 1970, pages K2-K3</ref>\n\nIn his 1973 book ''For Reasons of State'', Chomsky argues that instead of a capitalist system in which people are \"[[wage slavery|wage slaves]]\" or an authoritarian system in which decisions are made by a centralized committee, a society could function with no paid labor.  He argues that a nation's populace should be free to pursue jobs of their choosing. People will be free to do as they like, and the work they voluntarily choose will be both \"rewarding in itself\" and \"socially useful.\" Society would be run under a system of peaceful [[anarchism]], with no state or other authoritarian institutions. Work that was fundamentally distasteful to all, if any existed, would be distributed equally among everyone.<ref name=Peter-1976>Chomsky explains anarchism (5 parts): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW7nnLNANtQ 1] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnBnloqzGkE 2] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NFdmqxisfQ 3] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8M0UTtfkAI 4] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6HTQ6mtFqQ 5]</ref>\n\nChomsky was always critical of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, in the tens of millions'.<ref>Truth-out.org interview with C.J.Polychroniou, 17/7/16</ref> However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less critical of the communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, \"I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There are many things to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable.\" Chomsky continued: \"There are even better examples than China. But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which a good deal of the collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step.\"<ref name=autogenerated5 /> He said of Vietnam: \"Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10869|title=A Special Supplement: In North Vietnam by Noam Chomsky|work=nybooks.com|date=13 August 1970|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam}}</ref>\nIn the context of remarks on the topic of [[peak oil]] in April 2005, Chomsky stated \"China is probably the most polluted country in the world \u2013 you can't see.

He has been reticent about theorizing an anarchist society in detail, although he has outlined its likely value systems and institutional framework in broad terms. According to Chomsky, the variety of [[anarchism]] which he favors is:<ref name=\"Peter-1976\" />\n{{quote|... a kind of voluntary socialism, that is, as libertarian socialist or anarcho-syndicalist or communist anarchist, in the tradition of, say, Bakunin and Kropotkin and others. They had in mind a highly organized form of society, but a society that was organized on the basis of organic units, organic communities. And generally, they meant by that the workplace and the neighborhood, and from those two basic units there could derive through federal arrangements a highly integrated kind of social organization which might be national or even international in scope. And these decisions could be made over a substantial range, but by delegates who are always part of the organic community from which they come, to which they return, and in which, in fact, they live.}}On the question of the government of political and economic institutions, Chomsky has consistently emphasized the importance of grassroots democratic forms. Accordingly, current Anglo-American institutions of representative democracy \"would be criticized by an anarchist of this school on two grounds.

Herman]] and Chomsky's book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'' explores this topic and presents their \"[[propaganda model]]\" hypothesis as a basis to understand the news media with several case studies to support it. According to their propaganda model, more democratic societies like the U.S. use subtle, non-violent means of control, unlike totalitarian societies, where physical force can readily be used to coerce the general population. Chomsky asserts that \"propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state\" (''Media Control'').\n\nThe model attempts to explain such a [[systemic bias]] in terms of structural economic causes rather than a conspiracy of people. It argues the bias derives from five \"filters\" that all published news must pass through which combine to systematically distort news coverage.\n\n# The first filter, ownership, notes that most major media outlets are owned by large corporations.\n# The second, funding, notes that the outlets derive the majority of their funding from advertising, not readers. Thus, since they are profit-oriented businesses selling a product\u2014readers and audiences\u2014to other businesses (advertisers), the model would expect them to publish news which would reflect the desires and values of those businesses.\n# In addition, the news media are dependent on government institutions and major businesses with strong biases as sources (the third filter) for much of their information.\n# Flak, the fourth filter, refers to the various [[pressure group]]s which go after the media for supposed bias and so on when they go out of line.\n# Norms, the fifth filter, refer to the common conceptions shared by those in the profession of journalism.<ref>In the original text, published in 1988, the fifth filter was \"anticommunism\". However, with the fall of the Soviet Union, it has been broadened to allow for shifts in public opinion.\n</ref>\nThe model therefore attempts to describe how the media form a decentralized and non-conspiratorial but nonetheless very powerful propaganda system that is able to mobilize an \"\u00e9lite\" consensus, frame public debate within \"\u00e9lite\" perspectives and at the same time give the appearance of democratic consent.\n\n=== Views on the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn ===\nIn May 2017, Chomsky endorsed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the forthcoming [[2017 United Kingdom general election|UK general election]] saying, \"If I were a voter in Britain, I would vote for him [Jeremy Corbyn].\" He claimed that Corbyn would be doing better in opinion polls if it was not for the \"bitter\" hostility of the mainstream media, he said, \"If he had a fair treatment from the media \u2013 that would make a big difference.\"<ref name=\"theguardian1\">{{cite news |last=Asthana|first=Anushka|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/19/russell-brand-backs-jeremy-corbyn-in-labour-leadership-race|title=Labour party's future lies with Momentum, says Noam Chomsky|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 May 2017|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2019, along with other public figures, Chomsky signed a letter supporting Corbyn describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\" and endorsed him in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 UK general election]].<ref name=\"nme\">{{cite news |last=Neale|first=Matthew|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/new-letter-supporting-jeremy-corbyn-2568734|title=Exclusive: New letter supporting Jeremy Corbyn signed by Roger Waters, Robert Del Naja and more |work=[[NME]]|location= |date=16 November 2019|accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election.

His father was one of the foremost scholars of the [[Hebrew language]] and taught at a religious school. Chomsky has also had a long fascination with and involvement in [[Zionism|Zionist]] politics. As he described:\n{{quote|I was deeply interested in ... Zionist affairs and activities \u2013 or what was then called 'Zionist,' though the same ideas and concerns are now called 'anti-Zionist.'  I was interested in socialist, binationalist options for Palestine, and in the kibbutzim and the whole cooperative labor system that had developed in the Jewish settlement there (the Yishuv) ... The vague ideas I had at the time [1947] were to go to Palestine, perhaps to a kibbutz, to try to become involved in efforts at Arab-Jewish cooperation within a socialist framework, opposed to the deeply antidemocratic concept of a Jewish state (a position that was considered well within the mainstream of Zionism).<ref>Peck, p. 7</ref>}}\n\nHe is highly critical of the policies of Israel towards the [[Palestinians]] and its Arab neighbors. His book ''[[The Fateful Triangle]]'' is considered one of the premier texts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict among those who oppose Israel's policies in regard to the Palestinians as well as American support for the state of Israel. He has also accused Israel of \"guiding state terrorism\" for [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction#Alleged collaboration with Israel|selling weapons to apartheid South Africa]] and Latin American countries that he characterizes as U.S. [[puppet state]]s, e.g. [[Guatemala]] in the 1980s, as well as U.S.-backed paramilitaries (or, according to Chomsky, [[terrorist]]s) such as the Nicaraguan [[Contras]]. (''What Uncle Sam Really Wants'', Chapter 2.4) Chomsky characterizes Israel as a \"mercenary state\", \"an Israeli Sparta\", and a militarized dependency within a U.S. system of [[hegemony]]. He has also fiercely criticized sectors of the American Jewish community for their role in obtaining U.S. support, stating that \"they should more properly be called 'supporters of the moral degeneration and ultimate destruction of Israel'\" (''Fateful Triangle'', p. &nbsp;4). He says of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL):\n{{quote|The leading official monitor of anti-Semitism, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, interprets anti-Semitism as unwillingness to conform to its requirements with regard to support for Israeli authorities. ... The logic is straightforward: Anti-Semitism is opposition to the interests of Israel (as the ADL sees them). ...  The ADL has virtually abandoned its earlier role as a civil rights organization, becoming 'one of the main pillars' of Israeli propaganda in the U.S., as the Israeli press casually describes it, engaged in surveillance, blacklisting, compilation of FBI-style files circulated to adherents for the purpose of defamation, angry public responses to criticism of Israeli actions, and so on. These efforts, buttressed by insinuations of anti-Semitism or direct accusations, are intended to deflect or undermine opposition to Israeli policies, including Israel's refusal, with U.S. support, to move towards a general political settlement.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/ni/ni-c10-s20.html Necessary Illusions: Appendix V [20/33&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20000308023847/http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/ni/ni-c10-s20.html |date=2000-03-08 }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a 2004 interview with Jennifer Bleyer published The Ugly Planet, issue two<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.uglyplanet.com/issue2.html|title=UGLY PLANET|work=uglyplanet.com}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated4>[http://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/46362.html publish.nyc.indymedia.org | Noam Chomsky Interview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntimc.org/newswire.php?story_id=1348&topic=warandpeace&results_offset=390|title=Replacement Windows Reviews|work=ntimc.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419024705/http://www.ntimc.org/newswire.php?story_id=1348&topic=warandpeace&results_offset=390|archivedate=2012-04-19}}</ref> and in Heeb magazine,<ref name=autogenerated7>[http://www.heebmagazine.com/articles/view/54 Heeb: The Guilt Issue: Weapons of Mass Delusion<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226033528/http://www.heebmagazine.com/articles/view/54 |date=2007-12-26 }}</ref> Chomsky stated:\n\n{{quote|It ends up that about 90% of the land [in Israel] is reserved for people of Jewish race, religion and origin.

There can be no disagreement among decent people on the first two goals: achieving them is an occasion for rejoicing. ... The second goal could surely have been achieved, and possibly the first as well, without undermining the third.

You've written that you don't perceive anti-Semitism as a problem anymore, at least in this country, since its institutional applications and casual manifestations have basically disappeared. Do you still believe that?}}\n{{quote|\nI grew up with anti-Semitism in the United States. We were the only Jewish family in a mostly Irish- and German-Catholic neighborhood, which was very anti-Semitic and pretty pro-Nazi. For a young boy in the streets, you got to know what that meant. When my father was first able to get a secondhand car in the late 30s, we drove to the local mountains and passed hotels that said \"restricted\" meaning \"no Jews\". That was just part of life. When I got to Harvard in the 1950s, the anti-Semitism was so thick you could cut it with a knife. In fact, one of the reasons MIT is a great university is that people like Norbert Wiener couldn't get jobs at Harvard\u2014it was too anti-Semitic\u2014so they came to the engineering school down the street. That was anti-Semitism. Now, it's a very marginal issue. There is still racism, but it's anti-Arab racism which is extreme. Distinguished Harvard professors write that Palestinians are people who bleed and breed their misery in order to drive the Jews into the sea, and that's considered acceptable. If some distinguished Harvard professor were to write that Jews are people who bleed and breed and advertise their misery in order to drive Palestinians into the desert, the cry of outrage would be enormous. When Jewish intellectuals who are regarded as humanist leaders say that Israel ought to settle the underpopulated Galilee\u2014meaning too many Arabs, not enough Jews\u2014that's considered wonderful. Violent anti-Arab racism is so prevalent that we don't even notice it. That's what we should be worried about. It's in the cinema, advertising, everywhere.

In Chomsky's view, the [[Cuban embargo|U.S. embargo of Cuba]] has actually achieved its stated purpose. The goal of the embargo according to Chomsky has been to implement \"intensive U.S. terror operations\" and \"harsh [[economic warfare]]\" in order to cause \"rising discomfort among hungry Cubans\" in the hope that out of desperation they would overthrow the regime.<ref name=\"NoamCuba\" /> In lieu of this goal, Chomsky believes that \"U.S. policy has achieved its actual goals\" in causing \"bitter suffering among Cubans, impeding economic development, and undermining moves towards more internal democracy.\" In Chomsky's view, the real \"threat of Cuba\" is that successful independent development on the island might stimulate others who suffer from similar problems to follow the same course, thus causing the \"system of U.S. domination\" to unravel.<ref name=\"NoamCuba\" />\n\n===Turkish oppression of Kurds===\n{{quote|In the 1990s, it was the [[Kurds in Turkey|Kurdish population of Turkey]] that suffered the most brutal repression.

The Clinton administration gave crucial support throughout, providing Turkey lavishly with means of destruction.

Such aid Chomsky states allowed Turkey during the 1990s to conduct \"US-backed terrorist campaigns\" in [[Turkish Kurdistan|southeast Turkey]], which Chomsky believes \"rank among the most terrible crimes of the grisly 1990s\", featuring \"tens of thousands dead\" and \"every imaginable form of barbaric torture.\"<ref name = \"HRW02\">[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021228.htm Human Rights Week 2002] by Noam Chomsky, ''[[ZNet]]'', December 28, 2002</ref>\n\n=== Criticism of intellectual communities ===\nChomsky has at times been outspokenly critical of scholars and other public intellectuals; while his views sometimes place him at odds with individuals on particular points, he has also denounced intellectual sub-communities for what he sees as systemic failings. Chomsky sees two broad problems with academic intellectuals generally:\n\n# They largely function as a distinct class, and so distinguish themselves by using language inaccessible to people outside the academy, with more or less deliberately exclusionary effects. In Chomsky's view there is little reason to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation \"intellectual\" obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: \"These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities.  There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine\u2014in fact, I think the opposite. ... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people who are using their minds, then it's all over society\" (''Understanding Power'', p.&nbsp;96).\n# The corollary of this argument is that the privileges enjoyed by intellectuals make them more ideologised and obedient than the rest of society: \"If by 'intellectual' you mean people who are a special class who are in the business of imposing thoughts, and framing ideas for people in power, and telling everyone what they should believe, and so on, well, yeah, that's different. These people are called 'intellectuals'\u2014but they're really more a kind of secular priesthood, whose task is to uphold the doctrinal truths of the society. And the population ''should'' be anti-intellectual in that respect, I think that's a healthy reaction\" (ibid, p.&nbsp;96; this statement continues the previous quotation).\n\nChomsky is elsewhere asked what \"theoretical\" tools he feels can be produced to provide a strong intellectual basis for challenging hegemonic power, and he replies: \"if there is a body of theory, well tested and verified, that applies to the conduct of foreign affairs or the resolution of domestic or international conflict, its existence has been kept a well-guarded secret\", despite much \"pseudo-scientific posturing.\" Chomsky's general preference is, therefore, to use plain language in speaking with a non-elite audience.\n\nThe American Intellectual climate is the focus of \"[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]\", the essay which established Chomsky as one of the leading political philosophers in the second half of the 20th century. Chomsky's extensive criticisms of a new type of post-WW2 intellectual he saw arising in the United States were the focus of his book ''American Power and the New Mandarins''. There he described what he saw as the betrayal of the duties of an intellectual to challenge received opinion. The \"new [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarins]]\", who he saw as responsible in part for the Vietnam War, were apologists for [[American imperialism|United States as an imperial power]]; he wrote that their ideology demonstrated\n\n{{quote|the mentality of the colonial civil servant, persuaded of the benevolence of the mother country and the correctness of its vision of world order, and convinced that he understands the true interests of the backward peoples whose welfare he is to administer.}}\n\nChomsky has shown cynicism towards the credibility of [[postmodernism]] and [[poststructuralism]]. In particular he has criticised the Parisian intellectual community; the following disclaimer may be taken as indicative: \"I wouldn't say this if I hadn't been explicitly asked for my opinion \u2013 and if asked to back it up, I'm going to respond that I don't think it merits the time to do so\" (''ibid''). Chomsky's lack of interest arises from what he sees as a combination of difficult language and limited intellectual or \"real world\" value, especially in Parisian academe: \"Sometimes it gets kind of comical, say in post-modern discourse. Especially around Paris, it has become a comic strip, I mean it's all gibberish ... they try to decode it and see what is the actual meaning behind it, things that you could explain to an eight-year old child. There's nothing there.\" (Chomsky on Anarchism, pg. 216). This is exacerbated, in his view, by the attention paid to academics by the French press: \"in France if you're part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there's a front-page story in ''[[Le Monde]]''. That's one of the reasons why French intellectual culture is so farcical \u2013 it's like [[Hollywood]]\" (Understanding Power, pg. 96).\n\nChomsky made a 1971 appearance on Dutch television with [[Michel Foucault]], the full text of which can be found in ''Foucault and his Interlocutors'', Arnold Davidson (ed.), 1997 ({{ISBN|0-226-13714-7}}). Of Foucault, Chomsky wrote that:\n\n{{quote|... with enough effort, one can extract from his writings some interesting insights and observations, peeling away the framework of obfuscation that is required for respectability in the strange world of intellectuals, which takes on extreme forms in the weird culture of postwar Paris. Foucault is unusual among Paris intellectuals in that at least something is left when one peels this away.<ref>quoted in {{cite web|url=http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/5/8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104202047/http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/5/8.html |archivedate=2006-01-04 }} ''Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent''</ref>}}\n\n===Views on the Sri Lanka conflict===\nChomsky supports the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamils]]' right to self-determination in [[Tamil Eelam]], their homeland in the North and East of Sri Lanka. In a February 2009 interview, he said of the Tamil Eelam struggle: \"Parts of Europe, for example, are moving towards more federal arrangements. In Spain, for example, Catalonia by now has a high degree of autonomy within the Spanish state. The Basque Country also has a high degree of autonomy. In England, Wales and Scotland in the United Kingdom are moving towards a form of autonomy and self-determination and I think there are similar developments throughout Europe. Though they're mixed with a lot of pros and cons, but by and large I think it is a generally healthy development.

Chomsky says, referring to the 1960s, that MIT was \"about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was right in the middle of it. I was in a military lab. If you take a look at my early publications, they all say something about Air Force, Navy, and so on, because I was in a military lab, the Research Lab for Electronics.\" G.D. White (2000). ''Campus Inc.: Corporate power in the ivory tower''. Prometheus Books. pp. 445-6.</ref> Having kept quiet about his anti-militarist views in the early years of his career at MIT, Chomsky became more vocal as the war in Vietnam intensified.

In the first, he wrote that he had \"given a good bit of thought to ... resigning from MIT, which is, more than any other university associated with the activities of the Department of 'Defense'.\" He also stated that MIT's \"involvement in the [Vietnam] war effort is tragic and indefensible.\" Then, in the second letter written to clarify the first, Chomsky said that \"MIT as an institution has no involvement in the war effort. Individuals at MIT, as elsewhere, have direct involvement and that is what I had in mind.\"<ref>Chris Knight (2016). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''.

Barsky'], ''New Politics'', Vol.6(3), Issue 23. Retrieved 2016-10-7.</ref> Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but disagreed with their immediate aims. In opposition to the radical students, he argued that it was best to keep military research on campus rather than having it moved away. Against the students' campaign to close down all war-related research, he argued for restricting such research to \"systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character\".<ref>Barsky 1997, pp. 121-2, 140-1; Albert 2006, p. 98; Knight 2016, p. 34.</ref> MIT's student president at this time, [[Michael Albert]], has described this position as, in effect, \"preserving war research with modest amendments\".<ref>Albert 2006, p. 98.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, MIT had six students sentenced to prison terms, prompting Chomsky to say that MIT's students suffered things that \"should not have happened\". Despite this, he has described MIT as \"the freest and the most honest and has the best relations between faculty and students than at any other ... [with] quite a good record on civil liberties.\"<ref>Albert 2006, pp. 107-8; Knight 2016, pp. 36-8, 249.</ref> Chomsky's differences with student activists at this time led to what he has called \"considerable conflict\". He described the rebellions across US campuses as \"largely misguided\" and he was unimpressed by the student uprising of May 1968 in Paris, saying, \"I paid virtually no attention to what was going on in Paris as you can see from what I wrote - rightly, I think.\"<ref>Barsky 1997, pp. 121-2, 131.</ref> On the other hand, Chomsky was also very grateful to the students for raising the issue of the war in Vietnam.\n\nChomsky's particular interpretation of academic freedom led him to give support to some of MIT's more militaristic academics, even though he disagreed with their actions. For example, in 1969, when he heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at the university, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was \"denied a position at MIT.\" In 1989, Chomsky then gave support to a long-standing Pentagon adviser, John Deutch, by backing his candidacy for President of MIT.

The government was unmoved by protest, the people were uninformed and apathetic, and American technology was tearing Vietnam apart. What, then, was their responsibility? Noam Chomsky explored this problem in February 1967 in the ''New York Review'', which had become the favorite journal of the radicals. By virtue of their training and leisure, intellectuals had a greater responsibility than ordinary citizens for the actions of the state, Chomsky said. It was their special responsibility 'to speak the truth and expose lies' ... [Chomsky] concluded by quoting an essay written twenty years before by Dwight Macdonald, an essay that implied that in time of crisis exposing lies might not be enough. 'Only those who are willing to resist authority themselves when it conflicts too intolerably with their personal moral code', Macdonald had written, 'only they have the right to condemn'. Chomsky's article was immediately recognized as an important intellectual event. Along with the radical students, radical intellectuals were moving 'from protest to resistance.'}}\n\nA contemporary reaction came from New York University Professor of Philosophy Emeritus Raziel Abielson:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/12102|title=The Responsibility of Intellectuals by Raziel Abelson|work=nybooks.com}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...

William Fulbright]].\n\nChomsky's view of the war is different from orthodox anti-war opinion which holds the war as a tragic mistake. He argues that the war was a success from the US point of view. According to Chomsky's view the main aim of US policy was the destruction of the nationalist movements in the Vietnamese peasantry. In particular he argues that US attacks were not a defense of South Vietnam against the North but began directly in the early 1960s (covert US intervention from the 1950s) and at that time were mostly aimed at South Vietnam. He agrees with the view of orthodox historians that the US government was concerned about the possibility of a \"domino effect\" in South-East Asia. At this point Chomsky diverts from orthodox opinion \u2013 he holds that the US government was not so concerned with the spread of state Communism and authoritarianism but rather of nationalist movements that would not be sufficiently subservient to US economic interests.\n\n===Doubting genocide in Cambodia===\n{{main|Cambodian genocide denial}}\nThe [[Khmer Rouge]] (KR) communists took power in Cambodia in April 1975 and expelled all citizens of Western countries. The only sources of information about the country were a few thousand refugees who escaped to Thailand and the official pronouncements of the KR government. The refugees told stories of mass murders perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge and widespread starvation. Many leftist academics praised the Khmer Rouge and discounted the stories of the refugees.\n\nIn July 1978, Chomsky and his collaborator, Edward S. Herman jumped into the controversy. Chomsky and Herman reviewed three books about Cambodia. Two of the books by [[John Barron (journalist)|John Barron]] (and [[Anthony Paul]]) and [[Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud]] were based on interviews with Cambodian refugees and concluded that the Khmer Rouge had killed or been responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians. The third book, by scholars [[Gareth Porter]] and [[George Hildebrand]], described the KR in highly favorable terms. Chomsky and Herman called Barron and Paul's book \"third rate propaganda\" and part of a \"vast and unprecedented propaganda campaign\" against the KR. He said Ponchaud was \"worth reading\" but unreliable. Chomsky said that refugee stories of KR atrocities should be treated with great \"care and caution\" as no independent verification was available. By contrast, Chomsky was highly favorable toward the book by Porter and Hildebrand, which portrayed Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge as a \"bucolic idyll.\" Chomsky also opined that the documentation of Gareth Porter's book was superior to that of Ponchaud's, despite almost all of the references cited by Porter coming from Khmer Rouge documents while Ponchaud's came from speaking to Cambodian refugees.<ref>\"An Exchange on Cambodia\" New York Review of Books, July 20, 1978, http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1978/jul/20/an-exchange-on-cambodia/?pagination=false, accessed 25 May 2013</ref>\n\nChomsky and Herman later co-authored a book about Cambodia titled ''After the Cataclysm'' (1979), which appeared after the Khmer Rouge regime had been deposed. The book was described by Cambodian scholar [[Sophal Ear]] as \"one of the most supportive books of the Khmer revolution\" in which they \"perform what amounts to a defense of the Khmer Rouge cloaked in an attack on the media\".<ref name=\"Sear\">Sophal Ear [http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~sophal/canon.pdf \"The Kymer Rouge Canon 1975-1979: The Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122012256/http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~sophal/canon.pdf |date=2012-01-22 }}, Undergraduate Political Science Honor Thesis, Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley, May 1995, p.42, 63</ref> In the book, Chomsky and Herman acknowledged that \"The record of atrocities in Cambodia is substantial and often gruesome\", but questioned their scale, which may have been inflated \"by a factor of 100\".

Many deniers or doubters of the Cambodian genocide recanted their previous opinions, but Chomsky continued to insist that his analysis of Cambodia was without error based on the information available to him at the time.<ref>Sharp, Bruce \"Averaging Wrong Answers: Noam Chomsky and the Cambodian Controversy\" http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm#chx, accessed 25 May 2013</ref>  Herman addressed critics in 2001: \"Chomsky and I found that the very asking of questions about ... the victims in the anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda campaign of 1975\u20131979 was unacceptable, and was treated almost without exception as 'apologetics for Pol Pot'.\"<ref>Edward S.

In ''Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent'', [[Robert Barsky]] focuses on [[Steven Lukes]]' critique of Chomsky in ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]''. Barsky cites Lukes' claim that, obsessed by his opposition to the United States' role in [[Indochina]], Chomsky had \"lost all sense of perspective\" when it came to Pol Pot's Cambodia.\n\nBarsky responds to this by pointing out that Lukes ignores the fact that the references to Pol Pot in ''After the Cataclysm'' were primarily about comparing Pol Pot's mass killings to the contemporaneous mass killings in East Timor. Barsky then cites a rather harsh comment by Chomsky in which he says that, by making no mention of this, Lukes is demonstrating himself to be an apologist for the crimes in Timor. That is elementary logic: if a comparison of Pol Pot to Timor is apologetics for Pol Pot, as Lukes claims, then it must be that the crimes in Timor were insignificant. Lukes, then, is an apologist for the worst slaughter relative to population since the Holocaust. Barsky concludes that the vigor of Chomsky's remarks \"reflects the contempt that he feels\" for all such arguments.'<ref>Robert Barsky, (1997). ''Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent''. MIT Press. pp. 187-8.</ref>\n\nIn ''Decoding Chomsky'', [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] takes a rather different approach. He claims that because Chomsky never felt comfortable about working in a military-funded laboratory at MIT, he was reluctant to be too critical of any regime that was being targeted by that same military. Knight writes that \"while Chomsky has denounced the Russian Bolsheviks of 1917, he has been less hostile towards the so-called communist regimes which later took power in Asia. ... He also seemed reluctant to acknowledge the full horror of the 'communist' regime in Cambodia. The explanation I favour is that it pained Chomsky's conscience to denounce people anywhere who were being threatened by the very war machine that was funding his research.\"<ref>Chris Knight (2016). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''. Yale University Press. pp. 261.</ref>\n\nScholar and former Cambodia refugee, [[Sophal Ear]], has reacted personally to Chomsky's views about Cambodia. \"While my family worked and died in rice fields,\" Ear said, \"Chomsky sharpened his theories and amended his arguments while seated in his armchair in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] ... the peasants of Indochina, will write no memoirs and will be forgotten ...

At this time Chomsky chose to remind Americans of the three principal reasons why he felt they should care about East Timor:\n\n{{quote|First, since the Indonesian invasion of December 1975, East Timor has been the site of some of the worst atrocities of the modern era \u2013 atrocities which are mounting again right now. Second, the US government has played a decisive role in escalating these atrocities and can easily act to mitigate or terminate them. It is not necessary to bomb Jakarta or impose economic sanctions. Throughout, it would have sufficed for Washington to withdraw support and to inform its Indonesian client that the game was over. That remains true as the situation reaches a crucial turning point \u2013 the third reason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19990826.htm|title=Why Americans Should Care about East Timor, by Noam Chomsky|work=chomsky.info}}</ref>}}\n\nWeeks later, following the independence vote, the Indonesian military drove \"hundreds of thousands from their homes and destroying most of the country.

His speeches and publications on this topic were prodigious and widely read, but his financial support is less well known. When the US media were refusing to interview Timorese refugees, claiming that they had no access to them, Chomsky personally paid for the airfares of several refugees, bringing them from [[Lisbon]] to the US, where he tried to get them into the editorial offices of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other outlets. Most of his financial commitment to such causes has \u2013 because of his own reticence \u2013 gone unnoticed.

The state charged that the book \"promoted separatism\" violating Article 8 of the [[Turkish Anti-Terror Law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/02/13/turkey3746.htm|title=Turkey: Courts Must Safeguard Free Speech - Human Rights Watch|work=hrw.org}}</ref> One essay in the book was a reprint of a speech that Chomsky had made in Toledo, Ohio containing material claiming that the Turkish state had brutally repressed its Kurdish population. Prosecutors cited the following passages as particularly offensive:\n\n{{quote|In 1984, the Turkish government launched a major war in the Southeast against the Kurdish population. And that continued. In fact it's still continuing.}}\n\n{{quote|If we look at US military aid to Turkey-which is usually a pretty good index of policy-Turkey was of course a strategic ally so it always had a fairly high level of military aid. But the aid shot up in 1984, at the time that the counterinsurgency war began. This had nothing to do with Cold War, transparently. It was because of the counterinsurgency war. The aid remained high, peaking through the 1990s as the atrocities increased. The peak year was 1997. In fact in the single year 1997, US military aid to Turkey was greater than in the entire period of 1950 to 1983 when there were allegedly Cold War issues. The end result was pretty awesome: tens of thousands of people killed, two to three million refugees, massive ethnic cleansing with some 3500 villages destroyed-about seven times Kosovo under NATO bombing, and there's nobody bombing in this case, except for the Turkish air forces using planes that Clinton sent to them with the certain knowledge that that's how they would be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/talks/20010304.htm|title=Prospects for Peace in the Middle East, by Noam Chomsky (Talk delivered at the University of Toledo)|work=chomsky.info}}</ref>}}\n\nAt the request of Turkish activists, Chomsky petitioned the Turkish courts to name him as a co-defendant.

In December 2006, the four defendants were acquitted by Turkish courts. Tas still has several cases pending for the publishing of other books.\n\nIn 2003, in the ''[[New Humanist]]'', Chomsky wrote about repression of [[freedom of speech in Turkey|free speech in Turkey]] and \"the courage and dedication of the leading artists, writers, academics, journalists, publishers and others who carry on the daily struggle for freedom of speech and human rights, not just with statements but also with regular acts of [[civil disobedience]].

However, his recorded lectures are regularly replayed by NPR stations in the United States that carry the broadcasts of Alternative Radio, a syndicator of progressive lectures. Critics of Chomsky have argued his mainstream media coverage is adequate, and not unusual considering the fact that academics in general often receive low priority in the American media.\n\nWhen CNN presenter [[Jeff Greenfield]] was asked why Chomsky was never on his show, he claimed that Chomsky might \"be one of the leading intellectuals who can't talk on television.  ... If you['ve] got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, ... he's out\".<ref>\"He may be one of the leading intellectuals who can't talk on television.  You know, that's a standard that's very important to us.  If you've got a 22 minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up \u2013 now I don't know whether Chomsky does or not \u2013 he's out.  One of the reasons why Nightline has the \"usual suspects\" is that one of the things you have to do when you book a show is know that the person can make the point within the framework of television.  And if people don't like that, they should understand that it's about as sensible to book somebody who will take eight minutes to give an answer as it is to book somebody who doesn't speak English.\" {{cite web|url=http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter9.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923193416/http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter9.htm |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}</ref> Greenfield described this need to \"say things between two commercials\" as the media's requirement for \"[[concision]]\". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that \"the beauty of [concision] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, and a whole lot of it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical.\" He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they \"would sound like they were from Neptune.\" For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.\n\nSince his book ''9-11'' became a bestseller in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Chomsky has attracted more attention from the mainstream American media. For example, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article in May 2002 describing the popularity of ''9-11''.<ref name=autogenerated8>[http://www.theconversation.org/chomsky911.html Surprise Bestseller Blames the U.S<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050725074732/http://www.theconversation.org/chomsky911.html |date=2005-07-25 }}</ref> In January 2004, the ''Times'' published a highly critical review of Chomsky's ''Hegemony or Survival'' by [[Samantha Power]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/books/review/04POWERT.html |work=The New York Times |title='Hegemony or Survival': The Everything Explainer |first=Samantha |last=Power |date=January 4, 2004 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225211947/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/books/review/04POWERT.html |archivedate=February 25, 2010 }}</ref> and in February, the ''Times'' published an [[op-ed]] by Chomsky himself, criticizing the [[Israeli West Bank Barrier]] for taking Palestinian land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20040223.htm|title=A Wall as a Weapon, by Noam Chomsky|work=chomsky.info}}</ref>\n\n===Views on 9/11 conspiracy theories===\nChomsky has dismissed [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], stating that there is no credible evidence to support the claim that the United States government was responsible for the attacks.\n\n{{quote|I think the Bush administration would have had to be utterly insane to try anything like what is alleged, for their own narrow interests, and do not think that serious evidence has been provided to support claims about actions that would not only be outlandish, for their own interests, but that have no remote historical parallel.}}\n\nIn addition, Chomsky said he would not be surprised if the conspiracy theory movement is being fueled by the government establishment to distract the public from more pressing matters.\n\n{{quote|People always ask, 'What can I do?'

All movements become painful due to muscle atrophy and dry, cracked skin that is caused by severe dehydration. With a weakened body, diseases are commonplace.

The level of blood sugar is [[Blood sugar regulation|tightly regulated]]; as blood glucose is consumed, the [[pancreas]] releases [[glucagon]], a hormone that stimulates the [[liver]] to convert stored [[glycogen]] into glucose. The glycogen stores are ordinarily replenished after every meal, but if the store is depleted before it can be replenished, the body enters [[hypoglycemia]], and begins the [[starvation response]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAfter the exhaustion of the glycogen reserve, and for the next 2\u20133 days, [[lipolysis|fatty acids become the principal metabolic fuel]]. At first, the brain continues to use glucose. If a non-brain tissue is using fatty acids as its metabolic fuel, the use of glucose in the same tissue is switched off.  Thus, when fatty acids are being broken down for energy, all of the remaining glucose is made available for use by the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nAfter 2 or 3 days of fasting, the liver begins to synthesize [[ketone bodies]] from precursors obtained from fatty acid breakdown. The brain uses these ketone bodies as fuel, thus cutting its requirement for glucose. After fasting for 3 days, the brain gets 30% of its energy from ketone bodies. After 4 days, this may go upwards to 70% or more.<ref>{{cite book |author=C. J. Coffee |title=Quick Look: Metabolism |date=Dec 1, 2004 |publisher=Hayes Barton Press |pages=169 }}</ref> Thus, the production of ketone bodies cuts the brain's glucose requirement from 80 g per day to 30 g per day, about 35% of normal, with 65% derived from ketone bodies. But of the brain's remaining 30 g requirement, 20 g per day can be produced by the liver from [[glycerol]] (itself a product of fat breakdown). But this still leaves a deficit of about 10 g of glucose per day that must be supplied from some other source. This other source will be the body's own proteins.\n\nAfter exhaustion of fat stores, the cells in the body [[proteolysis|begin to break down protein]]. This releases [[alanine]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]] produced from [[pyruvate]] into the bloodstream, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of human muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon is responsible for the wasting away of muscle mass seen in starvation. However, the body is able to selectively decide which cells will break down protein and which will not. About 2\u20133 g of protein has to be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20\u201330 g of protein is broken down each day to make 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, this number may decrease the longer the fasting period is continued in order to conserve protein.\n\nStarvation ensues when the fat reserves are completely exhausted and protein is the only fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, even if there are still fat reserves left unused. (In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted faster, the protein depletion occurs sooner, and therefore death occurs sooner.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}) The ultimate cause of death is, in general,{{explain|date=May 2019}} [[cardiac arrhythmia]] or [[cardiac arrest]] brought on by tissue degradation and [[electrolyte]] imbalances.  Alternatively, things like [[metabolic acidosis]] may also cause death in starving people.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toth |first1=HL |last2=Greenbaum |first2=LA |title=Severe acidosis caused by starvation and stress. |journal=American Journal of Kidney Diseases |date=November 2003 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=E16-9 |pmid=14582074 }}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\n\nStarvation can be caused by factors, other than illness, outside of the control of the individual.

From the beginning of civilization to the [[Middle Ages]], people were [[immurement|immured]], or walled in, and would die for want of food.\n\nIn ancient Greco-Roman societies, starvation was sometimes used to dispose of guilty upper class citizens, especially erring female members of patrician families. For instance, in the year 31, [[Livilla]], the niece and daughter-in-law of [[Tiberius]], was discreetly starved to death by her mother for her adulterous relationship with [[Sejanus]] and for her complicity in the murder of her own husband, [[Drusus the Younger]].\n\nAnother daughter-in-law of Tiberius, named [[Agrippina the Elder]] (a granddaughter of [[Augustus]] and the mother of [[Caligula]]), also died of starvation, in 33 AD. (However, it is not clear whether her starvation was self-inflicted.)\n\nA son and daughter of Agrippina were also executed by starvation for political reasons; [[Drusus Caesar]], her second son, was put in prison in 33 AD, and starved to death by orders of Tiberius (he managed to stay alive for nine days by chewing the stuffing of his bed); Agrippina's youngest daughter, [[Julia Livilla]], was exiled on an island in 41 by her uncle, Emperor [[Claudius]], and subsequently her death by starvation was arranged by the empress [[Messalina]].\n\n[[File:Mongolian woman condemned to die of starvation (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A [[Mongolia]]n woman condemned to die of starvation, c. 1913]]\nIt is also possible that [[Vestal Virgin]]s were starved when found guilty of breaking their vows of [[celibacy]].\n\n[[Ugolino della Gherardesca]], his sons and other members of his family were immured in the [[Muda (tower)|Muda]], a tower of [[Pisa]], and starved to death in the thirteenth century. [[Dante]], his contemporary, wrote about Gherardesca in his masterpiece ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.\n\nIn [[Sweden]] in 1317, King [[Birger, King of Sweden|Birger of Sweden]] imprisoned his two brothers for a coup they had staged several years earlier ([[Nyk\u00f6ping Banquet]]). According to legend they died of starvation a few weeks later, since their brother had thrown the prison key in the castle moat.\n\nIn Cornwall in the UK in 1671, [[John Trehenban]] from [[St Columb Major]] was condemned to be starved to death in a cage at [[Castle An Dinas]] for the murder of two girls.\nThe [[Makah]], a Native American tribe inhabiting the Pacific Northwest near the modern border of Canada and the United States, practiced death by starvation as a punishment for slaves.<ref>Donald, Leland (1997).

Many occupants of [[ghetto]]s in eastern Europe also starved to death, most notoriously in the [[Warsaw ghetto]]. Prisoners were [[Holocaust trains|transported in inhumane conditions by rail freight cars]], in which many died before reaching their destination. The prisoners were confined to the [[cattle car]]s for days or even weeks, with little or no food or water. Many died of [[dehydration]] in the intense heat of summer or froze to death in winter. Nazi concentration camps in Europe from 1933 to 1945 deliberately underfed prisoners, who were at the same time forced to perform heavy labour. Their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] was restricted to watery vegetable soup and a little bread, with little to no [[dietary fat]]s, [[protein]]s or other essential [[nutrient]]s. Such treatment led to loss of body tissues, and when prisoners became skeletal, the so-called [[Muselmann]] were murdered by gas or bullets when examined by camp doctors.\n[[File:DBP 1973 771 Maximilian Kolbe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maximilian Kolbe]], on a West German postage stamp, marked [[Auschwitz]]]]\nStarvation was also used as a punishment where victims were locked into a small cell until dead, a process which could take many days.\nSaint [[Maximilian Kolbe]], a martyred Polish friar, underwent a sentence of starvation in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1941. Ten prisoners had been condemned to death by starvation in the wake of a successful escape from the camp. Kolbe volunteered to take the place of a man with a wife and children. After two weeks of starvation, Kolbe and three other inmates remained alive; they were then executed with injections of [[phenol]].\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[2007-2008 world food price crisis]]\n*[[Anorexia mirabilis]]\n*[[Norman Borlaug]]\n*[[Cachexia]]\n*[[Catharism#Sacraments|Catharistic endura rite]]\n*[[Global Hunger Index]]\n*[[Starvation mode]]\n*[[Famine scales]]\n*[[Hunger Plan]]\n*[[Hunger strike]]\n*[[List of famines]]\n*[[List of people who died of starvation]]\n*[[Marasmus]]\n*[[Muselmann]]\n*[[Human overpopulation]]\n*[[Santhara]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Starvation}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Library resources about|onlinebooks=yes}}\n* [http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/11/17/italy.food.summit/index.html U.N.

As the starving person becomes too weak to move or even eat, their interaction with the surrounding world diminishes. In females, [[Amenorrhoea|menstruation ceases]] when the body fat percentage is too low to support a fetus.\n\nVictims of starvation are often too weak to sense thirst, and therefore become [[dehydrated]]. All movements become painful due to muscle atrophy and dry, cracked skin that is caused by severe dehydration. With a weakened body, diseases are commonplace. Fungi, for example, often grow under the [[esophagus]], making swallowing painful. [[Vitamin deficiency]] is also a common result of starvation, often leading to [[anemia]], [[beriberi]], [[pellagra]], and [[scurvy]].

The level of blood sugar is [[Blood sugar regulation|tightly regulated]]; as blood glucose is consumed, the [[pancreas]] releases [[glucagon]], a hormone that stimulates the [[liver]] to convert stored [[glycogen]] into glucose. The glycogen stores are ordinarily replenished after every meal, but if the store is depleted before it can be replenished, the body enters [[hypoglycemia]], and begins the [[starvation response]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAfter the exhaustion of the glycogen reserve, and for the next 2\u20133 days, [[lipolysis|fatty acids become the principal metabolic fuel]]. At first, the brain continues to use glucose. If a non-brain tissue is using fatty acids as its metabolic fuel, the use of glucose in the same tissue is switched off.  Thus, when fatty acids are being broken down for energy, all of the remaining glucose is made available for use by the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nAfter 2 or 3 days of fasting, the liver begins to synthesize [[ketone bodies]] from precursors obtained from fatty acid breakdown. The brain uses these ketone bodies as fuel, thus cutting its requirement for glucose. After fasting for 3 days, the brain gets 30% of its energy from ketone bodies. After 4 days, this may go upwards to 70% or more.<ref>{{cite book |author=C. J. Coffee |title=Quick Look: Metabolism |date=Dec 1, 2004 |publisher=Hayes Barton Press |pages=169 }}</ref> Thus, the production of ketone bodies cuts the brain's glucose requirement from 80 g per day to 30 g per day, about 35% of normal, with 65% derived from ketone bodies. But of the brain's remaining 30 g requirement, 20 g per day can be produced by the liver from [[glycerol]] (itself a product of fat breakdown). But this still leaves a deficit of about 10 g of glucose per day that must be supplied from some other source. This other source will be the body's own proteins.\n\nAfter exhaustion of fat stores, the cells in the body [[proteolysis|begin to break down protein]]. This releases [[alanine]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]] produced from [[pyruvate]] into the bloodstream, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of human muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon is responsible for the wasting away of muscle mass seen in starvation. However, the body is able to selectively decide which cells will break down protein and which will not. About 2\u20133 g of protein has to be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20\u201330 g of protein is broken down each day to make 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, this number may decrease the longer the fasting period is continued in order to conserve protein.\n\nStarvation ensues when the fat reserves are completely exhausted and protein is the only fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, even if there are still fat reserves left unused. (In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted faster, the protein depletion occurs sooner, and therefore death occurs sooner.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}) The ultimate cause of death is, in general,{{explain|date=May 2019}} [[cardiac arrhythmia]] or [[cardiac arrest]] brought on by tissue degradation and [[electrolyte]] imbalances.  Alternatively, things like [[metabolic acidosis]] may also cause death in starving people.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toth |first1=HL |last2=Greenbaum |first2=LA |title=Severe acidosis caused by starvation and stress. |journal=American Journal of Kidney Diseases |date=November 2003 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=E16-9 |pmid=14582074 }}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\n\nStarvation can be caused by factors, other than illness, outside of the control of the individual.

From the beginning of civilization to the [[Middle Ages]], people were [[immurement|immured]], or walled in, and would die for want of food.\n\nIn ancient Greco-Roman societies, starvation was sometimes used to dispose of guilty upper class citizens, especially erring female members of patrician families. For instance, in the year 31, [[Livilla]], the niece and daughter-in-law of [[Tiberius]], was discreetly starved to death by her mother for her adulterous relationship with [[Sejanus]] and for her complicity in the murder of her own husband, [[Drusus the Younger]].\n\nAnother daughter-in-law of Tiberius, named [[Agrippina the Elder]] (a granddaughter of [[Augustus]] and the mother of [[Caligula]]), also died of starvation, in 33 AD. (However, it is not clear whether her starvation was self-inflicted.)\n\nA son and daughter of Agrippina were also executed by starvation for political reasons; [[Drusus Caesar]], her second son, was put in prison in 33 AD, and starved to death by orders of Tiberius (he managed to stay alive for nine days by chewing the stuffing of his bed); Agrippina's youngest daughter, [[Julia Livilla]], was exiled on an island in 41 by her uncle, Emperor [[Claudius]], and subsequently her death by starvation was arranged by the empress [[Messalina]].\n\n[[File:Mongolian woman condemned to die of starvation (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A [[Mongolia]]n woman condemned to die of starvation, c. 1913]]\nIt is also possible that [[Vestal Virgin]]s were starved when found guilty of breaking their vows of [[celibacy]].\n\n[[Ugolino della Gherardesca]], his sons and other members of his family were immured in the [[Muda (tower)|Muda]], a tower of [[Pisa]], and starved to death in the thirteenth century. [[Dante]], his contemporary, wrote about Gherardesca in his masterpiece ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.\n\nIn [[Sweden]] in 1317, King [[Birger, King of Sweden|Birger of Sweden]] imprisoned his two brothers for a coup they had staged several years earlier ([[Nyk\u00f6ping Banquet]]). According to legend they died of starvation a few weeks later, since their brother had thrown the prison key in the castle moat.\n\nIn Cornwall in the UK in 1671, [[John Trehenban]] from [[St Columb Major]] was condemned to be starved to death in a cage at [[Castle An Dinas]] for the murder of two girls.\nThe [[Makah]], a Native American tribe inhabiting the Pacific Northwest near the modern border of Canada and the United States, practiced death by starvation as a punishment for slaves.<ref>Donald, Leland (1997).

Many occupants of [[ghetto]]s in eastern Europe also starved to death, most notoriously in the [[Warsaw ghetto]]. Prisoners were [[Holocaust trains|transported in inhumane conditions by rail freight cars]], in which many died before reaching their destination. The prisoners were confined to the [[cattle car]]s for days or even weeks, with little or no food or water. Many died of [[dehydration]] in the intense heat of summer or froze to death in winter. Nazi concentration camps in Europe from 1933 to 1945 deliberately underfed prisoners, who were at the same time forced to perform heavy labour. Their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] was restricted to watery vegetable soup and a little bread, with little to no [[dietary fat]]s, [[protein]]s or other essential [[nutrient]]s. Such treatment led to loss of body tissues, and when prisoners became skeletal, the so-called [[Muselmann]] were murdered by gas or bullets when examined by camp doctors.\n[[File:DBP 1973 771 Maximilian Kolbe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maximilian Kolbe]], on a West German postage stamp, marked [[Auschwitz]]]]\nStarvation was also used as a punishment where victims were locked into a small cell until dead, a process which could take many days.\nSaint [[Maximilian Kolbe]], a martyred Polish friar, underwent a sentence of starvation in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1941. Ten prisoners had been condemned to death by starvation in the wake of a successful escape from the camp. Kolbe volunteered to take the place of a man with a wife and children. After two weeks of starvation, Kolbe and three other inmates remained alive; they were then executed with injections of [[phenol]].\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[2007-2008 world food price crisis]]\n*[[Anorexia mirabilis]]\n*[[Norman Borlaug]]\n*[[Cachexia]]\n*[[Catharism#Sacraments|Catharistic endura rite]]\n*[[Global Hunger Index]]\n*[[Starvation mode]]\n*[[Famine scales]]\n*[[Hunger Plan]]\n*[[Hunger strike]]\n*[[List of famines]]\n*[[List of people who died of starvation]]\n*[[Marasmus]]\n*[[Muselmann]]\n*[[Human overpopulation]]\n*[[Santhara]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Starvation}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Library resources about|onlinebooks=yes}}\n* [http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/11/17/italy.food.summit/index.html U.N.

It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage on [[Sicily]] during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in Sicily (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating lenience in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|[[Polybius]]{{snd}}\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}}}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[Punic War]]s{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Jones|Sidwell|2003|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the Mercenary War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} He was on the staff of [[Scipio Aemilianus]] when he led a Roman army during the [[Third Punic War]] on a campaign through many of the locations of the actions of the Mercenary War.{{sfn|Champion|2015|pp=108\u2013109}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Craige Champion describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other that Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Punic War was fought between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]], the two main powers of the western [[Mediterranean]] in the early 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]], to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gesco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gesco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans.

This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a [[Ruse de guerre|stratagem]], and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar's cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=117}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} South west of Utica Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}} but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were only saved from destruction when a Numidian leader, [[Navaras (Numidian)|Navaras]], who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides with his 2,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=150\u2013152}} This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the [[Hamilcar's victory with Navaras|resulting battle]] they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}}\n\n===Truceless War===\n[[File:Guerra mercenaria (cropped).png|thumb|upright=|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the war|{{center|Main manoeuvres during the war}}]]\nSince leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gesco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the \"Truceless War\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=135}}\n\nAt some point between March and September 239 BC{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}} the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]]{{#tag:ref|Not to be confused with [[Hannibal Barca]], of Second Punic War fame.|group=note}} was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were [[crucifixion|crucified]] in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. Meanwhile, Matho and his army had left Tunis and marched {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1}} south to the wealthy city of [[Leptis Parva]], which had risen against Carthage earlier in the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}} Hanno and Hamilcar marched after them with an army totalling perhaps 40,000{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} including every Carthaginian citizen of military age. The rebels, rather than wait to be besieged, met the Carthaginians in open battle in mid- to late 238 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=380}} No details of [[Battle of Leptis Parva|the battle]] survive,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=8}} but the remaining 30,000 rebels{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} were wiped out and Matho captured with few losses to the Carthaginians. Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=211}} Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \"quickly\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=377}} The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}}\n\n===Sardinia===\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}} It is unclear from the sources why the Romans acted differently from three years earlier.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}} Polybius held that this action was indefensible.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}} Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The [[Roman Senate]] cynically stated that they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209, 212\u2013213}}{{#tag:ref|1,200 talents was approximately {{convert|30|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again. The Romans required a strong military presence on the islands for at least the next seven years, as they struggled to suppress the local inhabitants. Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=175}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe historian Dexter Hoyos writes that \"the truceless war ... produce[d] a complete and enduring reversal of Carthage's domestic fortunes and military orientation\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} Miles agrees there was \"a period of profound political transformation\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=214}} The seizure of Sardinia and Corsica by Rome and the additional indemnity fuelled resentment in Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=211}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=213}} The role of Hamilcar Barca in the victory greatly enhanced the prestige and power of the [[Barcid]] family. Immediately after the war Hamilcar led many of his veterans on an expedition to expand Carthaginian holdings in southern [[Carthaginian Iberia|Iberia]]; this was to become a semi-autonomous Barcid fiefdom.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=216, 225}}{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar's son, Hannibal, was to lead Carthage to war in the Second Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=152\u2013155}}|group=note}}  In 218 BC a Carthaginian army under [[Hannibal Barca]] besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia and ignited the Second Punic War.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |url={{Google Books|W9u9mCSV4AgC|plainurl=y}} |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|editor1-last=Hoyos\n|editor1-first=Dexter\n|first=Craige B. \n|last=Champion\n|chapter=Polybius and the Punic Wars\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011\n|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars\n|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex\n|publisher=John Wiley\n|pages=95\u2013110\n|isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Spain: An Oxford Archaeological Guide|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-285300-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Trj8L8rPVRcC|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Andrew\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite web\n|url=\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/9781119099000.wbabat0270\n|title=The First Punic War and After, 264\u2013237 BC\n|last= Eckstein\n|first=Arthur\n|date=2017\n|website=The Encyclopedia of Ancient Battles\n|publisher=Wiley Online Library\n|access-date=12 March 2020\n|doi=\n|ref=harv }}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =143\n| issue =3/4\n| pages =369\u2013380 \n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2000\n| title =Towards a Chronology of the 'Truceless War', 241\u2013237 B.

It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage on [[Sicily]] during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in [[Sicily]] (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating lenience in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty.

Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]], to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gesco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gesco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal.

An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles.

This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a [[Ruse de guerre|stratagem]], and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force.

He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gesco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners.

The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC.

The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were [[crucifixion|crucified]] in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. Meanwhile, Matho and his army had left Tunis and marched {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1}} south to the wealthy city of [[Leptis Parva]], which had risen against Carthage earlier in the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}} Hanno and Hamilcar marched after them with an army totalling perhaps 40,000{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} including every Carthaginian citizen of military age.

Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=211}} Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \"quickly\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=377}} The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}}\n\n===Sardinia===\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy.

The Romans required a strong military presence on the islands for at least the next seven years, as they struggled to suppress the local inhabitants.

Symptoms vary by tree species but generally consist of leaf discoloration, wilt, defoliation, and death. The fungus spreads from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect or other airborne vectors and underground by naturally grafted tree roots. Management of the disease historically meant preventing infection by not wounding oaks during certain time periods, removing diseased oaks that will produce spores (sanitation), and breaking root connections with vibratory plows, trenchers, rock saws or hoes. Present methods focus on reducing or eliminating monocultures and restoring ecosystems correctly using soils baseline information. Fungicides are used for preventive treatments in urban areas. Oak wilt poses a danger for oak wood products and shade trees in urban areas.\n\n==Hosts and symptoms==\n[[File:Oak wilt symptoms.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of oak wilt symptoms|Photograph of leaf and whole tree symptoms of oak wilt in a red oak tree. Joseph O'Brien, USDA Forest Service, Bugwood.org]]\n\nOak wilt is one of three devastating North American vascular wilt diseases and was first seen in Wisconsin in the 1940s.  Within the last decade, it has spread into new counties in northern Wisconsin, counties northwest and northeast of the Twin Cities in Minnesota and also new locations in northeastern states.  The other two vascular wilts and their destructive time periods are [[chestnut blight]] (1900-1950) and [[Dutch elm disease]] (1928 - 1980).\n\nVascular wilts, including oak wilt, kill by fooling the tree into killing itself; the fungus or pathogen does not kill the tree or host.  The tree's reaction-to fungus entering into sapwood, by walling off the fungus, causes shutdown of water supply upward, then wilting, thus killing off the fungus doesn't eradicate the problem, keeping the water supply open and flowing upward is the main problem.  Certain elements like Boron are crucial to the trees' physiological well being, especially with translocation of fluids.  Additionally, copper and chemotherapies have been used to keep the tree or plant from killing itself via wilting[http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=EY7524088].\n\nOak wilt infects and kills all oak species but affects the two main groups, [[red oak|red]] and [[white oak]]s, differently. Mostly, red oak group trees die faster from oak wilt disease than white oak group trees. Oaks in North and Central America are sorted into two groups based mostly upon the porosity and corresponding leaf shape. The white oak group have rounded leaf edges and pores, also known as xylem or sapwood, are clogged with [[tylosis (botany)|tyloses]]. The red oak group have pointed leaf edges and pores are large and open.\n \nCommon names of oaks are based upon folklore or customs, which leads-to black oaks being in the red oak group. In the upper midwest, red oak group trees like black, northern red and northern pin are most threatened by oak wilt for two reasons: they die faster and they produce spore mats, known also as spore pads or pressure pads.  Spore mats are the fruiting bodies of the oak wilt fungus and, when ripening or sporulating, can spread disease overland.   Overland spread of oak wilt from white oaks is not a problem because white oak group trees rarely produce spore mats. When infected, oaks in the red oak group die over the course of a single summer. These oaks typically die from the top of the tree down as leaves become a bronze color and fall off the tree.  Another symptom is discoloration of the vascular tissues. Brown streaks or spots can be seen under the bark in the sapwood; oak wilt specialists call this stage II.[[File:Oak_Wilt_Dropped_Leaves_Polk_County_WI_Noon_July_14,_2016.png|thumb|right|Sudden leaf drop July red oak]]\n\nOaks in the white oak group, [[Quercus alba|white]], [[Quercus bicolor|swamp white]], and [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur]], die slower when infected (white oak in particular) and can live for several years after infection, losing a few branches each season from the top down. Bur oaks tend to die faster than others in the white oak group, although not as fast as trees in the red oak group. Symptoms in white oak are similar to those in red oak. Quercus virginiana, the southern live oak, is the most common of 31 species of evergreen oaks and is in the white oak group.\n\nOaks with oak wilt stand out with their dead crowns compared to a green canopy in the summer, so much so that oak wilt infections can be spotted from the air.\n\nNorthern pin oak (''Q. ellipsoidalis'') infection and spread are extreme when monocultures exist. Northern pin oak forests are typically found on entisol soils (aka barren, river terrace or lakebed sands) in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and these forest ecosystems are often misidentified as oak savannas, which are prairie - not forest - ecosystems. Mistaking northern pin oak forest monocultures for oak savannas, then burning them for oak savanna restoration, has made state and federal lands north of Minneapolis-St Paul the largest oak wilt disease reservoirs in Minnesota.<ref>Nelson, Steven (2011). ''Savanna Soils of Minnesota.'' Minnesota: Self. pp. 21-22,29-30. {{ISBN|978-0-615-50320-2}}.</ref>\n\nWilt and death in [[Live oak]] usually occurs within six months of infection. Live oak foliar symptoms differ from those of red and white oak. Infected live oak leaves develop yellow colored veins then eventually die and turn brown before falling off the tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texasoakwilt.org/Documents/Stewardship/OakWilt_English.pdf |title=How to identify and manage oak wilt in Texas |date= June 2003 |website=Texasokwilt.org |publisher=USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station |access-date= June 12, 2017 |quote=Leaves on diseased live oaks often develop chlorotic (yellow colored) veins that eventually die / turn brown}}</ref>\n\n==Disease Cycle==\n[[File:Oak Wilt cycle.gif|thumb|alt=Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle|Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle by Julie Martinez]]\n\n[[File:Ceratocystis fagacearum endoconidia.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ceratocystis fagacearum endoconidia|Photograph of spores produced by the oak wilt fungus. (a) Endoconidia (b) Conidiophore]]\n\nThe oak wilt fungus spreads in two basic ways: transfer of spores from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect and other vectors and movement underground of the fungus from a diseased tree to a healthy tree through [[grafting|root grafts]]. [[File:Root Graft.png|thumb|left|Root Graft of hardwood tree after excavation following vibratory plowing]] \n====Overland====\nSpores are the seeds of a fungus.  If conditions - temperature, moisture content, wood pH - are right after the oak has wilted and died, spore mats form under the bark of the tree. [[File:Spore_Mats_Car_Keys_May_2015.jpg|thumb|left|Bark removed by squirrels attracted-to fruity odor. Spore mats stage III]]\n\nSpore mats produce asexual spores called endoconidia, which are barrel shaped and produced in chains.  [[File:The Real Dr Spore Mat.jpg|thumb|right|Wood caramel colored, spore mats stage III]]Conidia are often dispersed by air and rain and also by insects and other agents.<ref>K\u00e4\u00e4rik, A. (1983).\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 {{ISBN|3-540-11900-0}}.</ref> If compatible mating types are present, these mats will also produce sexual spores called ascospores in fruiting structures called perithecia.  Ascospores are spread by water, insects and other agents.<ref>K\u00e4\u00e4rik, A. (1983).\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 {{ISBN|3-540-11900-0}}.</ref>    \nCertain species of [[Nitidulidae|sap beetles]] plus other insects, birds and animals are attracted to the fruity smell of oak wilt spore mats. \n\nSpore mats/pressure pads increase in size, eventually breaking the bark covering them, which sends the spores' fruity odor out into the area, attracting sap beetles and other insects, birds and animals, like squirrels. The oak wilt disease \"selling\" business is now open. [[File:SpMatClose.jpg|thumb|left|Spore Mat stage III meaning infectious]]One example of overland spread is sap beetles picking-up spores from diseased red oaks then depositing them onto fresh wounds made on healthy oaks.  The oak wilt \"buying\" business is now open...for 2 days only.  New infections in areas with no history of oak wilt occur by this overland transmission route.[[File:Spore_Mats_Stage_IV-V.jpg|thumb|right|Spore mats (dark patches) stage IV - V are no longer infectious]]  However, not all all red oaks that died in one year produce spores/sporulate the next year between April and July. Small red oaks 6 - 10 inch dbh tend to sporulate the autumn of the year they got infected, or not at all; small trees, once dead, dry out faster than large trees and oak wilt fungus cannot survive in that dry environment.  Roughly 15 to 30 percent of red oaks greater than 10 inch dbh will sporulate April - July the year following infection.  The other 70 - 85 percent of infected red oaks will sporulate, either before April or after July the following year or, not at all, because wood rotting fungi (Trichoderma) is already in the oak and out-competes/kills the oak wilt fungus.\n====Underground====\nOak wilt moves from diseased trees to healthy trees through roots that have become interconnected (root [[grafting|grafts]]). \nTransmission via root grafts is the most common means of spread, and makes up more than 85 % of new infections every year.  Oaks within 50 - 150 feet (15 - 50 meters) of a diseased oak can be infected via root graft transmission.  In this case, spores (also endoconidia) produced inside the tree travel upward through vascular tissue in the wood, known as the xylem.  Most root grafts form between oaks of the same species and of the same generation; it's rare for a 60 year old oak to root graft with a 15 year old oak of same species.  Red oak roots graft more commonly than do white oak roots, and grafts between red and white oaks are very rare.\n\n==Environment==\nIn the Midwest and eastern United States, conditions are usually favorable for spore production and beetle activity during spring and early summer.  In Texas, mat formation is most common in late fall and winter. Frequency of root graft formation, and therefore root graft transmission, is affected by soil type and stand composition (diversity of tree species). See disease cycle and management sections for details.\n\n==Management==\nLandowners and managers have to remember that oaks love light and heat more than other forest tree species; they are one of the few tree species that survive in the prairie regions.  Releasing or thinning oaks from competition, which gives remaining oaks more light, moisture and nutrients, should always be the primary goal, whether or not oak wilt is present.  Oak wilt is similar to [[Dutch elm disease]] but more controllable. Beetles carrying oak wilt do not have chewing mouth parts, and need some other creature or physical damage to wound the tree, whereas beetles that carry Dutch elm disease do have chewing mouth parts. Prevention is essential, as there is no permanent cure. To prevent overland spread, oaks should not be wounded, including [[pruning|pruned]], in the [[spring (season)|spring]] months in the east and Midwest or February through June in Texas. Care should be taken to prevent injury to oaks during this period, particularly during construction activities. Painting wounds less than 48 hours old is advised if oaks are wounded in the spring by wind or human caused damage. Painting wounds more than 48 hours old is not helpful because the oak by that time has compartmentalized (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODIT) the injury/wound.  Reducing the source of spores is helpful. When a dead red oak has not sporulated - hasn't reached stage III yet - before the following spring, it should be chipped or mulched onsite, then burned at a CHP (combined heat & power) plant.  If that is not possible, wood greater than 5\" diameter can be split into firewood size pieces then left onsite to dry before spring, or covered with plastic sheeting to effect composting. Heat from composting should destroy the fungus. Logs or firewood from red oak group trees that have died of oak wilt should never be moved to unaffected areas.\n\n====Root Graft or Overland Infection?====\nThe first oak in any infection center is always infected from overland spread; additional oaks killed from the disease in that infection center are killed from underground root graft spread.  Before control plans are made, the landowner or land manager (forester, arborist) needs to find out how the infection got there and what type (underground, overland or both) it is.  Root graft infections move slowly, so additional root graft infections may not be seen for 1-3 years.  It is impossible for one oak infected via overland to infect & wilt seventeen additional oaks via root graft transmission, in less than 4 months (see Kerrick, Minnesota oak wilt photo, below).  If one sees more than half dozen oaks wilting during one summer in a new infection with healthy oaks in between means infections started from overland route/storm event, not underground.  In that case, each wilting oak is a separate infection center, not part of one infection center.  One should also look at the site to confirm whether or not it's an overland infection.  Overland infections occur on or near hilltops or other exposed areas, where taller oaks get wounded, then infected, and shorter oaks look healthy.  A spread pattern with no obvious direction usually means multiple airborne/overland infections.  Root graft infections can \"fan\" out in 360 degree pattern, but tend to head faster in one or two directions because of soil and topography changes and tree species arrangement/diversity. [[File:Kost_Oak_Savanna_OW_cleanup_autumn_2007.jpg|thumb|left|Oak wilt and buckthorn cleanup on oak savanna in Chisago County, Minnesota autumn/after leaf drop 2007]]  A birds-eye view of an infection center, during the middle of summer, going from oldest to newest based on colors would show: stone dead gray, brown, yellow, orange, green.  So, if one doesn't see these color sequences or, a hub and spoke pattern radiating out, they are probably looking at multiple airborne infections.  Looks can be deceiving because 2-6 large wilting oaks may often have only 1-2 trees left nearby to infect.  Compared-to one oak deep in the woods that is just starting to wilt that can lead-to 2-5 dozen more nearby oaks dying in the next 5 years.  So, proper ground ID & diagnosis is crucial for stopping this disease.  Stopping spread with multiple infections means plowlines will be further out, so natural barriers should be located first.  In the Lake States, a vibratory plow line is installed 54 to 72 inches deep in the ground and 60 - 150 feet away from the diseased oak.  Plowing done correctly ruptures healthy roots that could, in the future, transmit oak wilt to neighboring healthy trees.  Installing plow lines far enough away from diseased oaks is key to preventing root graft disease transmission.  In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay or Caliche soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows.  Infected oaks should not be cut down before vibratory plowing because, doing so will speed up oak wilt root graft spread to nearby healthy oaks.  Base of trunk or root flare injections of azole or copper based fungicides can help contain foliar - or top down - infections but are costly and have less success containing root graft - bottom up - transmission of oak wilt.\n\n\n====Strategies - Containment vs. Control====\nThere is a big difference between containment and control.  Containment happens within a few hours or days; control takes weeks or many months.  The lack of appreciation and understanding for disease control methods and strategies has led to a lot of landowners and taxpayers thinking there is no way to control oak wilt.  Despite 40-50 years of work & study showing oak wilt as one of the easiest to control forest diseases in North America.  Putting a plowline around an oak wilt infection center is containment, which is not controlling the disease.  Going inside the containment lines or natural barriers/edges/cover type changes and making sure all oak wilt infections are dead and gone is control.  Landowners and managers have to ask themselves this question (are we going to be containing or controlling this disease?) before starting a disease control project, whether in a small yard or on hundreds of acres.  Control also means removal and processing - mostly by logging - of future spore-producing oaks.  For the last 40-50 years, experienced professionals throughout North America have been doing insect & disease control year round, not four or six months per year.  They stop oak wilt spread by identifying future spore producing red oaks, which trees to protect from wounding, which trees not threatened by root graft infection then, respond same day to tree health changes.  Agriculture and construction work starts in April-May each year, so it behooves oak wilt specialists to continue disease control work and prevention right through spring and early summer.\n[[File:White_Oak_on_Nymore_soils_Chisago_County_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Healthy white oak (Q. alba) remaining after cleaning up 7-1-11 storm damage & oak wilt infections, 13 months after storm, 2012, Chisago County Minnesota]]\nAfter 2005, treatment goals shifted towards \"passive oak wilt control\" on properties less than 5 acres and treating to natural barriers or edges for large acreages. Passive control means letting the disease burn out over a few years which allows other native tree and shrub species to take over. Treating to natural barriers means restoring to native forest or savanna species by harvesting out to where oak wilt can no longer expand via root grafts. All oaks of the species that is infected are logged out, whether they are infected or healthy. Passive oak wilt control on large acreages creates short and long term problems for oaks. White oak group trees are at risk for infection from nearby sporulating red oak group trees for the short term; invasive species can take over and monocultures of oaks can re-develop that sustain oak wilt infections for 50-100 more years making for long term risks. Treating to natural barriers/edges or cover type changes is by far the best method to use when controlling oak wilt on large acreages.\n\n==Importance==\n\nOak wilt is a devastating disease, killing trees rapidly in a single season. It is an important disease in urban areas where a few oak trees in a homeowner's yard may be of great value. If one tree in the homeowners yard becomes infected it will die. Not only will the homeowner need to pay to remove the dead tree, they will also need to protect the rest of the oak trees in their yard or face the prospect that remaining oaks will continue to die. Loss of trees from a property can also lead to a decrease in property value. Even if a homeowner is vigilant about pruning at the correct time, storms and construction can damage trees and introduce oak wilt into a neighborhood.  In forest systems, oak wilt is an important disease of oak produced for hardwood lumber and railroad ties.\n\n===July 1, 2011 Windstorm in Minnesota and Wisconsin===\n\n[[File:Kerrick_Oak_Wilt_8-19-16_Spawned-_from_7-1-2011_Infection_Centers.png|thumb|left|North Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru northern Pine and Carlton Counties Minnesota.

The infections appeared to have coincided-with the July 1, 2011 mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) windstorm,<ref>NWS NOAA https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Storm_1_01July2011_SW_to_NE.pdf</ref> which had windspeeds of over 100&nbsp;mph, because foresters found that first oaks infected were 7-1-11 storm-damaged oaks. \nThey also knew infections happened within 48 hours of storm damage. West-facing slopes on the east bank (Wisconsin side) and terrace crests in the St. Croix river valley were hit hard with wind damage and oak wilt infections.  Hilltops and bottoms and field edges, where oaks were more exposed, also had more serious wind and oak wilt damage.  Approximately 3/4 million acres in Minnesota, possibly 10 times that area for Wisconsin<ref>WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt-detections/</ref> and up to the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, were affected by the storm. Millions of freshly wounded oak trees were now open to infection from trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in by the storm.\n\n====Infection Levels-Spore Loads====\nIt's difficult for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because it's too hot for red oaks to sporulate and latewood cell development has been underway since early to mid-June. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in from west-southwest and the windstorm's tearing/shredding/breaking-apart trees which re-opened oaks' 2011 & 2010 earlywood cells (earlywood is also called ''springwood'', and latewood goes by the name ''summerwood'' in some areas). The oak wilt fungus is too big to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can fit within and move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This storm damage increased the chances of infection 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres. The manageable level of oak wilt disease is one infection per 640 acres.[[File:Oak_Wilt_Infection_Center_in_2013_Created_7-1-2011_Rushseba_Township,_Chisago_County,_Minnesota.jpg|thumb|right|7-1-2011 storm-caused oak wilt on terrace crest in Rushsheba Township, Chisago County, Minnesota]][[File:East_Farmington_3_Infection_Centers_photo_taken_8-8-16.png|thumb|left|South Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru St. Croix County, Wisconsin.  Photo shows one of five 7-1-11 infection centers on hilltop near East Farmington, Wisconsin]]\nOne year after the storm, in summer 2012, oak wilt specialists found 10 - 20 infections per 100 acres both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State Park<ref>Minnesota DNR Forestry 2012 Forest Health Annual Report, p. 37</ref>  in Pine County, Minnesota. \nWounding & infecting at ten oaks per 100 acres, one oak per 100 acres or one oak per 200 acres presents a serious threat to the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northern-most infected oak and southern-most infected oak were 10 miles apart. This broad coverage of oak wilt blanketing millions of acres is achieved only with huge spore supplies and re-opening of that years' earlywood cells.\n====Detection====\nThe use of spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging show promise for accurate detection of the disease <ref> https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/40/3/377/5728678 </ref> and are currently being tested for large scale detection and monitoring.\n\n====Sources====\nSources with that many hundreds of acres of oak wilt spores were upwind  (240 degrees/west southwest) in the three oak wilt \"reservoirs\" on state and federal lands in Sherburne, Anoka, Isanti and Chisago counties of Minnesota (see Hosts and Symptoms). The sources of oak wilt spores were not nearby.\n\n====Rate of Spread====\nBefore the windstorm, oak wilt could spread north at three quarters of a mile per year and east or west at one and one half miles per year.<ref>Minnesota DNR Forestry (2001).</ref>  During the storm, oak wilt spread at up to 100 miles per hour. In the two years following the 2011 storm, infections were found at new locations in four Minnesota and at least one (Sawyer) of three Wisconsin counties.<ref>Wisconsin DNR Division of Forestry, Annual Report 2012 p. 6</ref><ref>WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt-detections/</ref> These 2011 infections have serious ecological/economic impacts, including loss of stumpage and real estate values, and will only get worse if summer (aerial with ground follow up) surveys aren't established as soon as possible.\n\n\n==Host-Parasite Interaction==\n\nHardwood vascular wilt diseases are characterized by blockage of the tree's water-conducting vessels by either the physical presence of the pathogen (mycelium and spores), or through the host's own response to infection. Oak trees, in response to wounding or infection often produce [[tylosis (botany)|tyloses]], balloon-like outgrowths of the vessels' cell walls that can function to wall-off pathogens and prevent infections from spreading. Red oaks appear to lack a host-response mechanism that restricts the pathogen's movement, and infection usually kills the tree by wilting the entire crown. White oaks, which produce [[tyloses]] more quickly and in greater numbers, are more resistant to the disease, though the exact mechanism for this resistance is unknown.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThe causal agent, ''Bretziella fagacearum'', is found only within the borders of the United States, but the origin of the pathogen is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the pathogen was introduced into the United States, possibly from [[Central America|Central]] or [[South America]], or [[Mexico]].<ref>Juzwik, J.; Harrington, T.C.; MacDonald, W.L.; Appel, D.N. (2008), \"The origin of Ceratocystis fagacearum, the oak wilt fungus\", \"Annual Review of Phytopathology\",46: 13-26,</ref> The disease currently affects much of the eastern and central US, from [[Virginia]] to [[Minnesota]] to [[Arkansas]], with pockets of infection as far southwestward as the Hill Country of central [[Texas]]. One area of infection has recently been discovered as far northeastward as [[Glenville, New York|Glenville]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is particularly common in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n\n==See also==\n\n=== Mortality of oaks ===\n* [[Japanese oak wilt]] - caused by ''Raffaelea quercivora'' in Japan\n* [[Sudden oak death]] - caused by ''Phytophthora ramorum''\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/fidls/oakwilt/oakwilt.htm USDA Forest Service article]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/howtos/ht_oakwilt/toc.htm USDA \"How to prevent Oak Wilt\"]\n* [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/DD3174.html Oak Wilt in Minnesota]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1991788}}\n\n<!-- [[Category:Sordariomycetes]] moved to species Latin name redirect-->\n[[Category:Parasitic fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungal tree pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Quercus]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Central America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of South America]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox plant disease\n| name             = Oak wilt\n| image            = Oak wilt aerial photo.jpg\n| caption          = Aerial photograph of an oak wilt center (St. Paul, MN).

Symptoms vary by tree species but generally consist of leaf discoloration, wilt, defoliation, and death. The fungus spreads from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect or other airborne vectors and underground by naturally grafted tree roots. Management of the disease historically meant preventing infection by not wounding oaks during certain time periods, removing diseased oaks that will produce spores (sanitation), and breaking root connections with vibratory plows, trenchers, rock saws or hoes. Present methods focus on reducing or eliminating monocultures and restoring ecosystems correctly using soils baseline information. Fungicides are used for preventive treatments in urban areas. Oak wilt poses a danger for oak wood products and shade trees in urban areas.\n\n==Hosts and symptoms==\n[[File:Oak wilt symptoms.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of oak wilt symptoms|Photograph of leaf and whole tree symptoms of oak wilt in a red oak tree. Joseph O'Brien, USDA Forest Service, Bugwood.org]]\n\nOak wilt is one of three devastating North American vascular wilt diseases and was first seen in Wisconsin in the 1940s.  Within the last decade, it has spread into new counties in northern Wisconsin, counties northwest and northeast of the Twin Cities in Minnesota and also new locations in northeastern states.  The other two vascular wilts and their destructive time periods are [[chestnut blight]] (1900-1950) and [[Dutch elm disease]] (1928 - 1980).\n\nVascular wilts, including oak wilt, kill by fooling the tree into killing itself; the fungus or pathogen does not kill the tree or host.  The tree's reaction-to fungus entering into sapwood, by walling off the fungus, causes shutdown of water supply upward, then wilting, thus killing off the fungus doesn't eradicate the problem, keeping the water supply open and flowing upward is the main problem.  Certain elements like Boron are crucial to the trees' physiological well being, especially with translocation of fluids.  Additionally, copper and chemotherapies have been used to keep the tree or plant from killing itself via wilting[http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=EY7524088].\n\nOak wilt infects and kills all oak species but affects the two main groups, [[red oak|red]] and [[white oak]]s, differently. Mostly, red oak group trees die faster from oak wilt disease than white oak group trees. Oaks in North and Central America are sorted into two groups based mostly upon the porosity and corresponding leaf shape. The white oak group have rounded leaf edges and pores, also known as xylem or sapwood, are clogged with [[tylosis (botany)|tyloses]]. The red oak group have pointed leaf edges and pores are large and open.\n \nCommon names of oaks are based upon folklore or customs, which leads-to black oaks being in the red oak group. In the upper midwest, red oak group trees like black, northern red and northern pin are most threatened by oak wilt for two reasons: they die faster and they produce spore mats, known also as spore pads or pressure pads.  Spore mats are the fruiting bodies of the oak wilt fungus and, when ripening or sporulating, can spread disease overland.   Overland spread of oak wilt from white oaks is not a problem because white oak group trees rarely produce spore mats. When infected, oaks in the red oak group die over the course of a single summer. These oaks typically die from the top of the tree down as leaves become a bronze color and fall off the tree.  Another symptom is discoloration of the vascular tissues. Brown streaks or spots can be seen under the bark in the sapwood; oak wilt specialists call this stage II.[[File:Oak_Wilt_Dropped_Leaves_Polk_County_WI_Noon_July_14,_2016.png|thumb|right|Sudden leaf drop July red oak]]\n\nOaks in the white oak group, [[Quercus alba|white]], [[Quercus bicolor|swamp white]], and [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur]], die slower when infected (white oak in particular) and can live for several years after infection, losing a few branches each season from the top down. Bur oaks tend to die faster than others in the white oak group, although not as fast as trees in the red oak group. Symptoms in white oak are similar to those in red oak. Quercus virginiana, the southern live oak, is the most common of 31 species of evergreen oaks and is in the white oak group.\n\nOaks with oak wilt stand out with their dead crowns compared to a green canopy in the summer, so much so that oak wilt infections can be spotted from the air.\n\nNorthern pin oak (''Q. ellipsoidalis'') infection and spread are extreme when monocultures exist. Northern pin oak forests are typically found on entisol soils (aka barren, river terrace or lakebed sands) in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and these forest ecosystems are often misidentified as oak savannas, which are prairie - not forest - ecosystems. Mistaking northern pin oak forest monocultures for oak savannas, then burning them for oak savanna restoration, has made state and federal lands north of Minneapolis-St Paul the largest oak wilt disease reservoirs in Minnesota.<ref>Nelson, Steven (2011). ''Savanna Soils of Minnesota.'' Minnesota: Self. pp. 21-22,29-30. {{ISBN|978-0-615-50320-2}}.</ref>\n\nWilt and death in [[Live oak]] usually occurs within six months of infection. Live oak foliar symptoms differ from those of red and white oak. Infected live oak leaves develop yellow colored veins then eventually die and turn brown before falling off the tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texasoakwilt.org/Documents/Stewardship/OakWilt_English.pdf |title=How to identify and manage oak wilt in Texas |date= June 2003 |website=Texasokwilt.org |publisher=USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station |access-date= June 12, 2017 |quote=Leaves on diseased live oaks often develop chlorotic (yellow colored) veins that eventually die / turn brown}}</ref>\n\n==Disease Cycle==\n[[File:Oak Wilt cycle.gif|thumb|alt=Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle|Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle by Julie Martinez]]\n\n[[File:Ceratocystis fagacearum endoconidia.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ceratocystis fagacearum endoconidia|Photograph of spores produced by the oak wilt fungus. (a) Endoconidia (b) Conidiophore]]\n\nThe oak wilt fungus spreads in two basic ways: transfer of spores from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect and other vectors and movement underground of the fungus from a diseased tree to a healthy tree through [[grafting|root grafts]]. [[File:Root Graft.png|thumb|left|Root Graft of hardwood tree after excavation following vibratory plowing]] \n====Overland====\nSpores are the seeds of a fungus.  If conditions - temperature, moisture content, wood pH - are right after the oak has wilted and died, spore mats form under the bark of the tree. [[File:Spore_Mats_Car_Keys_May_2015.jpg|thumb|left|Bark removed by squirrels attracted-to fruity odor. Spore mats stage III]]\n\nSpore mats produce asexual spores called endoconidia, which are barrel shaped and produced in chains.  [[File:The Real Dr Spore Mat.jpg|thumb|right|Wood caramel colored, spore mats stage III]]Conidia are often dispersed by air and rain and also by insects and other agents.<ref>K\u00e4\u00e4rik, A. (1983).\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 {{ISBN|3-540-11900-0}}.</ref> If compatible mating types are present, these mats will also produce sexual spores called ascospores in fruiting structures called perithecia.  Ascospores are spread by water, insects and other agents.<ref>K\u00e4\u00e4rik, A. (1983).\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 {{ISBN|3-540-11900-0}}.</ref>    \nCertain species of [[Nitidulidae|sap beetles]] plus other insects, birds and animals are attracted to the fruity smell of oak wilt spore mats. \n\nSpore mats/pressure pads increase in size, eventually breaking the bark covering them, which sends the spores' fruity odor out into the area, attracting sap beetles and other insects, birds and animals, like squirrels. The oak wilt disease \"selling\" business is now open. [[File:SpMatClose.jpg|thumb|left|Spore Mat stage III meaning infectious]]One example of overland spread is sap beetles picking-up spores from diseased red oaks then depositing them onto fresh wounds made on healthy oaks.  The oak wilt \"buying\" business is now open...for 2 days only.  New infections in areas with no history of oak wilt occur by this overland transmission route.[[File:Spore_Mats_Stage_IV-V.jpg|thumb|right|Spore mats (dark patches) stage IV - V are no longer infectious]]  However, not all all red oaks that died in one year produce spores/sporulate the next year between April and July. Small red oaks 6 - 10 inch dbh tend to sporulate the autumn of the year they got infected, or not at all; small trees, once dead, dry out faster than large trees and oak wilt fungus cannot survive in that dry environment.  Roughly 15 to 30 percent of red oaks greater than 10 inch dbh will sporulate April - July the year following infection.  The other 70 - 85 percent of infected red oaks will sporulate, either before April or after July the following year or, not at all, because wood rotting fungi (Trichoderma) is already in the oak and out-competes/kills the oak wilt fungus.\n====Underground====\nOak wilt moves from diseased trees to healthy trees through roots that have become interconnected (root [[grafting|grafts]]). \nTransmission via root grafts is the most common means of spread, and makes up more than 85 % of new infections every year.  Oaks within 50 - 150 feet (15 - 50 meters) of a diseased oak can be infected via root graft transmission.  In this case, spores (also endoconidia) produced inside the tree travel upward through vascular tissue in the wood, known as the xylem.  Most root grafts form between oaks of the same species and of the same generation; it's rare for a 60 year old oak to root graft with a 15 year old oak of same species.  Red oak roots graft more commonly than do white oak roots, and grafts between red and white oaks are very rare.\n\n==Environment==\nIn the Midwest and eastern United States, conditions are usually favorable for spore production and beetle activity during spring and early summer.  In Texas, mat formation is most common in late fall and winter. Frequency of root graft formation, and therefore root graft transmission, is affected by soil type and stand composition (diversity of tree species). See disease cycle and management sections for details.\n\n==Management==\nLandowners and managers have to remember that oaks love light and heat more than other forest tree species; they are one of the few tree species that survive in the prairie regions.  Releasing or thinning oaks from competition, which gives remaining oaks more light, moisture and nutrients, should always be the primary goal, whether or not oak wilt is present.  Oak wilt is similar to [[Dutch elm disease]] but more controllable. Beetles carrying oak wilt do not have chewing mouth parts, and need some other creature or physical damage to wound the tree, whereas beetles that carry Dutch elm disease do have chewing mouth parts. Prevention is essential, as there is no permanent cure. To prevent overland spread, oaks should not be wounded, including [[pruning|pruned]], in the [[spring (season)|spring]] months in the east and Midwest or February through June in Texas. Care should be taken to prevent injury to oaks during this period, particularly during construction activities. Painting wounds less than 48 hours old is advised if oaks are wounded in the spring by wind or human caused damage. Painting wounds more than 48 hours old is not helpful because the oak by that time has compartmentalized (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODIT) the injury/wound.  Reducing the source of spores is helpful. When a dead red oak has not sporulated - hasn't reached stage III yet - before the following spring, it should be chipped or mulched onsite, then burned at a CHP (combined heat & power) plant.  If that is not possible, wood greater than 5\" diameter can be split into firewood size pieces then left onsite to dry before spring, or covered with plastic sheeting to effect composting. Heat from composting should destroy the fungus. Logs or firewood from red oak group trees that have died of oak wilt should never be moved to unaffected areas.\n\n====Root Graft or Overland Infection?====\nThe first oak in any infection center is always infected from overland spread; additional oaks killed from the disease in that infection center are killed from underground root graft spread.  Before control plans are made, the landowner or land manager (forester, arborist) needs to find out how the infection got there and what type (underground, overland or both) it is.  Root graft infections move slowly, so additional root graft infections may not be seen for 1-3 years.  It is impossible for one oak infected via overland to infect & wilt seventeen additional oaks via root graft transmission, in less than 4 months (see Kerrick, Minnesota oak wilt photo, below).  If one sees more than half dozen oaks wilting during one summer in a new infection with healthy oaks in between means infections started from overland route/storm event, not underground.  In that case, each wilting oak is a separate infection center, not part of one infection center.  One should also look at the site to confirm whether or not it's an overland infection.  Overland infections occur on or near hilltops or other exposed areas, where taller oaks get wounded, then infected, and shorter oaks look healthy.  A spread pattern with no obvious direction usually means multiple airborne/overland infections.  Root graft infections can \"fan\" out in 360 degree pattern, but tend to head faster in one or two directions because of soil and topography changes and tree species arrangement/diversity. [[File:Kost_Oak_Savanna_OW_cleanup_autumn_2007.jpg|thumb|left|Oak wilt and buckthorn cleanup on oak savanna in Chisago County, Minnesota autumn/after leaf drop 2007]]  A birds-eye view of an infection center, during the middle of summer, going from oldest to newest based on colors would show: stone dead gray, brown, yellow, orange, green.  So, if one doesn't see these color sequences or, a hub and spoke pattern radiating out, they are probably looking at multiple airborne infections.  Looks can be deceiving because 2-6 large wilting oaks may often have only 1-2 trees left nearby to infect.  Compared-to one oak deep in the woods that is just starting to wilt that can lead-to 2-5 dozen more nearby oaks dying in the next 5 years.  So, proper ground ID & diagnosis is crucial for stopping this disease.  Stopping spread with multiple infections means plowlines will be further out, so natural barriers should be located first.  In the Lake States, a vibratory plow line is installed 54 to 72 inches deep in the ground and 60 - 150 feet away from the diseased oak.  Plowing done correctly ruptures healthy roots that could, in the future, transmit oak wilt to neighboring healthy trees.  Installing plow lines far enough away from diseased oaks is key to preventing root graft disease transmission.  In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay or Caliche soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows.  Infected oaks should not be cut down before vibratory plowing because, doing so will speed up oak wilt root graft spread to nearby healthy oaks.  Base of trunk or root flare injections of azole or copper based fungicides can help contain foliar - or top down - infections but are costly and have less success containing root graft - bottom up - transmission of oak wilt.\n\n\n====Strategies - Containment vs. Control====\nThere is a big difference between containment and control.  Containment happens within a few hours or days; control takes weeks or many months.  The lack of appreciation and understanding for disease control methods and strategies has led to a lot of landowners and taxpayers thinking there is no way to control oak wilt.  Despite 40-50 years of work & study showing oak wilt as one of the easiest to control forest diseases in North America.  Putting a plowline around an oak wilt infection center is containment, which is not controlling the disease.  Going inside the containment lines or natural barriers/edges/cover type changes and making sure all oak wilt infections are dead and gone is control.  Landowners and managers have to ask themselves this question (are we going to be containing or controlling this disease?) before starting a disease control project, whether in a small yard or on hundreds of acres.  Control also means removal and processing - mostly by logging - of future spore-producing oaks.  For the last 40-50 years, experienced professionals throughout North America have been doing insect & disease control year round, not four or six months per year.  They stop oak wilt spread by identifying future spore producing red oaks, which trees to protect from wounding, which trees not threatened by root graft infection then, respond same day to tree health changes.  Agriculture and construction work starts in April-May each year, so it behooves oak wilt specialists to continue disease control work and prevention right through spring and early summer.\n[[File:White_Oak_on_Nymore_soils_Chisago_County_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Healthy white oak (Q. alba) remaining after cleaning up 7-1-11 storm damage & oak wilt infections, 13 months after storm, 2012, Chisago County Minnesota]]\nAfter 2005, treatment goals shifted towards \"passive oak wilt control\" on properties less than 5 acres and treating to natural barriers or edges for large acreages. Passive control means letting the disease burn out over a few years which allows other native tree and shrub species to take over. Treating to natural barriers means restoring to native forest or savanna species by harvesting out to where oak wilt can no longer expand via root grafts. All oaks of the species that is infected are logged out, whether they are infected or healthy. Passive oak wilt control on large acreages creates short and long term problems for oaks. White oak group trees are at risk for infection from nearby sporulating red oak group trees for the short term; invasive species can take over and monocultures of oaks can re-develop that sustain oak wilt infections for 50-100 more years making for long term risks. Treating to natural barriers/edges or cover type changes is by far the best method to use when controlling oak wilt on large acreages.\n\n==Importance==\n\nOak wilt is a devastating disease, killing trees rapidly in a single season. It is an important disease in urban areas where a few oak trees in a homeowner's yard may be of great value. If one tree in the homeowners yard becomes infected it will die. Not only will the homeowner need to pay to remove the dead tree, they will also need to protect the rest of the oak trees in their yard or face the prospect that remaining oaks will continue to die. Loss of trees from a property can also lead to a decrease in property value. Even if a homeowner is vigilant about pruning at the correct time, storms and construction can damage trees and introduce oak wilt into a neighborhood.  In forest systems, oak wilt is an important disease of oak produced for hardwood lumber and railroad ties.\n\n===July 1, 2011 Windstorm in Minnesota and Wisconsin===\n\n[[File:Kerrick_Oak_Wilt_8-19-16_Spawned-_from_7-1-2011_Infection_Centers.png|thumb|left|North Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru northern Pine and Carlton Counties Minnesota.

The infections appeared to have coincided-with the July 1, 2011 mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) windstorm,<ref>NWS NOAA https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Storm_1_01July2011_SW_to_NE.pdf</ref> which had windspeeds of over 100&nbsp;mph, because foresters found that first oaks infected were 7-1-11 storm-damaged oaks. \nThey also knew infections happened within 48 hours of storm damage. West-facing slopes on the east bank (Wisconsin side) and terrace crests in the St. Croix river valley were hit hard with wind damage and oak wilt infections.  Hilltops and bottoms and field edges, where oaks were more exposed, also had more serious wind and oak wilt damage.  Approximately 3/4 million acres in Minnesota, possibly 10 times that area for Wisconsin<ref>WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt-detections/</ref> and up to the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, were affected by the storm. Millions of freshly wounded oak trees were now open to infection from trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in by the storm.\n\n====Infection Levels-Spore Loads====\nIt's difficult for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because it's too hot for red oaks to sporulate and latewood cell development has been underway since early to mid-June. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in from west-southwest and the windstorm's tearing/shredding/breaking-apart trees which re-opened oaks' 2011 & 2010 earlywood cells (earlywood is also called ''springwood'', and latewood goes by the name ''summerwood'' in some areas). The oak wilt fungus is too big to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can fit within and move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This storm damage increased the chances of infection 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres. The manageable level of oak wilt disease is one infection per 640 acres.[[File:Oak_Wilt_Infection_Center_in_2013_Created_7-1-2011_Rushseba_Township,_Chisago_County,_Minnesota.jpg|thumb|right|7-1-2011 storm-caused oak wilt on terrace crest in Rushsheba Township, Chisago County, Minnesota]][[File:East_Farmington_3_Infection_Centers_photo_taken_8-8-16.png|thumb|left|South Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru St. Croix County, Wisconsin.  Photo shows one of five 7-1-11 infection centers on hilltop near East Farmington, Wisconsin]]\nOne year after the storm, in summer 2012, oak wilt specialists found 10 - 20 infections per 100 acres both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State Park<ref>Minnesota DNR Forestry 2012 Forest Health Annual Report, p. 37</ref>  in Pine County, Minnesota. \nWounding & infecting at ten oaks per 100 acres, one oak per 100 acres or one oak per 200 acres presents a serious threat to the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northern-most infected oak and southern-most infected oak were 10 miles apart. This broad coverage of oak wilt blanketing millions of acres is achieved only with huge spore supplies and re-opening of that years' earlywood cells.\n====Detection====\nThe use of spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging show promise for accurate detection of the disease <ref> https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/40/3/377/5728678 <ref> and are currently being tested for large scale detection and monitoring.\n\n====Sources====\nSources with that many hundreds of acres of oak wilt spores were upwind  (240 degrees/west southwest) in the three oak wilt \"reservoirs\" on state and federal lands in Sherburne, Anoka, Isanti and Chisago counties of Minnesota (see Hosts and Symptoms). The sources of oak wilt spores were not nearby.\n\n====Rate of Spread====\nBefore the windstorm, oak wilt could spread north at three quarters of a mile per year and east or west at one and one half miles per year.<ref>Minnesota DNR Forestry (2001).</ref>  During the storm, oak wilt spread at up to 100 miles per hour. In the two years following the 2011 storm, infections were found at new locations in four Minnesota and at least one (Sawyer) of three Wisconsin counties.<ref>Wisconsin DNR Division of Forestry, Annual Report 2012 p. 6</ref><ref>WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt-detections/</ref> These 2011 infections have serious ecological/economic impacts, including loss of stumpage and real estate values, and will only get worse if summer (aerial with ground follow up) surveys aren't established as soon as possible.\n\n\n==Host-Parasite Interaction==\n\nHardwood vascular wilt diseases are characterized by blockage of the tree's water-conducting vessels by either the physical presence of the pathogen (mycelium and spores), or through the host's own response to infection. Oak trees, in response to wounding or infection often produce [[tylosis (botany)|tyloses]], balloon-like outgrowths of the vessels' cell walls that can function to wall-off pathogens and prevent infections from spreading. Red oaks appear to lack a host-response mechanism that restricts the pathogen's movement, and infection usually kills the tree by wilting the entire crown. White oaks, which produce [[tyloses]] more quickly and in greater numbers, are more resistant to the disease, though the exact mechanism for this resistance is unknown.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThe causal agent, ''Bretziella fagacearum'', is found only within the borders of the United States, but the origin of the pathogen is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the pathogen was introduced into the United States, possibly from [[Central America|Central]] or [[South America]], or [[Mexico]].<ref>Juzwik, J.; Harrington, T.C.; MacDonald, W.L.; Appel, D.N. (2008), \"The origin of Ceratocystis fagacearum, the oak wilt fungus\", \"Annual Review of Phytopathology\",46: 13-26,</ref> The disease currently affects much of the eastern and central US, from [[Virginia]] to [[Minnesota]] to [[Arkansas]], with pockets of infection as far southwestward as the Hill Country of central [[Texas]]. One area of infection has recently been discovered as far northeastward as [[Glenville, New York|Glenville]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is particularly common in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n\n==See also==\n\n=== Mortality of oaks ===\n* [[Japanese oak wilt]] - caused by ''Raffaelea quercivora'' in Japan\n* [[Sudden oak death]] - caused by ''Phytophthora ramorum''\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/fidls/oakwilt/oakwilt.htm USDA Forest Service article]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/howtos/ht_oakwilt/toc.htm USDA \"How to prevent Oak Wilt\"]\n* [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/DD3174.html Oak Wilt in Minnesota]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1991788}}\n\n<!-- [[Category:Sordariomycetes]] moved to species Latin name redirect-->\n[[Category:Parasitic fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungal tree pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Quercus]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Central America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of South America]]\n", "name_user": "Cavender.bares", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_wilt"}

These complex architectures allow some group I and group II introns to be ''self-splicing'', that is, the intron-containing RNA molecule can rearrange its own covalent structure so as to precisely remove the intron and link the exons together in the correct order. In some cases, particular intron-binding proteins are involved in splicing, acting in such a way that they assist the intron in folding into the three-dimensional structure that is necessary for self-splicing activity. Group I and group II introns are distinguished by different sets of internal conserved sequences and folded structures, and by the fact that splicing of RNA molecules containing group II introns generates branched introns (like those of spliceosomal RNAs), while group I introns use a non-encoded guanosine nucleotide (typically GTP) to initiate splicing, adding it on to the 5'-end of the excised intron.\n\n== Biological functions and evolution ==\nWhile introns do not encode protein products, they are integral to gene expression regulation.

At least seven mechanisms of intron gain have been reported thus far: Intron Transposition, Transposon Insertion, Tandem Genomic Duplication, Intron Transfer, Intron Gain during Double-Strand Break Repair (DSBR), Insertion of a Group II Intron, and Intronization.  In theory it should be easiest to deduce the origin of recently gained introns due to the lack of host-induced mutations, yet even introns gained recently did not arise from any of the aforementioned mechanisms. These findings thus raise the question of whether or not the proposed mechanisms of intron gain fail to describe the mechanistic origin of many novel introns because they are not accurate mechanisms of intron gain, or if there are other, yet to be discovered, processes generating novel introns.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Yenerall | first1 = P. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-7-29 | title = Identifying the mechanisms of intron gain: Progress and trends | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 7 | pages = 29 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22963364| pmc =3443670 }}</ref>\n\nIn intron transposition, the most commonly purported intron gain mechanism, a spliced intron is thought to reverse splice into either its own mRNA or another mRNA at a previously intron-less position. This intron-containing mRNA is then reverse transcribed and the resulting intron-containing cDNA may then cause intron gain via complete or partial recombination with its original genomic locus. Transposon insertions can also result in intron creation. Such an insertion could intronize the transposon without disrupting the coding sequence when a transposon inserts into the sequence AGGT, resulting in the duplication of this sequence on each side of the transposon. It is not yet understood why these elements are spliced, whether by chance, or by some preferential action by the transposon. In tandem genomic duplication, due to the similarity between consensus donor and acceptor splice sites, which both closely resemble AGGT, the tandem genomic duplication of an exonic segment harboring an AGGT sequence generates two potential splice sites. When recognized by the spliceosome, the sequence between the original and duplicated AGGT will be spliced, resulting in the creation of an intron without alteration of the coding sequence of the gene. Double-stranded break repair via non-homologous end joining was recently identified as a source of intron gain when researchers identified short direct repeats flanking 43% of gained introns in Daphnia.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/> These numbers must be compared to the number of conserved introns flanked by repeats in other organisms, though, for statistical relevance. For group II intron insertion, the retrohoming of a group II intron into a nuclear gene was proposed to cause recent spliceosomal intron gain.\n\nIntron transfer has been hypothesized to result in intron gain when a paralog or pseudogene gains an intron and then transfers this intron via recombination to an intron-absent location in its sister paralog. Intronization is the process by which mutations create novel introns from formerly exonic sequence. Thus, unlike other proposed mechanisms of intron gain, this mechanism does not require the insertion or generation of DNA to create a novel intron.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/>\n\nThe only hypothesized mechanism of recent intron gain lacking any direct evidence is that of group II intron insertion, which when demonstrated in vivo, abolishes gene expression.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Chalamcharla | first1 = V.

Further genomic analyses, especially when executed at the population level, may then quantify the relative contribution of each mechanism, possibly identifying species-specific biases that may shed light on varied rates of intron gain amongst different species.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n'''Structure:'''\n* [[Exon]]\n* [[mRNA]]\n* [[Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure]]\n* [[Small t intron]]\n'''Splicing:'''\n* [[Alternative splicing]]\n* [[Exitron]]\n* [[Minor spliceosome]]\n* [[Outron]]\n'''Function'''\n* [[MicroRNA]]\n'''Others:'''\n* [[Exon shuffling]]\n* [[Intein]]\n* [[Interrupted gene]]\n* [[Noncoding DNA]]\n* [[Noncoding RNA]]\n* [[Selfish DNA]]\n* [[Twintron]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225316/http://www.mybioinfo.info/exon_search_symbol.php A search engine for exon/intron sequences defined by NCBI]\n* Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, and Peter Walter ''Molecular Biology of the Cell'', 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-4105-5}}.

At least seven mechanisms of intron gain have been reported thus far: Intron Transposition, Transposon Insertion, Tandem Genomic Duplication, Intron Transfer, Intron Gain during Double-Strand Break Repair (DSBR), Insertion of a Group II Intron, and Intronization.  In theory it should be easiest to deduce the origin of recently gained introns due to the lack of host-induced mutations, yet even introns gained recently did not arise from any of the aforementioned mechanisms. These findings thus raise the question of whether or not the proposed mechanisms of intron gain fail to describe the mechanistic origin of many novel introns because they are not accurate mechanisms of intron gain, or if there are other, yet to be discovered, processes generating novel introns.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Yenerall | first1 = P. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-7-29 | title = Identifying the mechanisms of intron gain: Progress and trends | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 7 | pages = 29 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22963364| pmc =3443670 }}</ref>\n\nIn intron transposition, the most commonly purported intron gain mechanism, a spliced intron is thought to reverse splice into either its own mRNA or another mRNA at a previously intron-less position. This intron-containing mRNA is then reverse transcribed and the resulting intron-containing cDNA may then cause intron gain via complete or partial recombination with its original genomic locus. Transposon insertions can also result in intron creation. Such an insertion could intronize the transposon without disrupting the coding sequence when a transposon inserts into the sequence AGGT, resulting in the duplication of this sequence on each side of the transposon. It is not yet understood why these elements are spliced, whether by chance, or by some preferential action by the transposon. In tandem genomic duplication, due to the similarity between consensus donor and acceptor splice sites, which both closely resemble AGGT, the tandem genomic duplication of an exonic segment harboring an AGGT sequence generates two potential splice sites. When recognized by the spliceosome, the sequence between the original and duplicated AGGT will be spliced, resulting in the creation of an intron without alteration of the coding sequence of the gene. Double-stranded break repair via non-homologous end joining was recently identified as a source of intron gain when researchers identified short direct repeats flanking 43% of gained introns in Daphnia.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/> These numbers must be compared to the number of conserved introns flanked by repeats in other organisms, though, for statistical relevance. For group II intron insertion, the retrohoming of a group II intron into a nuclear gene was proposed to cause recent spliceosomal intron gain.\n\nIntron transfer has been hypothesized to result in intron gain when a paralog or pseudogene gains an intron and then transfers this intron via recombination to an intron-absent location in its sister paralog. Intronization is the process by which mutations create novel introns from formerly exonic sequence. Thus, unlike other proposed mechanisms of intron gain, this mechanism does not require the insertion or generation of DNA to create a novel intron.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/>\n\nThe only hypothesized mechanism of recent intron gain lacking any direct evidence is that of group II intron insertion, which when demonstrated in vivo, abolishes gene expression.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Chalamcharla | first1 = V.

Further genomic analyses, especially when executed at the population level, may then quantify the relative contribution of each mechanism, possibly identifying species-specific biases that may shed light on varied rates of intron gain amongst different species.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n'''Structure:'''\n* [[Exon]]\n* [[mRNA]]\n* [[Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure]]\n* [[Small t intron]]\n'''Splicing:'''\n* [[Alternative splicing]]\n* [[Exitron]]\n* [[Minor spliceosome]]\n* [[Outron]]\n'''Function'''\n* [[MicroRNA]]\n'''Others:'''\n* [[Exon shuffling]]\n* [[Intein]]\n* [[Interrupted gene]]\n* [[Noncoding DNA]]\n* [[Noncoding RNA]]\n* [[Selfish DNA]]\n* [[Twintron]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225316/http://www.mybioinfo.info/exon_search_symbol.php A search engine for exon/intron sequences defined by NCBI]\n* Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, and Peter Walter ''Molecular Biology of the Cell'', 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-4105-5}}.

Radical feminist scholar and writer Andrea Dworkin named male power as the \u201c\u2018raison d\u2019etre\u2019 of pornography,\u201d as well as stating that pornography in itself is a means for expressing male power in her 1981 book \u201cPornography: Men Possessing Women.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pornography: Men Possessing Women|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|publisher=Perigee|year=1981|isbn=0399505326|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pornogr_dwo_1981_00_1790}}</ref>\n\nJae Woong Shim, author of ''Analysis of Representation of Sexuality on Women\u2019s and Men\u2019s Pornographic Websites'', describes her work, \u201cWe investigated how the sexuality of men and women is represented on pornographic websites aimed at women and pornographic websites aimed at men. We analyzed 200 pornographic images randomly selected from 4 websites (2 aimed at women and 2 aimed at men). The criteria for comparison were based on concepts of sexual inequality and sexual objectification that have been commonly used in the literature on analyses of pornography content.

In mainstream porn everything is about male pleasure and women are objects. Oral sex for men can last forever, but when women's turn comes it lasts 10 seconds. Female orgasms are not an issue in most of the films. And women are shown mostly as prostitutes, which is sad. Mainstream porn lacks creativity and a narrative. They only care about sets of genitals banging together as the woman enjoys fake pleasure until they get their money shot. The man is enjoying his orgasm with no thought to the woman\u2019s pleasure at all. The performer\u2019s are cloned stereotypes, everybody abiding to the same standards. Body hair is seen as something undesirable, or God forbid if you\u2019re not thin and muscular like an action man. There are no interesting stories, relatable characters, or good sex. It\u2019s bad sex that\u2019s given porn a bad name. I want others to continue to be inspired by the work I do, I want to encourage other women to get into leading roles within the adult film industry, as directors, producers, and scriptwriters. That way we can get more of the porn we want out there and express our perspective, our desires, and our pleasure. I create an environment which satisfies the viewer with realistic interpretations of real fantasies. The performers look like and play characters that are like the guy or girl on the street, they are natural, individual and attractive in their own unique way. The sex is real, you can see the pleasure. To get excited women want to see something that looks like us. We want to see independent women exploring their sexuality, who are not afraid, but are not sex heroines either. We want to see attractive men who share our lifestyles, our ideas. My films portray men and women as equals with consideration to everyone\u2019s pleasure, fantasies, and desires. Viewers can see themselves in my films, they feel like they could live out that scenario. That\u2019s what makes it more satisfying, erotic, and fun!\u201d <ref name=\"The problem with mainstream porn\"/>\n\n==Performers==\nPorn stars have differing views on the idea of women's pornography. Some performers embrace the movement, like Asa Akira, an award-winning porn star. Akira stated \u201cI\u2019m part of the new era of porn. We\u2019re feminists, very sex-positive people. We\u2019re not victims of rape, not drug addicts, we don\u2019t have any daddy issues.\u201d <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|title = From prep-school kid to millionaire porn star|url = https://nypost.com/2014/04/26/how-a-manhattan-prep-school-kid-became-a-millionaire-porn-star|website = The New York Post|accessdate = 2016-12-02|date = 2014-04-26}}</ref> Some performers also note the problems in the industry and then turn to directing themselves, like Madison Young. Young felt that most mainstream adult film videos lacked substance and sent confusing and potentially harmful signals about sex and body image to viewers. As a result, she turned to directing to add to the new movement of porn. Madison makes sure to include verbal consent, body positivity, and inclusiveness to all her performances.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|title = Madison Young Aims to Revolutionize Pornography|url = http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/reel-to-real/Content?oid=4203282|website = East Bay Express|accessdate = 2016-12-02}}</ref>\nMeanwhile, other performers fail to see the need for a specific type of porn just for women. As porn star James Deen put it, \u201cWhy is there porn explicitly only for women? By saying there needs to be porn for women, you\u2019re basically isolating women as a gender, and saying, \u201cThis is how women should think.

In mainstream porn everything is about male pleasure and women are objects. Oral sex for men can last forever, but when women's turn comes it lasts 10 seconds. Female orgasms are not an issue in most of the films. And women are shown mostly as prostitutes, which is sad. Mainstream porn lacks creativity and a narrative. They only care about sets of genitals banging together as the woman enjoys fake pleasure until they get their money shot. The man is enjoying his orgasm with no thought to the woman\u2019s pleasure at all. The performer\u2019s are cloned stereotypes, everybody abiding to the same standards. Body hair is seen as something undesirable, or God forbid if you\u2019re not thin and muscular like an action man. There are no interesting stories, relatable characters, or good sex. It\u2019s bad sex that\u2019s given porn a bad name. I want others to continue to be inspired by the work I do, I want to encourage other women to get into leading roles within the adult film industry, as directors, producers, and scriptwriters. That way we can get more of the porn we want out there and express our perspective, our desires, and our pleasure. I create an environment which satisfies the viewer with realistic interpretations of real fantasies. The performers look like and play characters that are like the guy or girl on the street, they are natural, individual and attractive in their own unique way. The sex is real, you can see the pleasure. To get excited women want to see something that looks like us. We want to see independent women exploring their sexuality, who are not afraid, but are not sex heroines either. We want to see attractive men who share our lifestyles, our ideas. My films portray men and women as equals with consideration to everyone\u2019s pleasure, fantasies, and desires. Viewers can see themselves in my films, they feel like they could live out that scenario. That\u2019s what makes it more satisfying, erotic, and fun!\u201d <ref name=\"The problem with mainstream porn\"/>\n\n==Performers==\nPorn stars have differing views on the idea of women's pornography. Some performers embrace the movement, like Asa Akira, an award-winning porn star. Akira stated \u201cI\u2019m part of the new era of porn. We\u2019re feminists, very sex-positive people.

Young felt that most mainstream adult film videos lacked substance and sent confusing and potentially harmful signals about sex and body image to viewers. As a result, she turned to directing to add to the new movement of porn. Madison makes sure to include verbal consent, body positivity, and inclusiveness to all her performances.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|title = Madison Young Aims to Revolutionize Pornography|url = http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/reel-to-real/Content?oid=4203282|website = East Bay Express|accessdate = 2016-12-02}}</ref>\nMeanwhile, other performers fail to see the need for a specific type of porn just for women. As porn star James Deen put it, \u201cWhy is there porn explicitly only for women?
