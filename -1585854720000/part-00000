It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design and combat mechanics.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn a demo build unveiled to the public in January 2020, further new mechanics were also revealed, including high-difficulty Slayer Challenges, additional upgrade resources including Sentinel Crystals, and the ability to take control of some enemy units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/watch-15-minutes-of-new-doom-eternal-gameplay/|title=Watch 15 minutes of new 'DOOM Eternal' gameplay|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=2019-10-08|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors. Players can also unlock a bonus weapon, the Unmaykr, after clearing six challenging Slayer Gates. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternals-hub-area-the-fortress-of-doom-has-up/1100-6472907/|title=Doom Eternal's Hub Area: The Fortress Of Doom Has Upgrades, Easter Eggs, And More|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwo years after the events of 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out 60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement initially formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a new arsenal of weapons and a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to Hell  to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge; the Slayer retrieves his Super Shotgun and defeats the Priest's Doom Hunter guardians before killing him.\n\nIn response to Deag Ranak\u2019s death, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a secure location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. After destroying the nest, Vega suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to a compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, the Slayer's past is revealed. The Slayer, who is identified by the name \"[[Doomguy]]\", is revealed to be from Earth. He was found on Sentinel Prime badly wounded, and ranting about his desire to kill the demons who were then unknown to the Sentinels and the Khan Maykr. The Priests had Doomguy tested in a gladiatorial arena where he bested his opponents and thereafter was inducted into the Sentinel military. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena. Despite knowing it is against Sentinel law, Slayer kills Deag Grav after defeating his guardian, the Gladiator and returns to the fortress.\n\nDespite stopping the demons' invasion of Earth, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr, who resolves to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind. However, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. More of the Slayer's past is revealed. During Hell's invasion of the Sentinels' world a rogue [[Seraph|servant]] to the Khan Maykr imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Slayer. It is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nWith the Icon of Sin on Urdak, Hayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Maykr\u2019s dimension. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and manages to teleport to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer over his actions, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer manages to kill the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin. After an intense battle, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

[[Bethesda Softworks]]. It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design and combat mechanics.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn a demo build unveiled to the public in January 2020, further new mechanics were also revealed, including high-difficulty Slayer Challenges, additional upgrade resources including Sentinel Crystals, and the ability to take control of some enemy units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/watch-15-minutes-of-new-doom-eternal-gameplay/|title=Watch 15 minutes of new 'DOOM Eternal' gameplay|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=2019-10-08|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors. Players can also unlock a bonus weapon, the Unmaykr, after clearing six challenging Slayer Gates. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternals-hub-area-the-fortress-of-doom-has-up/1100-6472907/|title=Doom Eternal's Hub Area: The Fortress Of Doom Has Upgrades, Easter Eggs, And More|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwo years after the events of 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out 60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement initially formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a new arsenal of weapons and a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to Hell  to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge; the Slayer retrieves his Super Shotgun and defeats the Priest's Doom Hunter guardians before killing him.\n\nIn response to Deag Ranak\u2019s death, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a secure location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. After destroying the nest, Vega suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to a compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, the Slayer's past is revealed. The Slayer, who is identified by the name \"[[Doomguy]]\", is revealed to be from Earth. He was found on Sentinel Prime badly wounded, and ranting about his desire to kill the demons who were then unknown to the Sentinels and the Khan Maykr. The Priests had Doomguy tested in a gladiatorial arena where he bested his opponents and thereafter was inducted into the Sentinel military. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena. Despite knowing it is against Sentinel law, Slayer kills Deag Grav after defeating his guardian, the Gladiator and returns to the fortress.\n\nDespite stopping the demons' invasion of Earth, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr, who resolves to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind. However, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. More of the Slayer's past is revealed. During Hell's invasion of the Sentinels' world a rogue [[Seraph|servant]] to the Khan Maykr imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Slayer. It is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nWith the Icon of Sin on Urdak, Hayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Maykr\u2019s dimension. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and manages to teleport to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer over his actions, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer manages to kill the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin. After an intense battle, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

Most have been donated by individuals or organizations, few by the city itself. While many early statues are of authors and poets along \"Literary Walk\" and American figures like [[Daniel Webster]] and \"the Pilgrim\", other early works were simply picturesque, like ''The Hunter'' and ''The Falconer''; other notable statues include the [[statue of Balto]], an Egyptian [[obelisk]] called the \"[[Cleopatra's Needle (New York City)|Cleopatra's Needle]]\", [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice of Wonderland]], and [[Duke Ellington Memorial]].\n\n==Selected sculptures==\n\n===Animals===\n[[File:Balto.jpg|thumb|upright|''Balto'']]\n[[File:\"Still Hunt\" 4.jpg|thumb|''Still Hunt'']]\n* '''''[[Statue of Balto|Balto]]''''' was dedicated to the sled dogs that led several dogsled teams through a snow-storm in the winter of 1925 in order to deliver [[medicine]] that would stop a [[diphtheria]] epidemic in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Alaska]]. The sculpture is slightly larger than the real-life dog, and is placed on a rock outcropping on the main path leading north from the Tisch Children's Zoo. The sculpture was created by [[Frederick George Richard Roth]], and placed in the park in 1925. Like so many other [[monument]]s in the park, it's made of [[bronze]], and it was donated to the park by the Balto Monument Committee to the City of [[New York City|New York]].  Under the [[sculpture]], a small plaque can be found, containing the following inscription:\n:<center>''Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxins six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925.

It is made of bronze, and was cast in Paris, France in 1850 and was placed in the park in 1863. The sculpture was donated by [[Gordon Webster Burnham]], who also donated the statue of [[Daniel Webster]], as well as statues in other cities.  The monument depicts a goat, wedged accidentally between two rocks, which is about to be devoured by two [[eagle]]s. Their talons are sunk into the back of the goat as they flap their wings in victory.\n* '''''Still Hunt''''' is a bronze sculpture of a crouching [[cougar]] waiting to pounce by sculptor [[Edward Kemeys]] (1843\u20131907), installed in the park in 1883. Situated on a rock outcrop on the west side of the East Drive at the edge of the Ramble, the crouching animal has scared many joggers as they climb \"Cat Hill\" (formally Cedar Hill) and approach this life-size and realistic representation. Unlike the traditional sculptures of other animals in the park that sit on a stone base or pedestal, Kemeys situated his sculpture directly on the rock ledge. Kemeys was so interested in depicting his animals in a realistic mode that he traveled to the western states to see them in their native habitat.\n\n===Artists===\n* Bust of the architect '''''[[Richard Morris Hunt]]''''' at the Hunt Memorial, along with two other figures sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]]. Flanking the Hunt bust are statuettes, one holding a sculptor's mallet and a palette, representing the allied arts, while the other holds a model for the Administration Building at the [[Chicago]] [[World's Columbian Exposition]], designed by Hunt. On the perimeter wall of Central Park, Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, opposite the [[Frick Collection]], which was built on the site of the [[New York Public Library|Lenox Library]], also designed by architect Hunt. The granite and marble Hunt memorial was designed by American architect [[Bruce Price]].\n* Tucked into a dead end triangle of Central Park at East 96th/97th Street, the statue of [[Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/albert-bertel-thorvaldsen.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ | title=Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen}}</ref> was first dedicated in 1894 and is the only statue of an artist displayed in any New York City park.\n\n===Fictional characters===\n[[File:Alice in Wonderland Central Park NYC.JPG|right|thumb]]\n* One large sculpture depicts '''''[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]''''', from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 classic ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The statue is located on [[East 74th Street]] on the north side of Central Park's Conservatory Water. Alice is pictured sitting on a [[giant]] [[mushroom]] reaching toward a [[pocket watch]] held by the [[White Rabbit]]. Peering over her shoulder is the [[Cheshire Cat]], flanked on one side by the [[Dormouse]], and on the other by [[Mad Hatter]], who in contrast to the calm Alice looks ready to laugh out loud at any moment.  Publisher and philanthropist [[George T. Delacorte Jr.]] ordered the sculpture from [[Jos\u00e9 de Creeft]], in honor of Delacorte's late wife, Margarita, and to the enjoyment of the children of [[New York City|New York]]. Unveiled in 1959, de Creeft's sculpture tries to follow [[John Tenniel]]'s whimsical [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] illustrations from the first edition of the book. According to various sources, Alice is said to look like de Creeft's daughter Donna. The Alice in Wonderland project's architects and designers were Hideo Sasaki and Fernando Texidor, who inserted some plaques with inscriptions from the book in the terrace around the sculpture. Margarita's favorite poem, \"The Jabberwocky\" is also included; chiseled in a granite circle surrounding the sculpture:\n''<center>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe</center>''\n:The design of the sculpture attracts many children who want to climb its many levels, resulting in the bronze's glowing patina, polished by thousands of tiny hands over the years since the sculpture was unveiled.  It was cast at Modern Art Foundry Astoria Queens NY. The sculpture was in the music video of Slick Ricks Children's Story.\n* The '''[[Burnett Memorial Fountain]]''', dedicated to the author [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], was placed in the [[Conservatory Garden]] when it reopened in 1936, a donation by the ad hoc Children's Garden Building Committee. It was designed and created by [[Bessie Potter Vonnoh]] between 1926 and 1936. When Frances Hodgson Burnett died in 1924, some of her friends wanted to honor her memory by creating a storytelling area in Central Park. They chose the Conservatory Garden's south garden, at 104th Street and Fifth Avenue, as the site for the memorial. It is believed that the two figures, a reclining boy playing the flute and the young girl holding the bowl, represent Mary and Dickon, the main characters from ''[[The Secret Garden]]''.\n\n===Historical figures===\n[[File:SimonBolivarCentralParkNYC.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (Central Park)|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'']]\n[[File:Christopher columbus321.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Statue of Christopher Columbus (Central Park)|Statue of Christopher Columbus]]]]\n* The [[equestrian sculpture]] of '''''[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]''''' was originally sited on the rock outcropping between 82nd and 83rd Streets overlooking [[Central Park West]], where the Bol\u00edvar Hotel, once facing it, commemorates its location. After Sixth Avenue was renamed [[Avenue of the Americas]] in 1945, the sculpture was relocated in the 1950s to be adjacent to those of fellow Latin American revolutionary leaders [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] at the head of the Avenue of the Americas.\n* In 1892, the '''[[Statue of Christopher Columbus (Central Park)|statue of Christopher Columbus]]''' was donated to Central Park by the [[New York Genealogical and Biographical Society]] in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of his arrival in the Americas. The statue replicates one made by [[Jeronimo Su\u00f1ol]] in 1892,<ref>The park's sculpture is signed in the bronze \"J. SU\u00d1OL\"; it bears the foundry mark of Federico Masriera Barcelona 1892.</ref> located at the Plaza de Colon, in [[Madrid]]. The New York version was placed in the park in 1894 at the foot of the Mall, and is today one of two monuments of Columbus found in the park's environs, the other being the statue surmounting the column at [[Columbus Circle]].  The sculpture depicts the explorer standing with outstretched arms, looking towards the heavens in gratitude for his successful voyage.\n* The standing [[Statue of Alexander Hamilton (Central Park)|sculpture]] of [[Alexander Hamilton]] standing in a grove of apple trees and crabapples west of the East Drive behind the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was \"presented by [[John Church Hamilton|John C. Hamilton]] 1880\", according to the inscription on its granite base. The donor was the son of Hamilton. It was sculpted by [[Carl Conrads]].\n* The '''''[[King Jagiello Monument]]''''' is an equestrian statue of King '''[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]]''' of [[History of Poland during the Jagiellonian dynasty|Poland]], holding over his head two crossed swords, is the largest sculpture in Central Park.  As a result of the outbreak of the World War II, the monument stayed in New York; in July 1945 it was presented to the City of New York by the King Jagiello Monument Committee and permanently placed in Central Park with the cooperation of the last pre-Communist consul of Poland in New York, Kazimierz Krasicki.<ref>{{cite journal|title=In the Footsteps of Stanislaw K.

The regiment was, as its name implies, stationed in New York, and consisted of males mainly from this region. In 1917, the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]'s 7th New York Infantry Registry Division. While in France, they saw heavy action, and at the end of the war in November 1918, of the 3,700 men originally in the regiment, 580 men were killed and 1,487 wounded, with four of the regiment's soldiers being awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].  The memorial depicts seven men; the one to the far right carrying two [[Mills bomb]]s, while supporting the wounded soldier next to him. To his right another infantryman (depicting Robert Russell Bennett, a 107 combat veteran who was asked by the artist to model for the statue along with 6 other actual 107 veterans of the Somme) rushes towards the enemy positions, while the helmet less squad leader and another soldier are approaching the enemy with bayonets fixed. To the far left, one soldier is holding a mortally wounded soldier, keeping him on his feet. The [[bronze]] memorial was donated by 7th\u2013107th Memorial Committee, and was designed and sculpted by [[Karl Illava]], who served in the 107th IR as a sergeant in World War I. The monument was first conceived about 1920, was made in 1926\u20131927 and was placed in the park and unveiled in 1927, near the perimeter wall at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 67th Street.\n\n===Writers and poets===\n[[File:NYC Hans C Andersen.jpg|thumb|right|''Hans Christian Andersen'']]\n* '''''[[Hans Christian Andersen]]''''', the famous Danish fairy-tale writer, his most notable work being \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\".

It was intended as a companion statue to '''''[[Statue of Walter Scott (New York City)|Sir Walter Scott]]''''' by the same sculptor, erected some eight years previously.\n* '''''[[Statue of Fitz-Greene Halleck|Fitz-Greene Halleck]]''''' has been described as the ''least known literary figure today on Literary Walk'', despite being the only person to have a memorial unveiled by the then-[[president of the United States]], [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1877, ten years after his death in November 1867. The monument was funded by the use of public subscription, and had a long list of prominent guests and speakers at the dedication and unveiling of the monument, among them the president's cabinet, [[General of the Army]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T.Sherman]], the poets [[Bayard Taylor]], [[George Henry Boker]] and [[William Cullen Bryant]], as well as other notable citizens.  The monument is made in bronze by [[James Wilson Alexander MacDonald]], and is placed near the Literary Walk and The Mall. The monument has been thoroughly refurbished by The Central Park Conservancy, first by hot waxing it in 1983, and then again in 1992, as well as in 1999, when it was dewaxed, pressure-washed and repatinated, and then protected by a coating of a corrosion-inhibiting lacquer.\n* '''''[[Statue of William Shakespeare (New York City)|William Shakespeare]]''''', a bronze statue on a stone pedestal, located to the south of the mall, southeast of Sheep's Meadow; this sculpture was erected with funds raised from a benefit performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' on November 25, 1864, at [[The Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|The Winter Garden Theatre]], in a performance by [[Edwin Booth]], [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]] and their younger brother, [[John Wilkes Booth]].

At the unveiling ceremony, the artist's brochure quoted a Biblical verse from the Gospel of St. John: ''Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called\u2026 Bethesda\u2026whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.''  The fountain was designed and created by [[Emma Stebbins]], who became the first woman to receive a sculptural commission in New York City when she was commissioned to create this fountain. <!-- CHECK It is one of the few monuments donated by NYC itself--> It was designed and created in 1868, but wasn't unveiled until 1873, when the park was officially completed. In 1988. the [[Central Park Conservancy]] cleaned, repatinated, and sealed the fountain with a protective coating, and it is washed and waxed annually in order to preserve it.

Most have been donated by individuals or organizations, few by the city itself. While many early statues are of authors and poets along \"Literary Walk\" and American figures like [[Daniel Webster]] and \"the Pilgrim\", other early works were simply picturesque, like ''The Hunter'' and ''The Falconer''; other notable statues include the [[statue of Balto]], an Egyptian [[obelisk]] called the \"[[Cleopatra's Needle (New York City)|Cleopatra's Needle]]\", [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice of Wonderland]], and [[Duke Ellington Memorial]].\n\n==Selected sculptures==\n\n===Animals===\n[[File:Balto.jpg|thumb|upright|''Balto'']]\n[[File:\"Still Hunt\" 4.jpg|thumb|''Still Hunt'']]\n* '''''[[Statue of Balto|Balto]]''''' was dedicated to the sled dogs that led several dogsled teams through a snow-storm in the winter of 1925 in order to deliver [[medicine]] that would stop a [[diphtheria]] epidemic in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Alaska]]. The sculpture is slightly larger than the real-life dog, and is placed on a rock outcropping on the main path leading north from the Tisch Children's Zoo. The sculpture was created by [[Frederick George Richard Roth]], and placed in the park in 1925. Like so many other [[monument]]s in the park, it's made of [[bronze]], and it was donated to the park by the Balto Monument Committee to the City of [[New York City|New York]].  Under the [[sculpture]], a small plaque can be found, containing the following inscription:\n:<center>''Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxins six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925.

It is made of bronze, and was cast in Paris, France in 1850 and was placed in the park in 1863. The sculpture was donated by [[Gordon Webster Burnham]], who also donated the statue of [[Daniel Webster]], as well as statues in other cities.  The monument depicts a goat, wedged accidentally between two rocks, which is about to be devoured by two [[eagle]]s. Their talons are sunk into the back of the goat as they flap their wings in victory.\n* '''''Still Hunt''''' is a bronze sculpture of a crouching [[cougar]] waiting to pounce by sculptor [[Edward Kemeys]] (1843\u20131907), installed in the park in 1883. Situated on a rock outcrop on the west side of the East Drive at the edge of the Ramble, the crouching animal has scared many joggers as they climb \"Cat Hill\" (formally Cedar Hill) and approach this life-size and realistic representation. Unlike the traditional sculptures of other animals in the park that sit on a stone base or pedestal, Kemeys situated his sculpture directly on the rock ledge. Kemeys was so interested in depicting his animals in a realistic mode that he traveled to the western states to see them in their native habitat.\n\n===Artists===\n* Bust of the architect '''''[[Richard Morris Hunt]]''''' at the Hunt Memorial, along with two other figures sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]]. Flanking the Hunt bust are statuettes, one holding a sculptor's mallet and a palette, representing the allied arts, while the other holds a model for the Administration Building at the [[Chicago]] [[World's Columbian Exposition]], designed by Hunt. On the perimeter wall of Central Park, Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, opposite the [[Frick Collection]], which was built on the site of the [[New York Public Library|Lenox Library]], also designed by architect Hunt. The granite and marble Hunt memorial was designed by American architect [[Bruce Price]].\n* Tucked into a dead end triangle of Central Park at East 96th/97th Street, the statue of [[Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/albert-bertel-thorvaldsen.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ | title=Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen}}</ref> was first dedicated in 1894 and is the only statue of an artist displayed in any New York City park.\n\n===Fictional characters===\n[[File:Alice in Wonderland Central Park NYC.JPG|right|thumb]]\n* One large sculpture depicts '''''[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]''''', from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 classic ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The statue is located on [[East 74th Street]] on the north side of Central Park's Conservatory Water. Alice is pictured sitting on a [[giant]] [[mushroom]] reaching toward a [[pocket watch]] held by the [[White Rabbit]]. Peering over her shoulder is the [[Cheshire Cat]], flanked on one side by the [[Dormouse]], and on the other by [[Mad Hatter]], who in contrast to the calm Alice looks ready to laugh out loud at any moment.  Publisher and philanthropist [[George T. Delacorte Jr.]] ordered the sculpture from [[Jos\u00e9 de Creeft]], in honor of Delacorte's late wife, Margarita, and to the enjoyment of the children of [[New York City|New York]]. Unveiled in 1959, de Creeft's sculpture tries to follow [[John Tenniel]]'s whimsical [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] illustrations from the first edition of the book. According to various sources, Alice is said to look like de Creeft's daughter Donna. The Alice in Wonderland project's architects and designers were Hideo Sasaki and Fernando Texidor, who inserted some plaques with inscriptions from the book in the terrace around the sculpture. Margarita's favorite poem, \"The Jabberwocky\" is also included; chiseled in a granite circle surrounding the sculpture:\n''<center>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe</center>''\n:The design of the sculpture attracts many children who want to climb its many levels, resulting in the bronze's glowing patina, polished by thousands of tiny hands over the years since the sculpture was unveiled.  It was cast at Modern Art Foundry Astoria Queens NY. The sculpture was in the music video of Slick Ricks Children's Story.\n* The '''[[Burnett Memorial Fountain]]''', dedicated to the author [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], was placed in the [[Conservatory Garden]] when it reopened in 1936, a donation by the ad hoc Children's Garden Building Committee. It was designed and created by [[Bessie Potter Vonnoh]] between 1926 and 1936. When Frances Hodgson Burnett died in 1924, some of her friends wanted to honor her memory by creating a storytelling area in Central Park. They chose the Conservatory Garden's south garden, at 104th Street and Fifth Avenue, as the site for the memorial. It is believed that the two figures, a reclining boy playing the flute and the young girl holding the bowl, represent Mary and Dickon, the main characters from ''[[The Secret Garden]]''.\n\n===Historical figures===\n[[File:SimonBolivarCentralParkNYC.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (Central Park)|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'']]\n[[File:Christopher columbus321.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Statue of Christopher Columbus (Central Park)|Statue of Christopher Columbus]]]]\n* The [[equestrian sculpture]] of '''''[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]''''' was originally sited on the rock outcropping between 82nd and 83rd Streets overlooking [[Central Park West]], where the Bol\u00edvar Hotel, once facing it, commemorates its location. After Sixth Avenue was renamed [[Avenue of the Americas]] in 1945, the sculpture was relocated in the 1950s to be adjacent to those of fellow Latin American revolutionary leaders [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] at the head of the Avenue of the Americas.\n* In 1892, the '''[[Statue of Christopher Columbus (Central Park)|statue of Christopher Columbus]]''' was donated to Central Park by the [[New York Genealogical and Biographical Society]] in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of his arrival in the Americas. The statue replicates one made by [[Jeronimo Su\u00f1ol]] in 1892,<ref>The park's sculpture is signed in the bronze \"J. SU\u00d1OL\"; it bears the foundry mark of Federico Masriera Barcelona 1892.</ref> located at the Plaza de Colon, in [[Madrid]]. The New York version was placed in the park in 1894 at the foot of the Mall, and is today one of two monuments of Columbus found in the park's environs, the other being the statue surmounting the column at [[Columbus Circle]].  The sculpture depicts the explorer standing with outstretched arms, looking towards the heavens in gratitude for his successful voyage.\n* The standing [[Statue of Alexander Hamilton (Central Park)|sculpture]] of [[Alexander Hamilton]] standing in a grove of apple trees and crabapples west of the East Drive behind the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was \"presented by [[John Church Hamilton|John C.

As a result of the outbreak of the World War II, the monument stayed in New York; in July 1945 it was presented to the City of New York by the King Jagiello Monument Committee and permanently placed in Central Park with the cooperation of the last pre-Communist consul of Poland in New York, Kazimierz Krasicki.<ref>{{cite journal|title=In the Footsteps of Stanislaw K.

The regiment was, as its name implies, stationed in New York, and consisted of males mainly from this region. In 1917, the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]'s 7th New York Infantry Registry Division. While in France, they saw heavy action, and at the end of the war in November 1918, of the 3,700 men originally in the regiment, 580 men were killed and 1,487 wounded, with four of the regiment's soldiers being awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].  The memorial depicts seven men; the one to the far right carrying two [[Mills bomb]]s, while supporting the wounded soldier next to him. To his right another infantryman (depicting Robert Russell Bennett, a 107 combat veteran who was asked by the artist to model for the statue along with 6 other actual 107 veterans of the Somme) rushes towards the enemy positions, while the helmet less squad leader and another soldier are approaching the enemy with bayonets fixed. To the far left, one soldier is holding a mortally wounded soldier, keeping him on his feet. The [[bronze]] memorial was donated by 7th\u2013107th Memorial Committee, and was designed and sculpted by [[Karl Illava]], who served in the 107th IR as a sergeant in World War I. The monument was first conceived about 1920, was made in 1926\u20131927 and was placed in the park and unveiled in 1927, near the perimeter wall at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 67th Street.\n\n===Writers and poets===\n[[File:NYC Hans C Andersen.jpg|thumb|right|''Hans Christian Andersen'']]\n* '''''[[Hans Christian Andersen]]''''', the famous Danish fairy-tale writer, his most notable work being \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\".

The monument was funded by the use of public subscription, and had a long list of prominent guests and speakers at the dedication and unveiling of the monument, among them the president's cabinet, [[General of the Army]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T.Sherman]], the poets [[Bayard Taylor]], [[George Henry Boker]] and [[William Cullen Bryant]], as well as other notable citizens.  The monument is made in bronze by [[James Wilson Alexander MacDonald]], and is placed near the Literary Walk and The Mall. The monument has been thoroughly refurbished by The Central Park Conservancy, first by hot waxing it in 1983, and then again in 1992, as well as in 1999, when it was dewaxed, pressure-washed and repatinated, and then protected by a coating of a corrosion-inhibiting lacquer.\n* '''''[[Statue of William Shakespeare (New York City)|William Shakespeare]]''''', a bronze statue on a stone pedestal, located to the south of the mall, southeast of Sheep's Meadow; this sculpture was erected with funds raised from a benefit performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' on November 25, 1864, at [[The Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|The Winter Garden Theatre]], in a performance by [[Edwin Booth]], [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]] and their younger brother, [[John Wilkes Booth]]. [[John Quincy Adams Ward]] sculpted the work. Ward was arguably the dean of American sculpture at the time, and he is the source of more public sculpture in NYC than any other artist. This is the artist's second of four works in Central Park.\n\n===Other sculptures===\n* ''The Angel of the Waters'' / '''[[Bethesda Fountain]]''' (unveiled in 1873) was not in the original \"Greensward Plan\", developed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]; the architectural middle of the park was called \"The Water Terrace\", for its placement beside The Lake, but the area became known as Bethesda Terrace after the fountain was unveiled in 1873. At the unveiling ceremony, the artist's brochure quoted a Biblical verse from the Gospel of St. John: ''Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called\u2026 Bethesda\u2026whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.''  The fountain was designed and created by [[Emma Stebbins]], who became the first woman to receive a sculptural commission in New York City when she was commissioned to create this fountain. <!-- CHECK It is one of the few monuments donated by NYC itself--> It was designed and created in 1868, but wasn't unveiled until 1873, when the park was officially completed. In 1988. the [[Central Park Conservancy]] cleaned, repatinated, and sealed the fountain with a protective coating, and it is washed and waxed annually in order to preserve it. The fountain can be found in the middle of the park, on the north side of 72nd Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n* '''''[[Indian Hunter (Ward)|Indian Hunter]]''''' (1866) by [[John Quincy Adams Ward]]<ref>Signed in the bronze \"J.Q.A.

Produced by [[Lucasfilm]], it is the second film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series (albeit the fifth chronologically) and the sequel to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977).{{EpIV}} Set three years after the events of the first film, the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], under the leadership of [[Darth Vader]] and the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], pursues [[Luke Skywalker]] and the rest of the [[Rebel Alliance]]. While Vader relentlessly pursues Luke's friends\u2014[[Han Solo]], [[Princess Leia]], [[Chewbacca]], and {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}}\u2014Luke studies [[the Force]] under [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Mark Hamill]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[David Prowse]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], [[Peter Mayhew]], and [[Frank Oz]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''Star Wars'', Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel; after her death in 1978, he outlined the ''Star Wars'' saga as a whole and wrote next draft himself, before hiring Kasdan. Lucas chose not to direct due to his obligations at [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and handling the financing, and passed the duty to Kershner, his former professor. Filmed from March to September 1979, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' faced a difficult production that included actor injuries, a set fire, and fines from the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers]] and [[Directors Guild of America|Directors]] Guilds of America. The initial budget was $18 million, but ballooned to $33 million by the time production concluded, making it one of the most expensive films ever made at the time.\n\n''The Empire Strikes Back'' premiered at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on May 17, 1980, and was released in the United States on May 21, 1980. The film became the [[1980 in film#Worldwide gross revenue|highest-grossing film of 1980]]. Though it was met with divided reviews, it is now regarded as the best film in the ''Star Wars'' saga and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. The film has grossed over $547&nbsp;million worldwide from its original run and several rereleases. Adjusted for inflation, it is the second-highest-grossing sequel of all time and the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States|thirteenth highest-grossing film of all time in North America]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=Films adjusted for inflation |website=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=June 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504000735/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm|archive-date=May 4, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States' [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n''The Empire Strikes Back'' had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture, being regarded as a rare example of a sequel that transcends the original. The climax, in which Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father, is often cited as one of the greatest [[plot twist]]s in cinematic history. ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was followed by ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' in 1983. The two films, alongside the original ''Star Wars'', comprise the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nThree years after the destruction of the [[Death Star]],{{efn|As depicted in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.}} the [[Rebel Alliance]], led by [[Princess Leia]], has set up a new base on the ice planet [[Hoth]]. The [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] fleet, led by a merciless [[Darth Vader]], hunts for the new Rebel base by dispatching [[Droid (Star Wars)|probe droids]] across the galaxy. [[Luke Skywalker]] is captured by a [[wampa]] while investigating one such probe, but manages to escape from its lair using [[the Force]] and his [[lightsaber]]. Before Luke succumbs to [[hypothermia]], the [[Force spirit]] of his deceased mentor, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], instructs him to go to the swamp planet [[Dagobah]] to train under [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. [[Han Solo]] discovers Luke and manages to keep him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead [[Tauntaun]] mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning.\n\nThe probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebels' location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack using [[AT-AT walker]]s to capture the base, which forces the Rebels to evacuate. Han and Leia escape with {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}} and [[Chewbacca]] on the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', but the ship's [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperdrive]] malfunctions. They hide in an [[Asteroid belt|asteroid field]], where Han and Leia grow closer amidst the tensions. Several bounty hunters, summoned by Vader, assist in searching for the ''Falcon''. Meanwhile, Luke travels with {{nowrap|[[R2-D2]]}} in his [[X-wing fighter]] to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; who reluctantly accepts Luke as his apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit. Luke learns more about the Force from Yoda, who lifts his X-wing out of the swamp using the Force.\n\nAfter evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet [[Bespin]], which is governed by Han's old friend [[Lando Calrissian]]. Bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] tracks the ''Falcon'' and, with Vader, forces Lando to hand the group over to the Empire. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure Luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the [[dark side of the Force]]. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against the wishes of Yoda and Obi-Wan, abandons his training to rescue them.\n\nVader intends to hold Luke in [[suspended animation]] by imprisoning him in carbonite, selecting Han to be frozen as an experiment. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Lando, still loyal to Han, frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo. Under attack from [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]], they fight their way back to the ''Falcon'' and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central air shaft. Vader severs Luke's right hand, disarming him, and tempts him to embrace his anger and join the dark side. Luke accuses Vader of murdering his father, but Vader reveals that ''he'' is Luke's father. Appalled and Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, where he hangs from an antenna. He reaches out [[Telepathy|telepathically]] to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewie to turn back. After Luke is brought aboard, they are chased by [[TIE fighter]]s towards Vader on his [[Star Destroyer]] and find that the ''Falcon''{{'}}s hyperdrive has been tampered with, but {{nowrap|R2-D2}} reactivates it, allowing them to escape.\n\nLuke rejoins the Rebel fleet and his severed hand is replaced with a [[Technology in Star Wars#Prosthetics|robotic prosthesis]]. Lando and Chewbacca begin their quest to save Han, as the other rebels watch the ''Falcon'' depart.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]]: A pilot in the Rebel Alliance and Jedi in training\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]]: A smuggler and captain of the [[Millennium Falcon]]\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]]: A leader in the Rebel Alliance\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]]: The administrator of Cloud City \n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]]: A humanoid protocol droid in the Alliance\n* [[David Prowse]] as [[Darth Vader]]: A powerful Sith lord in service to the Emperor of the Galactic Empire \n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]]: Han's loyal [[Wookiee]] friend and copilot\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]]: An astromech droid in the Rebellion and {{nowrap|C-3PO's}} counterpart\n* [[Frank Oz]] as [[Yoda]]: A diminutive, centuries-old Jedi Master living in self-imposed exile\n\nWhile Prowse physically portrays Darth Vader, [[James Earl Jones]] provides the character's voice.

The success of ''Star Wars'' and its licensing opportunities meant that a sequel was inevitable.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3}} Sequels were generally not well regarded at the time and Lucas was not ready to commit, as the production of the original film \"had been a four-year horrific seat-of-the-pants experience\"\u2014one that Lucas never wanted to experience again.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3}} However, the film did not represent what he had envisioned, and he knew that a sequel would allow him to finish the story. Additionally, Lucas had already established the ''Star Wars'' universe, so he figured a sequel would provide an opportunity to introduce more ideas and adventures. \"I always felt if I could go back to those environments using the same characters, I could make a helluva better movie,\" he said.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3\u20134}} Lucas hired [[Alan Dean Foster]], the [[ghostwriter]] of the [[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|''Star Wars'' novelization]], to write the sequel novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' so it could be adapted as a low-budget film if ''Star Wars'' was a box-office failure,<ref>{{cite web |last=Wenz |first=John |title=The First Star Wars sequel: Inside the writing of Splinter of the Mind's Eye |url=https://syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye |work=Syfy |publisher=SyFy Channel |date=January 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930231749/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> but by August 1977 ''Star Wars'' was still the number-one film in cinemas, motivating Lucas to continue the saga.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=7}}\n\nBefore production on the sequel, then titled ''Star Wars: Chapter II'', could begin, Lucas had to sort out various problems that had arisen. His [[special effects]] company, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), no longer had any employees, as many of them had left to form Apogee and work on ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. ''Galactica'' became a \"thorn in [Lucas's] side,\"{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=4}} as the project bore a strong resemblance to ''Star Wars'' to the point that production illustrator [[Ralph McQuarrie]] called it a \"rip-off.\"{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6}} Lucas hired some of the ''Galactica'' crew back, but had to replace others\u2014most notably [[John Dykstra]], whom he had a hard time working with on ''Star Wars''. Lucas had almost fired Dykstra during the production of the first film but did not because Dykstra had close friends on the crew, so Lucas also chose not to hire them back as well.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6}} One of Lucas's new hirees was [[Brian Johnson (special effects artist)|Brian Johnson]], who had worked on ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) and turned down an opportunity to work on the first film.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6\u20137}} Lucas also had to build his studio, [[Lucasfilm]], which similarly had few employees.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=5}}\n\nDistributor [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] had tried to sell ''Star Wars'' to other studios because it feared it would lose money on the overbudget production, but following the film's success, by September 1977 it was eager to make a deal with Lucas on the sequel. Unlike the prolonged negotiations of ''Star Wars'', which took years, Lucas was able to strike a deal with Fox swiftly, partially because he planned to finance the sequel himself{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=10}} with $33 million from loans and the previous film's earning. Lucas hoped to become independent from the Hollywood film industry and went against the principles of many Hollywood producers, who believe in never investing one's own money.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> Similar to how he set up The Star Wars Corporation for the first film, Lucas created a subsidiary, The Chapter II Company, to help minimize the financial risks. By the end of September, the contract had been signed: the \"negative cost\" of the sequel was set at $8 million, Lucas would receive [[final cut privilege]], and Lucasfilm was guaranteed 77.5% of the profits if the film grossed over $100 million.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=10}} Under the contract, by July 1978 Lucasfilm subsidiary Black Falcon Ltd. would gain control of licensing, marketing, and merchandise, and the profit split would be 80% for Lucasfilm and 20% for Fox. The contract made it clear that Fox would have no creative control over the film, set a January 1979 start date for filming, and a May 1, 1980 release date.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=11}}\n\nNow fully in control of the ''Star Wars'' enterprise, Lucas chose not to direct the sequel because of his other production roles, including overseeing ILM and handling the financing.

Lucas envisioned 60 scenes, a script around 100 pages, and a roughly two-hour runtime. The two laid out the film's basic plot, but also discussed expanding the character of Han\u2014with Lucas suggesting that he met Chewbacca because he was raised by Wookiees\u2014and Luke's lost twin sister.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=19\u201321}}\n\nBrackett and Lucas came up with various ideas for subplots, including a [[love triangle]] (Lucas compared Han to [[Rhett Butler]], Leia to [[Scarlett O'Hara]], and Luke to [[Ashley Wilkes]]), the reintroduction of Obi-Wan as a ghost, an arctic world inspired by ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' (1939\u20131940) and ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951), further development of the Force, and the new Jedi master being an elderly, froglike alien. They also conceived new aliens, planets, and the notion that the Emperor, not Darth Vader, is the true villain.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=22\u201323}}\n\nBrackett's treatment, delivered on February 21, 1978, is similar to the final film, but Anakin Skywalker appears as a ghost to instruct Luke, and Vader is a separate character.<ref name=\"Sunstein 2016\">{{cite book |last=Sunstein |first=Cass |title=The world according to Star Wars |publisher=Dey Street Books |location=New York |year=2016 |isbn=9780062484246 |oclc=939911359 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2020}} Lucas was disappointed with Brackett's draft, but before he could discuss it with her, learned that she was in the hospital; she died of cancer in mid-March.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=144}} With no writer available, Lucas had to write the next draft himself. It was this draft in which Lucas first made use of the \"Episode\" numbering for the films; ''The Empire Strikes Back'' became ''Episode II''.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=135}} His disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions in which to take the story.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=161}} He made use of a new plot twist: Darth Vader claims to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggles writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more drafts,<ref name=\"Bouzereau 1997 123\">{{harvnb|Bouzereau|1997|p=123}}</ref> all in April 1978.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008}}\n\nThis plot twist of Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series, including the audience's interpretation of the original film.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=120\u201321}} Lucas outlined a new backstory: Anakin Skywalker had been Ben Kenobi's brilliant student, and had a child named Luke, but was swayed to the dark side by the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] (who was really a [[Sith|Sith Lord]]). Anakin battled Kenobi on the site of a volcano and was horribly wounded, but was resurrected as Darth Vader. Meanwhile, Kenobi hid Luke on [[Tatooine]] while the Republic became the Empire and Vader systematically hunted down the Jedi.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=164\u201365}}\n\nWith this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that ''The Empire Strikes Back'' would be the second film of two trilogies, designating it ''Episode V'' by the fifth draft.<ref name=\"Bouzereau 1997 123\" />{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=528}} [[Lawrence Kasdan]] had just completed writing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'',<ref name=\"hearn\">{{Cite book |author=Marcus Hearn |title=The Cinema of George Lucas |publisher=Harry N.

Like the filming of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', where the production in Tunisia coincided with the area's first major rainstorm in fifty years, the weather was against the film crew. While filming in Norway, they encountered the worst winter storm in fifty years. Temperatures dropped to {{convert|\u221220|F|C}}, and {{convert|18|ft|m|disp=flip}} of snow fell.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> On one occasion, the crew were unable to exit their hotel. They achieved a shot involving Luke's exit of the Wampa cave by opening the hotel's doors and filming Mark Hamill running out into the snow while the crew remained warm inside.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> Mark Hamill's face was scarred in a motor accident that occurred between filming of ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Despite reports to the contrary, the scene in which Luke is knocked unconscious by the Wampa was not added specifically to explain this change to Hamill's face. Lucas admitted that the scene \"helped\" the situation, though he felt that Luke's time fighting in the rebellion was sufficient explanation.<ref name=\"DVDcom\">''The Empire Strikes Back'' DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren and Carrie Fisher, [2004]</ref>\n\nThe production moved to [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] near London on March 13,<ref name=\"hearn\"/> where over 60 sets were built, more than double the number used in the previous film.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> A fire in January on Stage 3 (during filming of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') forced the budget to be increased from {{Nowrap|$18.5 million}} to {{Nowrap|$22 million}}, and by July the budget increased {{Nowrap|$3 million}} more.\n\nFilming finished September 24, 1979.<ref name=\"hearn\"/><ref>{{cite book |first=John Phillip |last=Peecher |title=The Making of Return of the Jedi |year=1983 |page=226}}</ref>\n\nThe script contained a scene in which Princess Leia professed her love to Han Solo, with Han replying \"I love you too.\" Harrison Ford felt the characterization was not being used effectively, and Kershner agreed.

While this practice has become more common over the years, this was relatively unusual at the time. The [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers]] and [[Directors Guild of America|Directors]] guilds of America had no problem allowing it on ''Star Wars'', back in 1977, because the writer-director credit (George Lucas) matched the company name. However, when Lucas did the same thing for the sequel, it became an issue because they viewed the company credit (Lucasfilm) as displaying Lucas' name at the start of the film, while the director and writers had theirs on the end.

For the battle scenes on the ice planet [[Hoth]], the initial intent was to use [[chroma key|bluescreen]] to composite the [[AT-AT|Imperial walkers]] into still-shots from the original set. Instead, an artist ([[Michael Pangrazio]]) was hired to paint landscapes, resulting in the Imperial walkers being shot using [[stop motion]] animation in front of the landscape paintings.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> The original designs for the AT-ATs were, according to [[Phil Tippett]], \"big armored vehicles with wheels\".

Hence in 2004, the Sony Classical company began manufacturing copies of the film-score CDs that RCA Victor had been making since 1997, including the one for ''The Empire Strikes Back''.

Lucas took this opportunity to make several minor changes to the film. These included explicitly showing the [[Wampa]] creature on Hoth in full form, creating a more complex flight path for the ''Falcon'' as it approaches Cloud City, digitally replacing some of the interior walls of Cloud City with vistas of Bespin, and replacing certain lines of dialogue. A short sequence was also added depicting Vader's return to his [[Super Star Destroyer]] after dueling with Luke, created from alternate angles of a scene from ''Return of the Jedi''.

Also included are featurettes, teasers, trailers, TV spots, still galleries, video game demos, and a preview of ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]''. For the DVD release, Lucas and his team made changes that they stated would ensure continuity between ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and the then-recently released [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] films. The most noticeable of these changes was replacing the stand-in used in the holographic image of the Emperor (with Clive Revill providing the voice) with actor [[Ian McDiarmid]] providing some slightly altered dialogue. With this release, Lucas also supervised the creation of a high-definition digital print of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and the original trilogy's other films.

Produced by [[Lucasfilm]], it is the second film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series (albeit the fifth chronologically) and the sequel to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977).{{EpIV}} Set three years after the events of the first film, the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], under the leadership of [[Darth Vader]] and the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], pursues [[Luke Skywalker]] and the rest of the [[Rebel Alliance]]. While Vader relentlessly pursues Luke's friends\u2014[[Han Solo]], [[Princess Leia]], [[Chewbacca]], and {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}}\u2014Luke studies [[the Force]] under [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Mark Hamill]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[David Prowse]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], [[Peter Mayhew]], and [[Frank Oz]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''Star Wars'', Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel; after her death in 1978, he outlined the ''Star Wars'' saga as a whole and wrote next draft himself, before hiring Kasdan. Lucas chose not to direct due to his obligations at [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and handling the financing, and passed the duty to Kershner, his former professor. Filmed from March to September 1979, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' faced a difficult production that included actor injuries, a set fire, and fines from the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers]] and [[Directors Guild of America|Directors]] Guilds of America. The initial budget was $18 million, but ballooned to $33 million by the time production concluded, making it one of the most expensive films ever made at the time.\n\n''The Empire Strikes Back'' premiered at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on May 17, 1980, and was released in the United States on May 21, 1980. The film became the [[1980 in film#Worldwide gross revenue|highest-grossing film of 1980]]. Though it was met with divided reviews, it is now regarded as the best film in the ''Star Wars'' saga and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. The film has grossed over $547&nbsp;million worldwide from its original run and several rereleases. Adjusted for inflation, it is the second-highest-grossing sequel of all time and the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States|thirteenth highest-grossing film of all time in North America]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=Films adjusted for inflation |website=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=June 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504000735/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm|archive-date=May 4, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States' [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n''The Empire Strikes Back'' had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture, being regarded as a rare example of a sequel that transcends the original. The climax, in which Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father, is often cited as one of the greatest [[plot twist]]s in cinematic history. ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was followed by ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' in 1983. The two films, alongside the original ''Star Wars'', comprise the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nThree years after the destruction of the [[Death Star]],{{efn|As depicted in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.}} the [[Rebel Alliance]], led by [[Princess Leia]], has set up a new base on the ice planet [[Hoth]]. The [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] fleet, led by a merciless [[Darth Vader]], hunts for the new Rebel base by dispatching [[Droid (Star Wars)|probe droids]] across the galaxy. [[Luke Skywalker]] is captured by a [[wampa]] while investigating one such probe, but manages to escape from its lair using [[the Force]] and his [[lightsaber]]. Before Luke succumbs to [[hypothermia]], the [[Force spirit]] of his deceased mentor, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], instructs him to go to the swamp planet [[Dagobah]] to train under [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. [[Han Solo]] discovers Luke and manages to keep him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead [[Tauntaun]] mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning.\n\nThe probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebels' location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack using [[AT-AT walker]]s to capture the base, which forces the Rebels to evacuate. Han and Leia escape with {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}} and [[Chewbacca]] on the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', but the ship's [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperdrive]] malfunctions. They hide in an [[Asteroid belt|asteroid field]], where Han and Leia grow closer amidst the tensions. Several bounty hunters, summoned by Vader, assist in searching for the ''Falcon''. Meanwhile, Luke travels with {{nowrap|[[R2-D2]]}} in his [[X-wing fighter]] to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; who reluctantly accepts Luke as his apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit. Luke learns more about the Force from Yoda, who lifts his X-wing out of the swamp using the Force.\n\nAfter evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet [[Bespin]], which is governed by Han's old friend [[Lando Calrissian]]. Bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] tracks the ''Falcon'' and, with Vader, forces Lando to hand the group over to the Empire. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure Luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the [[dark side of the Force]]. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against the wishes of Yoda and Obi-Wan, abandons his training to rescue them.\n\nVader intends to hold Luke in [[suspended animation]] by imprisoning him in carbonite, selecting Han to be frozen as an experiment. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Lando, still loyal to Han, frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo. Under attack from [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]], they fight their way back to the ''Falcon'' and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central air shaft. Vader severs Luke's right hand, disarming him, and tempts him to embrace his anger and join the dark side. Luke accuses Vader of murdering his father, but Vader reveals that ''he'' is Luke's father. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, where he hangs from an antenna. He reaches out [[Telepathy|telepathically]] to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewie to turn back. After Luke is brought aboard, they are chased by [[TIE fighter]]s towards Vader on his [[Star Destroyer]] and find that the ''Falcon''{{'}}s hyperdrive has been tampered with, but {{nowrap|R2-D2}} reactivates it, allowing them to escape.\n\nLuke rejoins the Rebel fleet and his severed hand is replaced with a [[Technology in Star Wars#Prosthetics|robotic prosthesis]]. Lando and Chewbacca begin their quest to save Han, as the other rebels watch the ''Falcon'' depart.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]]: A pilot in the Rebel Alliance and Jedi in training\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]]: A smuggler and captain of the [[Millennium Falcon]]\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]]: A leader in the Rebel Alliance\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]]: The administrator of Cloud City \n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]]: A humanoid protocol droid in the Alliance\n* [[David Prowse]] as [[Darth Vader]]: A powerful Sith lord in service to the Emperor of the Galactic Empire \n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]]: Han's loyal [[Wookiee]] friend and copilot\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]]: An astromech droid in the Rebellion and {{nowrap|C-3PO's}} counterpart\n* [[Frank Oz]] as [[Yoda]]: A diminutive, centuries-old Jedi Master living in self-imposed exile\n\nWhile Prowse physically portrays Darth Vader, [[James Earl Jones]] provides the character's voice.

The success of ''Star Wars'' and its licensing opportunities meant that a sequel was inevitable.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3}} Sequels were generally not well regarded at the time and Lucas was not ready to commit, as the production of the original film \"had been a four-year horrific seat-of-the-pants experience\"\u2014one that Lucas never wanted to experience again.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3}} However, the film did not represent what he had envisioned, and he knew that a sequel would allow him to finish the story. Additionally, Lucas had already established the ''Star Wars'' universe, so he figured a sequel would provide an opportunity to introduce more ideas and adventures. \"I always felt if I could go back to those environments using the same characters, I could make a helluva better movie,\" he said.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3\u20134}} Lucas hired [[Alan Dean Foster]], the [[ghostwriter]] of the [[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|''Star Wars'' novelization]], to write the sequel novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' so it could be adapted as a low-budget film if ''Star Wars'' was a box-office failure,<ref>{{cite web |last=Wenz |first=John |title=The First Star Wars sequel: Inside the writing of Splinter of the Mind's Eye |url=https://syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye |work=Syfy |publisher=SyFy Channel |date=January 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930231749/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> but by August 1977 ''Star Wars'' was still the number-one film in cinemas, motivating Lucas to continue the saga.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=7}}\n\nBefore production on the sequel, then titled ''Star Wars: Chapter II'', could begin, Lucas had to sort out various problems that had arisen. His [[special effects]] company, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), no longer had any employees, as many of them had left to form Apogee and work on ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. ''Galactica'' became a \"thorn in [Lucas's] side,\"{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=4}} as the project bore a strong resemblance to ''Star Wars'' to the point that production illustrator [[Ralph McQuarrie]] called it a \"rip-off.\"{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6}} Lucas hired some of the ''Galactica'' crew back, but had to replace others\u2014most notably [[John Dykstra]], whom he had a hard time working with on ''Star Wars''. Lucas had almost fired Dykstra during the production of the first film but did not because Dykstra had close friends on the crew, so Lucas also chose not to hire them back as well.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6}} One of Lucas's new hirees was [[Brian Johnson (special effects artist)|Brian Johnson]], who had worked on ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) and turned down an opportunity to work on the first film.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6\u20137}} Lucas also had to build his studio, [[Lucasfilm]], which similarly had few employees.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=5}}\n\nDistributor [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] had tried to sell ''Star Wars'' to other studios because it feared it would lose money on the overbudget production, but following the film's success, by September 1977 it was eager to make a deal with Lucas on the sequel. Unlike the prolonged negotiations of ''Star Wars'', which took years, Lucas was able to strike a deal with Fox swiftly, partially because he planned to finance the sequel himself{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=10}} with $33 million from loans and the previous film's earning. Lucas hoped to become independent from the Hollywood film industry and went against the principles of many Hollywood producers, who believe in never investing one's own money.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> Similar to how he set up The Star Wars Corporation for the first film, Lucas created a subsidiary, The Chapter II Company, to help minimize the financial risks. By the end of September, the contract had been signed: the \"negative cost\" of the sequel was set at $8 million, Lucas would receive [[final cut privilege]], and Lucasfilm was guaranteed 77.5% of the profits if the film grossed over $100 million.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=10}} Under the contract, by July 1978 Lucasfilm subsidiary Black Falcon Ltd. would gain control of licensing, marketing, and merchandise, and the profit split would be 80% for Lucasfilm and 20% for Fox. The contract made it clear that Fox would have no creative control over the film, set a January 1979 start date for filming, and a May 1, 1980 release date.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=11}}\n\nNow fully in control of the ''Star Wars'' enterprise, Lucas chose not to direct the sequel because of his other production roles, including overseeing ILM and handling the financing.

Lucas envisioned 60 scenes, a script around 100 pages, and a roughly two-hour runtime. The two laid out the film's basic plot, but also discussed expanding the character of Han\u2014with Lucas suggesting that he met Chewbacca because he was raised by Wookiees\u2014and Luke's lost twin sister.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=19\u201321}}\n\nBrackett and Lucas came up with various ideas for subplots, including a [[love triangle]] (Lucas compared Han to [[Rhett Butler]], Leia to [[Scarlett O'Hara]], and Luke to [[Ashley Wilkes]]), the reintroduction of Obi-Wan as a ghost, an arctic world inspired by ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' (1939\u20131940) and ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951), further development of the Force, and the new Jedi master being an elderly, froglike alien. They also conceived new aliens, planets, and the notion that the Emperor, not Darth Vader, is the true villain.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=22\u201323}}\n\nBrackett's treatment, delivered on February 21, 1978, is similar to the final film, but Anakin Skywalker appears as a ghost to instruct Luke, and Vader is a separate character.<ref name=\"Sunstein 2016\">{{cite book |last=Sunstein |first=Cass |title=The world according to Star Wars |publisher=Dey Street Books |location=New York |year=2016 |isbn=9780062484246 |oclc=939911359 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2020}} Lucas was disappointed with Brackett's draft, but before he could discuss it with her, learned that she was in the hospital; she died of cancer in mid-March.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=144}} With no writer available, Lucas had to write the next draft himself. It was this draft in which Lucas first made use of the \"Episode\" numbering for the films; ''The Empire Strikes Back'' became ''Episode II''.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=135}} His disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions in which to take the story.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=161}} He made use of a new plot twist: Darth Vader claims to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggles writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more drafts,<ref name=\"Bouzereau 1997 123\">{{harvnb|Bouzereau|1997|p=123}}</ref> all in April 1978.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008}}\n\nThis plot twist of Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series, including the audience's interpretation of the original film.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=120\u201321}} Lucas outlined a new backstory: Anakin Skywalker had been Ben Kenobi's brilliant student, and had a child named Luke, but was swayed to the dark side by the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] (who was really a [[Sith|Sith Lord]]). Anakin battled Kenobi on the site of a volcano and was horribly wounded, but was resurrected as Darth Vader. Meanwhile, Kenobi hid Luke on [[Tatooine]] while the Republic became the Empire and Vader systematically hunted down the Jedi.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=164\u201365}}\n\nWith this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that ''The Empire Strikes Back'' would be the second film of two trilogies, designating it ''Episode V'' by the fifth draft.<ref name=\"Bouzereau 1997 123\" />{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=528}} [[Lawrence Kasdan]] had just completed writing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'',<ref name=\"hearn\">{{Cite book |author=Marcus Hearn |title=The Cinema of George Lucas |publisher=Harry N.

Like the filming of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', where the production in Tunisia coincided with the area's first major rainstorm in fifty years, the weather was against the film crew. While filming in Norway, they encountered the worst winter storm in fifty years. Temperatures dropped to {{convert|\u221220|F|C}}, and {{convert|18|ft|m|disp=flip}} of snow fell.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> On one occasion, the crew were unable to exit their hotel. They achieved a shot involving Luke's exit of the Wampa cave by opening the hotel's doors and filming Mark Hamill running out into the snow while the crew remained warm inside.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> Mark Hamill's face was scarred in a motor accident that occurred between filming of ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Despite reports to the contrary, the scene in which Luke is knocked unconscious by the Wampa was not added specifically to explain this change to Hamill's face. Lucas admitted that the scene \"helped\" the situation, though he felt that Luke's time fighting in the rebellion was sufficient explanation.<ref name=\"DVDcom\">''The Empire Strikes Back'' DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren and Carrie Fisher, [2004]</ref>\n\nThe production moved to [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] near London on March 13,<ref name=\"hearn\"/> where over 60 sets were built, more than double the number used in the previous film.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> A fire in January on Stage 3 (during filming of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') forced the budget to be increased from {{Nowrap|$18.5 million}} to {{Nowrap|$22 million}}, and by July the budget increased {{Nowrap|$3 million}} more.\n\nFilming finished September 24, 1979.<ref name=\"hearn\"/><ref>{{cite book |first=John Phillip |last=Peecher |title=The Making of Return of the Jedi |year=1983 |page=226}}</ref>\n\nThe script contained a scene in which Princess Leia professed her love to Han Solo, with Han replying \"I love you too.\" Harrison Ford felt the characterization was not being used effectively, and Kershner agreed.

While this practice has become more common over the years, this was relatively unusual at the time. The [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers]] and [[Directors Guild of America|Directors]] guilds of America had no problem allowing it on ''Star Wars'', back in 1977, because the writer-director credit (George Lucas) matched the company name. However, when Lucas did the same thing for the sequel, it became an issue because they viewed the company credit (Lucasfilm) as displaying Lucas' name at the start of the film, while the director and writers had theirs on the end. The guilds fined him over $250,000 and attempted to pull ''Empire'' out of theaters. The DGA also attacked Kershner; to protect his director, Lucas paid all the fines to the guilds. Due to the controversy, he left the Directors and Writers guilds, and the [[Motion Picture Association]].<ref name=\"EOD\"/>\n\nThe initial production budget of $18 million<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\">{{cite web |title=Box Office Mojo Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0080684/?ref_=bo_gr_ti |website=Box Offic Mojo |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> was 50 percent more than that of the original.

Instead, an artist ([[Michael Pangrazio]]) was hired to paint landscapes, resulting in the Imperial walkers being shot using [[stop motion]] animation in front of the landscape paintings.<ref name=\"EOD\"/> The original designs for the AT-ATs were, according to [[Phil Tippett]], \"big armored vehicles with wheels\".

Hence in 2004, the Sony Classical company began manufacturing copies of the film-score CDs that RCA Victor had been making since 1997, including the one for ''The Empire Strikes Back''.

Lucas took this opportunity to make several minor changes to the film. These included explicitly showing the [[Wampa]] creature on Hoth in full form, creating a more complex flight path for the ''Falcon'' as it approaches Cloud City, digitally replacing some of the interior walls of Cloud City with vistas of Bespin, and replacing certain lines of dialogue. A short sequence was also added depicting Vader's return to his [[Super Star Destroyer]] after dueling with Luke, created from alternate angles of a scene from ''Return of the Jedi''.

Also included are featurettes, teasers, trailers, TV spots, still galleries, video game demos, and a preview of ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]''. For the DVD release, Lucas and his team made changes that they stated would ensure continuity between ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and the then-recently released [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] films. The most noticeable of these changes was replacing the stand-in used in the holographic image of the Emperor (with Clive Revill providing the voice) with actor [[Ian McDiarmid]] providing some slightly altered dialogue. With this release, Lucas also supervised the creation of a high-definition digital print of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and the original trilogy's other films.
