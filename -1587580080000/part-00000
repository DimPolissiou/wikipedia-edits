It began a [[limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States on November 27, 2019, and in the United Kingdom on November 29, 2019, and started digital streaming on December 20, 2019, by [[Netflix]]. The performances of Pryce and Hopkins, as well as McCarten's screenplay, received high praise from critics, and all three men received respective nominations for their work at the [[92nd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], [[77th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]] and [[73rd British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Film Awards.]]\n\n==Plot==\nIn April 2005, Cardinal [[Pope Francis|Jorge Mario Bergoglio]], the Archbishop of [[Buenos Aires]], is called to [[Vatican City]] after the [[death of Pope John Paul II]] to elect a new pope. German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger is elected [[Pope Benedict XVI]]; Bergoglio receives the second-highest vote count. Seven years later, the [[Catholic Church]] is embroiled in the [[Vatican leaks scandal]], and Benedict's tenure has been tainted by public accusations regarding his role in the cover-up.\n\nBergoglio has submitted his resignation as Archbishop, but the Vatican has not responded. As he prepares to go to Rome and personally deliver his resignation, he is summoned to [[Vatican City]]. Bergoglio and Pope Benedict meet at the [[Palace of Castel Gandolfo]], the Pope's summer residence. The two debate the roles of God and the church. Benedict recounts what led him to the priesthood and talks about his interests. The two watch Benedict's favorite TV show, ''[[Kommissar Rex]]'', which further delays their discussion about Bergoglio's resignation.\n\nBergoglio recounts his early life and path into the church. He ended his marital engagement and joined the [[Jesuits]]. He was met by Father [[Franz Jalics]] and Father Orlando Yorio, who become his spiritual friends. Benedict rejects Bergoglio's resignation, saying the world would perceive it as a vote of no confidence in his leadership and weaken the Catholic Church. Benedict and Bergoglio put aside their differences and chat informally, gradually warming to each other.\n\nThe next day, the two are helicoptered to the Vatican, during which Benedict again avoids discussing Bergoglio's resignation. Benedict meets with Bergoglio in the [[Room of Tears]] within the [[Sistine Chapel]], where he confides his intention to resign the papacy. Shocked, Bergoglio objects and argues for church tradition and continuity. Benedict says his opinions regarding tradition are different now and believes change is essential. Benedict says Bergoglio could be his successor, but Bergoglio rejects the idea, citing the perception that he had collaborated with the [[1976 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat|Argentine military dictatorship]], and his failure to protect his friends and confront the [[Military junta|junta]] may have damaged his reputation. Following the \"[[Dirty War]]\" (taking liberty with the facts), Bergoglio was removed as head of the Argentinian Society of Jesus and was exiled to serve as an ordinary parish priest to the poor for the next ten years.\n\nOver time, Father Jalics reconciled with Bergoglio, but Bergoglio regrets never reconciling with Father Yorio. Memories of his actions and inaction during the dictatorship continually haunt him. Benedict comforts Bergoglio, reminding him that having survived a dictatorship himself, the freedom to choose to help is often stifled; he gives Bergoglio [[Sacrament of Penance|absolution]]. Then, Benedict makes his own confessions: being aware of a priest's long-term sexual misconduct and his regret on staying silent. He no longer hears God's words and affirms his wishes to abdicate. Bergoglio ultimately comforts the Pope and offers him absolution as well. The two emerge from the room, surprising tourists. Benedict goes outside to greet the masses and take [[selfie]]s with them. Bergoglio departs for Argentina.\n\nOne year later, Pope Benedict XVI delivers [[Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|his resignation]] to the world. Cardinal Bergoglio is elected Benedict's successor in the [[2013 papal conclave]] and becomes Pope Francis. The two popes watch the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]] between [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Pope Francis|Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio]], the future Pope Francis\n** [[Juan Minuj\u00edn]] as Young Jorge Mario Bergoglio\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Pope Benedict XVI]]\n* [[Luis Gnecco]] as [[Cl\u00e1udio Hummes|Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes]]\n* Sidney Cole as [[Peter Turkson|Cardinal Peter Turkson]]\n* Lisandro Fiks as Father [[Franz Jalics]]\n* Maria Ucedo as [[Esther Ballestrino]]\n* Willie Jonah as [[Francis Arinze|Cardinal Arinze]]\n* Thomas D.

J. Peter Nixon, in the publication ''U.S. Catholic,'' decried \"the film\u2019s implication that it was Benedict who allowed Father Marcial Maciel Degollado to remain leader of the [[Legionaries of Christ]] despite mounting evidence that he was a sexual predator. It was during the papacy of [[Pope John Paul II]], however, that efforts to investigate Maciel were repeatedly frustrated. It was Benedict who ultimately removed him.\" However publications including ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/ratzingers-responsibility|title=Ratzinger's Responsibility|date=March 18, 2010|website=National Catholic Reporter}}</ref> and ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' have disagreed, with ''Slate'' writing: \"For years, Joseph Ratzinger also refused to act against Maciel. As the prefect responsible for enforcing church doctrine, he chose to handle the [[catholic sexual abuse scandals|church\u2019s sexual abuse]] through secrecy rather than transparency. For almost a quarter century, Ratzinger failed to push for the detachment of Marcial Maciel from the position of privilege he enjoyed for so long. He finally did so in 2006, when, as Pope, he found the courage to remove Maciel from the priesthood and send him to Mexico to supposedly focus on a 'discreet life of penance and prayer.' If Maciel followed Benedict's spiritual marching orders, it certainly did not lead to atonement. He never admitted any wrongdoing, much less showed remorse. He died in 2008 without ever asking for forgiveness.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/01/marcial-maciel-benedict-francis-popes.html|title=The Catholic Church Still

2019. It began a [[limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States on November 27, 2019 and in the United Kingdom on November 29, 2019, and started digital streaming on December 20, 2019, by [[Netflix]]. The performances of Pryce and Hopkins, as well as McCarten's screenplay, received high praise from critics, and all three men received respective nominations for their work at the [[92nd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], [[77th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]] and [[73rd British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Film Awards.]]\n\n==Plot==\nIn April 2005, Cardinal [[Pope Francis|Jorge Mario Bergoglio]], the Archbishop of [[Buenos Aires]], is called to [[Vatican City]] after the [[death of Pope John Paul II]] to elect a new pope. German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger is elected [[Pope Benedict XVI]]; Bergoglio receives the second-highest vote count. Seven years later, the [[Catholic Church]] is embroiled in the [[Vatican leaks scandal]], and Benedict's tenure has been tainted by public accusations regarding his role in the cover-up.\n\nBergoglio has submitted his resignation as Archbishop, but the Vatican has not responded. As he prepares to go to Rome and personally deliver his resignation, he is summoned to [[Vatican City]]. Bergoglio and Pope Benedict meet at the [[Palace of Castel Gandolfo]], the Pope's summer residence. The two debate the roles of God and the church. Benedict recounts what led him to the priesthood and talks about his interests. The two watch Benedict's favorite TV show, ''[[Kommissar Rex]]'', which further delays their discussion about Bergoglio's resignation.\n\nBergoglio recounts his early life and path into the church. He ended his marital engagement and joined the [[Jesuits]]. He was met by Father [[Franz Jalics]] and Father Orlando Yorio, who become his spiritual friends. Benedict rejects Bergoglio's resignation, saying the world would perceive it as a vote of no confidence in his leadership and weaken the Catholic Church. Benedict and Bergoglio put aside their differences and chat informally, gradually warming to each other.\n\nThe next day, the two are helicoptered to the Vatican, during which Benedict again avoids discussing Bergoglio's resignation. Benedict meets with Bergoglio in the [[Room of Tears]] within the [[Sistine Chapel]], where he confides his intention to resign the papacy. Shocked, Bergoglio objects and argues for church tradition and continuity. Benedict says his opinions regarding tradition are different now and believes change is essential. Benedict says Bergoglio could be his successor, but Bergoglio rejects the idea, citing the perception that he had collaborated with the [[1976 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat|Argentine military dictatorship]] and his failure to protect his friends and confront the [[Military junta|junta]] may have damaged his reputation. Following the \"[[Dirty War]]\" Bergoglio was removed as head of the Argentinian Society of Jesus and was exiled to serve as an ordinary parish priest to the poor for the next ten years.\n\nOver time, Father Jalics reconciled with Bergoglio, but Bergoglio regrets never reconciling with Father Yorio. Memories of his actions and inaction during the dictatorship continually haunt him. Benedict comforts Bergoglio, reminding him that having survived a dictatorship himself, the freedom to choose to help is often stifled; he gives Bergoglio [[Sacrament of Penance|absolution]]. Then, Benedict makes his own confessions: being aware of a priest's long-term sexual misconduct and his regret on staying silent. He no longer hears God's words and affirms his wishes to abdicate. Bergoglio ultimately comforts the Pope and offers him absolution as well. The two emerge from the room, surprising tourists. Benedict goes outside to greet the masses and take [[selfie]]s with them. Bergoglio departs for Argentina.\n\nOne year later, Pope Benedict XVI delivers [[Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|his resignation]] to the world. Cardinal Bergoglio is elected Benedict's successor in the [[2013 papal conclave]] and becomes Pope Francis. The two popes watch the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]] between [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Pope Francis|Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio]], the future Pope Francis\n** [[Juan Minuj\u00edn]] as Young Jorge Mario Bergoglio\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Pope Benedict XVI]]\n* [[Luis Gnecco]] as [[Cl\u00e1udio Hummes|Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes]]\n* Sidney Cole as [[Peter Turkson|Cardinal Peter Turkson]]\n* Lisandro Fiks as Father [[Franz Jalics]]\n* Maria Ucedo as [[Esther Ballestrino]]\n* Willie Jonah as [[Francis Arinze|Cardinal Arinze]]\n* Thomas D.

It was during the papacy of [[Pope John Paul II]], however, that efforts to investigate Maciel were repeatedly frustrated. It was Benedict who ultimately removed him.\" However publications including ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', and ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' have disagreed stating, \"For years, Joseph Ratzinger also refused to act against Maciel. As the prefect responsible for enforcing church doctrine, he chose to handle the [[catholic sexual abuse scandals|church\u2019s sexual abuse]] through secrecy rather than transparency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/ratzingers-responsibility|title=Ratzinger's Responsibility|date=March 18, 2010|website=National Catholic Reporter}}</ref> For almost a quarter century, Ratzinger failed to push for the detachment of Marcial Maciel from the position of privilege he enjoyed for so long. He finally did so in 2006, when, as Pope, he found the courage to remove Maciel from the priesthood and send him to Mexico to supposedly focus on a 'discreet life of penance and prayer.'

In the [[Puranas]], Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of the God [[Vishnu]] from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as '''Ananta Shesha''', which translates as endless-Shesha or '''Adishesha''' \"first Shesha\". It is said that when Adishesa uncoils, time moves forward and creation takes place; when he coils back, the universe ceases to exist. \n\nVishnu is often depicted as resting on Shesha. Shesha is considered a servant and a manifestation of Vishnu. He is said to have descended to Earth in three human forms or avatars: [[Lakshmana]], brother of Vishnu's avatar [[Rama]] during Tretayuga, and as [[Balarama]], brother of Vishnu's avatar [[Krishna]] during Dwaparayuga and Ramanujacharya, the proponent of Vishishtadvaita school of Vedanta during Kaliyuga.\n\n\"Shesha\" in Sanskrit texts, especially those relating to mathematical calculation, implies the \"remainder\"\u2014that which remains when all else ceases to exist.\n\n==Form==\n[[File:Sheshashayi - Laxminarayan by DHURANDHAR MV.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Vishnu]] resting on Ananta-Shesha, with his consort [[Lakshmi]] massaging his feet]]\n[[File:Vishnu reclining on Shesha, as Brahma is born on a lotus from his navel (palace of Bir Singh Dev, Orchha, early 17th c.).jpg|right|thumb|Vishnu reclining on Shesha,as Brahma is born on a lotus from his navel (palace of Bir Singh Dev, Orchha, early 17th c.)]]\n\nShesha is generally depicted with a massive form that floats coiled in space, or on the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of bliss]], to form the bed on which Vishnu lies. Sometimes he is shown as five-headed or seven-headed, but more commonly as a many thousand-headed [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], sometimes with each head wearing an ornate crown.\n\nHis name means \"that which remains\", from the [[Sanskrit]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''\u015bi\u1e63'', because when the world is destroyed at the end of the [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]], Shesha remains as he is.\n\nIn the [[Bhagavadgita]] of Chapter 10, verse 29, Shri [[Krishna]] while describing 75 of his common manifestations, declares, {{IAST|\"ananta\u015b ca asmi n\u0101g\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\"}}: Of the nagas, I am Ananta.\n\nAs per the [[Mahabharata]], Shesha was born to sage [[Kashyap]] and his wife [[Kadru]]. Kadru gave birth to a thousand snakes, of which Shesha was the eldest. After Shesha, [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], [[Airavata]] and [[Takshaka]] were born, in order. A lot of Shesha's brothers were cruel and were bent upon inflicting harm on others. They were even unkind to Garuda, who was Kashyapa's son through Vinatha, sister of Kadru. (Kadru and Vinatha were daughters of Daksha).\n\nShesha, disgusted by the cruel acts of his brothers, left his mother and kin, and took to austere penances. He lived on air and meditated in places including Gandhamadhana, Badrikashrama, Gokarna, Pushkara and Himalayas. His penances were so severe that his flesh, skin and muscles dried up and merged with his frame. [[Brahma]], convinced of his Shesha's will, asked Shesha to request a boon. Shesha asked that he be able to keep his mind under control so that he could continue to perform ascetic penances. Brahma gladly accepted the request. [[Brahma]] then asked a favour of Shesha: to go beneath the unstable earth and stabilize it. Shesha agreed and went to the netherworld and stabilized her with his hood. He is known to support her even today, thus making Patala his perennial residence.<ref>''Mbh'', Adi Parva</ref>\n\n===Maha Vishnu and Sankarshana===\n\nShesha is also depicted as floating in the ocean of the changing world, forming the bed of Maha Vishnu. Since he is known as Adishesha (the foremost of snakes) and because he is Anantashesha or simply [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]] (endless, as He is known to remain in existence even after the end of the Kalpa, when the whole universe is destroyed).\n\nIn the [[Bhagavata Purana]] Shesha is named '''Sankarshana''', the [[tamasic]] energy of Lord [[Narayana]] himself, and is said to live deep within the inner layers of [[patala]], where there are many serpents with gems on their heads and where Sankarshana is the ruler. He is said to live since before the creation of the universe. When the universe is towards its end, he creates 11 [[Rudras]] from Them to destroy the universe for a new one to be created.\n\nSankarshana is also one of the four [[vyuha]] forms of Vishnu or [[Krishna]], the other three being [[V\u0101sudeva]], [[Pradyumna]] and [[Aniruddha]].\n\nSankarshana expands himself as Garbhodakshayi-Vishnu in the beginning of the universe to create [[Brahma]]. In other words, Lord Sankarshana is Lord Narayana himself.\n\nIn previous chapters of the [[Purana]] it is also said that Lord Sankarshana spoke the Bhagavata to the [[Four Kumaras]], who in their turn passed this message of the Bhagavata. At some point the message was passed to sage [[Maitreya]] who in his turn spoke it to [[Vidura]].\n\n==Other details==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Seshanarayana (Oleographic print).jpg|thumb|250px|Sheshanarayana by [[Raja Ravi Varma]].]]\n\n[[Lakshmana]] and [[Balarama]] are considered avatara of Sheshanaga (or vice versa).\n\nIt is considered in Vaishnavism, that Lord Balarama is the first manifestation from Lord Krishna, and that Lord Balarama then incarnates into Sesha to serve Krishna as Vishnu.\n\nIn a story from the [[Purana]]s, Shesha's younger brother [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] loosens [[Mount Mandara]], to enable it to be used in the churning of the ocean by the [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s and [[asura]]s.\n\nAccording to the [[Mahabharata]] (Adi Parva), his father was [[Kashyapa]] and his mother [[Kadru]].\n\nThe city of [[Thiruvananthapuram]] is named after him as the \"City of Lord Anantapadmanabha.\"\n\n==Quotations==\n[[File:Vishnu with Shesha Naga - Bronze - Showcase 11-1 - Bronze Gallery - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 6635.JPG|thumb|Vishnu with Shesha Naga-ancient Bronze artefact in Government Museum Mathura]]\n* \"The foremost manifestation of Lord Vishnu is Sankar\u1e63ana, who is known as Ananta.

The game came out during the height of the [[role-playing game]] craze in the early 1980s.

In addition, there are several peg boards (with red ''[[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]''-type pegs) used to keep track of a player's number of troops, gold and food.\n\nThe Tower itself consists of a small [[membrane keyboard]] beneath a \"display\" (a piece of tinted plastic).  Behind the display cover is a carousel containing a number of film cels, which, when backlit by one of three lights mounted underneath, display the appropriate picture on the display cover.  The display cover also conceals a digital [[LED]] display for representing numbers up to 99.  As the Tower rotates and illuminates the appropriate cells during gameplay, it also emits sounds for the events represented by each cell.\n\n==Gameplay==\nTo play, each player takes turns rotating the Tower to face them and then moving about the board. The quarter of the board in front of a particular player is their territory.  Gameplay proceeds by moving a player's token one space and then pressing a button on the Tower that corresponds to the type of space (e.g., Sanctuary, Tomb, Bazaar, Frontier). The Tower then resolves what happens to the player by showing the player the appropriate cel and reporting whatever occurs. For instance, if the Tower decides that the player has encountered Brigands, it will turn to the Brigands cel, simultaneously displaying the number of brigands encountered. If the player chooses to fight, the Tower resolves the battle by alternately counting off the remaining numbers of friendly troops and Brigands.  Once all events have resolved, the Tower is rotated to the next player and their turn begins.\n\nEach territory besides a player's own contains one of three keys\u2014bronze, silver and gold, in that order\u2014needed to unlock the Tower.  The location of the key is randomly determined by the Tower.  Each player will therefore need to travel counter-clockwise around the board, through each of the other three players' territories, until the player has all three keys.  At this point, the player returns to his or her territory, buys reinforcements, and then attempts to attack the Tower, which contains a predetermined number of defenders inside. The first player to beat the Tower wins the game; losing requires building up another army.\n\n==Rarity==\nWorking copies of ''Dark Tower'' are increasingly difficult to find, and thus highly sought after by collectors.  This is primarily due to two things: (1) wear and tear on the tower unit, which tended to experience technical faults with the light bulbs and carousel after prolonged use, and, (2) the fact that the game went out of print shortly after release due to a lawsuit brought against Milton Bradley for intellectual property theft.\n\n==Litigation==\n''Dark Tower'' was the subject of trade secret litigation in 1985.  Two independent game developers named Robert Burton and Allen Coleman submitted a game to Milton Bradley titled \"Triumph\" that involved an electronic tower as the centerpiece.  Milton Bradley rejected the game, but proceeded to release ''Dark Tower'' some time later.  The inventors sued for misappropriation of trade secrets and won a jury verdict for over $700,000.  The trial judge, however, vacated the jury's judgement.  Despite finding that Milton Bradley had likely \"plagiarized the plaintiffs' idea without so much as a by-your-leave\" the judge proceeded to issue a directed verdict for the defendant because Burton and Coleman had signed a contract waiving any contractual relationship (which arguably included any duty of confidentiality).  The First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding evidence that Milton Bradley entered an implied agreement to keep the game confidential and reinstated the damage award.<ref>''Burton v.

For example, in a [[gland]], the tissue that makes the hormones is the parenchyma, whereas the stroma includes the [[nerve tissue|nerves]] that innervate the parenchyma, the [[blood vessel]]s that oxygenate and nourish it and carry away its metabolic wastes, and the [[connective tissue]]s that provide a suitable place for it to be situated and anchored. The main tissues that make up an organ tend to have common [[embryology|embryologic]] origins, such as arising from the same [[germ layer]]. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in most multicellular [[organism]]s. In [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]] such as [[bacteria]], the [[analogy (biology)|functional analogue]] of an organ is known as an [[organelle]]. In plants, there are three main organs.<ref name=\"Botany\">{{cite web|title=Botany/Plant structure - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Botany/Plant_structure|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en}}</ref> A hollow organ is an internal organ that forms a hollow tube, or pouch such as the [[stomach]], [[intestine]], or [[urinary bladder|bladder]].\n\nIn the study of [[anatomy]], the term ''viscus'' refers to an internal organ. Viscera is the plural form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Viscus |title=Viscus - Definition |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=14 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=viscera |title=Viscera |work=MeSH |accessdate=14 December 2009}}</ref> \n\nThe number of organs in any organism depends on [[#Modern times|which precise definition of the term one uses]]. By one widely used definition, 79 organs have been identified in the human body.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38506708|title=New organ named in digestive system|date=2017|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Tissue===\nIn [[biology]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] is a cellular organizational level between [[cell (biology)|cells]] and complete organs. A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells and their [[extracellular matrix]] from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues.\n\nThe study of human and animal tissues is known as [[histology]] or, in connection with disease, [[histopathology]]. For plants, the discipline is called [[plant anatomy|plant morphology]]. Classical tools for studying tissues include the [[Microtome#Applications|paraffin block]] ([[agarose]] gel is often used with plants<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li\u0161kov\u00e1|first=Desana|last2=Koll\u00e1rov\u00e1|first2=Karin|last3=Martinka|first3=Michal|last4=Sterckeman|first4=Thibault|last5=Lux|first5=Alexander|last6=Zelko|first6=Ivan|date=2012-07-01|title=An easy method for cutting and fluorescent staining of thin roots|journal=Annals of Botany|language=en|volume=110|issue=2|pages=475\u2013478|doi=10.1093/aob/mcs046|pmid=22419758|issn=0305-7364|pmc=3394640}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/schiefelbein-lab/rapid-preparation-of-transverse-sections-of-plant-roots/|title=Rapid Preparation of Transverse Sections of Plant Roots {{!}} Schiefelbein Lab|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref>) in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the [[staining|histological stain]], and the [[Microscope|optical microscope]]. In the last couple of decades, developments in [[electron microscopy]], [[immunofluorescence]], and the use of [[microtome|frozen tissue sections]] have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling considerable refinement of [[medical diagnosis]] and [[prognosis]].\n\n=== Organ systems ===\n{{main|Biological system}}\n{{See also|List of organs of the human body}}\nTwo or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a [[biological system]] or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the [[nervous system|nervous]] and [[endocrine system]] both operate via a shared organ, the [[hypothalamus]]. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the [[neuroendocrine system]]. The same is true for the [[musculoskeletal system]] because of the relationship between the [[muscular system|muscular]] and [[skeletal system]]s.\n\nCommon organ system designations in plants includes the differentiation of shoot and root. All parts of the plant above ground (in non-[[epiphyte]]s), including the functionally distinct leaf and flower organs, may be classified together as the shoot organ system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-biology/chapter/the-plant-body/|title=The Plant Body {{!}} Boundless Biology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\n\n===Animals===\n[[File:Leber Schaf.jpg|thumb|The [[liver]] and [[gallbladder]] of a [[sheep]]]]\nNon-[[placozoa]]n [[animal]]s such as humans have a variety of organ systems.

Organs of [[plant]]s can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs include [[root]]s, [[plant stem|stems]], and [[leaf|leaves]]. The reproductive organs are variable. In [[flowering plant]]s, they are represented by the [[flower]], [[seed]] and [[fruit]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Reproduction in Plants |url=http://www. biologyreference. com/Re-Se/Reproduction-in-Plants.html |website=Biology Reference |publisher=Biology Reference |accessdate=8 September 2019}}</ref> In [[Pinophyta|conifers]], the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a [[conifer cone|cone]]. In other divisions ([[phylum|phyla]]) of plants, the reproductive organs are called [[strobili]], in ''[[Lycopodiophyta]]'', or simply gametophores in [[moss]]es.\n\nThe vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as [[photosynthesis]], while the reproductive organs are essential in [[plant sexuality|reproduction]]. However, if there is [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[vegetative reproduction]], the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see [[clonal colony]]).\n\n==Society and culture==\nMany societies have a system for [[organ donation]], in which a living or deceased donor's organ is [[Organ transplant|transplanted]] into a person with a failing organ.

For example, in a [[gland]], the tissue that makes the hormones is the parenchyma, whereas the stroma includes the [[nerve tissue|nerves]] that innervate the parenchyma, the [[blood vessel]]s that oxygenate and nourish it and carry away its metabolic wastes, and the [[connective tissue]]s that provide a suitable place for it to be situated and anchored. The main tissues that make up an organ tend to have common [[embryology|embryologic]] origins, such as arising from the same [[germ layer]]. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in most multicellular [[organism]]s. In [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]] such as [[bacteria]], the [[analogy (biology)|functional analogue]] of an organ is known as an [[organelle]]. In plants, there are three main organs.<ref name=\"Botany\">{{cite web|title=Botany/Plant structure - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Botany/Plant_structure|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en}}</ref> A hollow organ is an internal organ that forms a hollow tube, or pouch such as the [[stomach]], [[intestine]], or [[urinary bladder|bladder]].\n\nIn the study of [[anatomy]], the term ''viscus'' refers to an internal organ.

With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling considerable refinement of [[medical diagnosis]] and [[prognosis]].\n\n=== Organ systems ===\n{{main|Biological system}}\n{{See also|List of organs of the human body}}\nTwo or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a [[biological system]] or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the [[nervous system|nervous]] and [[endocrine system]] both operate via a shared organ, the [[hypothalamus]]. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the [[neuroendocrine system]]. The same is true for the [[musculoskeletal system]] because of the relationship between the [[muscular system|muscular]] and [[skeletal system]]s.\n\nCommon organ system designations in plants includes the differentiation of shoot and root.

An outstanding model for this kind of research is the [[placentation|placenta]], which has evolved more than 100 times independently in vertebrates, has evolved relatively recently in some lineages, and exists in intermediate forms in extant taxa.<ref name=\"Griffith\">{{cite journal|last1=Griffith|first1=Oliver W.|last2=Wagner|first2=G?nter P.|title=The placenta as a model for understanding the origin and evolution of vertebrate organs|journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution|date=23 March 2017|volume=1|issue=4|page=0072|doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0072|pmid=28812655}}</ref> Studies on the evolution of the placenta have identified a variety of genetic and physiological processes that contribute to the origin and evolution of organs, these include the re-purposing of existing animal tissues, the acquisition of new functional properties by these tissues, and novel interactions of distinct tissue types.<ref name=\"Griffith\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Organoid]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscat-inline|Organs (anatomy)}}\n\n{{Organ systems}}\n{{Composition (Biology)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Levels of organization (Biology)]]\n[[Category:Organ systems| ]]\n[[Category:Organs (anatomy)| ]]\n", "name_user": "98.29.17.200", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"}
