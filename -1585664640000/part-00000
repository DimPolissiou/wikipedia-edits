It is one of the largest paved squares in the United Kingdom.\n\nLocated in the heart of [[Nottingham City Centre]], the square is bounded by [[Beastmarket Hill]] to the West, [[Long Row]] to the North, and [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]] to the South. The Eastern end of the square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which served as Nottingham's [[town hall]] until 2010.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxley_House,_Nottingham Loxley House]</ref>\n\nThe nature of the square means it is often used for large local events, fairs, concerts and exhibitions.\n\n==History==\nThe early market square, from the 11th Century until 1928, covered an area of about 5.5 acres (22,260 square metres), with its narrow western edge near Mount Street, broadening out to its eastern edge, adjacent to High Street. The perimeter then, being formed by what is now: [[Long Row|Long Row West]], [[Long Row]], [[Long Row|Long Row East]], High Street, [[Poultry, Nottingham|Poultry]], [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]], [[Beastmarket Hill]], and Angel Row.<ref>[https://nottinghamhiddenhistoryteam.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nottinghams-old-market-square/ Hidden History]</ref> Because of its size during these several centuries, it was frequently referred to as the, 'Great Market Place'.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1931/itinerary1931p2.htm Thoroton]</ref>\n\nThe square has long been at the centre of Nottingham life. In the early days before the [[City of Nottingham]] was formed, the area was the centre-point between the [[Normans|Norman]] town of Nottingham, situated around the Castle Rock, and the old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] town which was based around the current [[Lace Market]] at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary's Church]], also called Snothryngham, Snottingaham or Snottingham.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/swinnerton1910/chapter1.htm Nottinghamshire history > Cambridge County Geographies: Nottinghamshire, (1910)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The central point between the two towns became a major market point, and hence the square has been at the centre of Nottingham's growth around it for hundreds of years since. The two towns were once divided by a wall. The old positioning of this historic wall was reinstated when the square was redesigned in the 2000s, with a stainless steel drainage channel down the centre of the Square. This marks the Wall that divided the livestock from the agricultural feed and foodstuffs.\n\nThe square was the original setting of [[Nottingham Goose Fair]], an annual fair held in October originating over 700 years ago. The Goose Fair was moved in 1928 for redevelopment of the square.\n\nThe square was the location of [[Smith's Bank]] which, established in 1688, was the earliest provincial bank in England. Its successor, the [[National Westminster Bank]], is still located in the same premises.\n\nWhen the [[Nottingham Exchange]] was demolished and the new [[Nottingham Council House]] built, the Square was redesigned in 1927 with several platforms creating a central procession way. However, the decline in the quality, changes in function, and issues surrounding disabled access spurred a City Council-led international redevelopment competition in 2003 known as [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/features/2004/03/old_market_square_designs_introduction.shtml Square One].\n\nThe Square continues to be affectionately nicknamed, 'Slab Square', which is a colloquialism and an accurate description, owing to the high number of concrete slabs that made up the former Square, and the high number in place after the 2007 redesign.<ref>[https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/X9Y-1152789 Pre 2007]</ref><ref>[https://www.picturesofengland.com/England/Nottinghamshire/Nottingham/pictures/1168323 Post 2007]</ref> There was a mosaic of the city [[coat of arms]] in front of the Council House on the square. This fell into a state of dis-repair before the redesign, but was subsequently removed, renovated and installed near the [[Nottingham Royal Concert Hall|Royal Concert Hall]] entrance.\n\nConstruction of the new design cost \u00a317 million. Work began in 2005. The Square was scheduled to reopen before the end of 2006, but following delays reopened in March 2007.\n\nHistorically the Square forms a meeting place for the people of Nottingham and is also the location for local events, civic protests, royal visits, celebrations, and public mourning. A number of Nottingham's defining moments have taken place in the Square.\n\nOne of the most significant civil protests to start here was the protest by [[Luddites]] (a social movement of British textile artisans) in the early nineteenth century, who protested growth in industrial machinery which was seen to be taking jobs. This protest eventually led to the destruction by fire of the [[4th Duke of Newcastle]]\u2019s mansion house, which was built for the 2nd Duke in 1679 on the remaining foundations of the earlier medieval castle.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/gill1904/dismantled.htm Gill Notts History]</ref> The mansion house, the grounds, and the remaining fortifications including the renovated gatehouse, are [[colloquially]] known as, \u2018[[Nottingham Castle]]\u2019 or simply, \u2018the Castle\u2019. Trophies won by [[Nottingham Forest|Nottingham Forest Football Club]] including the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and the [[FA Cup]] have all been held aloft in front of crowds here. Nottingham ice dance legends [[Torvill and Dean]] also stood on the Council House balcony following their famous Olympic Triumph. In 2004, a memorial service to remember the life of Nottingham Forest's former manager [[Brian Clough]] was held there in front of national television cameras and thousands of local football supporters.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090418073216/http://www.brianclough.com/civic_tribute.html Civic Tribute]</ref> A statue of [[Brian Clough]] is located just off the square at the junction of King Street and Queen Street.<ref>[https://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/brian-clough-statue-48800.html Statue]</ref>\n\nAs well as many shops, bars and department stores, the Square is also home to the [http://www.nctx.co.uk/ Nottingham City Transport] Travel Centre. The city [[tourist information centre]] and [[Nottinghamshire]] Angel Row central library are also both just near the Square. [[The Bell Inn, Nottingham|The Bell Inn]], thought to be one of the UK's oldest pubs dating back to around 1276, also sits at the back of the Square.\n[[Image:Nottingham Market Square Ferris Wheel.JPG|thumb|200px|Wheel of Nottingham [[Ferris wheel]] in Old Market Square, 2008]]\n[[Folklore]] has it that it was in the Market Square where [[outlaw]] [[Robin Hood]] took advantage of an [[amnesty]] and won the coveted silver arrow in a contest devised by the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]. This contest forms the central plot to the [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Disney version of Robin Hood]].\n\nThe Square has been the focal point of Nottingham's entry to the ''[[Britain in Bloom]]'' competition in recent years, taking the title four times (1997, 2001, 2003 and 2007).\n\nIn December every year, the Square hosts a [[Christmas market|''Weihnachtsmarkt'']] (German Christmas Market), and is the centre of local New Year's Eve celebrations. The Nottingham [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas Lights]] switch-on event also takes place here.\n\nIn February 2008, a [[Ferris wheel]] was installed in Market Square.

At the west end was a similar arrangement, but at the centre of each of these two areas of grass, was a circular pool with a single central fountain. There was a period during the 1950s\u20131960s when there were four grassed areas with flowerbeds, but no fountains. \n\nSubsequently, in the 1960s, the two squares flanking the central processional way at the east end, were rebuilt as two pools with a multiple fountain display in each. These remained until the redesign by [[Kathryn Gustafson]] which was completed in 2007, when new fountains and water feature, were added at the west end of the new square.<ref>[http://www.gp-b.com/old-market-square Gustafson Porter + Bowman]</ref>\n\n===Tram stop===\nOn the southern side of the Market Square, along South Parade, is [[Nottingham Express Transit]]\u2019s [[Old Market Square tram stop]].

Based on fossil evidence found at the [[Olduvai Gorge]], various [[hominid]] species have occupied the area for 3 million years.\n\nHunter-gatherers were replaced by [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]]s a few thousand years ago.

Two German brothers (Adolph and Friedrich Siedentopf) farmed in the crater until the outbreak of [[World War I]], after leasing the land from the administration of [[German East Africa]]. The brothers regularly organized shooting parties to entertain their German friends.

In 1928, hunting was prohibited on all land within the crater rim, except the former Siedentopf farms. The National Park Ordinance of 1948 (implemented in 1951) created the [[Serengeti National Park]] (SNP). This, however, caused problems with the Maasai and other tribes, resulting in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Ordinance (1959) that separated the conservation area from the national park.

Land use is controlled to prevent negative effects on the wildlife population. For example, cultivation is prohibited at all but subsistence levels.\n\nThe area is part of the [[Serengeti|Serengeti ecosystem]] and, to the northwest, adjoins the SNP and is contiguous with the southern Serengeti plains. These plains also extend to the north into the unprotected Loliondo division and are kept open to wildlife through [[transhumance]] pastoralism practiced by the Maasai. The south and west of the area are volcanic highlands, including the famous Ngorongoro Crater and the lesser known Empakaa Crateri. The southern and eastern boundaries are approximately defined by the rim of the [[East African Rift]] wall, which also prevents animal migration in these directions.\n\n==Geology==\nThe [[Pliocene]] Ngorongoro [[Volcanic complex]] consists of 8 extinct [[shield volcanoes]] within the Eyasi [[Half-graben]], the eastern boundary marked by the [[Gregory Rift]] Western [[Escarpment]].  The [[Lake Eyasi]] escarpment bounds the half-graben on the southwest.  Within the complex, 5 volcanoes are [[volcanic cone|dome-shaped cones]], while 3 have calderas.  Ngorongoro Volcano (2.5-1.9 Ma) is primarily [[basaltic]] [[trachyandesite]].  The caldera is fed by the Munge and Oljoro Nyuki Rivers, while the Ngoitokitok [[hot springs]] feed into the Goringop swamp.  Lake Magadi is a shallow (1.7 m) [[alkaline lake]].  Other volcanoes within the complex include Olmoti (2.01-1.79 Ma), Empakaai, Loolmalasin, Sadiman (3.7 Ma), Lemagrut, and Oldeani.

Based on fossil evidence found at the [[Olduvai Gorge]], various [[hominid]] species have occupied the area for 3 million years.\n\nHunter-gatherers were replaced by [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]]s a few thousand years ago.

Two German brothers (Adolph and Friedrich Siedentopf) farmed in the crater until the outbreak of [[World War I]], after leasing the land from the administration of [[German East Africa]]. The brothers regularly organized shooting parties to entertain their German friends.

In 1928, hunting was prohibited on all land within the crater rim, except the former Siedentopf farms. The National Park Ordinance of 1948 (implemented in 1951) created the [[Serengeti National Park]] (SNP). This, however, caused problems with the Maasai and other tribes, resulting in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Ordinance (1959) that separated the conservation area from the national park. Maasai pastoralists living in Serengeti National Park were systematically relocated to Ngorongoro, increasing the population of Maasai and livestock living in the Crater.<ref name=\"natgeo\">{{cite web | url=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0602/feature1/text4.html | title=Heartbreak on the Serengeti | accessdate=21 February 2008 | author=Robert M.

Land use is controlled to prevent negative effects on the wildlife population. For example, cultivation is prohibited at all but subsistence levels.\n\nThe area is part of the [[Serengeti|Serengeti ecosystem]] and, to the northwest, adjoins the SNP and is contiguous with the southern Serengeti plains. These plains also extend to the north into the unprotected Loliondo division and are kept open to wildlife through [[transhumance]] pastoralism practiced by the Maasai. The south and west of the area are volcanic highlands, including the famous Ngorongoro Crater and the lesser known Empakaa Crateri. The southern and eastern boundaries are approximately defined by the rim of the [[East African Rift]] wall, which also prevents animal migration in these directions.\n\n==Geology==\nThe [[Pliocene]] Ngorongoro [[Volcanic complex]] consists of 8 extinct [[shield volcanoes]] within the Eyasi [[Half-graben]], the eastern boundary marked by the [[Gregory Rift]] Western [[Escarpment]].  The [[Lake Eyasi]] escarpment bounds the half-graben on the southwest.  Within the complex, 5 volcanoes are [[volcanic cone|dome-shaped cones]], while 3 have calderas.  Ngorongoro Volcano (2.5-1.9 Ma) is primarily [[basaltic]] [[trachyandesite]].  The caldera is fed by the Munge and Oljoro Nyuki Rivers, while the Ngoitokitok [[hot springs]] feed into the Goringop swamp.  Lake Magadi is a shallow (1.7 m) [[alkaline lake]].  Other volcanoes within the complex include Olmoti (2.01-1.79 Ma), Empakaai, Loolmalasin, Sadiman (3.7 Ma), Lemagrut, and Oldeani.

With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting to them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says \"but.\" Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison. Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys.
