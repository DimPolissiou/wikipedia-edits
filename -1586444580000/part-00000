It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A '''wristwatch''' is designed to be worn around the [[wrist]], attached by a [[watch strap]] or other type of [[bracelet]], including [[metal bands]], [[leather straps]] or any other kind of bracelet. A [[pocket watch]] is designed for a person to carry in a [[pocket]], often attached to a chain. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\nWatches progressed in the 17th&nbsp;century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th&nbsp;century. During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by [[clockwork]], powered by winding a [[mainspring]], and keeping time with an oscillating [[balance wheel]]. These are called ''[[mechanical watch]]es''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christopherward.com/blog/quartz-vs-automatic/|title=CWorld {{!}} Christopher Ward {{!}} QUARTZ VS AUTOMATIC|website=www.christopherward.com|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://est1897.co.uk/what-is-a-watch-movement-quartz-automatic-manual-kinetic|title=What is a Watch Movement?

The first thing to be improved was the [[escapement]]. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the [[Escapement#Cylinder escapement|cylinder escapement]], invented by [[Thomas Tompion]] in 1695 and further developed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] in the 1720s. Improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by [[Robert Hooke]] allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.\n\nA major cause of error in balance wheel timepieces, caused by changes in [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the [[balance spring]] from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic [[Balance wheel|temperature compensated balance wheel]] invented in 1765 by [[Pierre Le Roy]] and improved by [[Thomas Earnshaw]]. The [[lever escapement]] was the single most important technological breakthrough, and was invented by [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] in 1759 and improved by Josiah Emery in 1785, although it only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - II orologi, 1737 \u2013 BEIC 13458392.jpg|thumb|A watch drawn in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1737]]\nThe British had predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high-quality products for the elite.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVUSauNST8EC&dq=British+Watch+Company+mass+production&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Manufacturing Time: Global Competition in the Watch Industry, 1795\u20132000|author=Glasmeier, Amy|year=2000|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with [[mass production]] techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the British Watch Company in 1843, it was in the [[United States]] that this system took off.

[[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an armed watch. The oldest surviving wristwatch (then described as a bracelet watch) is one made in 1806 and given to [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]].<ref name=Bruton183>{{cite book |last=Bruton |first=Eric |date=2000 |title=The History of Clocks & Watches |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=183 |isbn=0316853550}}</ref> From the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket watches up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Evolu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=The Evolution of the Wristwatch|access-date=8 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208200615/http://vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|archive-date=8 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, when the importance of synchronizing maneuvers during war, without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signaling, was increasingly recognized. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a \"Watch Wristlet\" design in 1893, but they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> During the [[First Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin & Webb]] began production of their successful \"campaign watch\" for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at Sudan in 1898]] and accelerated production for the [[Second Boer War]] a few years later.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> In continental Europe, [[Girard-Perregaux]] and other Swiss watchmakers began supplying German naval officers with wristwatches in about 1880.<ref name=Bruton183 />\n\nEarly models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap but, by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company Dimier Fr\u00e8res & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. [[Hans Wilsdorf]] moved to London in 1905 and set up his own business, Wilsdorf & Davis, with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company later became [[Rolex]].<ref>Rolex Jubilee Vade Mecum published by the Rolex Watch Company in 1946.</ref> Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|first=John E.|last=Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. The [[War Office]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight |publisher=Hyperion Press |isbn=0-7868-8571-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wingsofmadnessal0000hoff }}</ref> By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that \"the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.\" By 1930, the ratio of a wrist to pocket watches was 50 to 1. The first successful [[self-winding watch|self-winding]] system was invented by [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923.\n\n====Quartz====\nThe commercial introduction of the [[quartz watch]] in 1969 in the form of the Omega [[Omega Electroquartz|Beta 21]] and the Seiko [[Astron (wristwatch)|Astron]] was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, they used a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]] [[resonator]] which vibrated at 8,192&nbsp;Hz, driven by a battery-powered [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]]. Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.\n\n====Hamilton Electric====\nHamilton Electric were the pioneers of the first electric watch <ref>https://wornandwound.com/hamilton-electric-the-race-to-create-the-worlds-first-battery-powered-watch/ Worlds first battery powered watch </ref> unlike the Quartz and the Bulova Accutron this was the first movement to use a battery as a source to oscillate the balance wheel. Hamilton released two models of the Electric: the first released was the Hamilton 500 on 3 January 1957, which was produced into 1959. This model had problems with the contact wires misaligning and the watch returned to Hamilton for alignment. The Hamilton 505 was an improvement on the 500 and was more reliable: the contact wires were removed and a non-adjustable contact on the balance assembly delivered the power to the balance wheel.\n\n== Movement ==\n[[File:Watch Mechanical Quartz Comparison.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of movements move the hands differently as shown in this 2-second exposure.

The movement is fitted with a cylinder escapement.]]\n\nA [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the [[watch face]] indicating the time.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\n{{Main|Mechanical watch}}\nCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, and they are sensitive to position, temperature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/temperature|title= Temperature | work = Advice on Your Timepiece |publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> and magnetism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/magnetism|title=Magnetism| work=Advice on Your Timepiece|publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> They are also costly to produce, require regular maintenance and adjustments, and are more prone to failures. Nevertheless, the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public, especially among the watch collectors. [[Skeleton watch]]es are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes.\n\nA mechanical movement uses an [[escapement]] mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release. A mechanical movement also uses a [[balance wheel]] together with the [[balance spring]] (also known as a hairspring) to control the motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the [[pendulum]] of a [[pendulum clock]]. The [[tourbillon]], an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, which is used to cancel out or reduce the effects of [[gravity|gravitational]] bias to the timekeeping. Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are very expensive, and only found in prestigious watches.\n\nThe [[pin-lever escapement]] (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, [[Georges Frederic Roskopf]]), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers as well as by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]], until it was replaced by quartz movements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |title=The original pin-pallet |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205103752/http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |title=The Roskopf Watch |publisher=Musketeer.ch |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150312/http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsr.id.au/buffat.html|title=Buffat The Roskopf watch|website=Watkinsr.id.au|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement. Introduced by [[Bulova]] in 1960, they use a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 [[hertz]]) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. [[Electric watch#Types of electric watches|Tuning-fork watches]] were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed. [[Quartz watch]]es were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate.\n\n{{Main|Mainspring}}\nTraditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a [[mainspring]] as a power source. In ''manual watches'' the spring must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown. Antique [[pocketwatch]]es were wound by inserting a separate key into a hole in the back of the watch and turning it. Most modern watches are designed to run 40&nbsp; hours on a winding and thus must be wound daily, but some run for several days and a few have 192-hour mainsprings and are wound weekly.\n\n==== Automatic watches ====\n{{Main|Automatic watch}}\n[[File:Jaeger-Lecoultre-p1000838.jpg|thumb|[[Automatic watch]]: An eccentric weight, called a rotor, swings with the movement of the wearer's body and winds the spring]]\n[[File:Seiko 5 Automatic 21 Jewels.png|thumb|upright|Seiko 5 Automatic Watch 21 Jewels]]\n\nA ''self-winding'' or ''automatic'' watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body. The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ | title=Watchmaking in Europe and China: Watches & Wonders | work=[[Richemont]] | publisher=Worldtempus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011232012/http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ |archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref> but the first \"[[self-winding watch|self-winding]]\", or \"automatic\", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.\n\nIn April 2014 the Swatch Group launched the ''sistem51'' wristwatch. It has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight. So far, it is the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/featured/exclusive-an-inside-view-of-the-eta-high-tech-swatch-sistem51-production-in-boncourt-in-the-swiss-jura/|title=EXCLUSIVE: An inside view of the ETA high-tech Swatch Sistem51 production in Boncourt in the Swiss Jura \u2013 Watch-Insider.com|date=3 December 2014|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> The low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical Swiss watch, which can be considered a successor to ''Roskopf'' movements, although of higher quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/news/swatch-sistem51-swiss-watchmaking-revolution|title=Swatch Sistem51 a Swiss-made watchmaking revolution|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronic ===\n{{See also|Electric watch|Quartz clock}}\n[[File:Csem-beta1.jpg|thumb|upright|First quartz wristwatch BETA 1 developed by CEH, Switzerland, 1967]]\nElectronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a [[quartz]] [[crystal]] which is made to vibrate by the [[piezoelectric effect]]. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an [[quartz oscillator|oscillator]]. It [[resonance|resonates]] at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.\n\nIn 1959 [[Seiko]] placed an order with Epson (a daughter company of Seiko and the 'brain' behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch. The project was codenamed 59A. By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.\n\nThe first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just ''portable'' quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192&nbsp; Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module, and an in-house-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch\u00e2tel in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Pioneering_Work_on_the_Quartz_Electronic_Wristwatch,_1962-1967 |title=Milestones:Pioneering Work on the Quartz Electronic Wristwatch, 1962\u20131967 |publisher=Ieeeghn.org |date= |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the [[Omega Electroquartz]] as well as [[Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex Oysterquartz]] and Piaget.\n\n[[File:Seiko 35A.jpg|thumb|Quartz Movement of the Seiko Astron, 1969 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2010-006)]]\n\nThe first quartz watch to enter production was the [[Seiko]] [[Astron (wristwatch)|35 SQ Astron]], which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date: the [[Omega Marine Chronometer]]. Since the technology having been developed by contributions from Japanese, American and Swiss,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieee-uffc.org/main/history/step.pdf |title=In the late 1960s teams of engineers working independently in Japan, Switzerland and the United States used newly created electronic components to completely reinvent the wristwatch. |publisher=IEEE |date=2000 |accessdate=7 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013191116/http://www.ieee-uffc.org/main/history/step.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> nobody could patent the whole movement of the quartz wristwatch, thus allowing other manufacturers to participate in the rapid growth and development of the quartz watch market. This ended\u2014in less than a decade\u2014almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy. Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements. Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day\u2014ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.<ref>Quartz mechanisms usually have a resonant frequency of 32768&nbsp; Hz, chosen for ease of use (being 2<sup>15</sup>). Using a simple 15 stage divide-by-two circuit, this is turned into a 1 pulse per second signal responsible for the watch's timekeeping.</ref>\n\nAfter a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the [[Swatch Group]] of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products. For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture [[Watch battery|watch batteries]] (Renata), oscillators ([[Oscilloquartz]], now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed [[EM Microelectronic-Marin]]). The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design, and marketing. Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company.\n\n[[Seiko]]'s efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the [[Seiko]] [[Spring Drive]], first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.\n\nIn 2010, Miyota ([[Citizen Watch]]) of [[Japan]] introduced a newly developed movement that uses a 3-pronged quartz crystal that was exclusively produced for [[Bulova]] to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144&nbsp;kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/\u2212 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/23/bulova-introduces-the-most-accurate-watch-in-the-world-the-precisionist/ |title=Bulova introduces the most accurate watch in the world, the Precisionist |publisher=Crunch gear |date = 23 March 2010 |accessdate= 8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nRadio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch which synchronizes ([[time transfer]]s) its time with an external [[Time signal#Radio time signals|time source]] such as in [[atomic clock]]s, time signals from [[GPS]] navigation satellites, the German [[DCF77]] signal in Europe, [[WWVB]] in the US, and others. Movements of this type may\u2014among others\u2014synchronize the time of day and the date, the [[leap year|leap-year]] status and the state of [[daylight saving time]] (on or off). However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.\n\nElectronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a replaceable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].\n\nWatch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement. Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some [[solar-powered watch]]es.\n\nSome electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer. For instance, Seiko's [[Automatic quartz|kinetic-powered quartz watches]] use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny [[Electrical generator|generator]] to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.\n\n[[Solar powered watch]]es are powered by light. A [[photovoltaic cell]] on the face ([[dial (measurement)|dial]]) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a [[rechargeable battery]] or [[capacitor]]. The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor. As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs a battery replacement. Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen [[Eco-Drive]]). Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko, and Citizen). As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soluhr.com/|title=History of the Solar Wristwatch|work=Soluhr.com|accessdate=17 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141728/http://www.soluhr.com/|archive-date=12 August 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the [[Citizen Watch Co., Ltd|Citizen]] [[Eco-Drive]] Thermo).\n\n== Display ==\n=== Analog ===\n[[File:Poljot-Aviator-3133.jpg|thumb|[[Poljot]] [[chronograph]]]]\n[[File:Casio AE12.jpg|alt=Casio AE12|thumb|Casio AE12 LCA (liquid-crystal-analog) watch]]\nTraditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker. Watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand, although it is actually not gliding; the hand merely moves in smaller steps, typically 1/5 of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. In some escapements (for example the ''duplex'' escapement), the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically 1/2-second in those watches, or even every four beats (two periods, 1 second), in the ''double duplex'' escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the ''tri-synchro regulator'' of [[Spring Drive]] watches. All of the hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with \"hands\" that are simulated by a [[liquid crystal display|liquid-crystal display]].\n\nAnalog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.\n\nAnalog watches, as well as clocks, are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on the upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/business/media/28adco.html|title=Why Time Stands Still for Watchmakers|work=New York Times|accessdate=28 November 2008|date=28 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Ten Ten Tenet|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/market/clockhands.asp|work=Snopes.com|publisher=Barbara and David P.

Usually, the LED display color would be red. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness would a button need to be pressed to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.<ref>{{US Patent|4096550}}: W. Boller, M. Donati, J. Fingerle, P.

Some watches, such as the [[Timex Datalink#Timex Datalink USB|Timex Datalink USB]], feature [[dot matrix]] displays.

Various methods have been used to achieve this.\n\nMechanical watches often have [[luminous paint]] on their hands and hour marks. In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light. [[Radium]] was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan's Vintage Watches|url=http://alanwatch.homestead.com/page9.html|publisher=Radium Watch Dial Pattern|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> [[Tritium]] was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass. However, tritium is expensive\u2014it has to be made in a [[nuclear reactor]]\u2014and it has a [[half-life]] of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years. Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (See [[Tritium illumination]]). For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it. This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.\n\nWatches that incorporate batteries often have the electric illumination of their displays. However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements. To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button. Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.\n\n[[File:Backlit LCD display.jpg|thumbnail|Views of a [[liquid crystal display]], both with [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] backlight switched on (top) and switched off (bottom)]]\n[[File:Casio LCD Watch F-E10.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail| Digital LCD wristwatch Casio type F-E10 with electroluminescent backlighting.]]\nIn some early digital watches, [[LED]] displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight. The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.\n\nIn some types of watches, small [[incandescent]] lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination. Incandescent lamps are very wasteful of electricity.\n\nOther watches use [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.\n\n== Speech synthesis ==\n[[Speech synthesis|Talking]] watches are available, intended for the [[Visual impairment|blind or visually impaired]]. They speak the time out loud at the press of a button. This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting the non-[[deaf]] that the wearer is checking the time. Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.\n\n==Handedness==\nWristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch so it can be worn of the left wrist for a right-handed individual. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Some manufacturers offer \"left-hand drive\", aka \"destro\", configured watches which move the crown to the left side<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/a-guide-to-destro-watches-from-sinn-muhle-citizen-and-more/|title=A Guide to \"Destro\": Watches from Sinn, M\u00fchle, Citizen, and More - Worn & Wound|date=10 May 2016|website=Wornandwound.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> making wearing the watch easier for left-handed individuals.\n\nA rarer configuration is the bullhead watch. Bullhead watches are generally, but not exclusively, [[chronograph]]s. The configuration moves the crown and chronograph pushers to the top of the watch. Bullheads are commonly wristwatch chronographs that are intended to be used as stopwatches off the wrist. Examples are the Citizen Bullhead Change Timer<ref>CITIZEN \"BULLHEAD\" CHALLENGE TIMER</ref> and the Omega Seamaster Bullhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-omega-seamaster-bullhead-live-pics-pricing|title=Hands-On: With The Omega Seamaster Bullhead (Live Pics + Pricing)|website=Hodinkee.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDigital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments. These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Rolex-Submariner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Rolex]] Submariner, an officially certified chronometer]]\n[[File:Breguet MG 2573.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]] squelette watch 2933 with [[tourbillon]]]]\n[[File:Patek-Philippe MG 2583.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Perpetual calendar and moonphase wristwatch by [[Patek Philippe]]]]\nCustomarily, watches provide the [[time of day]], giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second. Many also provide the current date, and some (called \"complete calendar\" or \"triple date\" watches) display the day of the week and the month as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include [[alarm]]s. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate [[Striking clock|striking mechanisms]] or [[Repeater (horology)|repeater]] functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary [[Clock|timepieces]]. This feature is available on most digital watches.\n\nA ''complicated watch'' has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a [[Complication (horology)|complication]]. Two popular complications are the '''[[chronograph]]''' complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a [[stopwatch]], and the '''moonphase''' complication, which is a display of the [[lunar phase]]. Other more expensive complications include [[Tourbillon]], [[Perpetual calendar]], [[Minute repeater]], and [[Equation of time]]. A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see [[Calibre 89]] from [[Patek Philippe]] for instance).

Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for [[UTC]] or [[GMT]].\n\nThe similar-sounding terms '''chronograph''' and '''chronometer''' are often confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a [[stopwatch]] complication (as explained above), while a [[chronometer watch]] is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the [[COSC]] (Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\u00e8tres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.\n\n[[File:Datalink USB Dress Edition.JPG|thumb|upright|Timex Datalink USB Dress edition from 2003 with a dot matrix display; the ''Invasion'' video game is on the screen]]\n\nMany computerized wristwatches have been developed, but none have had long-term sales success, because they have awkward [[user interface]]s due to the tiny screens and buttons, and short battery life. As miniaturized electronics became cheaper, watches have been developed containing [[calculator watch|calculators]], [[tonometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, a [[compass]] using both hands to show the N/S direction, [[video game]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[keydrive]]s, [[GPS watch|GPS receivers]] and [[cellular phone]]s. A few [[Astronomical clock#Watches|astronomical watches]] show [[phase of the Moon]] and other celestial phenomena. In the early 1980s [[Seiko]] marketed a watch with a television in it. Such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly [[geek]] toys. Several companies have however attempted to develop a [[computer]] contained in a wristwatch (see also [[wearable computer]]).\n\nElectronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or [[Activity tracker|activity tracking]], address the general [[Physical fitness|fitness]] market and have the potential for commercial success ([[Garmin forerunner]], Garmin Vivofit, Epson,<ref name=\"Epson\" /> announced model of [[Swatch]] Touch series<ref>Hug, Daniel : ''Swatch lanciert 2015 eine intelligente Uhr.''

Some dress watches have a [[cabochon]] on the crown or [[facet]]ed [[gemstone]]s on the face, [[bezel setting|bezel]], or bracelet. Some are made entirely of faceted [[sapphire]] ([[corundum]]).\n\nMany fashions and [[department store]]s offer a variety of less-expensive, trendy, \"[[costume jewelry|costume]]\" watches (usually for women), many of which are similar in quality to basic quartz timepieces but which feature bolder designs. In the 1980s, the Swiss [[Swatch]] company hired graphic designers to redesign a new annual collection of non-repairable watches.\n\nTrade in [[counterfeit watch]]es, which mimic expensive brand-name watches, constitutes an estimated {{USD|1 billion}} market per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havocscope.com/counterfeit-watches-market-value/|title=Havocscope Counterfeit Watches Market Value: $1 billion}}</ref>\n\n=== Space ===\n[[File:OMEGA-Speedmaster-Professional-Front.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Omega Speedmaster]], selected by [[NASA]] for use on space missions in the 1960s.]]\n\nThe [[Weightlessness|zero-gravity]] environment and other extreme conditions encountered by [[astronaut]]s in [[Outer space|space]] require the use of specially tested watches.\n\nThe first ever watch to be sent into space was a Russian \"[[Pobeda (watch)|Pobeda]]\" watch from the [[Petrodvorets Watch Factory]]. It was sent on a single orbit flight on the spaceship [[Korabl-Sputnik 4]] on 9 March 1961. The watch had been attached without authorisation to the wrist of Chernuchka, a dog that successfully did exactly the same trip as Yuri Gagarin, with exactly the same rocket and equipment, just a month before Gagarin's flight.<ref>{{cite book |title=Animals in Space: From Research Rockets to the Space Shuttle |edition=illustrated |first1=Colin |last1=Burgess |first2=Chris |last2=Dubbs |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-387-49678-8 |page=213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSdHVIpsrKkC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=xSdHVIpsrKkC&pg=PA213 Extract of page 213]</ref>\n\nOn 12 April 1961, [[Yuri Gagarin]] wore a Shturmanskie (a transliteration of ''\u0428\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435'' which actually means \"navigator's\") wristwatch during his historic first flight into space. The Shturmanskie was manufactured at the [[Poljot|First Moscow Factory]].

In the late 1970s, [[Poljot]] launched a new [[Chronometer watch|chrono]] movement, the 3133. With a 23 jewel movement and manual winding (43 hours), it was a modified Russian version of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Valjoux]] 7734 of the early 1970s.

These watches are sometimes called [[diving watches]] when they are suitable for [[scuba diving]] or [[saturation diving]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] issued a standard for water resistant watches which also prohibits the term \"[[waterproof]]\" to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted.\n\nWater resistance is achieved by the [[gasket]]s which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out. The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/watch_tech/waterresistance.jsp|title=Watch Industry Questions and Answers: Water-Resistance|work=Europa Star|publisher=VNU eMedia Inc|accessdate=17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nNone of the tests defined by [[ISO 2281]] for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving. Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water resistant during exercises such as swimming. They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.\n\nThe standards for diving watches are regulated by the [[ISO 6425]] international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100-metre depth rating ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met.\n\nWatches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwnz.co.nz/page/watches.aspx|title=Watches|website=Jwnz.co.nz|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Main Article [[ISO 6425#Water resistance classification|ISO 6425]]\n|-\n! nowrap=\"nowrap\" |Water-resistance rating || Suitability || Remarks\n|-\n| Water Resistant or 30&nbsp;m || Suitable for everyday use.

Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch. Some watches are rated in [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.\n\n=== Navigation ===\n{{Main|Cardinal direction#Watch dial}}\nThere is a traditional method by which an [[analog watch]] can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour [[clock face]] takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During [[daylight saving time]], the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12. This method is accurate enough to be used only at fairly high latitudes.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Technology}}\n\n{{clear}}\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute]]\n* [[Clock]]\n* [[Coin watch]]\n* [[List of most expensive watches sold at auction]]\n* [[List of watch manufacturers]]\n* [[Marine chronometer]]\n* [[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]\n* [[Smartwatch]]\n* [[Tachymeter (watch)]]\n* [[24-hour analog dial]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett, Edmund]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17576 ''A Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks, Watches and Bells''], 1903, from [[Project Gutenberg]]\n* Berner, G.A., [http://www.fhs.ch/berner/?l=en ''Illustrated Professional Dictionary of Horology''], [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry]] FH 1961\u20132012\n* Daniels, George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWq8c0xvGxsC&printsec=frontcover ''Watchmaking''], London: Philip Wilson Publishers, 1981 (reprinted 15 June 2011)\n* De Carle, Donald, (Illustrations by E.

The first thing to be improved was the [[escapement]]. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the [[Escapement#Cylinder escapement|cylinder escapement]], invented by [[Thomas Tompion]] in 1695 and further developed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] in the 1720s. Improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by [[Robert Hooke]] allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.\n\nA major cause of error in balance wheel timepieces, caused by changes in [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the [[balance spring]] from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic [[Balance wheel|temperature compensated balance wheel]] invented in 1765 by [[Pierre Le Roy]] and improved by [[Thomas Earnshaw]]. The [[lever escapement]] was the single most important technological breakthrough, and was invented by [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] in 1759 and improved by Josiah Emery in 1785, although it only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - II orologi, 1737 \u2013 BEIC 13458392.jpg|thumb|A watch drawn in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1737]]\nThe British had predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high-quality products for the elite.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVUSauNST8EC&dq=British+Watch+Company+mass+production&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Manufacturing Time: Global Competition in the Watch Industry, 1795\u20132000|author=Glasmeier, Amy|year=2000|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with [[mass production]] techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the British Watch Company in 1843, it was in the [[United States]] that this system took off.

[[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an armed watch. The oldest surviving wristwatch (then described as a bracelet watch) is one made in 1806 and given to [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]].<ref name=Bruton183>{{cite book |last=Bruton |first=Eric |date=2000 |title=The History of Clocks & Watches |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=183 |isbn=0316853550}}</ref> From the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket watches up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Evolu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=The Evolution of the Wristwatch|access-date=8 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208200615/http://vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|archive-date=8 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, when the importance of synchronizing maneuvers during war, without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signaling, was increasingly recognized. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a \"Watch Wristlet\" design in 1893, but they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> During the [[First Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin & Webb]] began production of their successful \"campaign watch\" for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at Sudan in 1898]] and accelerated production for the [[Second Boer War]] a few years later.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> In continental Europe, [[Girard-Perregaux]] and other Swiss watchmakers began supplying German naval officers with wristwatches in about 1880.<ref name=Bruton183 />\n\nEarly models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap but, by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company Dimier Fr\u00e8res & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. [[Hans Wilsdorf]] moved to London in 1905 and set up his own business, Wilsdorf & Davis, with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company later became [[Rolex]].<ref>Rolex Jubilee Vade Mecum published by the Rolex Watch Company in 1946.</ref> Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|first=John E.|last=Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. The [[War Office]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight |publisher=Hyperion Press |isbn=0-7868-8571-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wingsofmadnessal0000hoff }}</ref> By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that \"the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.\" By 1930, the ratio of a wrist to pocket watches was 50 to 1. The first successful [[self-winding watch|self-winding]] system was invented by [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923.\n\n====Quartz====\nThe commercial introduction of the [[quartz watch]] in 1969 in the form of the Omega [[Omega Electroquartz|Beta 21]] and the Seiko [[Astron (wristwatch)|Astron]] was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, they used a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]] [[resonator]] which vibrated at 8,192&nbsp;Hz, driven by a battery-powered [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]]. Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.\n\n====Hamilton Electric====\nHamilton Electric were the pioneers of the first electric watch <ref>https://wornandwound.com/hamilton-electric-the-race-to-create-the-worlds-first-battery-powered-watch/ Worlds first battery powered watch </ref> unlike the Quartz and the Bulova Accutron this was the first movement to use a battery as a source to oscillate the balance wheel. Hamilton released two models of the Electric: the first released was the Hamilton 500 on 3 January 1957, which was produced into 1959. This model had problems with the contact wires misaligning and the watch returned to Hamilton for alignment. The Hamilton 505 was an improvement on the 500 and was more reliable: the contact wires were removed and a non-adjustable contact on the balance assembly delivered the power to the balance wheel.\n\n== Movement ==\n[[File:Watch Mechanical Quartz Comparison.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of movements move the hands differently as shown in this 2-second exposure.

The movement is fitted with a cylinder escapement.]]\n\nA [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the [[watch face]] indicating the time.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\n{{Main|Mechanical watch}}\nCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, and they are sensitive to position, temperature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/temperature|title= Temperature | work = Advice on Your Timepiece |publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> and magnetism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/magnetism|title=Magnetism| work=Advice on Your Timepiece|publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> They are also costly to produce, require regular maintenance and adjustments, and are more prone to failures. Nevertheless, the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public, especially among the watch collectors. [[Skeleton watch]]es are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes.\n\nA mechanical movement uses an [[escapement]] mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release. A mechanical movement also uses a [[balance wheel]] together with the [[balance spring]] (also known as a hairspring) to control the motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the [[pendulum]] of a [[pendulum clock]]. The [[tourbillon]], an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, which is used to cancel out or reduce the effects of [[gravity|gravitational]] bias to the timekeeping. Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are very expensive, and only found in prestigious watches.\n\nThe [[pin-lever escapement]] (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, [[Georges Frederic Roskopf]]), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers as well as by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]], until it was replaced by quartz movements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |title=The original pin-pallet |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205103752/http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |title=The Roskopf Watch |publisher=Musketeer.ch |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150312/http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsr.id.au/buffat.html|title=Buffat The Roskopf watch|website=Watkinsr.id.au|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement. Introduced by [[Bulova]] in 1960, they use a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 [[hertz]]) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. [[Electric watch#Types of electric watches|Tuning-fork watches]] were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed. [[Quartz watch]]es were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate.\n\n{{Main|Mainspring}}\nTraditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a [[mainspring]] as a power source. In ''manual watches'' the spring must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown. Antique [[pocketwatch]]es were wound by inserting a separate key into a hole in the back of the watch and turning it. Most modern watches are designed to run 40&nbsp; hours on a winding and thus must be wound daily, but some run for several days and a few have 192-hour mainsprings and are wound weekly.\n\n==== Automatic watches ====\n{{Main|Automatic watch}}\n[[File:Jaeger-Lecoultre-p1000838.jpg|thumb|[[Automatic watch]]: An eccentric weight, called a rotor, swings with the movement of the wearer's body and winds the spring]]\n[[File:Seiko 5 Automatic 21 Jewels.png|thumb|upright|Seiko 5 Automatic Watch 21 Jewels]]\n\nA ''self-winding'' or ''automatic'' watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body. The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ | title=Watchmaking in Europe and China: Watches & Wonders | work=[[Richemont]] | publisher=Worldtempus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011232012/http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ |archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref> but the first \"[[self-winding watch|self-winding]]\", or \"automatic\", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.\n\nIn April 2014 the Swatch Group launched the ''sistem51'' wristwatch. It has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight. So far, it is the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/featured/exclusive-an-inside-view-of-the-eta-high-tech-swatch-sistem51-production-in-boncourt-in-the-swiss-jura/|title=EXCLUSIVE: An inside view of the ETA high-tech Swatch Sistem51 production in Boncourt in the Swiss Jura \u2013 Watch-Insider.com|date=3 December 2014|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> The low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical Swiss watch, which can be considered a successor to ''Roskopf'' movements, although of higher quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/news/swatch-sistem51-swiss-watchmaking-revolution|title=Swatch Sistem51 a Swiss-made watchmaking revolution|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronic ===\n{{See also|Electric watch|Quartz clock}}\n[[File:Csem-beta1.jpg|thumb|upright|First quartz wristwatch BETA 1 developed by CEH, Switzerland, 1967]]\nElectronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a [[quartz]] [[crystal]] which is made to vibrate by the [[piezoelectric effect]]. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an [[quartz oscillator|oscillator]]. It [[resonance|resonates]] at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.\n\nIn 1959 [[Seiko]] placed an order with Epson (a daughter company of Seiko and the 'brain' behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch. The project was codenamed 59A. By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.\n\nThe first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just ''portable'' quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192&nbsp; Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module, and an in-house-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch\u00e2tel in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Pioneering_Work_on_the_Quartz_Electronic_Wristwatch,_1962-1967 |title=Milestones:Pioneering Work on the Quartz Electronic Wristwatch, 1962\u20131967 |publisher=Ieeeghn.org |date= |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the [[Omega Electroquartz]] as well as [[Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex Oysterquartz]] and Piaget.\n\n[[File:Seiko 35A.jpg|thumb|Quartz Movement of the Seiko Astron, 1969 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2010-006)]]\n\nThe first quartz watch to enter production was the [[Seiko]] [[Astron (wristwatch)|35 SQ Astron]], which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date: the [[Omega Marine Chronometer]].

This ended\u2014in less than a decade\u2014almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy. Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements. Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day\u2014ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.<ref>Quartz mechanisms usually have a resonant frequency of 32768&nbsp; Hz, chosen for ease of use (being 2<sup>15</sup>). Using a simple 15 stage divide-by-two circuit, this is turned into a 1 pulse per second signal responsible for the watch's timekeeping.</ref>\n\nAfter a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the [[Swatch Group]] of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products. For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture [[Watch battery|watch batteries]] (Renata), oscillators ([[Oscilloquartz]], now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed [[EM Microelectronic-Marin]]). The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design, and marketing. Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company.\n\n[[Seiko]]'s efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the [[Seiko]] [[Spring Drive]], first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.\n\nIn 2010, Miyota ([[Citizen Watch]]) of [[Japan]] introduced a newly developed movement that uses a 3-pronged quartz crystal that was exclusively produced for [[Bulova]] to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144&nbsp;kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/\u2212 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/23/bulova-introduces-the-most-accurate-watch-in-the-world-the-precisionist/ |title=Bulova introduces the most accurate watch in the world, the Precisionist |publisher=Crunch gear |date = 23 March 2010 |accessdate= 8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nRadio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch which synchronizes ([[time transfer]]s) its time with an external [[Time signal#Radio time signals|time source]] such as in [[atomic clock]]s, time signals from [[GPS]] navigation satellites, the German [[DCF77]] signal in Europe, [[WWVB]] in the US, and others. Movements of this type may\u2014among others\u2014synchronize the time of day and the date, the [[leap year|leap-year]] status and the state of [[daylight saving time]] (on or off). However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.\n\nElectronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a replaceable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].\n\nWatch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement. Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some [[solar-powered watch]]es.\n\nSome electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer. For instance, Seiko's [[Automatic quartz|kinetic-powered quartz watches]] use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny [[Electrical generator|generator]] to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.\n\n[[Solar powered watch]]es are powered by light. A [[photovoltaic cell]] on the face ([[dial (measurement)|dial]]) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a [[rechargeable battery]] or [[capacitor]]. The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor. As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs a battery replacement. Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen [[Eco-Drive]]). Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko, and Citizen). As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soluhr.com/|title=History of the Solar Wristwatch|work=Soluhr.com|accessdate=17 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141728/http://www.soluhr.com/|archive-date=12 August 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the [[Citizen Watch Co., Ltd|Citizen]] [[Eco-Drive]] Thermo).\n\n== Display ==\n=== Analog ===\n[[File:Poljot-Aviator-3133.jpg|thumb|[[Poljot]] [[chronograph]]]]\n[[File:Casio AE12.jpg|alt=Casio AE12|thumb|Casio AE12 LCA (liquid-crystal-analog) watch]]\nTraditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker. Watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand, although it is actually not gliding; the hand merely moves in smaller steps, typically 1/5 of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. In some escapements (for example the ''duplex'' escapement), the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically 1/2-second in those watches, or even every four beats (two periods, 1 second), in the ''double duplex'' escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the ''tri-synchro regulator'' of [[Spring Drive]] watches. All of the hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with \"hands\" that are simulated by a [[liquid crystal display|liquid-crystal display]].\n\nAnalog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.\n\nAnalog watches, as well as clocks, are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on the upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/business/media/28adco.html|title=Why Time Stands Still for Watchmakers|work=New York Times|accessdate=28 November 2008|date=28 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Ten Ten Tenet|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/market/clockhands.asp|work=Snopes.com|publisher=Barbara and David P.

This was only sold for a few years, as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production.\n\nMost watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously. Usually, the LED display color would be red. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness would a button need to be pressed to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.<ref>{{US Patent|4096550}}: W. Boller, M. Donati, J. Fingerle, P.

In 1985, Casio produced the CFX-400 scientific calculator watch. In 1987 Casio produced a watch that could dial telephone numbers and Citizen revealed one that would react to voice. In 1995 Timex released a watch which allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist. Some watches, such as the [[Timex Datalink#Timex Datalink USB|Timex Datalink USB]], feature [[dot matrix]] displays. Since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad, digital watches have mostly become simpler, less expensive timepieces with little variety between models.\n\n<gallery widths=\"270px\" heights=\"270px\">\nFile:Jumphour.jpg|[[Cort\u00e9bert (watch manufacturer)|''Cort\u00e9bert'']] digital mechanical pocket watch (1890s)\nFile:Cortjump1.jpg|''Cort\u00e9bert'' digital mechanical wristwatch (1920s)\nFile:PulsarLED.jpg|A silver Pulsar [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] watch from 1976.\nFile:Timex T5E901 Ironman Triathlon 30 Lap FLIX.jpg|A [[Timex Group|Timex]] digital watch with an always-on display of the time and date\n</gallery>\n\n=== Illuminated ===\n{{more citations needed|subsection|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Tritium-watch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An illuminated watch face, using tritium]]\nMany watches have displays that are illuminated, so they can be used in darkness. Various methods have been used to achieve this.\n\nMechanical watches often have [[luminous paint]] on their hands and hour marks. In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light. [[Radium]] was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan's Vintage Watches|url=http://alanwatch.homestead.com/page9.html|publisher=Radium Watch Dial Pattern|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> [[Tritium]] was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass. However, tritium is expensive\u2014it has to be made in a [[nuclear reactor]]\u2014and it has a [[half-life]] of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years. Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (See [[Tritium illumination]]). For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it. This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.\n\nWatches that incorporate batteries often have the electric illumination of their displays. However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements. To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button. Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.\n\n[[File:Backlit LCD display.jpg|thumbnail|Views of a [[liquid crystal display]], both with [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] backlight switched on (top) and switched off (bottom)]]\n[[File:Casio LCD Watch F-E10.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail| Digital LCD wristwatch Casio type F-E10 with electroluminescent backlighting.]]\nIn some early digital watches, [[LED]] displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight. The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.\n\nIn some types of watches, small [[incandescent]] lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination. Incandescent lamps are very wasteful of electricity.\n\nOther watches use [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.\n\n== Speech synthesis ==\n[[Speech synthesis|Talking]] watches are available, intended for the [[Visual impairment|blind or visually impaired]]. They speak the time out loud at the press of a button. This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting the non-[[deaf]] that the wearer is checking the time. Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.\n\n==Handedness==\nWristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch so it can be worn of the left wrist for a right-handed individual. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Some manufacturers offer \"left-hand drive\", aka \"destro\", configured watches which move the crown to the left side<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/a-guide-to-destro-watches-from-sinn-muhle-citizen-and-more/|title=A Guide to \"Destro\": Watches from Sinn, M\u00fchle, Citizen, and More - Worn & Wound|date=10 May 2016|website=Wornandwound.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> making wearing the watch easier for left-handed individuals.\n\nA rarer configuration is the bullhead watch. Bullhead watches are generally, but not exclusively, [[chronograph]]s. The configuration moves the crown and chronograph pushers to the top of the watch. Bullheads are commonly wristwatch chronographs that are intended to be used as stopwatches off the wrist. Examples are the Citizen Bullhead Change Timer<ref>CITIZEN \"BULLHEAD\" CHALLENGE TIMER</ref> and the Omega Seamaster Bullhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-omega-seamaster-bullhead-live-pics-pricing|title=Hands-On: With The Omega Seamaster Bullhead (Live Pics + Pricing)|website=Hodinkee.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDigital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments. These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Rolex-Submariner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Rolex]] Submariner, an officially certified chronometer]]\n[[File:Breguet MG 2573.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]] squelette watch 2933 with [[tourbillon]]]]\n[[File:Patek-Philippe MG 2583.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Perpetual calendar and moonphase wristwatch by [[Patek Philippe]]]]\nCustomarily, watches provide the [[time of day]], giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second. Many also provide the current date, and some (called \"complete calendar\" or \"triple date\" watches) display the day of the week and the month as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include [[alarm]]s. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate [[Striking clock|striking mechanisms]] or [[Repeater (horology)|repeater]] functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary [[Clock|timepieces]]. This feature is available on most digital watches.\n\nA ''complicated watch'' has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a [[Complication (horology)|complication]]. Two popular complications are the '''[[chronograph]]''' complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a [[stopwatch]], and the '''moonphase''' complication, which is a display of the [[lunar phase]]. Other more expensive complications include [[Tourbillon]], [[Perpetual calendar]], [[Minute repeater]], and [[Equation of time]]. A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see [[Calibre 89]] from [[Patek Philippe]] for instance). Some watches can both indicate the [[Qibla compass|direction of Mecca]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Muslim watches |url=http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |publisher=Watchismo |accessdate=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928004218/http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |archivedate=28 September 2015 }}</ref> and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islamic Watch & Clock|url=http://www.alfajr.com|publisher=ALFAJR|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Among watch enthusiasts, complicated watches are especially collectible. Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for [[UTC]] or [[GMT]].\n\nThe similar-sounding terms '''chronograph''' and '''chronometer''' are often confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a [[stopwatch]] complication (as explained above), while a [[chronometer watch]] is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the [[COSC]] (Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\u00e8tres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.\n\n[[File:Datalink USB Dress Edition.JPG|thumb|upright|Timex Datalink USB Dress edition from 2003 with a dot matrix display; the ''Invasion'' video game is on the screen]]\n\nMany computerized wristwatches have been developed, but none have had long-term sales success, because they have awkward [[user interface]]s due to the tiny screens and buttons, and short battery life. As miniaturized electronics became cheaper, watches have been developed containing [[calculator watch|calculators]], [[tonometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, a [[compass]] using both hands to show the N/S direction, [[video game]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[keydrive]]s, [[GPS watch|GPS receivers]] and [[cellular phone]]s. A few [[Astronomical clock#Watches|astronomical watches]] show [[phase of the Moon]] and other celestial phenomena. In the early 1980s [[Seiko]] marketed a watch with a television in it. Such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly [[geek]] toys. Several companies have however attempted to develop a [[computer]] contained in a wristwatch (see also [[wearable computer]]).\n\nElectronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or [[Activity tracker|activity tracking]], address the general [[Physical fitness|fitness]] market and have the potential for commercial success ([[Garmin forerunner]], Garmin Vivofit, Epson,<ref name=\"Epson\" /> announced model of [[Swatch]] Touch series<ref>Hug, Daniel : ''Swatch lanciert 2015 eine intelligente Uhr.''

Some dress watches have a [[cabochon]] on the crown or [[facet]]ed [[gemstone]]s on the face, [[bezel setting|bezel]], or bracelet. Some are made entirely of faceted [[sapphire]] ([[corundum]]).\n\nMany fashions and [[department store]]s offer a variety of less-expensive, trendy, \"[[costume jewelry|costume]]\" watches (usually for women), many of which are similar in quality to basic quartz timepieces but which feature bolder designs. In the 1980s, the Swiss [[Swatch]] company hired graphic designers to redesign a new annual collection of non-repairable watches.\n\nTrade in [[counterfeit watch]]es, which mimic expensive brand-name watches, constitutes an estimated {{USD|1 billion}} market per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havocscope.com/counterfeit-watches-market-value/|title=Havocscope Counterfeit Watches Market Value: $1 billion}}</ref>\n\n=== Space ===\n[[File:OMEGA-Speedmaster-Professional-Front.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Omega Speedmaster]], selected by [[NASA]] for use on space missions in the 1960s.]]\n\nThe [[Weightlessness|zero-gravity]] environment and other extreme conditions encountered by [[astronaut]]s in [[Outer space|space]] require the use of specially tested watches.\n\nThe first ever watch to be sent into space was a Russian \"[[Pobeda (watch)|Pobeda]]\" watch from the [[Petrodvorets Watch Factory]].

The [[Omega Speedmaster]] Professional was selected by NASA, the U.S space agency, and it is mostly known thanks to astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] who wore it during the moon landing, 1969. [[TAG Heuer|Heuer]] became the first Swiss watch in space thanks to a Heuer Stopwatch, worn by [[John Glenn]] in 1962 when he piloted the [[Friendship 7]] on the first manned U.S. orbital mission. The [[Breitling SA|Breitling]] Navitimer Cosmonaute was designed with a [[24-hour analog dial]] to avoid confusion between AM and PM, which are meaningless in space. It was first worn in space by U.S. astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]] on 24 May 1962 in the [[Aurora 7]] mercury capsule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breitling.com/en/models/navitimer/cosmonaute/|title=Navitimer, the aviator favourite watch|work=[[Breitling SA|Breitling]]|accessdate=17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nSince 1994 [[Fortis Uhren AG|Fortis]] is the exclusive supplier for manned space missions authorized by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]].

These watches are sometimes called [[diving watches]] when they are suitable for [[scuba diving]] or [[saturation diving]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] issued a standard for water resistant watches which also prohibits the term \"[[waterproof]]\" to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted.\n\nWater resistance is achieved by the [[gasket]]s which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out. The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/watch_tech/waterresistance.jsp|title=Watch Industry Questions and Answers: Water-Resistance|work=Europa Star|publisher=VNU eMedia Inc|accessdate=17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nNone of the tests defined by [[ISO 2281]] for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving. Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water resistant during exercises such as swimming. They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.\n\nThe standards for diving watches are regulated by the [[ISO 6425]] international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100-metre depth rating ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met.\n\nWatches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwnz.co.nz/page/watches.aspx|title=Watches|website=Jwnz.co.nz|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Main Article [[ISO 6425#Water resistance classification|ISO 6425]]\n|-\n! nowrap=\"nowrap\" |Water-resistance rating || Suitability || Remarks\n|-\n| Water Resistant or 30&nbsp;m || Suitable for everyday use.

Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch. Some watches are rated in [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.\n\n=== Navigation ===\n{{Main|Cardinal direction#Watch dial}}\nThere is a traditional method by which an [[analog watch]] can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour [[clock face]] takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During [[daylight saving time]], the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12. This method is accurate enough to be used only at fairly high latitudes.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Technology}}\n\n{{clear}}\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute]]\n* [[Clock]]\n* [[Coin watch]]\n* [[List of most expensive watches sold at auction]]\n* [[List of watch manufacturers]]\n* [[Marine chronometer]]\n* [[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]\n* [[Smartwatch]]\n* [[Tachymeter (watch)]]\n* [[24-hour analog dial]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett, Edmund]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17576 ''A Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks, Watches and Bells''], 1903, from [[Project Gutenberg]]\n* Berner, G.A., [http://www.fhs.ch/berner/?l=en ''Illustrated Professional Dictionary of Horology''], [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry]] FH 1961\u20132012\n* Daniels, George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWq8c0xvGxsC&printsec=frontcover ''Watchmaking''], London: Philip Wilson Publishers, 1981 (reprinted 15 June 2011)\n* De Carle, Donald, (Illustrations by E.

One of the mausoleums outside the town contains the tomb of Sheikh [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa'di]], the first poet of his time. Close at hand is a hermitage built by Sa'di himself, surrounded by a charming garden. It is situated near the source of the Ruknabad. In the garden Sheikh Sa'di constructed a number of basins for the washing of clothes. The citizens of Shiraz make parties of pleasure to this mausoleum; they eat food prepared in the hermitage, wash their garments in the river, and at sunset return to the town. So did I also. May God have mercy on Shiraz!\"\n\n==Edward Granville Browne==\n[[Edward Granville Browne]], later to become author of the well-known ''A Literary History of Persia'', visited Shiraz as a young man in March 1888, and recorded his impressions of the Roknabad stream as he approached the city from the north as follows:<ref>Browne, E. G. (1893/1926) ''A Year Amongst the Persians'' (Cambridge), p. 282.</ref>\n\n:\"Beyond this there was little to attract my interest till, about 1.30, on surmounting another pass, \u1e24\u00e1j\u00ed \u1e62afar cried out \"''Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d! Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d!''&thinsp;\" and, with a thrill of pleasure, I found myself at the source of that stream, so dear to every Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, of which \u1e24\u00e1fi\u1e93 declared, in perhaps the best known of his poems, that Paradise itself could not boast the like. \n\n:\"But for the rich associations which the sight of it evoked in my mind, I might perhaps have experienced that sense of disappointment with which [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry|V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]] declares he was affected by the first view of this classic stream. As it was, I saw nothing but the limpid water rushing from its rocky source; heard nothing but its melodious ripple; thought nothing but those thoughts which rise in the mind of one who first stands in the favourite haunt of an immortal bard who immortalises all that he touches.\"\n\n==Herman Bicknell==\nThe linguist and traveller Herman Bicknell, who spent several months in Shiraz in 1869, writes: \"The ruined mosque of Musall\u00e1, and the brook of Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d about four feet wide, are a mile to the North of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. The water of this streamlet, derived from a spring in the pass of All\u00e2hu Akbar, has been made to branch into two principal channels, one South-eastward, the other South-westward, to irrigate various sown fields and gardens, among the latter the H\u00e1fiz\u00edah, part of which is a cemetery, and contains the poet's tomb.\"<ref>Bicknell, Herman (1875).

One of the mausoleums outside the town contains the tomb of Sheikh [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa'di]], the first poet of his time. Close at hand is a hermitage built by Sa'di himself, surrounded by a charming garden. It is situated near the source of the Ruknabad. In the garden Sheikh Sa'di constructed a number of basins for the washing of clothes. The citizens of Shiraz make parties of pleasure to this mausoleum; they eat food prepared in the hermitage, wash their garments in the river, and at sunset return to the town. So did I also. May God have mercy on Shiraz!\"\n\n==Edward Granville Browne==\n[[Edward Granville Browne]], later to become author of the well-known ''A Literary History of Persia'', visited Shiraz as a young man in March 1888, and recorded his impressions of the Roknabad stream as he approached the city from the north as follows:<ref>Browne, E. G. (1893/1926) ''A Year Amongst the Persians'' (Cambridge), p. 282.</ref>\n\n:\"Beyond this there was little to attract my interest till, about 1.30, on surmounting another pass, \u1e24\u00e1j\u00ed \u1e62afar cried out \"''Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d! Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d!''&thinsp;\" and, with a thrill of pleasure, I found myself at the source of that stream, so dear to every Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, of which \u1e24\u00e1fi\u1e93 declared, in perhaps the best known of his poems, that Paradise itself could not boast the like. \n\n:\"But for the rich associations which the sight of it evoked in my mind, I might perhaps have experienced that sense of disappointment with which [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry|V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]] declares he was affected by the first view of this classic stream. As it was, I saw nothing but the limpid water rushing from its rocky source; heard nothing but its melodious ripple; thought nothing but those thoughts which rise in the mind of one who first stands in the favourite haunt of an immortal bard who immortalises all that he touches.\"\n\n==Herman Bicknell==\nThe linguist and traveller Herman Bicknell, who spent several months in Shiraz in 1869, writes: \"The ruined mosque of Musall\u00e1, and the brook of Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d about four feet wide, are a mile to the North of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. The water of this streamlet, derived from a spring in the pass of All\u00e2hu Akbar, has been made to branch into two principal channels, one South-eastward, the other South-westward, to irrigate various sown fields and gardens, among the latter the H\u00e1fiz\u00edah, part of which is a cemetery, and contains the poet's tomb.\"<ref>Bicknell, Herman (1875).
