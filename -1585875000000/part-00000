For example, rear-view mirrors are [[symmetrical]] and can be used on either side of the car, the [[windshield]] is flatter than usual, and the [[dashboard]] is a single [[injection molding|injection-molded]] piece.\n\nThe developers have taken into account several differences between road and climate conditions in developed and developing countries. The Logan suspension is soft and strong, and the chassis sits visibly higher than most other [[compact car]]s to help it negotiate dirt roads and potholes on ill-maintained asphalt roads. The engine is specially prepared to handle lower quality fuel, whereas the air conditioning is powerful enough to lower the temperature several degrees (temperatures above 40&nbsp;\u00b0C are common in the Middle East and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]).\n\n===Trim levels===\nIn Romania, it was initially available in four trim levels: Ambiance, Preference, Laureate and Ambition.

This makes the car cheaper to produce and easier and cheaper to repair.\n\nSome parts are also much simpler than those of its competitors. For example, rear-view mirrors are [[symmetrical]] and can be used on either side of the car, the [[windshield]] is flatter than usual, and the [[dashboard]] is a single [[injection molding|injection-molded]] piece.\n\nThe developers have taken into account several differences between road and climate conditions in developed and developing countries. The Logan suspension is soft and strong, and the chassis sits visibly higher than most other [[compact car]]s to help it negotiate dirt roads and potholes on ill-maintained asphalt roads. The engine is specially prepared to handle lower quality fuel, whereas the air conditioning is powerful enough to lower the temperature several degrees (temperatures above 40&nbsp;\u00b0C are common in the Middle East and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]).\n\n===Trim levels===\nIn Romania, it was initially available in four trim levels: Ambiance, Preference, Laureate and Ambition.

The second trim level, Preference, added a passenger airbag, power steering, electric front windows, a radio, two rear seat head restraints and remote locking.
