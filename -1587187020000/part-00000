Some students cited his case as an example of the university's inability to fully meet its students' financial need.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news | first = Karen W. | last = Arenson | work = [[The New York Times]] | title =  Yes, Some Students Live in the Library (But Not Like This) | date = April 27, 2004 | accessdate = August 22, 2012 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/nyregion/yes-some-students-live-in-the-library-but-not-like-this.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm }}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes2\">{{cite news | first = Karen W. | last = Arenson | work = [[The New York Times]] | title = Page Two: April 25\u2013May 1; Reading Oneself to Sleep | date = May 2, 2004 | accessdate = August 22, 2012 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EED8123DF931A35756C0A9629C8B63}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nIn 2016, several student organizations sent a list of demands to the NYU Board of Trustees.

Each release was given a new version number and a [[code name]], using a female first name starting with the letter whose alphabetical index corresponds to the version number and ending with the letter \"a\" (e.g., \"Elyssa\" for version 5, \"Felicia\" for version 6).  There is also an OEM version for ease of installation for hardware manufacturers.<ref name=\"LM-Download-Official\">{{cite web |url=https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php |title=Download \u2013 Linux Mint |publisher=linuxmint.com |accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nReleases are timed to be approximately one month after [[Ubuntu (Operating System)|Ubuntu]] releases (which in turn are about one month after [[GNOME|Gnome]] releases and two months after [[X Window System]] releases). Consequently, every Linux Mint release comes with an updated version of both GNOME and X and features some of the improvements brought in the latest Ubuntu release. Support for most releases is discontinued two months after the next release, but since the mid-2008 v5 every fourth release has been labelled a [[long-term support]] (LTS) version, indicating that it is supported (with updates) for longer, three years for v5 and v9, and five years thereafter.\n\nLinux Mint 17 \"Qiana\" LTS was released on 31 May 2014, remaining current until the end of November 2014 and supported until April 2019.<ref name=\"LM-Download-Official\"/> In mid-2014 the successor to 17 Qiana was announced to be 17.1 Rebecca; the development team said that from a technical point of view Linux Mint was no longer tied to the Ubuntu schedule, so it could be released at any time, although the six-month cycle provided rhythm, leading to a late November 2014 target.<ref name=v17_1/> Linux Mint 17 LTS would be the first release of the 17.x series, and for two years applications would be backported to 17.x, with security updates until 2019.<ref name=v17_1/>\n\nThe latest release is Linux Mint 19.3 \"Tricia\", released on 18 December 2019. As an LTS release, it will be supported until 2023.<ref name=\"Tricia\">{{cite web |title=Linux Mint 19.3 \u201cTricia\u201d Xfce released! |url=https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3834 |website=The Linux Mint Blog |accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref> \n\n[[Linux Mint Debian Edition#LMDE|Linux Mint Debian Edition]], not compatible with Ubuntu,<ref name=\"LM-Download-LMDE\">{{cite web |url=https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php |title=Download LMDE |publisher=linuxmint.com |accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref> is based on [[Debian]] and updates are brought in continuously between major versions (of LMDE).\n\n==Release history==\n<!-- Template:Version - for version & release history.

Each release was given a new version number and a [[code name]], using a female first name starting with the letter whose alphabetical index corresponds to the version number and ending with the letter \"a\" (e.g., \"Elyssa\" for version 5, \"Felicia\" for version 6).  There is also an OEM version for ease of installation for hardware manufacturers.<ref name=\"LM-Download-Official\">{{cite web |url=https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php |title=Download \u2013 Linux Mint |publisher=linuxmint.com |accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nReleases are timed to be approximately one month after [[Ubuntu (Operating System)|Ubuntu]] releases (which in turn are about one month after [[GNOME|Gnome]] releases and two months after [[X Window System]] releases). Consequently, every Linux Mint release comes with an updated version of both GNOME and X and features some of the improvements brought in the latest Ubuntu release. Support for most releases is discontinued two months after the next release, but since the mid-2008 v5 every fourth release has been labelled a [[long-term support]] (LTS) version, indicating that it is supported (with updates) for longer, three years for v5 and v9, and five years thereafter.\n\nLinux Mint 17 \"Qiana\" LTS was released on 31 May 2014, remaining current until the end of November 2014 and supported until April 2019.<ref name=\"LM-Download-Official\"/> In mid-2014 the successor to 17 Qiana was announced to be 17.1 Rebecca; the development team said that from a technical point of view Linux Mint was no longer tied to the Ubuntu schedule, so it could be released at any time, although the six-month cycle provided rhythm, leading to a late November 2014 target.<ref name=v17_1/> Linux Mint 17 LTS would be the first release of the 17.x series, and for two years applications would be backported to 17.x, with security updates until 2019.<ref name=v17_1/>\n\nThe latest release is Linux Mint 19.3 \"Tricia\", released on 18 December 2019. As an LTS release, it will be supported until 2023.<ref name=\"Tricia\">{{cite web |title=Linux Mint 19.3 \u201cTricia\u201d Xfce released! |url=https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3834 |website=The Linux Mint Blog |accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref> \n\n[[Linux Mint Debian Edition#LMDE|Linux Mint Debian Edition]], not compatible with Ubuntu,<ref name=\"LM-Download-LMDE\">{{cite web |url=https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php |title=Download LMDE |publisher=linuxmint.com |accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref> is based on [[Debian]] and updates are brought in continuously.\n\n==Release history==\n<!-- Template:Version - for version & release history.

During the 1980s and 1990s, he was considered one of the best acoustic guitar players in the world and played with many famous artists, such as [[Tom Jobim]], [[Ney Matogrosso]], [[Paulo Moura]], and [[Paco de Lucia]].<ref name=\"neder\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p116465|pure_url=yes}}|title=Raphael Rabello: Biography|last=Neder|first=Alvaro|work=Allmusic|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nRaphael Rabello was born in [[Petr\u00f3polis]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. He was the youngest child of his family, which included many musicians. His sister [[Luciana Rabello|Luciana]] was a well-known [[cavaquinho]] player and his other sister, [[Am\u00e9lia Rabello|Am\u00e9lia]], became a singer. His first guitar teacher was an older brother, Ruy Fabiano, when Raphael Rabello was seven years old. However, the biggest influence on Rabello starting his music studies was his grandfather, Jos\u00e9 de Queiroz Baptista, who was a [[choro]] guitar player.<ref name=\"cravoalbin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/raphael-rabello/biografia|title=Raphael Rabello: Biografia|work=Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira|language=Portuguese|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe studied music theory with Maria Alice Salles, who also taught his brothers and sisters. In the 1970s, he took guitar lessons with Jaime Florence, the famous Meira, who had also taught [[Baden Powell de Aquino|Baden Powell]] in the 1940s. In the same period, he studied harmony with Ian Guest.<ref name=\"cravoalbin\"/> Influenced by [[Dino 7 Cordas]], Rabello eventually switched to the [[Seven-string guitar#The Brazilian guitar|Brazilian seven-string guitar]] and started playing professionally when he was a teenager.<ref name=\"neder\"/><ref name=\"gsp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gspguitar.com/jsp2/detailArtist.jsp?id=42|title=Rabello, Raphael|work=GSP|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Early musical career===\nHis first recording as a sideman was at age 14 on a recording of [[choro]] music by classical guitarist [[Turibio Santos]]. In this period, he took lessons from guitarist Dino 7 Cordas (Dino 7 strings), with whom he recorded an LP in 1991.<ref name=\"cliquemusic\">{{cite web|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/artistas/ver/raphael-rabello|title=Raphael Rabello|work=Cliquemusic|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, he founded the group Os Carioquinhas, with his sister Luciana Rabello (cavaquinho), Paulo Alves (mandolin), T\u00e9o (acoustic guitar) and Mario Flor\u00eancio (tambourine). The band became famous and played with many other choro groups, such as [[\u00c9poca de Ouro]] and [[Quinteto Villa-Lobos]].

In this same period, he started his career as an arranger, working for the group Galo Preto.<ref name=\"cravoalbin1\"/>\n\n===Later career and success===\nHis most productive years spanned 1982 to 1995. He was considered by many to be one of the finest guitarists of his generation. He played in many different styles, but specialized in [[choro]]. His first album was released in 1982 and, influenced by Dino 7 Cordas, Rabello adopted the name 'Raphael 7 Cordas', which was also the name of his first record. However, he did not use this nickname for very long.<ref name=\"cliquemusic\"/>\n\nThroughout his career, Rabello recorded 16 albums, some of them in collaboration with other artists, such as Dino 7 Cordas, [[Elizeth Cardoso]] and [[Paulo Moura]]. He also participated on about 600 albums, recording in Brazil and abroad.<ref name=\"acari\"/> He participated in concerts and recordings with a number of well-known Brazilian musicians, such as [[Tom Jobim]], [[Ney Matogrosso]], [[Jaques Morelenbaum]] and Paulo Moura, as well as international players, such as [[Paco de Lucia]].<ref name=\"neder\"/>\n\nRabello also became famous abroad. He performed shows in Italy, Switzerland, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Portugal, France, Canada and the United States. In 1994, he moved to the U.S. and met [[Laurindo Almeida]], who helped to spread his work around the world. There, he also gave guitar lessons in Los Angeles. At the end of the same year, he returned to Brazil to participate in the project \"Orgulho do Brasil\", which had the goal of recording songs composed by the most notable artists of that country. In this project, he recorded a tribute to [[Capiba]], which was released in 2002.<ref name=\"cravoalbin1\"/>\n\n===Final years===\nIn 1989, Rabello was involved in a car accident and suffered multiple fractures in his right arm. After a delicate surgery, he recovered and continued to play months later. However, during the surgery, he contracted HIV in a blood transfusion. Hopeless, he became addicted to alcohol and drugs. On April 27, 1995, Rafael Rabello died of [[cardiac dysrhythmia]] followed by [[respiratory arrest]].<ref name=\"veja\">{{cite journal|date=3 May 1995|title=Talento e drama|journal=Veja|publisher=Abril|location=Brazil|issue=1390|pages=107|language=Portuguese|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/acervodigital/home.aspx?edicao=1390&pg=107|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nRabello has had two full-length CDs released posthumously and a choro school was named after him.\n\nHis latest posthumous release is the project he was working on when he died: a tribute to Louren\u00e7o da Fonseca Barbosa, known as Capiba (1904\u20131997).

1995) was a virtuoso Brazilian guitarist and composer. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was considered one of the best acoustic guitar players in the world and played with many famous artists, such as [[Tom Jobim]], [[Ney Matogrosso]], [[Paulo Moura]], and [[Paco de Lucia]].<ref name=\"neder\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p116465|pure_url=yes}}|title=Raphael Rabello: Biography|last=Neder|first=Alvaro|work=Allmusic|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nRaphael Rabello was born in [[Petr\u00f3polis]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. He was the youngest child of his family, which included many musicians. His sister [[Luciana Rabello|Luciana]] was a well-known [[cavaquinho]] player and his other sister, [[Am\u00e9lia Rabello|Am\u00e9lia]], became a singer. His first guitar teacher was an older brother, Ruy Fabiano, when Raphael Rabello was seven years old. However, the biggest influence on Rabello starting his music studies was his grandfather, Jos\u00e9 de Queiroz Baptista, who was a [[choro]] guitar player.<ref name=\"cravoalbin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/raphael-rabello/biografia|title=Raphael Rabello: Biografia|work=Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira|language=Portuguese|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe studied music theory with Maria Alice Salles, who also taught his brothers and sisters. In the 1970s, he took guitar lessons with Jaime Florence, the famous Meira, who had also taught [[Baden Powell de Aquino|Baden Powell]] in the 1940s. In the same period, he studied harmony with Ian Guest.<ref name=\"cravoalbin\"/> Influenced by [[Dino 7 Cordas]], Rabello eventually switched to the [[Seven-string guitar#The Brazilian guitar|Brazilian seven-string guitar]] and started playing professionally when he was a teenager.<ref name=\"neder\"/><ref name=\"gsp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gspguitar.com/jsp2/detailArtist.jsp?id=42|title=Rabello, Raphael|work=GSP|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Early musical career===\nHis first recording as a sideman was at age 14 on a recording of [[choro]] music by classical guitarist [[Turibio Santos]]. In this period, he took lessons from guitarist Dino 7 Cordas (Dino 7 strings), with whom he recorded an LP in 1991.<ref name=\"cliquemusic\">{{cite web|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/artistas/ver/raphael-rabello|title=Raphael Rabello|work=Cliquemusic|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, he founded the group Os Carioquinhas, with his sister Luciana Rabello (cavaquinho), Paulo Alves (mandolin), T\u00e9o (acoustic guitar) and Mario Flor\u00eancio (tambourine). The band became famous and played with many other choro groups, such as [[\u00c9poca de Ouro]] and [[Quinteto Villa-Lobos]]. They also recorded one album in 1977.<ref name=\"cravoalbin1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/raphael-rabello/dados-artisticos|title=Raphael Rabelo: Dados art\u00edsticos|work=Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Rabello became a member of Camerata Carioca.

In this same period, he started his career as an arranger, working for the group Galo Preto.<ref name=\"cravoalbin1\"/>\n\n===Later career and success===\nHis most productive years spanned 1982 to 1995. He was considered by many to be one of the finest guitarists of his generation. He played in many different styles, but specialized in [[choro]]. His first album was released in 1982 and, influenced by Dino 7 Cordas, Rabello adopted the name 'Raphael 7 Cordas', which was also the name of his first record. However, he did not use this nickname for very long.<ref name=\"cliquemusic\"/>\n\nThroughout his career, Rabello recorded 16 albums, some of them in collaboration with other artists, such as Dino 7 Cordas, [[Elizeth Cardoso]] and [[Paulo Moura]]. He also participated on about 600 albums, recording in Brazil and abroad.<ref name=\"acari\"/> He participated in concerts and recordings with a number of well-known Brazilian musicians, such as [[Tom Jobim]], [[Ney Matogrosso]], [[Jaques Morelenbaum]] and Paulo Moura, as well as international players, such as [[Paco de Lucia]].<ref name=\"neder\"/>\n\nRabello also became famous abroad. He performed shows in Italy, Switzerland, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Portugal, France, Canada and the United States. In 1994, he moved to the U.S. and met [[Laurindo Almeida]], who helped to spread his work around the world. There, he also gave guitar lessons in Los Angeles. At the end of the same year, he returned to Brazil to participate in the project \"Orgulho do Brasil\", which had the goal of recording songs composed by the most notable artists of that country. In this project, he recorded a tribute to [[Capiba]], which was released in 2002.<ref name=\"cravoalbin1\"/>\n\n===Final years===\nIn 1989, Rabello was involved in a car accident and suffered multiple fractures in his right arm. After a delicate surgery, he recovered and continued to play months later. However, during the surgery, he contracted HIV in a blood transfusion. Hopeless, he became addicted to alcohol and drugs. On April 27, 1995, Rafael Rabello died of [[cardiac dysrhythmia]] followed by [[respiratory arrest]].<ref name=\"veja\">{{cite journal|date=3 May 1995|title=Talento e drama|journal=Veja|publisher=Abril|location=Brazil|issue=1390|pages=107|language=Portuguese|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/acervodigital/home.aspx?edicao=1390&pg=107|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nRabello has had two full-length CDs released posthumously and a choro school was named after him.\n\nHis latest posthumous release is the project he was working on when he died: a tribute to Louren\u00e7o da Fonseca Barbosa, known as Capiba (1904\u20131997).

He believed that habitual consumption of soft \"pappy\" foods and \"pultaceous puddings\" caused undersized jaws and dental disease.<ref name=\"Anthropology Today\"/> He recommended a pre-agricultural diet that consisted of [[animal product]]s and raw vegetables. He wrote that the \"British diet errs mainly in containing an excess of cereals and starchy foods generally, and a dearth of animal and raw vegetable foods.\"<ref name=\"Campbell 1936\">Campbell, Harry. (1936). ''Introduction''. In ''What Is Wrong with British Diet? Being an Exposition of the Factors Responsible for the Undersized Jaws and Appalling Prevalence of Dental Disease Among British Peoples''. London: William Heinemann.</ref>\nDr. Campbell wrote several medical research papers on mastication and the physiology of the jaw bones, jaw muscles and teeth formation in children and this is reflected in the series published in The Lancet, Observations on Mastication I-III <ref>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)50996-4/fulltext</ref> in 1903. Here he examined the requirement for mastication in the development of the jaw in children. He was one of the first to make the link between a lack of chewing on tough foods during the formative \"first\" [[teething]] years of 6 months to 3 years leading to narrower jaws and compacted teeth - a phenomenon seen today with the higher prevalence of orthodontistry work (braces & teeth straightening) in teenage children.  His research work in this area took him down the path of establishing a business in 1925, after he retired from the medical profession, manufacturing natural teething biscuits which he called Bickiepegs in [[Welwyn Garden City]]. Made from cereal wheat the finger shaped product was designed to help babies cut the back and front teeth whilst exercising the jaw muscles, bones and gums.

Being an Exposition of the Factors Responsible for the Undersized Jaws and Appalling Prevalence of Dental Disease Among British Peoples''. London: William Heinemann.</ref>\nDr. Campbell wrote several medical research papers on mastication and the physiology of the jaw bones, jaw muscles and teeth formation in children and this is reflected in the series published in The Lancet, Observations on Mastication I-III <ref>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)50996-4/fulltext</ref> in 1903. Here he examined the requirement for mastication in the development of the jaw in children. He was one of the first to make the link between a lack of chewing on tough foods during the formative \"first\" [[teething]] years of 6 months to 3 years leading to narrower jaws and compacted teeth - a phenomenon seen today with the higher prevalence of orthodontistry work (braces & teeth straightening) in teenage children.  His research work in this area took him down the path of establishing a business in 1925, after he retired from the medical profession, manufacturing natural teething biscuits which he called Bickiepegs in [[Welwyn Garden City]]. Made from cereal wheat the finger shaped product was designed to help babies cut the back and front teeth whilst exercising the jaw muscles, bones and gums.

The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] \"heads\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date=February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]\n\n==Composition and structure==\nSurfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').<ref name=\"The Lipid Chronicles\">{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of absorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant. Shown in {{color|#800000|red}} \u2013 [[choline]] and [[phosphate]] group; {{color|#000000|black}} \u2013 [[glycerol]]; {{color|#008000|green}} \u2013 [[monounsaturated fatty acid]]; {{color|#000080|blue}} \u2013 [[saturated fatty acid]].]]\nThe human body produces diverse surfactants. [[Pulmonary surfactant]] is produced in [[lung]]s in order to facilitate breathing by increasing total lung capacity, TLC, and lung compliance. In respiratory distress syndrome or RDS [[Pulmonary surfactant (medication)|surfactant replacement]] therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using pharmaceutical forms of the surfactants. One example of pharmaceutical pulmonary surfactants is Survanta ([[beractant]]) or its generic form Beraksurf produced by [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] and [[Tekzima]] respectively. [[Bile salts]] play important role in digestion.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2010.12.002|pmid=21236400|title=The role of bile salts in digestion|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=165|issue=1|pages=36\u201346|year=2011|last1=Maldonado-Valderrama|first1=Julia|last2=Wilde|first2=Pete|last3=MacIerzanka|first3=Adam|last4=MacKie|first4=Alan}}</ref>\n\n== Safety and environmental risks ==\nMost anionic and non-ionic surfactants are nontoxic, having [[LD50]] comparable to sodium chloride. The toxicity of [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium compounds]], which are [[antibacterial]] and [[antifungal]], varies. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low [[LD50]] (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nSurfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process or as industrial and household waste.<ref name=\"pmid18333674\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Metcalfe TL, Dillon PJ, Metcalfe CD | title = Detecting the transport of toxic pesticides from golf courses into watersheds in the Precambrian Shield region of Ontario, Canada | journal = Environ.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's [[lipid bilayer]] (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|title=Progress Toward an Artificial Liver Transplant&nbsp;\u2013 NIH Research Matters|last=Wein|first=Harrison|date=28 June 2010|publisher=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805083144/http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|archive-date=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Pulmonary surfactant]]s are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in [[mammals]].\n\n===Quantum dot preparation===\nSurfactants are used with [[quantum dot]]s in order to manipulate growth.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and Characterization of Monodisperse Nanocrystals and Close-Packed Nanocrystal Assemblies |journal=Annual Review of Materials Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=545\u2013610 |year=2000 |doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.30.1.545|bibcode = 2000AnRMS..30..545M |last1=Murray |first1=C.

[[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Chemistry|Underwater diving}}\n* [[Anti-fog]]\n* [[Cleavable detergent]]\n* [[Emulsion]]\n* [[Hydrotrope]]\n* [[MBAS assay]], an [[assay]] that indicates [[Ion#Anions and cations|anionic]] surfactants in water with a bluing reaction.\n* [[Niosome]]\n* [[Oil dispersants]]\n* [[Surfactants in paint]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Surfactants}}\n\n{{Foam scales and properties}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Surfactants| ]]\n[[Category:Bioremediation]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n[[Category:Cleaning product components]]\n[[Category:Colloidal chemistry]]\n[[Category:Environmental terminology]]\n[[Category:Underwater diving physics]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Pulmonary surfactant}}\n{{Short description|Substance that lowers the surface tension between a liquid and another material}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:A lipid micelle.png|thumb|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]] of oil in aqueous suspension, such as might occur in an [[emulsion]] of oil in water.

This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil.

Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of absorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

[[Pulmonary surfactant]] is produced in [[lung]]s in order to facilitate breathing by increasing total lung capacity, TLC, and lung compliance. In respiratory distress syndrome or RDS [[Pulmonary surfactant (medication)|surfactant replacement]] therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using pharmaceutical forms of the surfactants. One example of pharmaceutical pulmonary surfactants is Survanta ([[beractant]]) or its generic form Beraksurf produced by [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] and [[Tekzima]] respectively.

Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low [[LD50]] (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nSurfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process or as industrial and household waste.<ref name=\"pmid18333674\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Metcalfe TL, Dillon PJ, Metcalfe CD | title = Detecting the transport of toxic pesticides from golf courses into watersheds in the Precambrian Shield region of Ontario, Canada | journal = Environ.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's [[lipid bilayer]] (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|title=Progress Toward an Artificial Liver Transplant&nbsp;\u2013 NIH Research Matters|last=Wein|first=Harrison|date=28 June 2010|publisher=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805083144/http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|archive-date=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Pulmonary surfactant]]s are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in [[mammals]].\n\n===Quantum dot preparation===\nSurfactants are used with [[quantum dot]]s in order to manipulate growth.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and Characterization of Monodisperse Nanocrystals and Close-Packed Nanocrystal Assemblies |journal=Annual Review of Materials Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=545\u2013610 |year=2000 |doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.30.1.545|bibcode = 2000AnRMS..30..545M |last1=Murray |first1=C.

[[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Chemistry|Underwater diving}}\n* [[Anti-fog]]\n* [[Cleavable detergent]]\n* [[Emulsion]]\n* [[Hydrotrope]]\n* [[MBAS assay]], an [[assay]] that indicates [[Ion#Anions and cations|anionic]] surfactants in water with a bluing reaction.\n* [[Niosome]]\n* [[Oil dispersants]]\n* [[Surfactants in paint]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Surfactants}}\n\n{{Foam scales and properties}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Surfactants| ]]\n[[Category:Bioremediation]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n[[Category:Cleaning product components]]\n[[Category:Colloidal chemistry]]\n[[Category:Environmental terminology]]\n[[Category:Underwater diving physics]]\n", "name_user": "Ziyu Guo", "label": "safe", "comment": "Unbolded the subtitle", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"}

Her business celebrity led to book and [[Hollywood]] film deals based on her experience. Originally [[homeschooled]] in rural [[Arizona]], Fowler studied physics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. She worked at two technology [[startup companies]] before joining Uber in late 2015. In early 2017, her [[blog]] post on sexual harassment at the company was widely shared and ultimately led to the ouster of Uber founder and CEO [[Travis Kalanick]]. She runs a science [[book discussion club|book club]] and has written a book on [[microservices]]. Fowler served as editor-in-chief of a quarterly publication by the [[payment processing]] company [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], and is currently a technology opinion editor at ''[[The New York Times]]''.\n\n== Early life ==\nSusan Fowler was raised in rural [[Yarnell, Arizona]], the second of seven children. Her father was an [[evangelical Christianity|evangelical]] [[Assemblies of God]] preacher and [[pay phone]] salesman, and her mother [[Homeschooling in the United States|homeschooled]] their children. Fowler recalled having little direction in her education, and would often visit the library and try to [[autodidactism|teach herself]] topics. She was influenced by ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]'' and the [[Stoics]], which encouraged her to focus on the parts of her life she could control. She worked as a [[stable hand]] and [[nanny]] to make money for her family. \n\nFowler prepared herself to take college entrance exams without high school and was accepted with a full scholarship to [[Arizona State University]], where she wanted to pursue astronomy. However, her lack of high school prerequisites prevented her study of math and physics, so she transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where Fowler faced similar opposition until she appealed to [[Amy Gutmann|the university president]].{{r|Kuchler}} \n\nShe worked as a physics research assistant during her time at Penn, but was forced out after befriending a fellow student named Tim. When Tim turned suicidal, Fowler tried to seek help, but the university put the blame on her and tried to remove Fowler from classes they shared. The university also rescinded her master's degree. She considered suing, but decided to move on with her life. This incident later helped Fowler make the decision to blow the whistle on [[Uber]].<ref name=\"Penn\" /> She graduated with a degree in physics.{{r|Heavy listicle}}\n\n== Career ==\nFowler was a platform engineer at financial technology company [[Plaid (company)|Plaid]] in early 2015 and a [[DevOps]] engineer at data infrastructure company [[PubNub]] later in the year before joining [[Uber]] in November 2015.{{r|Heavy listicle}}\n\n=== Uber ===\n{{see also|Uber#Sexual harassment allegations and management shakeup (2017)}}\nIn February 2017, Fowler wrote a 3,000-word [[blog post]] on sexual harassment at Uber.<ref>[https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber] \u2013 probably this is the mentioned blog post.</ref> Fowler's post outlined a hostile work culture for female employees of Uber. She recounted how the company's [[human resources]] refused to punish her former manager, who had propositioned her for sex, based on his productivity.{{r|Bloomberg: Ordeal}} The story was shared 22,000 times on [[Twitter]].{{r|Kuchler}} External probes confirmed her account and led to multiple firings.{{r|Bloomberg: Ordeal}} The fallout ultimately forced Uber founder and CEO [[Travis Kalanick]] to resign,{{r|Bloomberg: Ordeal}} and a subsequent backlash against sexual harassment in [[Silicon Valley]], including the removal of tech investors [[Dave McClure]] and Justin Caldbeck.{{r|Guynn/Cava}} \n\nFowler's role in changing Uber made her into a business world celebrity. She has received book and Hollywood film deals and continues to work towards legislation and workplace protections for women. In August 2017, she petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] to consider her experience in [[Epic Systems Corp. v.

Her business celebrity led to book and [[Hollywood]] film deals based on her experience. Originally [[homeschooled]] in rural [[Arizona]], Fowler studied physics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. She worked at two technology [[startup companies]] before joining Uber in late 2015. In early 2017, her [[blog]] post on sexual harassment at the company was widely shared and ultimately led to the ouster of Uber founder and CEO [[Travis Kalanick]]. She runs a science [[book discussion club|book club]] and has written a book on [[microservices]]. Fowler served as editor-in-chief of a quarterly publication by the [[payment processing]] company [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], and is currently a technology opinion editor at ''[[The New York Times]]''.\n\n== Early life ==\nSusan Fowler was raised in rural [[Yarnell, Arizona]], the second of seven children. Her father was an [[evangelical Christianity|evangelical]] [[Assemblies of God]] preacher and [[pay phone]] salesman, and her mother [[Homeschooling in the United States|homeschooled]] their children. Fowler recalled having little direction in her education, and would often visit the library and try to [[autodidactism|teach herself]] topics. She was influenced by ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]'' and the [[Stoics]], which encouraged her to focus on the parts of her life she could control. She worked as a [[stable hand]] and [[nanny]] to make money for her family. \n\nFowler prepared herself to take college entrance exams without high school and was accepted with a full scholarship to [[Arizona State University]], where she wanted to pursue astronomy. However, her lack of high school prerequisites prevented her study of math and physics, so she transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where Fowler faced similar opposition until she appealed to [[Amy Gutmann|the university president]].{{r|Kuchler}} \n\nShe worked as a physics research assistant during her time at Penn, but was forced out after befriending a fellow student named Tim. When Tim turned suicidal, Fowler tried to seek help, but the university put the blame on her and tried to remove Fowler from classes they shared. The university also rescinded her master's degree. She considered suing, but decided to move on with her life. This incident later helped Fowler make the decision to blow the whistle on [[Uber]].<ref name=\"Penn\" /> She graduated with a degree in physics.{{r|Heavy listicle}}\n\n== Career ==\nFowler was a platform engineer at financial technology company [[Plaid (company)|Plaid]] in early 2015 and a [[DevOps]] engineer at data infrastructure company [[PubNub]] later in the year before joining [[Uber]] in November 2015.{{r|Heavy listicle}}\n\n=== Uber ===\n{{see also|Uber#Sexual harassment allegations and management shakeup (2017)}}\nIn February 2017, Fowler wrote a 3,000-word [[blog post]] on sexual harassment at Uber.<ref>[https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber] \u2013 probably this is the mentioned blog post.</ref> Fowler's post outlined a hostile work culture for female employees of Uber. She recounted how the company's [[human resources]] refused to punish her former manager, who had propositioned her for sex, based on his productivity.{{r|Bloomberg: Ordeal}} The story was shared 22,000 times on [[Twitter]].{{r|Kuchler}} External probes confirmed her account and led to multiple firings.{{r|Bloomberg: Ordeal}} The fallout ultimately forced Uber founder and CEO [[Travis Kalanick]] to resign,{{r|Bloomberg: Ordeal}} and a subsequent backlash against sexual harassment in [[Silicon Valley]], including the removal of tech investors [[Dave McClure]] and Justin Caldbeck.{{r|Guynn/Cava}} \n\nFowler's role in changing Uber made her into a business world celebrity. She has received book and Hollywood film deals and continues to work towards legislation and workplace protections for women. In August 2017, she petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] to consider her experience in [[Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis|its decision]] on whether employees can forfeit rights to collective litigation in their employment contracts.{{r|Guynn/Cava}} ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' named her among their 2017 list of top business and cultural leaders.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morse |first1=Brittany |title=Elon Musk, Susan Fowler, and Mark Zuckerberg Join Tech's Biggest Names in 'New Establishment' List |work=[[Inc.com]] |date=2017-10-02 |url=https://www.inc.com/brittany-morse/elon-musk-susan-fowler-and-markzerberg-join-big-tech-names-in-new-establishment-list.html |accessdate=2017-11-12 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nFowler was one of five women featured on the cover of ''Time'' magazine's Person of the Year issue for 2017, as representative of \"The Silence Breakers\", for reporting on the sexual harassment she experienced at Uber.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two Bay Area women on Time cover for 'Person of the Year'| url= http://abc7news.com/society/two-bay-area-women-on-time-cover-for-person-of-the-year-/2750072/|date=December 6, 2017|first=Lilian|last=Kim|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> She was also named [[Financial Times Person of the Year]] by the British business newspaper ''[[Financial Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hook|first1=Leslie|title=FT Person of the Year: Susan Fowler|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b4bc2a68-dc4f-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482|accessdate=2017-12-12|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=2017-12-12 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Journalism ===\n\nIn April 2017, Fowler joined the payment processing company [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]] as the editor-in-chief of a new quarterly publication called Increment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/stripe-susan-fowler-increment/| title=Susan Fowler joins Stripe as editor-in-chief of new quarterly publication Increment|first=Ryan|last=Lawler|date=April 13, 2017|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]}}</ref> She also started a science book club and published a book on [[microservices]].\n\nIn July 2018, Fowler was hired by ''The New York Times'' as an opinion editor writing [[op-ed]] pieces on tech subjects.

The weight varies from {{convert|75|to(-)|157|g|oz|abbr=on}}. The [[plumage]] of the [[nominate race]], as with all subspecies, is very bright. The head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar, and the rest of the upper parts (wings, back and tail) are green. The chest is orange/yellow. The belly is deep blue, and the thighs and rump are green. In flight a yellow wing-bar contrasts clearly with the red underwing [[Covert (feather)|coverts]].\n\nThere is little to visually distinguish between the sexes.\n\nJuveniles have a black [[beak]], which gradually brightens to orange in the adults.\n\nThe markings of ''Trichoglossus moluccanus'' resemble those of the Coconut Lorikeet (''Trichoglossus haematodus''), but with a blue belly and a more orange breast with little or no blue-black barring.<ref name = \"HBW\">Collar N (1997). \"Family Psittacidae (Parrots)\" in ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]] Volume 4; Sandgrouse to Cuckoos'' (eds del Hoyo J, Elliott A, Sargatal J) Lynx Edicions: Barcelona. {{ISBN|84-87334-22-9}}, pp. 420\u2013425</ref>\n\n== Dimorphism ==\n\nUnlike the [[eclectus parrot]], rainbow lorikeets do not have any immediately discernible dimorphic traits. Males and females look identical, and surgical sexing by a vet or DNA analysis of a feather is used to determine the sex of an individual.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rainbow Lorikeet Information|url=http://birdsville.net.au/birds-for-sale/lori-and-lorikeet/rainbow-lorikeet/|website=Birdsville|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Owen|first1=Mike|title=Trichoglossus haematodus moluccanus|url=http://www.birdsnways.com/mowen/rainbows.htm|website=Birds of Australia|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Behaviour ==\n\nRainbow lorikeets often travel together in pairs and occasionally respond to calls to fly as a flock, then disperse again into pairs. Rainbow lorikeet pairs defend their feeding and nesting areas aggressively against other rainbow lorikeets and other bird species. They chase off not only smaller birds such as the [[noisy miner]] and the [[little wattlebird]], but also larger birds such as the [[Australian magpie]].\n\n=== Diet ===\n[[File:Rainbow Lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus subspecies moluccanus) at Adelaide Airport.JPG|thumb|Rainbow lorikeet, ''Trichoglossus moluccanus'', feeding at Adelaide Airport]]\n[[File:Trichoglossus moluccanus with open wings, Brisbane.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Brisbane]], Queensland.]]\nRainbow lorikeets feed mainly on fruit, pollen and nectar, and possess a tongue adapted especially for their particular diet. The end of the tongue is equipped with a [[papillate]] appendage adapted to gathering pollen and nectar from flowers.<ref>Low, R. (1977): ''Lories and Lorikeets \u2013 the brush-tongued parrots''. [[Paul Elek]] Ltd., London</ref> Nectar from [[eucalyptus]] is important in Australia, other important nectar sources are ''[[Pittosporum]]'', ''[[Grevillea]]'', ''[[Spathodea campanulata]]'' (African tulip-tree), and ''[[Metroxylon sagu]]'' (sago palm).<ref name = \"HBW\"/> In Melanesia [[coconut]]s are very important food sources, and rainbow lorikeets are important pollinators of these.<ref name = \"Vanuatu\"/> They also consume the fruits of ''[[Ficus]]'', ''[[Trema (plant)|Trema]]'', ''[[Mutingia]]'', as well as papaya and mangoes already opened by [[fruit bat]]s. They also eat crops such as [[apple]]s, and will raid [[maize]] and [[sorghum]].<ref name = \"HBW\"/>  They are also frequent visitors at bird feeders placed in gardens, which supply store-bought nectar, sunflower seeds, and fruits such as apples, grapes and pears.\n\nIn many places, including campsites and suburban gardens, wild lorikeets are so used to humans that they can be hand-fed. The [[Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Queensland]], Australia, is noted for its thousands of lorikeets. Around 8am and 4pm each day the birds gather in a huge, noisy flock in the park's main area.

The weight varies from {{convert|75|to(-)|157|g|oz|abbr=on}}. The [[plumage]] of the [[nominate race]], as with all subspecies, is very bright. The head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar, and the rest of the upper parts (wings, back and tail) are green. The chest is orange/yellow. The belly is deep blue, and the thighs and rump are green. In flight a yellow wing-bar contrasts clearly with the red underwing [[Covert (feather)|coverts]].\n\nThere is little to visually distinguish between the sexes.\n\nJuveniles have a black [[beak]], which gradually brightens to orange in the adults.\n\nThe markings of ''Trichoglossus moluccanus'' resemble those of the Coconut Lorikeet (''Trichoglossus haematodus''), but with a blue belly and a more orange breast with little or no blue-black barring.<ref name = \"HBW\">Collar N (1997). \"Family Psittacidae (Parrots)\" in ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]] Volume 4; Sandgrouse to Cuckoos'' (eds del Hoyo J, Elliott A, Sargatal J) Lynx Edicions: Barcelona. {{ISBN|84-87334-22-9}}, pp. 420\u2013425</ref>\n\n== Dimorphism ==\n\nUnlike the [[eclectus parrot]], rainbow lorikeets do not have any immediately discernible dimorphic traits. Males and females look identical, and surgical sexing by a vet or DNA analysis of a feather is used to determine the sex of an individual.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rainbow Lorikeet Information|url=http://birdsville.net.au/birds-for-sale/lori-and-lorikeet/rainbow-lorikeet/|website=Birdsville|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Owen|first1=Mike|title=Trichoglossus haematodus moluccanus|url=http://www.birdsnways.com/mowen/rainbows.htm|website=Birds of Australia|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Behaviour ==\n\nRainbow lorikeets often travel together in pairs and occasionally respond to calls to fly as a flock, then disperse again into pairs. Rainbow lorikeet pairs defend their feeding and nesting areas aggressively against other rainbow lorikeets and other bird species. They chase off not only smaller birds such as the [[noisy miner]] and the [[little wattlebird]], but also larger birds such as the [[Australian magpie]].\n\n=== Diet ===\n[[File:Rainbow Lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus subspecies moluccanus) at Adelaide Airport.JPG|thumb|Rainbow lorikeet, ''Trichoglossus moluccanus'', feeding at Adelaide Airport]]\n[[File:Trichoglossus moluccanus with open wings, Brisbane.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Brisbane]], Queensland.]]\nRainbow lorikeets feed mainly on fruit, pollen and nectar, and possess a tongue adapted especially for their particular diet. The end of the tongue is equipped with a [[papillate]] appendage adapted to gathering pollen and nectar from flowers.<ref>Low, R. (1977): ''Lories and Lorikeets \u2013 the brush-tongued parrots''. [[Paul Elek]] Ltd., London</ref> Nectar from [[eucalyptus]] is important in Australia, other important nectar sources are ''[[Pittosporum]]'', ''[[Grevillea]]'', ''[[Spathodea campanulata]]'' (African tulip-tree), and ''[[Metroxylon sagu]]'' (sago palm).<ref name = \"HBW\"/> In Melanesia [[coconut]]s are very important food sources, and rainbow lorikeets are important pollinators of these.<ref name = \"Vanuatu\"/> They also consume the fruits of ''[[Ficus]]'', ''[[Trema (plant)|Trema]]'', ''[[Mutingia]]'', as well as papaya and mangoes already opened by [[fruit bat]]s. They also eat crops such as [[apple]]s, and will raid [[maize]] and [[sorghum]].<ref name = \"HBW\"/>  They are also frequent visitors at bird feeders placed in gardens, which supply store-bought nectar, sunflower seeds, and fruits such as apples, grapes and pears.\n\nIn many places, including campsites and suburban gardens, wild lorikeets are so used to humans that they can be hand-fed. The [[Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Queensland]], Australia, is noted for its thousands of lorikeets. Around 8am and 4pm each day the birds gather in a huge, noisy flock in the park's main area. Visitors are encouraged to feed them a specially prepared nectar, and the birds will happily settle on people's arms and heads to consume it. Wild rainbow lorikeets can also be hand-fed by visitors at [[Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary]] in [[Brisbane]], Queensland, Australia.\n\nSemi-tame lorikeets are common daily visitors in many Sydney backyards, though many people, ignorant of their dietary requirements, feed them bread or bread coated with honey.
