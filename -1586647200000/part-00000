Fiction was best known for The Cure's releases and achieved its first UK No. 1 album in 1992 with The Cure's ''[[Wish (The Cure album)|Wish]]''; the album's [[lead single]] \"[[Friday I'm In Love]]\" also topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Modern Rock chart. Additionally, Fiction was home to other artists who signed to the publishing company  as well as the record label and released a number of acclaimed albums including [[Eat (band)|Eat]]'s ''[[Sell Me a God]]'' (Fiction/Polydor) in 1989, [[The God Machine (band)|The God Machine]]'s ''[[Scenes from the Second Storey]]'' (Fiction/Polydor) in 1993 and [[Die Warzau]]'s ''Engine'' (Fiction/[[Wax Trax!

However, BMG eventually acquired Fiction Songs and its catalog in 2001. Besides being the publisher for the Cure and other Fiction artists, Fiction Songs was also home to [[hip hop]]/[[Electronic music|electronic]] artist [[Stereo MCs]], producer and songwriter [[Cameron McVey]], the [[Jungle Brothers]], [[Primitive Radio Gods]], and NY Loose.\n \nIn 1992, the Fiction headquarters at Charlotte Street served as the first home to XFM London co founded by Parry.

Fiction was best known for The Cure's releases and achieved its first UK No. 1 album in 1992 with The Cure's ''[[Wish (The Cure album)|Wish]]''; the album's [[lead single]] \"[[Friday I'm In Love]]\" also topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Modern Rock chart.

However, BMG eventually acquired Fiction Songs and its catalog in 2001.

I felt guilty about using Colin's life to do stuff about myself. I felt like I was standing on the shoulders of giants. That's where the idea of the impostor came from.<ref name=\"Hirschmann\" /></blockquote>\n''The Impostor'' is therefore \"a portrait of a young man using the death of another as an opportunity to grandstand\", that is to say: \"It's a video about Cockburn's anxiety about making the video.\"<ref name=\"Hirschmann\" />\n\n===Fathers and sons: the anxiety of influence===\nCockburn transforms this anxiety of performance into one of influence, through the theme of fathers and sons, which [[Mike Hoolboom]] traces across a number of Cockburn's videos, including ''[[WEAKEND]]'', which premiered at the same festival as ''The Impostor'', in which video the theme is \"brought to a head\".<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> To comply with the commission, Cockburn must take inspiration from an influential predecessor or \"video dad\", Colin Campbell.<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> The man speaking in the video, according to Cockburn, has an \"adverse relationship to his late father (who is also himself) \u2013 an antagonism born of disassociation, of one party's ignorance and the other's absence.\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom2\" /> He is attempting to breach that chasm by throwing a rope across it, \"even as a third aspect of himself scissors the rope into little bits.\"<blockquote>And this is a pretty good expression of the way I feel, or don't, about Colin. By this I mean Colin is an influence at second remove; I understand his work by having heard people talk about it, by having seen work made in its shadow. So my work is the shadow of a shadow, a second-generation copy at best. For me, in the context of video art, Colin is like, for instance, Orson Welles (and I mean the Welles of ''Chimes at Midnight'' and ''It's All True!'', not the Welles who made ''Citizen Kane'' and ''Touch of Evil'' and the other few that I actually have seen), or like all the Godard or Snow that I know  enough about to pretend I've seen if the conversation doesn't get too specific. And if we stand on the shoulders of those who come before us, then I'm standing on someone who's standing on Colin's shoulders, and I've gotten to this height to no credit of my own... And I want to build on what I'm standing on, not just fritter away my vantage point from atop the dead, yet it feels that to do so I have to wrest  attention away from them, toward myself (because attention is a finite resource)... At any rate, I feel a need to justify or defend myself \u2013 even if only to myself, to make me happy.<ref name=\"Hoolboom2\" /></blockquote>\n[[File:Mike_Hoolboom_crop.JPG|thumb|165px|left|[[Mike Hoolboom]]]]\nColin Campbell made his first films in [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]], where he made a \"gently ironic send up\" of his small town origins (he was born in [[Reston, Manitoba]]) and \"big world aspirations,\" done in the form of a [[monologue]] delivered to camera, \"all in one take, like so much work made in the seventies.\" ''Sackville, I'm Yours'' (1972) became a template for Campbell's work over the next three decades, and \"set up a style sheet for much of the field.\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> Cockburn's own performance addressed directly to the camera is a [[postmodernist]] take on the motif: \"there is a picture playing beside him, which turns his speaking self into a picture as well.\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> Hoolboom asks whether the invoked eulogy, or indeed the video itself, is a eulogy for Campbell, and interprets the invocation as an expression of \"the wish for the father's death\", a metaphor for \"the unconscious of the medium itself, the unspoken darkness that lies at the heart of the collective project\" of [[video art]]:<blockquote>Isn't this a confession?

The words are \"physical\" because they have been \"laid onto videotape\"; Cockburn belongs to a generation of video artists who made videos rather than digital files, and \"it's clear that the material troubles him, why else imagine the turning wheels of the video cassette skinning him alive?

He describes a dream in which he was asked to read a [[eulogy]] for his father.\n\nWatching his father (Daniel Cockburn) in the home movie, he realizes that the gestures his father made are a kind of prison; he is forced to repeat them involuntarily. Then the man in black looks on with the horror of recognition, realizing that his father's [[body language]] \"prefigured all the gestures into which I would later grow, thinking they were my own.\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" />\n\nIn a dream, the man returns to his father's bedside. \"I had gone to visit him at the hospital, and he had been unconscious, but I thought he might like to hear the sound of my voice, so I spoke to him...\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> The man's father is on his [[wikt:deathbed|deathbed]]. Moments before his father dies, the man speaks to him, but his father makes no sign of hearing. The man pulls out an [[IV tube]] and speaks into it as though it were a microphone. His words turn into sharp needles that enter his father through the tube, who dies presently. The man wonders if his words killed his father, or perhaps removing the tube.\n\nAt his father's funeral, the man says that his inheritance now depends on the tears shed by the audience.\n\nThe man changes places with the projectionist in the left screen (Daniel Cockburn). The projectionist destroys the work.\n\n[[File:Director Daniel Cockburn leads a post-show Q&amp;A (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Cockburn]]]]\n\n==Cast==\n[[Daniel Cockburn]] plays both a fictional version of himself and his \"fictionally dead father\".<ref name=\"Hoolboom2\">{{cite book |last1=Hoolboom |first1=Mike (ed. and interviewer) |title=Practical Dreamers: Conversations with Movie Artists |date=2008 |publisher=Coach House Books |location=Toronto |pages=7\u201320 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=n8eOKiK3llYC&pg=PA3&dq=daniel+cockburn+hoolboom+smartbomb&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIt4PA-OzkAhVeJDQIHXc9AZ4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=daniel%20cockburn%20hoolboom%20smartbomb&f=false |accessdate=25 September 2019 |chapter=Daniel Cockburn: Smartbomb}}</ref>\n\nThe fictional Cockburn is himself conceived as split between the \"monologist\" who delivers the introspective eulogy, and \"the projectionist who destroys the film after its projected.\"<ref name=\"Hirschmann\">{{cite news |last1=Hirschmann |first1=Thomas |title=Tranz Tech Profile |url=https://nowtoronto.com/art-and-books/art/tranz-tech-profile/ |accessdate=23 September 2019 |work=Now |date=9 October 2003}}</ref> At the end, Cockburn the monologist steps back to take the place of Cockburn the projectionist, and Cockburn the projectionist steps forward to take the place of Cockburn the monologist.<ref name=\"Hirschmann\" />\n\n==Themes==\n===Life and death===\nOn the surface, ''The Impostor (hello goodbye)'' is ostensibly a work about a dead father and a [[eulogy]] by his son. Norman Wilner finds Cockburn talks about [[life and death]], and dreams of death, \"with a childlike fascination and an adult's sense of gravity.\"<ref name=\"Wilner\">{{cite news |last1=Wilner |first1=Norman |title=Rocket man, space movies: Daniel Cockburn puts space movies in the universe of post-modern cultural collage |url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/rocket-man-space-movies/ |accessdate=15 October 2019 |work=Now |date=4 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===The artist and the anxiety of performance===\nMost of Cockburn's previous work had been, in one way or another, about himself, his own ideas: \"It's me trying to figure myself out.\"<ref name=\"Hirschmann\" /> When he was asked to make a video for The Colin Campbell Sessions to be screened with other new films inspired by [[Colin Campbell (artist)|Colin Campbell]], it gave him pause:<blockquote>I didn't know how I was going to be able to do a film about myself and still be respectful. I felt guilty about using Colin's life to do stuff about myself. I felt like I was standing on the shoulders of giants. That's where the idea of the impostor came from.<ref name=\"Hirschmann\" /></blockquote>\n''The Impostor'' is therefore \"a portrait of a young man using the death of another as an opportunity to grandstand\", that is to say: \"It's a video about Cockburn's anxiety about making the video.\"<ref name=\"Hirschmann\" />\n\n===Fathers and sons: the anxiety of influence===\nCockburn transforms this anxiety of performance into one of influence, through the theme of fathers and sons, which [[Mike Hoolboom]] traces across a number of Cockburn's videos, including ''[[WEAKEND]]'', which premiered at the same festival as ''The Impostor'', in which video the theme is \"brought to a head\".<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> To comply with the commission, Cockburn must take inspiration from an influential predecessor or \"video dad\", Colin Campbell.<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> The man speaking in the video, according to Cockburn, has an \"adverse relationship to his late father (who is also himself) \u2013 an antagonism born of disassociation, of one party's ignorance and the other's absence.\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom2\" /> He is attempting to breach that chasm by throwing a rope across it, \"even as a third aspect of himself scissors the rope into little bits.\"<blockquote>And this is a pretty good expression of the way I feel, or don't, about Colin. By this I mean Colin is an influence at second remove; I understand his work by having heard people talk about it, by having seen work made in its shadow. So my work is the shadow of a shadow, a second-generation copy at best. For me, in the context of video art, Colin is like, for instance, Orson Welles (and I mean the Welles of ''Chimes at Midnight'' and ''It's All True!'', not the Welles who made ''Citizen Kane'' and ''Touch of Evil'' and the other few that I actually have seen), or like all the Godard or Snow that I know  enough about to pretend I've seen if the conversation doesn't get too specific. And if we stand on the shoulders of those who come before us, then I'm standing on someone who's standing on Colin's shoulders, and I've gotten to this height to no credit of my own... And I want to build on what I'm standing on, not just fritter away my vantage point from atop the dead, yet it feels that to do so I have to wrest  attention away from them, toward myself (because attention is a finite resource)... At any rate, I feel a need to justify or defend myself \u2013 even if only to myself, to make me happy.<ref name=\"Hoolboom2\" /></blockquote>\n[[File:Mike_Hoolboom_crop.JPG|thumb|165px|left|[[Mike Hoolboom]]]]\nColin Campbell made his first films in [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]], where he made a \"gently ironic send up\" of his small town origins (he was born in [[Reston, Manitoba]]) and \"big world aspirations,\" done in the form of a [[monologue]] delivered to camera, \"all in one take, like so much work made in the seventies.\" ''Sackville, I'm Yours'' (1972) became a template for Campbell's work over the next three decades, and \"set up a style sheet for much of the field.\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> Cockburn's own performance addressed directly to the camera is a [[postmodernist]] take on the motif: \"there is a picture playing beside him, which turns his speaking self into a picture as well.\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> Hoolboom asks whether the invoked eulogy, or indeed the video itself, is a eulogy for Campbell, and interprets the invocation as an expression of \"the wish for the father's death\", a metaphor for \"the unconscious of the medium itself, the unspoken darkness that lies at the heart of the collective project\" of [[video art]]:<blockquote>Isn't this a confession? Whenever I speak I am killing him. Or: the only way for me to speak is to kill my father. Every word I pronounce is sharp, that's how dad feels it, because it's either him or me.

Depending on the dose, some or all of the pathogenic organisms, [[microorganism]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es present are destroyed, slowed down, or rendered incapable of reproduction. Irradiation cannot return spoiled or over-ripe food to a fresh state. If this food was processed by irradiation, further spoilage would cease and ripening would slow down, yet the irradiation would not destroy the toxins or repair the texture, color, or taste of the food.<ref name=\"Loaharanu2\">{{cite journal|last=Loaharanu|first=Paisan|year=1990|title=Food irradiation: Facts or fiction?.|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|journal=IAEA Bulletin|volume=32|issue=2|pages=44\u201348|accessdate=March 3, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304152545/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> When targeting bacteria, most foods are irradiated to significantly reduce the number of active microbes, not to sterilize all microbes in the product. In this respect it is similar to pasteurization.\n\nIrradiation is used to create safe foods for people at high risk of infection, or for conditions where food must be stored for long periods of time and proper storage conditions are not available. Foods that can tolerate irradiation at sufficient doses are treated to ensure that the product is completely [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]]. This is most commonly done with rations for astronauts, and special diets for hospital patients.\n\nIrradiation is used to create shelf-stable products. Since irradiation reduces the populations of spoilage microorganisms, and because pre-packed food can be irradiated, the packaging prevents recontamination of the final product.<ref name=\"FI\" />\n\nIrradiation is used to reduce post-harvest losses. It reduces populations of spoilage micro-organisms in the food and can slow down the speed at which enzymes change the food, and therefore slows spoilage and ripening, and inhibits sprouting (e.g., of potato, onion, and garlic).<ref name=\"Loaharanu\"/>\n\nFood is also irradiated to prevent the spread of invasive pest species through trade in fresh vegetables and fruits, either within countries, or trade across international boundaries. Pests such as insects could be transported to new habitats through trade in fresh produce which could significantly affect agricultural production and the environment were they to establish themselves.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1261545694-KGCNC1z9SSW95acAk0gz0g Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation.] ''[[The New York Times]].'' February 1, 2009.</ref> Some of the potential secondary impacts of irradiation are hypothetical, while others are demonstrated. These effects include cumulative impacts to pathogens, people, and the environment due to the reduction of food quality, the transportation and storage of radioactive goods, and destruction of pathogens, changes in the way we relate to food and how irradiation changes the food production and shipping industries.\n\n===Immediate effects===\nThe radiation source supplies energetic particles or waves. As these waves/particles pass through a target material they [[Event (particle physics)|collide with other particles]]. Around the sites of these collisions [[chemical bonds]] are broken, creating short lived radicals (e.g. the [[hydroxyl radical]], the hydrogen atom and [[solvated electron]]s). These radicals cause further chemical changes by bonding with and or stripping particles from nearby molecules. When collisions damage [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], effective [[reproduction]] becomes unlikely, also when collisions occur in cells, [[cell division]] is often suppressed.<ref name=\"FI\"/>\n\nIrradiation (within the accepted energy limits, as 10 MeV for electrons, 5 MeV for X-rays [US 7.5 MeV] and gamma rays from [[Cobalt-60]]) can not make food radioactive, but it does produce [[#Chemical changes|radiolytic products, and free radicals]] in the food. A few of these products are unique, but not considered dangerous.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\" />\n\nIrradiation can also alter the [[#Food quality|nutritional content and flavor of foods]], much like cooking.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/sources/food_safety.html |title=Radiation Protection-Food Safety|publisher=epa.gov |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> The scale of these chemical changes is not unique. Cooking, smoking, salting, and other less novel techniques, cause the food to be altered so drastically that its original nature is almost unrecognizable, and must be called by a different name. Storage of food also causes dramatic chemical changes, ones that eventually lead to deterioration and spoilage.<ref name=\"ROT\">{{cite web|url=http://science-at-home.org/kid-question-rotting/ |title=kid question rotting |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Misconceptions====\nA major concern is that irradiation might cause chemical changes that are harmful to the consumer. Several national expert groups and two international expert groups evaluated the available data and concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume as long as it remains palatable and maintains its technical properties (e.g. feel, texture, or color).<ref name=\"JECFI\"/><ref name=\"JSGHDI\"/>\n\nIrradiated food does not become radioactive, just as an object exposed to light does not start producing light. Radioactivity is the ability of a substance to emit high energy particles. When particles hit the target materials they may free other highly energetic particles. This ends shortly after the end of the exposure, much like objects stop reflecting light when the source is turned off and warm objects emit heat until they cool down but do not continue to produce their own heat. To modify a material so that it keeps emitting radiation (induce radiation) the atomic cores ([[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]) of the atoms in the target material must be modified.\n\nIt is impossible for food irradiators to induce radiation in a product. Irradiators emit [[electron]]s or [[photon]]s and the radiation is intrinsically radiated at precisely known strengths ([[wavelength]]s for photons, and speeds for electrons). These radiated particles at these strengths can never be strong enough to modify the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the targeted atom in the food, regardless of how many particles hit the target material, and radioactivity can not be induced without modifying the nucleus.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\"/>\n\n====Chemical changes====\nCompounds known as free radicals form when food is irradiated. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., accept electrons) and some react very strongly. According to the free-radical theory of aging excessive amounts of these free radicals can lead to cell injury and cell death, which may contribute to many diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rajamani Karthikeyan |author2=Manivasagam T |author3=Anantharaman P |author4=Balasubramanian T |author5=Somasundaram ST |title=Chemopreventive effect of Padina boergesenii extracts on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats |journal=J.

One family of chemicals (2ACB's) are uniquely formed by irradiation (unique radiolytic products), and this product is nontoxic. When fatty acids are irradiated, a family of compounds called 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) are produced.

For example, in the U.S. the FDA has approved food irradiation for over fifty years. However, in the past decade the major growth area is for fruits and vegetables that are irradiated to prevent the spread of pests. In the early 2000s in the US, irradiated meat was common at some grocery stores, but because of lack of consumer demand, it is no longer common. Because consumer demand for irradiated food is low, reducing the spoilage between manufacturer and consumer purchase and reducing the risk of food borne illness is currently not sufficient incentive for most manufacturers to supplement their process with irradiation.<ref name=\"NYT_P.O.\" /> Nevertheless, food irradiation does take place commercially and volumes are in general increasing at a slow rate, even in the European Union where all member countries allow the irradiation of dried herbs spices and vegetable seasonings but only a few allow other foods to be sold as irradiated.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/biosafety/irradiation/reports_en | title=Annual Reports - Food Safety - European Commission| date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there are some consumers who choose not to purchase irradiated food, a sufficient market has existed for retailers to have continuously stocked irradiated products for years.<ref name=\"StewartPR\">P.

Regardless of treatment source, all processing facilities must adhere to safety standards set by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), Codex Code of Practice for the Radiation Processing of Food, [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC), and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Peter|date=December 2016|title=Food Irradiation: Standards, regulations, and world-wide trade|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|volume=129|pages=30\u201334|doi=10.1016/j.radphyschem.2016.06.005}}</ref> More specifically, ISO 14470 and ISO 9001 provide in-depth information regarding safety in irradiation facilities.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAll commercial irradiation facilities contain safety systems which are designed to prevent exposure of personnel to radiation. The radiation source is constantly shielded by water, concrete, or metal. Irradiation facilities are designed with overlapping layers of protection, interlocks, and safeguards to prevent accidental radiation exposure.<ref name=\":5\" /> Additionally, \"melt-downs\" do not occur in facilities because the radiation source gives off radiation and decay heat; however, the heat is not sufficient to melt any material.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Labeling===\n[[File:Radura-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Radura symbol, as required by U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations to show a food has been treated with ionizing radiation.]]\nThe provisions of the [[Codex Alimentarius]] are that any \"first generation\" product must be labeled \"irradiated\" as any product derived directly from an irradiated raw material; for ingredients the provision is that even the last molecule of an irradiated ingredient must be listed with the ingredients even in cases where the unirradiated ingredient does not appear on the label. The RADURA-logo is optional; several countries use a graphical version that differs from the Codex-version.

The European Community does not provide for the use of the Radura logo and relies exclusively on labeling by the appropriate phrases in the respective languages of the Member States. The European Union enforces its irradiation labeling laws by requiring its member countries to perform tests on a cross section of food items in the market-place and to report to the European Commission.

Therefore, food that is processed as an ingredient by a restaurant or food processor is exempt from the labeling requirement in the US. All irradiated foods must include a prominent Radura symbol followed in addition to the statement \"treated with irradiation\" or \"treated by irradiation.<ref name=\":2\" /> Bulk foods must be individually labeled with the symbol and statement or, alternatively, the Radura and statement should be located next to the sale container.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Packaging ===\nUnder section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, irradiation of prepackaged foods requires premarket approval for not only the irradiation source for a specific food but also for the food packaging material.

Each food approved for irradiation has specific guidelines in terms of minimum and maximum dosage as determined safe by the FDA.<ref name=\":1\" /> Packaging materials containing the food processed by irradiation must also undergo approval. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) amends these rules for use with meat, poultry, and fresh fruit.<ref>USDA/FSIS and USDA/APHIS, various final rules on pork, poultry and fresh fruits: Fed.Reg. 51:1769\u20131771 (1986); 54:387-393 (1989); 57:43588-43600 (1992); and others more</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has approved the use of low-level irradiation as an alternative treatment to pesticides for fruits and vegetables that are considered hosts to a number of insect pests, including fruit flies and seed weevils. Under bilateral agreements that allows less-developed countries to earn income through food exports agreements are made to allow them to irradiate fruits and vegetables at low doses to kill insects, so that the food can avoid quarantine.\n\n====European Union====\nEuropean law dictates that all member countries must allow the sale of irradiated dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings.<ref name=\"EUregulation\">EU: Food Irradiation&nbsp;\u2013 Community Legislation http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/comm_legisl_en.htm</ref> However, these Directives allow Member States to maintain previous clearances food categories the EC's Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) had previously approved (the approval body is now the European Food Safety Authority).

Depending on the dose, some or all of the pathogenic organisms, [[microorganism]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es present are destroyed, slowed down, or rendered incapable of reproduction. Irradiation cannot return spoiled or over-ripe food to a fresh state. If this food was processed by irradiation, further spoilage would cease and ripening would slow down, yet the irradiation would not destroy the toxins or repair the texture, color, or taste of the food.<ref name=\"Loaharanu2\">{{cite journal|last=Loaharanu|first=Paisan|year=1990|title=Food irradiation: Facts or fiction?.|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|journal=IAEA Bulletin|volume=32|issue=2|pages=44\u201348|accessdate=March 3, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304152545/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> When targeting bacteria, most foods are irradiated to significantly reduce the number of active microbes, not to sterilize all microbes in the product. In this respect it is similar to pasteurization.\n\nIrradiation is used to create safe foods for people at high risk of infection, or for conditions where food must be stored for long periods of time and proper storage conditions are not available. Foods that can tolerate irradiation at sufficient doses are treated to ensure that the product is completely [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]]. This is most commonly done with rations for astronauts, and special diets for hospital patients.\n\nIrradiation is used to create shelf-stable products. Since irradiation reduces the populations of spoilage microorganisms, and because pre-packed food can be irradiated, the packaging prevents recontamination of the final product.<ref name=\"FI\" />\n\nIrradiation is used to reduce post-harvest losses. It reduces populations of spoilage micro-organisms in the food and can slow down the speed at which enzymes change the food, and therefore slows spoilage and ripening, and inhibits sprouting (e.g., of potato, onion, and garlic).<ref name=\"Loaharanu\"/>\n\nFood is also irradiated to prevent the spread of invasive pest species through trade in fresh vegetables and fruits, either within countries, or trade across international boundaries. Pests such as insects could be transported to new habitats through trade in fresh produce which could significantly affect agricultural production and the environment were they to establish themselves.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1261545694-KGCNC1z9SSW95acAk0gz0g Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation.] ''[[The New York Times]].'' February 1, 2009.</ref> Some of the potential secondary impacts of irradiation are hypothetical, while others are demonstrated. These effects include cumulative impacts to pathogens, people, and the environment due to the reduction of food quality, the transportation and storage of radioactive goods, and destruction of pathogens, changes in the way we relate to food and how irradiation changes the food production and shipping industries.\n\n===Immediate effects===\nThe radiation source supplies energetic particles or waves. As these waves/particles pass through a target material they [[Event (particle physics)|collide with other particles]]. Around the sites of these collisions [[chemical bonds]] are broken, creating short lived radicals (e.g. the [[hydroxyl radical]], the hydrogen atom and [[solvated electron]]s). These radicals cause further chemical changes by bonding with and or stripping particles from nearby molecules. When collisions damage [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], effective [[reproduction]] becomes unlikely, also when collisions occur in cells, [[cell division]] is often suppressed.<ref name=\"FI\"/>\n\nIrradiation (within the accepted energy limits, as 10 MeV for electrons, 5 MeV for X-rays [US 7.5 MeV] and gamma rays from [[Cobalt-60]]) can not make food radioactive, but it does produce [[#Chemical changes|radiolytic products, and free radicals]] in the food. A few of these products are unique, but not considered dangerous.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\" />\n\nIrradiation can also alter the [[#Food quality|nutritional content and flavor of foods]], much like cooking.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/sources/food_safety.html |title=Radiation Protection-Food Safety|publisher=epa.gov |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> The scale of these chemical changes is not unique. Cooking, smoking, salting, and other less novel techniques, cause the food to be altered so drastically that its original nature is almost unrecognizable, and must be called by a different name. Storage of food also causes dramatic chemical changes, ones that eventually lead to deterioration and spoilage.<ref name=\"ROT\">{{cite web|url=http://science-at-home.org/kid-question-rotting/ |title=kid question rotting |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Misconceptions====\nA major concern is that irradiation might cause chemical changes that are harmful to the consumer. Several national expert groups and two international expert groups evaluated the available data and concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume as long as it remains palatable and maintains its technical properties (e.g. feel, texture, or color).<ref name=\"JECFI\"/><ref name=\"JSGHDI\"/>\n\nIrradiated food does not become radioactive, just as an object exposed to light does not start producing light. Radioactivity is the ability of a substance to emit high energy particles. When particles hit the target materials they may free other highly energetic particles. This ends shortly after the end of the exposure, much like objects stop reflecting light when the source is turned off and warm objects emit heat until they cool down but do not continue to produce their own heat. To modify a material so that it keeps emitting radiation (induce radiation) the atomic cores ([[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]) of the atoms in the target material must be modified.\n\nIt is impossible for food irradiators to induce radiation in a product. Irradiators emit [[electron]]s or [[photon]]s and the radiation is intrinsically radiated at precisely known strengths ([[wavelength]]s for photons, and speeds for electrons). These radiated particles at these strengths can never be strong enough to modify the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the targeted atom in the food, regardless of how many particles hit the target material, and radioactivity can not be induced without modifying the nucleus.<ref name=\"EPA-food-safety\"/>\n\n====Chemical changes====\nCompounds known as free radicals form when food is irradiated. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., accept electrons) and some react very strongly. According to the free-radical theory of aging excessive amounts of these free radicals can lead to cell injury and cell death, which may contribute to many diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rajamani Karthikeyan |author2=Manivasagam T |author3=Anantharaman P |author4=Balasubramanian T |author5=Somasundaram ST |title=Chemopreventive effect of Padina boergesenii extracts on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats |journal=J.

One family of chemicals (2ACB's) are uniquely formed by irradiation (unique radiolytic products), and this product is nontoxic. When fatty acids are irradiated, a family of compounds called 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) are produced. These are thought to be unique radiolytic products.\nWhen irradiating food, all other chemicals occur in a lower or comparable frequency to other food processing techniques.<ref name=\"JECFI\" /><ref name=\"JSGHDI\" /><ref name=\"WHO1994\">anon., Safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated food, WHO, Geneva, 1994</ref><ref name=\"EFSA2011\">{{Cite journal |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1930|title=Scientific Opinion on the Chemical Safety of Irradiation of Food|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=9|issue=4|pages=1930|year=2011}}</ref> Furthermore, the quantities in which they occur in irradiated food are lower or similar to the quantities formed in heat treatments.<ref name=\"JECFI\"/><ref name=\"JSGHDI\"/><ref name=\"WHO1994\"/><ref name=\"EFSA2011\" />\n\nThe radiation doses to cause toxic changes are much higher than the doses used during irradiation, and taking into account the presence of 2-ACBs along with what is known of free radicals, these results lead to the conclusion that there is no significant risk from radiolytic products.<ref name=\"JFDiehl\"/>\n\n====Food quality====\nIonizing radiation can change food quality but in general very high levels of radiation treatment (many thousands of gray) are necessary to adversely change nutritional content, as well as the sensory qualities (taste, appearance, and texture). Irradiation to the doses used commercially to treat food have very little negative impact on the sensory qualities and nutrient content in foods.

The implementation of irradiation on prepackaged foods has been found to impact foods by inducing specific chemical alterations to the food packaging material that migrates into the food.

On the other hand, chain scission is fragmentation of polymer chains that leads to a molecular weight reduction.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Dosimetry===\nThe radiation absorbed dose is the amount energy absorbed per unit weight of the target material. Dose is used because, when the same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The [[SI unit]] for dose is [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy or [[Joule|J]]/[[Kilogram|kg]]). [[Dosimeter]]s are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]], change measurable physical attributes to a degree that can be correlated to the dose received.

Regardless of treatment source, all processing facilities must adhere to safety standards set by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), Codex Code of Practice for the Radiation Processing of Food, [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC), and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Peter|date=December 2016|title=Food Irradiation: Standards, regulations, and world-wide trade|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|volume=129|pages=30\u201334|doi=10.1016/j.radphyschem.2016.06.005}}</ref> More specifically, ISO 14470 and ISO 9001 provide in-depth information regarding safety in irradiation facilities.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAll commercial irradiation facilities contain safety systems which are designed to prevent exposure of personnel to radiation. The radiation source is constantly shielded by water, concrete, or metal. Irradiation facilities are designed with overlapping layers of protection, interlocks, and safeguards to prevent accidental radiation exposure.<ref name=\":5\" /> Additionally, \"melt-downs\" do not occur in facilities because the radiation source gives off radiation and decay heat; however, the heat is not sufficient to melt any material.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Labeling===\n[[File:Radura-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Radura symbol, as required by U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations to show a food has been treated with ionizing radiation.]]\nThe provisions of the [[Codex Alimentarius]] are that any \"first generation\" product must be labeled \"irradiated\" as any product derived directly from an irradiated raw material; for ingredients the provision is that even the last molecule of an irradiated ingredient must be listed with the ingredients even in cases where the unirradiated ingredient does not appear on the label. The RADURA-logo is optional; several countries use a graphical version that differs from the Codex-version. The suggested rules for labeling is published at CODEX-STAN&nbsp;\u2013 1 (2005),<ref name=\"CX-label\">{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/32/CXS_001e.pdf |title=''GENERAL STANDARD FOR THE LABELLING OF PREPACKAGED FOODS''.

The Radura symbol is not a designator of quality. The amount of pathogens remaining is based upon dose and the original content and the dose applied can vary on a product by product basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=179&showFR=1 |title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe European Union follows the Codex's provision to label irradiated ingredients down to the last molecule of irradiated food. The European Community does not provide for the use of the Radura logo and relies exclusively on labeling by the appropriate phrases in the respective languages of the Member States. The European Union enforces its irradiation labeling laws by requiring its member countries to perform tests on a cross section of food items in the market-place and to report to the European Commission. The results are published annually in the OJ of the European Communities.<ref name=\"FDA\">http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/scientific_advices_reports_en.htm\n Expand \"Food Irradiation Reports\" and select respective annual report and language</ref>\n\nThe US defines irradiated foods as foods in which the irradiation causes a material change in the food, or a material change in the consequences that may result from the use of the food. Therefore, food that is processed as an ingredient by a restaurant or food processor is exempt from the labeling requirement in the US. All irradiated foods must include a prominent Radura symbol followed in addition to the statement \"treated with irradiation\" or \"treated by irradiation.<ref name=\":2\" /> Bulk foods must be individually labeled with the symbol and statement or, alternatively, the Radura and statement should be located next to the sale container.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Packaging ===\nUnder section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, irradiation of prepackaged foods requires premarket approval for not only the irradiation source for a specific food but also for the food packaging material.

Countries such as Pakistan and Brazil have adopted the Codex without any reservation or restriction.\n\nStandards that describe calibration and operation for radiation dosimetry, as well as procedures to relate the measured dose to the effects achieved and to report and document such results, are maintained by the [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM international) and are also available as ISO/ASTM standards.<ref>(see Annual Book of ASTM Standards, vol. 12.02, West Conshohocken, PA, US)</ref>\n\nAll of the rules involved in processing food are applied to all foods before they are irradiated.\n\n====United States====\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is the agency responsible for regulation of radiation sources in the United States.<ref name=\":1\" /> Irradiation, as defined by the FDA is a \"[[food additive]]\" as opposed to a food process and therefore falls under the food additive regulations. Each food approved for irradiation has specific guidelines in terms of minimum and maximum dosage as determined safe by the FDA.<ref name=\":1\" /> Packaging materials containing the food processed by irradiation must also undergo approval. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) amends these rules for use with meat, poultry, and fresh fruit.<ref>USDA/FSIS and USDA/APHIS, various final rules on pork, poultry and fresh fruits: Fed.Reg. 51:1769\u20131771 (1986); 54:387-393 (1989); 57:43588-43600 (1992); and others more</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has approved the use of low-level irradiation as an alternative treatment to pesticides for fruits and vegetables that are considered hosts to a number of insect pests, including fruit flies and seed weevils. Under bilateral agreements that allows less-developed countries to earn income through food exports agreements are made to allow them to irradiate fruits and vegetables at low doses to kill insects, so that the food can avoid quarantine.\n\n====European Union====\nEuropean law dictates that all member countries must allow the sale of irradiated dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings.<ref name=\"EUregulation\">EU: Food Irradiation&nbsp;\u2013 Community Legislation http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/comm_legisl_en.htm</ref> However, these Directives allow Member States to maintain previous clearances food categories the EC's Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) had previously approved (the approval body is now the European Food Safety Authority).

These Directives only control food irradiation for food retail and their conditions and controls are not applicable to the irradiation of food for patients requiring sterile diets.\n\nBecause of the [[Single Market]] of the EC any food, even if irradiated, must be allowed to be marketed in any other Member State even if a general ban of food irradiation prevails, under the condition that the food has been irradiated legally in the state of origin.\nFurthermore, imports into the EC are possible from third countries if the irradiation facility had been inspected and approved by the EC and the treatment is legal within the EC or some Member state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:287:0040:0041:EN:PDF |title=Official Journal of the European Communities. 23 October 2002.

The group includes the [[Beijing dialect]], the basis of [[Standard Chinese]]. Because Mandarin originated in [[North China]] and most Mandarin languages and dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as '''Northern Chinese''' ({{zh|s=\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd|labels=no}} ''b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0'' 'northern speech'). Many varieties of Mandarin, such those of the [[Southwest Mandarin|Southwest]] (including Sichuanese) and the [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze]] (including the old capital Nanjing), are not [[mutually intelligible]] or are only partially intelligible with the standard language. Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in [[lists of languages by number of native speakers]] (with nearly a billion).\n\nMandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups, spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area, stretching from [[Yunnan]] in the southwest to [[Xinjiang]] in the northwest and [[Heilongjiang]] in the northeast. This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the [[North China Plain]] compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.\n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. The final stops of [[Middle Chinese]] have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final [[glottal stop]]. Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain [[retroflex]] initial consonants, which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese.\n\nThe [[Historical capitals of China|capital]] has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a national [[lingua franca]] since the 14th century. In the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the [[national language]].

When [[Jesuit]] missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it \"Mandarin\", from its Chinese name ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b98\u8bdd/\u5b98\u8a71}}) or \"language of the officials\".{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|p=537}}\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to [[Standard Chinese]], which is often called simply \"Chinese\". Standard Chinese is based on the [[Beijing dialect|particular Mandarin dialect]] spoken in [[Beijing]], with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects. It is the official spoken language of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), the ''de facto'' official language of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan) and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. It also functions as the language of instruction in Mainland China and in Taiwan. It is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]], under the name \"Chinese\". Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as\n* ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u666e\u901a\u8bdd/\u666e\u901a\u8a71}}, literally 'common speech') in Mainland China,\n* ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u56fd\u8bed/\u570b\u8a9e}}, literally 'national language') in Taiwan or\n* ''Hu\u00e1y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh|\u534e\u8bed/\u83ef\u8a9e}}, literally '[[Huaxia|Hua]] (Chinese) language') in southeast Asia,\nbut not as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\n\nLinguists use the term \"Mandarin\" to refer to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China, which Chinese linguists call ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''. The alternative term ''B\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd/\u5317\u65b9\u8a71}}) or \"Northern dialects\", is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term \"Old Mandarin\" or \"Early Mandarin\" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.\n\nNative speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of \"Mandarin\" (or so-called \"Northern dialects\") in a broader sense. Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common \"Mandarin\" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name\u2014for example [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuan dialect]], Hebei dialect or [[Northeastern Mandarin|Northeastern dialect]], all being regarded as distinct from the standard language.\n\n==History==\nThe hundreds of modern local [[varieties of Chinese]] developed from regional variants of [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]. Traditionally, seven major groups of dialects have been recognized. Aside from Mandarin, the other six are [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] in central China and [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] on the southeast coast.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}} The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987) distinguishes three further groups: [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] (split from Mandarin), [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] in the [[Huizhou region]] of [[Anhui]] and [[Zhejiang]] and [[Pinghua]] in [[Guangxi]] and [[Yunnan]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n=== Old Mandarin ===\n{{main|Old Mandarin}}\n[[File:Mengu Ziyun xia 24b.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A page of the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', covering the syllables ''tsim'' to ''lim'']]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Song dynasty#Northern Song, 959\u20131126|Northern Song]] (959\u20131126) and during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] (1115\u20131234) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the ''[[Qu (poetry)|qu]]'' and ''[[sanqu]]'' poetry.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nThe rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a [[rime dictionary]] called the ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'' (1324). A radical departure from the [[rime table]] tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the [['Phags-pa script]] based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese and the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nIn Middle Chinese, initial [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate consonant|affricates]] showed a three-way contrast between [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]], with the fourth or \"entering tone\", a [[checked tone]] comprising syllables ending in plosives (''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-k''). Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch and by the late [[Tang dynasty]], each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials. When voicing was lost in all languages except the Wu subfamily, this distinction became phonemic and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34\u201336, 52\u201354}}\n\nThe ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the \"even\" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the \"even\" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final ''-m'', which has merged with ''-n'' in modern dialects and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered ''j-'', ''q-'' and ''x-'' in [[pinyin]]).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nThe flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun ''t\u0101'' (\u4ed6), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=111\u2013132}}\n\n=== Vernacular literature ===\nUntil the early 20th century, formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in [[Literary Chinese]], which was modeled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] of the [[Warring States period]] and the [[Han dynasty]]. Over time, the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese, which was learned and composed as a special language. Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties, its economy of expression was greatly valued. For example, {{lang|zh|\u7ffc}} (''y\u00ec'', \"wing\") is unambiguous in written Chinese, but has over 75 [[homophone]]s in [[Standard Chinese]].\n\nThe literary language was less appropriate for recording materials that were meant to be reproduced in oral presentations, materials such as plays and grist for the professional story-teller's mill. From at least the Yuan dynasty, plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', on down to the Qing dynasty novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' and beyond, there developed a literature in [[written vernacular Chinese]] (\u767d\u8bdd/\u767d\u8a71, ''b\u00e1ihu\u00e0''). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=10}}\n\n[[Hu Shih]], a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled ''B\u00e1ihu\u00e0 W\u00e9nxu\u00e9sh\u01d0'' (\"A History of Vernacular Literature\").\n\n=== Koin\u00e9 of the Late Empire ===\n{{main|Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)}}\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|upright|right|''Zhongguo Guanhua'' (\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71), or ''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'' (\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\"), used on the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] (with [[Arcadio Huang]]) in 1742<ref>Fourmont, Etienne (1742).

As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\n\nOfficials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], unable to understand the accents of officials from [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u6b63\u97f3\u66f8\u9662|p=Zh\u00e8ngy\u012bn Sh\u016byu\u00e0n}}) were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:\n* loss of the Middle Chinese voiced initials except for ''v-''\n* merger of ''-m'' finals with ''-n''\n* the characteristic Mandarin four-tone system in open syllables, but retaining a final glottal stop in \"entering tone\" syllables\n* retention of the distinction between [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] velars and dental affricates, the source of the spellings \"Peking\" and \"Tientsin\" for modern \"Beijing\" and \"Tianjin\".{{sfnp|Kaske|2008|pp=48\u201352}}\n\nAs the last two of these features indicate, this language was a [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] based on dialects spoken in the [[Nanjing]] area, though not identical to any single dialect.{{sfnp|Coblin|2003|p=353}} This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to [[Beijing]] in 1421, though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard. As late as 1815, [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] based the [[A Dictionary of the Chinese Language|first English\u2013Chinese dictionary]] on this koin\u00e9 as the standard of the time, though he conceded that the Beijing dialect was gaining in influence.<ref>{{cite book|title=A dictionary of the Chinese language: in three parts, Volume 1|given=Robert|surname=Morrison|year=1815|publisher=P.P.

A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language ({{zh|t=\u570b\u8a9e|w=Kuo\u00b2-y\u00fc\u00b3|s=\u56fd\u8bed|p=Gu\u00f3y\u01d4|given=t}}). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at [[Old National Pronunciation|an artificial pronunciation]], the [[National Languages Committee|National Language Unification Commission]] finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it ''p\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{zh|s=\u666e\u901a\u8bdd|t=\u666e\u901a\u8a71|l=common speech}}).{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3\u201315}}\nSome 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984.  Nationally, the proportion understanding the standard rose from 41% to 90% over the same period.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nThe national language is now used in education, the media and formal occasions in both [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] but not in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. This standard can now be spoken intelligibly by most younger people in [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] with various regional accents. In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], because of their colonial and linguistic history, the sole language of education, the media, formal speech and everyday life remains the local [[Cantonese]]. Mandarin is now common and taught in many schools{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004}} but still has yet to gain traction with the local population. In Mandarin-speaking areas such as [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]], the local dialect is the native tongue of most of the population.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The era of mass education in Standard Chinese has not erased these regional differences, and people may be either [[diglossia|diglossic]] or speak the standard language with a notable accent.\n\nFrom an official point of view, the mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. Technically, both ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' and ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' base their [[phonology]] on the Beijing accent, though ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' also takes some elements from other sources. Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the [[Beijing dialect]]. ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' and ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' also have some differences from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and [[pragmatics]].\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]] are used in mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia, while people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan generally use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]].\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n\n[[File:Mandarin subgroups and Jin group.png|thumb|right|upright=1.65|Distribution of the eight subgroups of Mandarin plus [[Jin Chinese]], which many linguists include as part of Mandarin, according to the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987){{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Map A2}}]]\n\nMost Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The [[North China Plain]] provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in [[Fujian]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183\u2013190}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=22}}\n\nHowever, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people. As a result, there are pronounced regional variations in [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], and [[grammar]],{{sfnp|Szeto|Ansaldo|Matthews|2018}} and many Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible.{{efn|For example:\n* In the early 1950s, only 54% of people in the Mandarin-speaking area could understand Standard Chinese, which was based on the Beijing dialect.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=27}}\n* \"Hence we see that even Mandarin includes within it an unspecified number of languages, very few of which have ever been reduced to writing, that are mutually unintelligible.\"{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=18}}\n* \"the common term assigned by linguists to this group of languages implies a certain homogeneity which is more likely to be related to the sociopolitical context than to linguistic reality, since most of those varieties are not mutually intelligible.\"{{sfnp|Escure|1997|p=144}}\n* \"A speaker of only standard Mandarin might take a week or two to comprehend even simple Kunminghua with ease\u2014and then only if willing to learn it.\"{{sfnp|Blum|2001|p=27}}\n* \"without prior exposure, speakers of different Mandarin dialects often have considerable difficulty understanding each other's local vernacular even if they come from the same province, provided that two or more distinct groups of Mandarin are spoken therein. In some cases, mutual intelligibility is not guaranteed even if the Mandarin dialects concerned belong to the same group and are spoken within the same province. As reported by a native speaker of the Zhenjiang dialect (a Jianghuai (Lower Yangtze) Mandarin dialect spoken in the Jiangsu province), it is impossible for her to understand the Nantong dialect (another Jianghuai Mandarin dialect spoken around 140 kilometers away in the same province).\"{{sfnp|Szeto|Ansaldo|Matthews|2018|pp=241\u2013242}}}}\n\nMost of northeastern China, except for [[Liaoning]], did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century,{{sfnp|Richards|2003|pp=138\u2013139}} and as a result the [[Northeastern Mandarin]] dialects spoken there differ little from the [[Beijing dialect]].{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=21}} The [[Manchu people]] of the area now speak these dialects exclusively; their native language is only maintained in northwestern [[Xinjiang]], where [[Xibe language|Xibe]], a modern dialect, is spoken.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=215\u2013216}}\n\nThe frontier areas of Northwest China were colonized by speakers of Mandarin dialects at the same time, and the dialects in those areas similarly closely resemble their relatives in the core Mandarin area.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=21}} The Southwest was settled early, but the population fell dramatically for obscure reasons in the 13th century, and did not recover until the 17th century.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=21}} The dialects in this area are now relatively uniform.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}} However, long-established cities even very close to [[Beijing]], such as [[Tianjin]], [[Baoding]], [[Shenyang]], and [[Dalian]], have markedly different dialects.\n\nUnlike their compatriots on the southeast coast, few Mandarin speakers engaged in [[Chinese emigration|overseas emigration]] until the late 20th century, but there are now significant communities of them in cities across the world.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}\n\n=== Subgrouping ===\n\n{{see also|List of varieties of Chinese}}\nThe classification of Chinese dialects evolved during the 20th century, and many points remain unsettled. Early classifications tended to follow provincial boundaries or major geographical features.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=36\u201341}}\n\nIn 1936, [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]] produced the first classification based on phonetic criteria, principally the evolution of [[Middle Chinese]] voiced initials. His Mandarin group included dialects of northern and southwestern China, as well as those of [[Hunan]] and northern [[Jiangxi]].{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=41\u201342}}\n[[Li Fang-Kuei]]'s classification of 1937 distinguished the latter two groups as [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] and [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], while splitting the remaining Mandarin dialects between Northern, Lower Yangtze and Southwestern Mandarin groups.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=49}}\n\nThe widely accepted seven-group classification of [[Yuan Jiahua]] in 1960 kept Xiang and Gan separate, with Mandarin divided into Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern and Jiang\u2013Huai (Lower Yangtze) subgroups.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=53\u201354}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=181, 191}}\nOf Yuan's four Mandarin subgroups, the Northwestern dialects are the most diverse, particularly in the province of [[Shanxi]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}} The linguist [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]] proposed that the northwestern dialects of Shanxi and neighbouring areas that retain a final glottal stop in the Middle Chinese [[entering tone]] (plosive-final) category should constitute a separate top-level group called [[Jin Chinese|Jin]].{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=61}} He used this classification in the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987).{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}} Many other linguists continue to include these dialects in the Mandarin group, pointing out that the Lower Yangtze dialects also retain the glottal stop.{{sfnp|Ting|1991|p=190}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55\u201356, 74\u201375}}\n\nThe southern boundary of the Mandarin area, with the central [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], Gan and Xiang groups, is weakly defined due to centuries of diffusion of northern features. Many border varieties have a mixture of features that make them difficult to classify.\nThe boundary between Southwestern Mandarin and Xiang is particularly weak,{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=190}} and in many early classifications the two were not separated.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=41\u201346}} [[Zhou Zhenhe]] and You Rujie include the [[New Xiang]] dialects within Southwestern Mandarin, treating only the more conservative [[Old Xiang]] dialects as a separate group.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=55}}\nThe [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] dialects have features of both Mandarin and Wu, and have been assigned to one or other of these groups or treated as separate by various authors.

In [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze dialects]] and some north-western dialects they have merged as a final [[glottal stop]]. In other dialects they have been lost, with varying effects on the vowel.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} As a result, Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin.

For example, the dialects of [[Jinan]], [[Chengdu]], [[Xi'an]] and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the [[Beijing dialect]] tones of {{IPA|[\u02e5]}} (55), {{IPA|[\u02e7\u02e5]}} (35), {{IPA|[\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6]}} (214), and {{IPA|[\u02e5\u02e9]}} (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194\u2013196}}\n\n[[Middle Chinese]] stops and affricates had a three-way distinction between tenuis, voiceless aspirate and voiced (or breathy voiced) consonants.\nIn Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost, yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non-aspirates in other syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}\nOf the [[four tones]] of Middle Chinese, the level, rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects; the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers, conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial, while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194\u2013195}}\nThe following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects (recall that pinyin ''d'' denotes a non-aspirate {{IPA|/t/}}, while ''t'' denotes an aspirate {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Reflexes of Middle Chinese initials and tones in modern Mandarin\n|-\n!

Baxter's transcription]]), are now pronounced ''j\u012b'', ''j\u01d0'' and ''j\u00ec'' respectively.  Older dictionaries such as ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).\n\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. [[Minjiang dialect|Minjiang]]) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}} (This includes the dialect of [[Nanjing]] on which the [[Postal Romanization]] was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing ''h''.) This development is shared with [[Wu Chinese]] and is thought to represent the pronunciation of [[Old Mandarin]]. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four.  However, modern linguistics considers these syllables as having no [[phonemic]] tone at all.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Reflexes of the Middle Chinese entering tone in Mandarin dialects<ref>Li Rong's 1985 article on Mandarin classification, quoted in {{harvp|Yan|2006|p=61}} and {{harvp|Kurpaska|2010|p=89}}.</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | subgroup\n! colspan=3 | Middle Chinese initial\n|-\n! voiceless\n! voiced [[sonorant]] \n! voiced obstruent\n|-\n| Beijing\n| rowspan=2 | 1,3,4\n| rowspan=4 | 4\n| rowspan=6 | 2\n|-\n| Northeastern\n|-\n| Jiao\u2013Liao\n| 3\n|-\n| Ji\u2013Lu\n| 1\n|-\n| Central Plains\n| colspan=2 | 1\n|-\n| Lan\u2013Yin\n| colspan=2 | 4\n|-\n| Southwestern\n| colspan=3 | 2\n|-\n| Lower Yangtze\n| colspan=3 | marked with final glottal stop (''r\u00f9'')\n|}\n\nAlthough the system of tones is common across Mandarin dialects, their realization as [[tone contour]]s varies widely:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=195\u2013196}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Phonetic realization of Mandarin tones in principal dialects\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Tone name\n| 1 (''y\u012bn p\u00edng'')\n| 2 (''y\u00e1ng p\u00edng'')\n| 3 (''sh\u01ceng'')\n| 4 (''q\u00f9'')\n| marked with<br />glottal stop (''r\u00f9'')\n|-\n| Beijing\n| [[Beijing]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6}} (214)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e9}} (51)\n|-\n| Northeastern\n| [[Harbin]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e8}} (52)\n|-\n| Jiao\u2013Liao\n| [[Yantai]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| ({{IPA|\u02e5}} (55))\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6}} (214)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Ji\u2013Lu\n| [[Tianjin]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9}} (21)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n| {{IPA|\u02e9\u02e9\u02e7}} (113)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n|-\n| [[Shijiazhuang]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e7}} (23)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Central Plains\n| [[Zhengzhou]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9\u02e8}} (312)\n|-\n| [[Luoyang]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e6}} (54)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n|-\n| [[Xi'an]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9}} (21)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n|-\n| [[Tianshui]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|\u02e9\u02e7}} (13)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Lan\u2013Yin\n| [[Lanzhou]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7}} (33)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n|-\n| [[Yinchuan]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| colspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e9\u02e7}} (13)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | Southwestern\n| [[Chengdu]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9}} (21)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)\n|-\n| [[Xichang]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7}} (33)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e8}} (52)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e5}} (45)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9\u0294}} (31)\n|-\n| [[Kunming]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e8}} (212)\n|-\n| [[Wuhan]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n|-\n| [[Liuzhou]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Lower Yangtze\n| [[Yangzhou]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u0294}} (5)\n|-\n| [[Nantong]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9}} (21)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42), {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)*\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u0294}} (4), {{IPA|\u02e5\u0294}} (5)*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Dialects in and around the Nantong area typically have many more than 4 tones, due to influence from the neighbouring [[Wu Chinese|Wu dialects]].\n\nMandarin dialects frequently employ neutral tones in the second syllables of words, creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate. These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThere are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except [[Shanghainese]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more [[homophone]]s. New words have been formed by adding [[affix]]es such as ''lao-'' ({{lang|zh|\u8001}}), ''-zi'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b50}}), ''-(e)r'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u513f}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5152}}), and ''-tou'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5934}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u982d}}), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in ''c\u014dngm\u00e1ng'' ({{lang|zh|\u5306\u5fd9}}), made from elements meaning \"hurried\" and \"busy\".\nA distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun [[reduplication]], which is hardly used in Beijing. In [[Sichuan]], one hears ''b\u0101ob\u0101o'' ({{lang|zh|\u5305\u5305}}) \"handbag\" where Beijing uses ''b\u0101o'r'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5305\u513f}}).\nThere are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|h\u00fadi\u00e9}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8774\u8776}}}}) \"butterfly\".\n\nThe singular [[pronoun]]s in Mandarin are {{lang|zh-Latn|w\u01d2}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6211}}}}) \"I\", {{lang|zh-Latn|n\u01d0}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f60}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59b3}}}}) \"you\", {{lang|zh-Latn|n\u00edn}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u60a8}}}}) \"you (formal)\", and {{lang|zh-Latn|t\u0101}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4ed6}}}}, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5979}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b83}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u7260}}}}) \"he/she/it\", with -{{lang|zh-Latn|men}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5011}}) added for the plural. Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun {{lang|zh-Latn|z\u00e1nmen}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u54b1\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u54b1\u5011}}), which is inclusive of the listener, and {{lang|zh-Latn|w\u01d2men}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u6211\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-hant|\u6211\u5011}}), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns.  While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., [[Shanghainese]] has ''non'' {{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u4fac}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5102}} \"you\" and ''yi'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f0a}}}} \"he/she\").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=182, 195\u2013196}}\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|[[hutong|h\u00fat\u00f2ng]]}} ({{lang|zh|\u80e1\u540c}}) \"alley\".

The least variation occurs in \"formal\" vocabulary\u2014terms dealing with science, law, or government.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{see also|Chinese grammar}}\n\nChinese varieties of all periods have traditionally been considered prime examples of [[analytic language]]s, relying on word order and particles instead of [[inflection]] or [[affix]]es to provide grammatical information such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], or [[Grammatical case|case]].\nAlthough modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=10}}\n\nThe basic word order of [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] is common across Chinese dialects, but there are variations in the order of the two objects of [[ditransitive]] sentences.\nIn northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object (as in English), for example in the Standard Chinese sentence:\n<blockquote>\n{| style=\"border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n| \u6211 || \u7ed9 || \u4f60 || \u4e00\u672c || \u4e66 \u3002\n|-\n| ''w\u01d2'' || ''g\u011bi'' || ''n\u01d0'' || ''y\u00ecb\u011bn'' || ''sh\u016b''.\n|-\n| I || give || you || a (one) || book.\n|}\n</blockquote>\nIn southern dialects, as well as many southwestern and Lower Yangtze dialects, the objects occur in the reverse order.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=162}}{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nMost varieties of Chinese use post-verbal particles to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], but the particles used vary.\nMost Mandarin dialects use the particle ''-le'' (\u4e86) to indicate the [[perfective aspect]] and ''-zhe'' (\u7740/\u8457) for the [[progressive aspect]].\nOther Chinese varieties tend to use different particles, e.g. Cantonese ''zo<sup>2</sup>'' \u5497 and ''gan<sup>2</sup>'' \u7d27/\u7dca respectively.\nThe experiential aspect particle ''-guo'' (\u8fc7/\u904e) is used more widely, except in Southern Min.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nThe subordinative particle ''de'' (\u7684) is characteristic of Mandarin dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=196}}\nSome southern dialects, and a few Lower Yangtze dialects, preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle, while in others a [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nEspecially in conversational Chinese, sentence-final [[particle (grammar)|particles]] alter the inherent meaning of a sentence. Like much vocabulary, particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale. For example, the particle ''ma'' (\u561b), which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention, is replaced by ''yo'' (\u54df) in southern usage.\n\nSome characters in Mandarin can be combined with others to indicate a particular meaning just like prefix and suffix in English. For example, the suffix -er which means the person who is doing the action, e.g. teacher, person who teaches.

The group includes the [[Beijing dialect]], the basis of [[Standard Chinese]]. Because Mandarin originated in [[North China]] and most Mandarin languages and dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as '''Northern Chinese''' ({{zh|s=\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd|labels=no}} ''b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0'' 'northern speech'). Many varieties of Mandarin, such those of the [[Southwest Mandarin|Southwest]] (including Sichuanese) and the [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze]] (including the old capital Nanjing), are not [[mutually intelligible]] or are only partially intelligible with the standard language. Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in [[lists of languages by number of native speakers]] (with nearly a billion).\n\nMandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups, spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area, stretching from [[Yunnan]] in the southwest to [[Xinjiang]] in the northwest and [[Heilongjiang]] in the northeast. This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the [[North China Plain]] compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.\n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. The final stops of [[Middle Chinese]] have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final [[glottal stop]]. Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain [[retroflex]] initial consonants, which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese.\n\nThe [[Historical capitals of China|capital]] has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a national [[lingua franca]] since the 14th century.

When [[Jesuit]] missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it \"Mandarin\", from its Chinese name ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b98\u8bdd/\u5b98\u8a71}}) or \"language of the officials\".{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|p=537}}\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to [[Standard Chinese]], which is often called simply \"Chinese\". Standard Chinese is based on the [[Beijing dialect|particular Mandarin dialect]] spoken in [[Beijing]], with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects. It is the official spoken language of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), the ''de facto'' official language of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan) and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. It also functions as the language of instruction in Mainland China and in Taiwan. It is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]], under the name \"Chinese\". Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as\n* ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u666e\u901a\u8bdd/\u666e\u901a\u8a71}}, literally 'common speech') in Mainland China,\n* ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u56fd\u8bed/\u570b\u8a9e}}, literally 'national language') in Taiwan or\n* ''Hu\u00e1y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh|\u534e\u8bed/\u83ef\u8a9e}}, literally '[[Huaxia|Hua]] (Chinese) language') in southeast Asia,\nbut not as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\n\nLinguists use the term \"Mandarin\" to refer to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China, which Chinese linguists call ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''. The alternative term ''B\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd/\u5317\u65b9\u8a71}}) or \"Northern dialects\", is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term \"Old Mandarin\" or \"Early Mandarin\" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.\n\nNative speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of \"Mandarin\" (or so-called \"Northern dialects\") in a broader sense. Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common \"Mandarin\" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name\u2014for example [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuan dialect]], Hebei dialect or [[Northeastern Mandarin|Northeastern dialect]], all being regarded as distinct from the standard language.\n\n==History==\nThe hundreds of modern local [[varieties of Chinese]] developed from regional variants of [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]. Traditionally, seven major groups of dialects have been recognized. Aside from Mandarin, the other six are [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] in central China and [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] on the southeast coast.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}} The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987) distinguishes three further groups: [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] (split from Mandarin), [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] in the [[Huizhou region]] of [[Anhui]] and [[Zhejiang]] and [[Pinghua]] in [[Guangxi]] and [[Yunnan]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n=== Old Mandarin ===\n{{main|Old Mandarin}}\n[[File:Mengu Ziyun xia 24b.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A page of the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', covering the syllables ''tsim'' to ''lim'']]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Song dynasty#Northern Song, 959\u20131126|Northern Song]] (959\u20131126) and during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] (1115\u20131234) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the ''[[Qu (poetry)|qu]]'' and ''[[sanqu]]'' poetry.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nThe rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a [[rime dictionary]] called the ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'' (1324). A radical departure from the [[rime table]] tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the [['Phags-pa script]] based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese and the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nIn Middle Chinese, initial [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate consonant|affricates]] showed a three-way contrast between [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]], with the fourth or \"entering tone\", a [[checked tone]] comprising syllables ending in plosives (''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-k''). Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch and by the late [[Tang dynasty]], each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials. When voicing was lost in all languages except the Wu subfamily, this distinction became phonemic and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34\u201336, 52\u201354}}\n\nThe ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the \"even\" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the \"even\" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final ''-m'', which has merged with ''-n'' in modern dialects and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered ''j-'', ''q-'' and ''x-'' in [[pinyin]]).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nThe flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun ''t\u0101'' (\u4ed6), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=111\u2013132}}\n\n=== Vernacular literature ===\nUntil the early 20th century, formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in [[Literary Chinese]], which was modeled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] of the [[Warring States period]] and the [[Han dynasty]]. Over time, the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese, which was learned and composed as a special language. Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties, its economy of expression was greatly valued. For example, {{lang|zh|\u7ffc}} (''y\u00ec'', \"wing\") is unambiguous in written Chinese, but has over 75 [[homophone]]s in [[Standard Chinese]].\n\nThe literary language was less appropriate for recording materials that were meant to be reproduced in oral presentations, materials such as plays and grist for the professional story-teller's mill. From at least the Yuan dynasty, plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', on down to the Qing dynasty novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' and beyond, there developed a literature in [[written vernacular Chinese]] (\u767d\u8bdd/\u767d\u8a71, ''b\u00e1ihu\u00e0''). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=10}}\n\n[[Hu Shih]], a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled ''B\u00e1ihu\u00e0 W\u00e9nxu\u00e9sh\u01d0'' (\"A History of Vernacular Literature\").\n\n=== Koin\u00e9 of the Late Empire ===\n{{main|Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)}}\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|upright|right|''Zhongguo Guanhua'' (\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71), or ''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'' (\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\"), used on the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] (with [[Arcadio Huang]]) in 1742<ref>Fourmont, Etienne (1742).

As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\n\nOfficials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], unable to understand the accents of officials from [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u6b63\u97f3\u66f8\u9662|p=Zh\u00e8ngy\u012bn Sh\u016byu\u00e0n}}) were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:\n* loss of the Middle Chinese voiced initials except for ''v-''\n* merger of ''-m'' finals with ''-n''\n* the characteristic Mandarin four-tone system in open syllables, but retaining a final glottal stop in \"entering tone\" syllables\n* retention of the distinction between [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] velars and dental affricates, the source of the spellings \"Peking\" and \"Tientsin\" for modern \"Beijing\" and \"Tianjin\".{{sfnp|Kaske|2008|pp=48\u201352}}\n\nAs the last two of these features indicate, this language was a [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] based on dialects spoken in the [[Nanjing]] area, though not identical to any single dialect.{{sfnp|Coblin|2003|p=353}} This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to [[Beijing]] in 1421, though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard.

A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language ({{zh|t=\u570b\u8a9e|w=Kuo\u00b2-y\u00fc\u00b3|s=\u56fd\u8bed|p=Gu\u00f3y\u01d4|given=t}}). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at [[Old National Pronunciation|an artificial pronunciation]], the [[National Languages Committee|National Language Unification Commission]] finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it ''p\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{zh|s=\u666e\u901a\u8bdd|t=\u666e\u901a\u8a71|l=common speech}}).{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3\u201315}}\nSome 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984.  Nationally, the proportion understanding the standard rose from 41% to 90% over the same period.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nThe national language is now used in education, the media and formal occasions in both [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] but not in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. This standard can now be spoken intelligibly by most younger people in [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] with various regional accents. In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], because of their colonial and linguistic history, the sole language of education, the media, formal speech and everyday life remains the local [[Cantonese]]. Mandarin is now common and taught in many schools{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004}} but still has yet to gain traction with the local population. In Mandarin-speaking areas such as [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]], the local dialect is the native tongue of most of the population.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The era of mass education in Standard Chinese has not erased these regional differences, and people may be either [[diglossia|diglossic]] or speak the standard language with a notable accent.\n\nFrom an official point of view, the mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. Technically, both ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' and ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' base their [[phonology]] on the Beijing accent, though ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' also takes some elements from other sources. Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the [[Beijing dialect]]. ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' and ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' also have some differences from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and [[pragmatics]].\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]] are used in mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia, while people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan generally use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]].\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n\n[[File:Mandarin subgroups and Jin group.png|thumb|right|upright=1.65|Distribution of the eight subgroups of Mandarin plus [[Jin Chinese]], which many linguists include as part of Mandarin, according to the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987){{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Map A2}}]]\n\nMost Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The [[North China Plain]] provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in [[Fujian]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183\u2013190}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=22}}\n\nHowever, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people.

In [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze dialects]] and some north-western dialects they have merged as a final [[glottal stop]]. In other dialects they have been lost, with varying effects on the vowel.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} As a result, Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin.

For example, the dialects of [[Jinan]], [[Chengdu]], [[Xi'an]] and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the [[Beijing dialect]] tones of {{IPA|[\u02e5]}} (55), {{IPA|[\u02e7\u02e5]}} (35), {{IPA|[\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6]}} (214), and {{IPA|[\u02e5\u02e9]}} (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194\u2013196}}\n\n[[Middle Chinese]] stops and affricates had a three-way distinction between tenuis, voiceless aspirate and voiced (or breathy voiced) consonants.\nIn Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost, yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non-aspirates in other syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}\nOf the [[four tones]] of Middle Chinese, the level, rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects; the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers, conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial, while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194\u2013195}}\nThe following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects (recall that pinyin ''d'' denotes a non-aspirate {{IPA|/t/}}, while ''t'' denotes an aspirate {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Reflexes of Middle Chinese initials and tones in modern Mandarin\n|-\n!

Baxter's transcription]]), are now pronounced ''j\u012b'', ''j\u01d0'' and ''j\u00ec'' respectively.  Older dictionaries such as ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).\n\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. [[Minjiang dialect|Minjiang]]) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}} (This includes the dialect of [[Nanjing]] on which the [[Postal Romanization]] was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing ''h''.) This development is shared with [[Wu Chinese]] and is thought to represent the pronunciation of [[Old Mandarin]]. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four.

These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThere are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except [[Shanghainese]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more [[homophone]]s. New words have been formed by adding [[affix]]es such as ''lao-'' ({{lang|zh|\u8001}}), ''-zi'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b50}}), ''-(e)r'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u513f}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5152}}), and ''-tou'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5934}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u982d}}), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in ''c\u014dngm\u00e1ng'' ({{lang|zh|\u5306\u5fd9}}), made from elements meaning \"hurried\" and \"busy\".\nA distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun [[reduplication]], which is hardly used in Beijing. In [[Sichuan]], one hears ''b\u0101ob\u0101o'' ({{lang|zh|\u5305\u5305}}) \"handbag\" where Beijing uses ''b\u0101o'r'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5305\u513f}}).\nThere are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|h\u00fadi\u00e9}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8774\u8776}}}}) \"butterfly\".\n\nThe singular [[pronoun]]s in Mandarin are {{lang|zh-Latn|w\u01d2}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6211}}}}) \"I\", {{lang|zh-Latn|n\u01d0}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f60}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59b3}}}}) \"you\", {{lang|zh-Latn|n\u00edn}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u60a8}}}}) \"you (formal)\", and {{lang|zh-Latn|t\u0101}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4ed6}}}}, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5979}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b83}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u7260}}}}) \"he/she/it\", with -{{lang|zh-Latn|men}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5011}}) added for the plural. Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun {{lang|zh-Latn|z\u00e1nmen}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u54b1\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u54b1\u5011}}), which is inclusive of the listener, and {{lang|zh-Latn|w\u01d2men}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u6211\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-hant|\u6211\u5011}}), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns.  While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., [[Shanghainese]] has ''non'' {{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u4fac}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5102}} \"you\" and ''yi'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f0a}}}} \"he/she\").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=182, 195\u2013196}}\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|[[hutong|h\u00fat\u00f2ng]]}} ({{lang|zh|\u80e1\u540c}}) \"alley\".

The least variation occurs in \"formal\" vocabulary\u2014terms dealing with science, law, or government.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{see also|Chinese grammar}}\n\nChinese varieties of all periods have traditionally been considered prime examples of [[analytic language]]s, relying on word order and particles instead of [[inflection]] or [[affix]]es to provide grammatical information such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], or [[Grammatical case|case]].\nAlthough modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=10}}\n\nThe basic word order of [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] is common across Chinese dialects, but there are variations in the order of the two objects of [[ditransitive]] sentences.\nIn northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object (as in English), for example in the Standard Chinese sentence:\n<blockquote>\n{| style=\"border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n| \u6211 || \u7ed9 || \u4f60 || \u4e00\u672c || \u4e66 \u3002\n|-\n| ''w\u01d2'' || ''g\u011bi'' || ''n\u01d0'' || ''y\u00ecb\u011bn'' || ''sh\u016b''.\n|-\n| I || give || you || a (one) || book.\n|}\n</blockquote>\nIn southern dialects, as well as many southwestern and Lower Yangtze dialects, the objects occur in the reverse order.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=162}}{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nMost varieties of Chinese use post-verbal particles to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], but the particles used vary.\nMost Mandarin dialects use the particle ''-le'' (\u4e86) to indicate the [[perfective aspect]] and ''-zhe'' (\u7740/\u8457) for the [[progressive aspect]].\nOther Chinese varieties tend to use different particles, e.g. Cantonese ''zo<sup>2</sup>'' \u5497 and ''gan<sup>2</sup>'' \u7d27/\u7dca respectively.\nThe experiential aspect particle ''-guo'' (\u8fc7/\u904e) is used more widely, except in Southern Min.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nThe subordinative particle ''de'' (\u7684) is characteristic of Mandarin dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=196}}\nSome southern dialects, and a few Lower Yangtze dialects, preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle, while in others a [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nEspecially in conversational Chinese, sentence-final [[particle (grammar)|particles]] alter the inherent meaning of a sentence. Like much vocabulary, particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale. For example, the particle ''ma'' (\u561b), which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention, is replaced by ''yo'' (\u54df) in southern usage.\n\nSome characters in Mandarin can be combined with others to indicate a particular meaning just like prefix and suffix in English. For example, the suffix -er which means the person who is doing the action, e.g. teacher, person who teaches. In Mandarin the character \u5e2b functions the same thing, it is combined with \u6559, which means teach, to form the word teacher.\n\nList of several common Chinese prefixes and suffixes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
