The city is near the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] close to the border with [[South Korea]] and contains the remains of the [[Manwoldae|Manwoldae palace]]. Called Songdo while it was the ancient capital of Goryeo, the city prospered as a trade centre that produced Korean [[ginseng]]. Kaesong now functions as the DPRK's [[light industry]] centre. \n\nDuring the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] from 1910 to 1945, the city was known by the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Japanese pronunciation of its name]], \"Kaij\u014d\".<ref>http://www.drben.net/Koreas_Report/Sources/Korea_Maps/Historic/1945/Map-Japan-Korea-1945-01.html</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, Kaesong was part of South Korea and under its control. The 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] left the city under North Korean control. It is the only city to have changed hands as a result of the armistice agreement. Due to the city's proximity to the border with South Korea, Kaesong has hosted cross-border economic exchanges between the two countries as well as the jointly run [[Kaesong Industrial Region]].\n\nAs of 2009, the city had a population of 192,578.<ref name=\"Nkorea2009\">{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:240|title=City population by sex, city and city type|publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=2009|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kaesong_in_Summer.jpg|thumb|left|Kaesong in summer]]\nThe earliest archaeological signs of habitation in the Kaesong area date from the [[Neolithic]]. Artifacts such as [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun pottery]], stone ware, and stone axes have been excavated from [[Osongsan]] and [[Kaesong Nasong]], the double-walled fortress of Kaesong. As Kaesong has been occupied by various states throughout centuries, its name has changed. It was in the realm of [[Mahan confederacy]], and was referred to as ''Busogap'' during the rule of [[Goguryeo]]. Before the strength of [[Baekje]] was retreated to the southwest of [[Jungnyeong]], [[Mungyeong Saejae]], and [[Asan Bay]] in 475, the area had been a part of [[Baekje]] for about 100 years.\n\nHowever, it became a territory of Silla in 555, the 16th year of [[Jinheung of Silla]]'s reign, and its name was changed to ''Song'ak-gun'' during the period. According to the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', when a castle was built in the site in 694, the third year of [[Hyoso of Silla]]'s reign, Kaesong was referred to as \"Song'ak (\uc1a1\uc545; \u677e\u5dbd)\". Therefore, it is assumed that the name Song'ak had been used at least before the time.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|script-title=ko:\uac1c\uc131\uc2dc \u958b\u57ce\u5e02 (Kaesong)|language=Korean|publisher=Nate/ [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082842/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|archivedate=2011-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===Goryeo===\nSilla began to decline in late 9th century, and a period of rival warlords ensued. In 898, Kaesong fell under the hand of [[Gung Ye]], the founder of his short-lived state, [[Taebong]], and then became a part of [[Goryeo]] in 919 by its founder, Wang Geon, who was enthroned as [[Taejo of Goryeo]]. Taejo established the capital in the south of Song'ak, and incorporated Kaesong into Song'ak under the name of \"Gaeju\". In 919, Kaesong became the national capital. In 960, the 11th year of [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the city was renamed Gaegyeong, and in 995, the 14th year of [[Seonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, it was elevated to \"Gaesong-bu\". The Gaeseong-bu is a combined term of Song'ak-gun, and Gaesong-gun, which is different from the region of the pre-1945 Gaesong-ri, Seo-myeon, Kaepung-gun. In 1010, the first year of [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the palace and houses were almost burnt down during the [[second conflict in the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War]], so in 1018, Gaesong-bu was relegated for the \"bu\" system, and became to govern the three hyeon unites  of Jeongju, Deoksu, and Gangeum.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nIn the late 12th century, there was instability in both the government and the countryside. A slave named [[Manjeok|Manj\u01d2k]] (or spelled as Manjeok) (\ub9cc\uc801; \u842c\u7a4d) led a group of slaves who gathered outside Kaesong in 1198. The revolt plot was suppressed by [[Choe Chung-heon]].<ref>Michael J. Seth. ''A concise history of Korea: from the neolithic period through the nineteenth century.'' pp. 99\u2013102.

When Korea was partitioned at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] after [[World War II]], Kaesong was on the southern side of the line (within South Korea).\n\nHowever, the [[battle of Kaesong-Munsan]] was won by the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) in the first days of the Korean War. The city was recaptured by UN Forces on 9 October 1950 during the [[UN Offensive, 1950|pursuit of the KPA]] that followed the successful [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landings]]. UN Forces [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River#Aftermath|abandoned]] the city 16 December 1950 during the withdrawal to the [[Imjin River]] following the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] intervention in the war. Kaesong would remain under Chinese/North Korean control until the end of the war.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nCeasefire negotiations began in Kaesong on 10 July 1951, but were moved to [[Panmunjom]] on 25 October 1951. The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] signed on 27 July 1953 recognised [[North Korea]]n control over Kaesong making it the only city to change control from South Korea to North Korea as a result of the war. Postwar Kaesong and the part of Kyonggi Province that came to be occupied was organized into \"Kaesong Region\" (''Kaes\u014fng Chigu;'' \uac1c\uc131 \uc9c0\uad6c; \u958b\u57ce \u5730\u5340). In 1957, Kaesong became a \"Directly Governed City\" (''Kaes\u014fng Chikhalsi;'' \uac1c\uc131 \uc9c1\ud560\uc2dc; \u958b\u57ce \u76f4\u8f44\u5e02). In 2002, [[Kaesong Industrial Region|Kaes\u014fng Industrial Region]] was formed from part of Kaesong. In 2003, the remaining part of Kaesong (excluding the Industrial Region) became part of [[North Hwanghae Province]].

The city is near the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] close to the border with [[South Korea]] and contains the remains of the [[Manwoldae|Manwoldae palace]]. Called Songdo while it was the ancient capital of Goryeo, the city prospered as a trade centre that produced Korean [[ginseng]]. Kaesong now functions as the DPRK's [[light industry]] centre. \n\nDuring the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] from 1910 to 1945, the city was known by the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Japanese pronunciation of its name]], \"Kaij\u014d\".<ref>http://www.drben.net/Koreas_Report/Sources/Korea_Maps/Historic/1945/Map-Japan-Korea-1945-01.html</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, Kaesong was part of South Korea and under its control. The 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] left the city under North Korean control. It is the only city to have changed hands as a result of the armistice agreement. Due to the city's proximity to the border with South Korea, Kaesong has hosted cross-border economic exchanges between the two countries as well as the jointly run [[Kaesong Industrial Region]].\n\nAs of 2009, the city had a population of 192,578.<ref name=\"Nkorea2009\">{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:240|title=City population by sex, city and city type|publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=2009|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kaesong_in_Summer.jpg|thumb|left|Kaesong in summer]]\nThe earliest archaeological signs of habitation in the Kaesong area date from the [[Neolithic]]. Artifacts such as [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun pottery]], stone ware, and stone axes have been excavated from [[Osongsan]] and [[Kaesong Nasong]], the double-walled fortress of Kaesong. As Kaesong has been occupied by various states throughout centuries, its name has changed. It was in the realm of [[Mahan confederacy]], and was referred to as ''Busogap'' during the rule of [[Goguryeo]]. Before the strength of [[Baekje]] was retreated to the southwest of [[Jungnyeong]], [[Mungyeong Saejae]], and [[Asan Bay]] in 475, the area had been a part of [[Baekje]] for about 100 years.\n\nHowever, it became a territory of Silla in 555, the 16th year of [[Jinheung of Silla]]'s reign, and its name was changed to ''Song'ak-gun'' during the period. According to the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', when a castle was built in the site in 694, the third year of [[Hyoso of Silla]]'s reign, Kaesong was referred to as \"Song'ak (\uc1a1\uc545; \u677e\u5dbd)\". Therefore, it is assumed that the name Song'ak had been used at least before the time.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|script-title=ko:\uac1c\uc131\uc2dc \u958b\u57ce\u5e02 (Kaesong)|language=Korean|publisher=Nate/ [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082842/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|archivedate=2011-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===Goryeo===\nSilla began to decline in late 9th century, and a period of rival warlords ensued. In 898, Kaesong fell under the hand of [[Gung Ye]], the founder of his short-lived state, [[Taebong]], and then became a part of [[Goryeo]] in 919 by its founder, Wang Geon, who was enthroned as [[Taejo of Goryeo]]. Taejo established the capital in the south of Song'ak, and incorporated Kaesong into Song'ak under the name of \"Gaeju\". In 919, Kaesong became the national capital. In 960, the 11th year of [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the city was renamed Gaegyeong, and in 995, the 14th year of [[Seonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, it was elevated to \"Gaesong-bu\". The Gaeseong-bu is a combined term of Song'ak-gun, and Gaesong-gun, which is different from the region of the pre-1945 Gaesong-ri, Seo-myeon, Kaepung-gun. In 1010, the first year of [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the palace and houses were almost burnt down during the [[second conflict in the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War]], so in 1018, Gaesong-bu was relegated for the \"bu\" system, and became to govern the three hyeon unites  of Jeongju, Deoksu, and Gangeum.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nIn the late 12th century, there was instability in both the government and the countryside. A slave named [[Manjeok|Manj\u01d2k]] (or spelled as Manjeok) (\ub9cc\uc801; \u842c\u7a4d) led a group of slaves who gathered outside Kaesong in 1198. The revolt plot was suppressed by [[Choe Chung-heon]].<ref>Michael J. Seth. ''A concise history of Korea: from the neolithic period through the nineteenth century.'' pp. 99\u2013102.

When Korea was partitioned at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] after [[World War II]], Kaesong was on the southern side of the line (within South Korea).\n\nHowever, the [[battle of Kaesong-Munsan]] was won by the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) in the first days of the Korean War. The city was recaptured by UN Forces on 9 October 1950 during the [[UN Offensive, 1950|pursuit of the KPA]] that followed the successful [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landings]]. UN Forces [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River#Aftermath|abandoned]] the city 16 December 1950 during the withdrawal to the [[Imjin River]] following the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] intervention in the war. Kaesong would remain under Chinese/North Korean control until the end of the war.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nCeasefire negotiations began in Kaesong on 10 July 1951, but were moved to [[Panmunjom]] on 25 October 1951. The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] signed on 27 July 1953 recognised [[North Korea]]n control over Kaesong making it the only city to change control from South Korea to North Korea as a result of the war. Postwar Kaesong and the part of Kyonggi Province that came to be occupied was organized into \"Kaesong Region\" (''Kaes\u014fng Chigu;'' \uac1c\uc131 \uc9c0\uad6c; \u958b\u57ce \u5730\u5340). In 1957, Kaesong became a \"Directly Governed City\" (''Kaes\u014fng Chikhalsi;'' \uac1c\uc131 \uc9c1\ud560\uc2dc; \u958b\u57ce \u76f4\u8f44\u5e02). In 2002, [[Kaesong Industrial Region|Kaes\u014fng Industrial Region]] was formed from part of Kaesong. In 2003, the remaining part of Kaesong (excluding the Industrial Region) became part of [[North Hwanghae Province]]. The city is close to the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] that divides North and South Korea.\n\nIn October 2019, Kaesong became a \"Special City\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200213161400504?input=1195m|script-title=\u5317, \uc0c8 '\uce58\uc548\ucd1d\uc218'\uc5d0 \uae40\uc815\ud638\u2026\"\uac1c\uc131\uc2dc, \ud2b9\ubcc4\uc2dc\ub85c \uc2b9\uaca9\"|title=Bae, sae 'chianchongsu'e gimjeongho\u2026\"Gaeseongsi, teugbyeolsilo seung-gyeog\"|website=Yonhap News Agency|date=2020-02-13|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|Geography of North Korea}}\n[[File:Kaesong Mountains.JPG|thumb|left|Mountains of Kaesong]]\nLocated in the center of Korea, Kaesong is the southernmost city of North Korea.

The city center surrounds the much smaller Mt. Janam (103&nbsp;m), on which is located the city's iconic [[Kim Il Sung]] statue.\n\nIn the northern part of Kaesong, the end of the [[Ahobiryong Mountains|Ahobiry\u014fng]] range creates the northernmost border of Kaesong City. This range consists of Mts. [[Chonmasan|Ch\u014fnma]] (757 m), S\u014fngg\u014f, Myoji (764 m), Suryong (716 m), Ches\u014fk (749 m), Hwajang (558 m), and Ogwan.

BS is caused by mutations in the ''BLM'' gene which is a member of the RecQ DNA [[helicase]] family. Mutations in other members of this family, namely [[WRN (gene)|WRN]] and RECQL4, are associated with the clinical entities [[Werner syndrome]] and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively. More broadly, Bloom syndrome is a member of a class of clinical entities that are characterized by chromosomal instability, genomic instability, or both and by cancer predisposition.\n\nCells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive crossovers between homologous chromosomes and [[sister chromatid exchange]]s (SCEs).

The duplication process is called DNA replication. Errors made during DNA replication can lead to mutations. The BLM protein is important in maintaining the stability of the DNA during the replication process. Lack of BLM protein or protein activity leads to an increase in mutations; however, the molecular mechanism(s) by which BLM maintains stability of the chromosomes is still a very active area of research.\n\nPersons with Bloom syndrome have an enormous increase in exchange events between homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids (the two DNA molecules that are produced by the DNA replication process); and there are increases in chromosome breakage and rearrangements compared to persons who do not have Bloom's syndrome. Direct connections between the molecular processes in which BLM operates and the chromosomes themselves are under investigation. The relationships between molecular defects in Bloom syndrome cells, the chromosome mutations that accumulate in somatic cells (the cells of the body), and the many clinical features seen in Bloom syndrome are also areas of intense research.\n[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Bloom syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nBloom syndrome is diagnosed using any of three tests - the presence of quadriradial (Qr, a four-armed chromatid interchange) in cultured blood lymphocytes, and/or the elevated levels of [[sister chromatid exchange]] in cells of any type, and/or the mutation in the BLM gene.

BS is caused by mutations in the ''BLM'' gene which is a member of the RecQ DNA [[helicase]] family. Mutations in other members of this family, namely [[WRN (gene)|WRN]] and RECQL4, are associated with the clinical entities [[Werner syndrome]] and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively. More broadly, Bloom syndrome is a member of a class of clinical entities that are characterized by chromosomal instability, genomic instability, or both and by cancer predisposition.\n\nCells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive crossovers between homologous chromosomes and [[sister chromatid exchange]]s (SCEs). The condition was discovered and first described by New York dermatologist Dr. David Bloom in 1954.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bloom D |title=Congenital telangiectatic erythema resembling lupus erythematosus in dwarfs; probably a syndrome entity |journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=754\u20138 |year=1954 |pmid=13206391 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.1954.02050100756008}}</ref>\n\nBloom syndrome has also appeared in the older literature as '''Bloom-Torre-Machacek syndrome'''.<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book |author1=James, William |author2=Berger, Timothy |author3=Elston, Dirk |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |page=575 |edition=10th}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\nThe most prominent feature of Bloom syndrome is proportional small size.

The facial rash appears most prominently on the cheeks, nose, and around the lips. It is described as [[erythema]]tous, that is red and inflamed, and [[telangiectasia|telangiectatic]], that is characterized by dilated blood vessels at the skin's surface. The rash commonly also affects the backs of the hands and neck, and it can develop on any other sun-exposed areas of the skin. The rash is variably expressed, being present in a majority but not all persons with Bloom syndrome, and it is on average less severe in females than in males. Moreover, the sun sensitivity can resolve in adulthood. There are other dermatologic changes, including hypo-pigmented and hyper-pigmented areas, [[cafe-au-lait spot]]s, and telangiectasias, which can appear on the face and on the ocular surface.\n\nThere is a characteristic facial appearance that includes a long, narrow face; prominent nose, cheeks, and ears; and [[micrognathism]] or undersized jaw.

The duplication process is called DNA replication. Errors made during DNA replication can lead to mutations. The BLM protein is important in maintaining the stability of the DNA during the replication process. Lack of BLM protein or protein activity leads to an increase in mutations; however, the molecular mechanism(s) by which BLM maintains stability of the chromosomes is still a very active area of research.\n\nPersons with Bloom syndrome have an enormous increase in exchange events between homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids (the two DNA molecules that are produced by the DNA replication process); and there are increases in chromosome breakage and rearrangements compared to persons who do not have Bloom's syndrome. Direct connections between the molecular processes in which BLM operates and the chromosomes themselves are under investigation. The relationships between molecular defects in Bloom syndrome cells, the chromosome mutations that accumulate in somatic cells (the cells of the body), and the many clinical features seen in Bloom syndrome are also areas of intense research.\n[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Bloom syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nBloom syndrome is diagnosed using any of three tests - the presence of quadriradial (Qr, a four-armed chromatid interchange) in cultured blood lymphocytes, and/or the elevated levels of [[sister chromatid exchange]] in cells of any type, and/or the mutation in the BLM gene.

Efforts to minimize exposure to other known environmental mutagens are also advisable.\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nBloom syndrome is an extremely rare disorder in most populations and the frequency of the disease has not been measured in most populations.

It is a song for [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|Lutheran Communion]], and first appeared in 1649 in Cr\u00fcger's hymnal ''Geistliche Kirchen-Melodien'', later also in the 1653 edition of his {{Lang|la|[[Praxis pietatis melica]]}}. The hymn was often set to music to be played or sung under communion.\n\nIn the current German Protestant hymnal, ''[[Evangelisches Gesangbuch]]'', it is EG 218, retaining six of the original nine [[stanza]]s. A translation by [[Catherine Winkworth]], \"Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness\" of 1858, appears in 100 hymnals.\n\n== Text  ==\nThe hymn is a song for ''Abendmahl'', the [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|Lutheran Communion]]. The hymn lyrics were written in nine [[stanza]]s by [[Johann Franck]], who was not a minister but a politician and mayor,<ref name=\"Lamberti\" /> between 1646 and 1653.<ref name=\"chorale text\" /> Franck compared the unity between [[Jesus]] and a Christian receiving communion to the closeness of bridegroom and bride.<ref name=\"Lamberti\" /> With a melody by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] from 1649, the song appeared first in Cr\u00fcger's hymnal ''Geistliche Kirchen-Melodien'' (Sacred church melodies) of 1649,<ref name=\"M\u00fcnster\" /> and was included, now in nine stanzas in his {{Lang|la|[[Praxis pietatis melica]]}} in the 1653 edition.<ref name=\"Lund\" /><ref name=\"Praxis\" /> In the 19th century, the hymn became the communion hymn in German-speaking countries.<ref name=\"Lamberti\" />\n\nIn the current German Protestant hymnal, ''[[Evangelisches Gesangbuch]]'', the song is EG 218, rendering six stanzas as follows:<ref name=\"chorale melody\" />\n\n{{quote|<poem>1.

However, parks are still prevalent in the town as part of the country's green initiative. Parks include [[Ang Mo Kio Town Garden East]] and [[Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West]]. Although not technically located within Ang Mo Kio itself, the [[Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park]] in the adjacent town of Bishan was designed to serve residents of both towns. The park itself straddles along the Ang Mo Kio\u2013Bishan boundary, making it easily accessible from Ang Mo Kio.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the locality is synonymous with phrases in the [[Minnan (linguistics)|Hokkien]] dialect which either relates it as the \"Red Tomato\", or the \"Bridge of the Caucasian\". The [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] suggested could be a [[British people|British]] Lady called [[Lady Jennifer Windsor]]. Lady Windsor was the wife of Lord Windsor, a wealthy merchant who had a huge estate in the Upper Thomson Area in the 1920s until after World War II. Ang Mo Kio could also have been named in reference to Mr John Turnbull Thomson, a British civil engineer and artist who played an instrumental role in the development of the early infrastructure of late 19th century Singapore and New Zealand. Old survey maps relate the area as the \"Region of Ang Mo Kio\".<ref>{{cite web|title=An early surveyor in Singapore : John Turnbull Thomson in Singapore, 1841\u20131853 / John Hall-Jones, Christopher Hooi.|url=http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=4082509|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> The area has also been historically referred to as Kou Teu Kio.<ref>{{cite web|title=HDB Towns, Your Home - Ang Mo Kio|url=http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/ang-mo-kio|publisher=[[Housing and Development Board]]}}</ref>\n\n===Lady Jennifer Windsor===\nLady Windsor was linked to an unnamed crossing that bridged a stream running off the Peirce Reservoir. It suggested where the name \"Ang Mo Kio\" might have originated. An incident happened in 1923 when Lady Windsor lost 3 of her children; Harry, Paul and Angela. The 3 children were supposed to have visited a family friend staying in the Upper Thomson area, and were lost in the woods. It was later found that the 2 boys were playing by the wooden crossing when a sudden gush swept them away. Their bodies were found about 2 miles from the bridge. However, the body of Angela was never found.\n\nIt was said that locals started hearing cries of a little girl and that prompted Lady Windsor to stay by the bridge for the rest of her life. She thought that it was a ghost. She told her close friends that she had heard her daughter's voice by the bridge and she wanted to accompany her soul. Lady Windsor would spend the whole day by the bridge, reading or knitting. People soon got used to her perpetual presence by the bridge that they soon referred to the bridge as the \"Red Hair Bridge\"; which in its right sense should have been called \"Lady Windsor Bridge\".\n\nLady Windsor died in 1963 and it was only thereafter that locals no longer heard the voice of the little girl.\n\n===John Turnbull Thomson===\nJohn Turnbull Thomson (1821\u20131884) was responsible for building a bridge during the colonial days of Singapore, to facilitate logistic transportation to the nearby British military bases at Seletar until the British military withdrawal in the 1970s. After the bridge was completed, the locals often referred to it as Ang Mo Kio or \"Caucasian Bridge\" or \"Red Hair Bridge\", since it was built by a Caucasian; John Turnbull Thomson had a distinctive red-coloured hair. Nowadays, \"Ang Mo\" is a popular term to refer to Caucasians in Singapore.\n\nThe name \"Thomson\" was also used extensively in the naming of several roads in and around Ang Mo Kio. This explanation is currently being listed at the Heritage Corridor in Deyi Secondary School located in Ang Mo Kio. The explanation is also more widely accepted by the local historians and listed in the National Library Board. The bridge, however, no longer exists. It was, according to local historians, located at the junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Upper Thomson Road. Little of the bridge built by Thomson remains.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nAng Mo Kio Planning Area, as defined by the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]], sits within the North-East Region of Singapore. [[Yishun]] bounds Ang Mo Kio to the north, [[Sengkang]] to the northeast, [[Serangoon]] to the east, [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]] to the south and [[Central Water Catchment]] to the west.\n\nThe main component of the planning area, Ang Mo Kio New Town, is located within it. The town itself has seven neighbourhoods, with Neighbourhood 1 to the west, cycling in an anti-clockwise direction to Neighbourhood 6 to the north, and ending with Neighbourhood 7 for the town centre. The town centre is located in the heart of Ang Mo Kio and is sandwiched by two town gardens set on natural hillocks.\n\n===Subzones===\nAng Mo Kio Planning Area is officially divided into 12 subzones for urban planning and statistical purposes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name of estates\n!Location\n!Notable structures\n!Accessibility\n|-\n|Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\n|Areas around Ang Mo Kio Central 1, Ang Mo Kio Central 2 and Ang Mo Kio Central 3\n|Ang Mo Kio Public Library, [[Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange]] and [[AMK Hub]]\n|[[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]] and buses\n|-\n|[[Cheng San]]\n|Estates along Ang Mo Kio Street 51, Ang Mo Kio Street 52, Ang Mo Kio Street 53 and Ang Mo Kio Street 54\n|[[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]], [[Ang Mo Kio Town Garden East]] and [[Anderson Secondary School]]\n|[[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]] and buses\n|-\n|[[Chong Boon]]\n|Southeast Ang Mo Kio\n[[Deyi Secondary School]] and [[Pathlight School]]\n|Buses\n|-\n|[[Kebun Baru]]\n|Precincts west of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\n|[[Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West]], Kebun Baru Community Club, Kebun Baru Neighbourhood Police Post, [[CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School]] and the future [[Mayflower MRT station]]\n|Buses\n|-\n|Sembawang Hills\n|Estates along Seraya Crescent, Casuarina Road, Nemesu Avenue, Old Upper Thomson Road, Sembawang Hills Drive and Thomson Hills Drive\n|Sembawang Hills Food Centre\n|Buses\n|-\n|Shangri-La\n|Southwest Ang Mo Kio\n|[[Mayflower Secondary School]], Ang Mo Kio Primary School, [[Ang Mo Kio Secondary School]] and Ang Mo Kio Community Centre\n|Buses\n|-\n|Tagore\n|Northwest Ang Mo Kio\n|Teacher's Estate, Tagore Industrial Estate and the future [[Lentor MRT station]]\n|Buses\n|-\n|Townsville\n|Areas around Ang Mo Kio Street 31 and Ang Mo Kio Street 32\n|Ang Mo Kio Swimming Complex, Teck Ghee Neighbourhood Police Post and Townsville Primary School\n|Buses\n|-\n|[[Yio Chu Kang]]\n|Areas north of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\n|[[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]], [[Yio Chu Kang Bus Interchange]], [[Yio Chu Kang Stadium]], Yio Chu Kang Swimming Complex, [[Ang Mo Kio Police Division]] Headquarters, Ang Mo Kio North Neighbourhood Police Post, Ang Mo Kio Fire Station, Ang Mo Kio Bus Depot (SBS Transit) and [[Anderson Junior College]]\n|[[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]] and buses\n|-\n|Yio Chu Kang East\n|Northeast Ang Mo Kio\n|[[Nanyang Polytechnic]], [[ITE College Central]] and Amoy Quee Camp\n|[[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]] and buses\n|-\n|Yio Chu Kang North\n|Areas bounded by [[Seletar Expressway]], [[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway]], [[Yio Chu Kang Road]] and [[Lentor Avenue]]\n|Sungei Seletar Simpang Kiri\n|Buses\n|-\n|Yio Chu Kang West\n|Areas bounded by Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 and [[Yio Chu Kang Road]]\n|[[Anderson Primary School]], [[Presbyterian High School]] and [[Yio Chu Kang Secondary School]]\n|[[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]] and buses\n|}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe present-day Ang Mo Kio area remained largely uninhabited throughout the 19th century. Settlers were attracted to the area only around the start of the 20th century, as a result of the rubber boom. In the old maps of Singapore, much of the area was labelled as the Ang Mo Kio Forest Reserve with many plantation estates.\n\nThe village that sprang up with the clearing of the land took on the name \"Ang Mo Kio\". The immigrant Chinese, mostly Hokkiens were engaged in rubber-planting and tapping. Cheng San Village where Ang Mo Kio New Town now stands was once a huge rubber plantation. The 1922 to 1932 world slump in rubber prices made many tappers and labourers turn to pig and poultry farming or market gardening. During World War II when Singapore was occupied, more people moved to Ang Mo Kio to take up farming.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Ang mo kio.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre.]]\nThe development of the present Ang Mo Kio Town began in 1973,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ang Mo Kio, My Hometown of 25 years|url=http://remembersingapore.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/ang-mo-kio-my-hometown|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> and was the seventh [[New town]] to be built in Singapore. The first part of Ang Mo Kio was being built by 1979, and the Yio Chu Kang part of the town was completed in 1981. The present {{convert|29|ha}} self-contained town centre was built over an elongated valley formerly occupied by squatters. It has commercial offices, cultural and community facilities serving up to 200,000 residents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.gov.sg/dataset/estimated-resident-population-living-in-hdb-flats?view_id%3D31afe0d7-b8e7-41bd-b868-2d1bdac87779%26resource_id%3Db29c1af8-e11a-4e61-b813-933db9f69633|title=Estimated Singapore Resident Population in HDB Flats|website=Data.gov.sg|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the town won the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) Outstanding Buildings Award in 1983. The swimming complex at Avenue 1 also won the 1986 SIA Architectural Award for its unique \"tetrahedral skylight\" design. It was the first town to be designed in metric measurements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_230_2005-01-25.html|title=Ang Mo Kio {{!}} Infopedia|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\nFollowing the norm in the 1970s, most of the flats are organised in 12-storey long blocks or 25-storey point blocks. In recent years, certain parts of the estate have been rebuilt as part of the long process of renewal. As a result, segments of higher blocks clustered together can be seen interleaved with the older blocks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nWith Ang Mo Kio becoming an matured estate, several plots of residential land have been cleared up and sold to private developers for redevelopment. Many private residential projects are being constructed on these sites.\n\n===Transportation===\n\n==== Road network ====\n[[File:AngMoKioMRT-TopView.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]] mainly serves the New Town.]]The town's road system utilize a hierarchy of road sizes by design: the major roads are referred to as \"Avenues\", and the local-access roads referred to as \"Streets\". Ang Mo Kio Avenue 12 is an exception as it is a small road in an industrial estate in Ang Mo Kio. The town's avenues are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with the streets filtering traffic from the avenues to the individual blocks. The town itself is served by the [[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway]], providing a rapid link from the town to the rest of the island via the expressway network.\n\nIn the town's road numbering system, avenues running from east to west are assigned odd numbers, with numbers increasing from south to north, while north-south avenues are assigned even numbers, increasing from west to east. Street numbers consist of two digits, with the first digit corresponding to the neighbourhood it belongs to and the second running in numerical sequence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Map of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3/5, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6/8, Central Expressway (CTE) and Bishan Park in Singapore|url=http://map.sg/area/n5050|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAng Mo Kio Town was the first town to introduce this road numbering system, and it has since been replicated in other towns such as [[Hougang]], [[Jurong West]] and [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]]. The newer towns such as [[Sengkang]] and [[Punggol]] no longer follow this system.\n\n==== Mass Rapid Transit ====\nThe town is well served by a multi-modal public transport system. Two [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] stations currently serve the town, both of which are on the [[North South MRT line|North South Line]]. They are:\n\n*{{SMRT code|NS|15}} [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang]]\n*{{SMRT code 2I/C|NS|16|CR|11}} [[Ang Mo Kio MRT station|Ang Mo Kio]]\n\nIn addition, two upcoming stations on the [[Thomson-East Coast MRT Line]] and one station on the [[Cross Island MRT Line]] will serve the town alongside the existing stations on the North South Line. They are: \n\n*{{SMRT code|TE|5}} [[Lentor MRT station|Lentor]]\n*{{SMRT code|TE|6}} [[Mayflower MRT station|Mayflower]]\n*{{SMRT code|CR|12}} [[Teck Ghee MRT station|Teck Ghee]]\n\n[[Lentor MRT station]] will be located at the junction between Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 and Yio Chu Kang Road, and [[Mayflower MRT station]] will be located along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, within the [[Kebun Baru]] subzone. The two stations will be opened in 2020 and the line will parallel the North South line towards [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] and the city centre as well as offering direct connections to the eastern parts of Singapore. \n\n[[Teck Ghee MRT station]] will be located underneath Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, between the junctions of Ang Mo Kio Street 31 and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and will open in 2028.\n\n==== Bus ====\nThe [[Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange]] is directly linked to the [[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]] via an underground pedestrian walkway, and provides feeder bus services from the MRT stations to each neighbourhood. [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]] is also served by bus services via the [[Yio Chu Kang Bus Terminal]] sited beside the station. Both the bus interchange and terminal offers trunk bus services to connect the town with the rest of the island, including a rapid connection to the city centre in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], as well as other financial and commercial districts in the [[Central Region, Singapore|central region of Singapore]], including [[Shenton Way]], [[Orchard Road]], [[Marina Centre]] and [[Marine Parade]].\n\n===Amenities===\nAdministrative, legal, medical, religious, and social services catering towards the general public may also be found in the Ang Mo Kio area, with a major community hospital Ang Mo Kio Thye Hua Kwan Hospital that offers rehabilitative care.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ang Mo Kio \u2013 Thye Hua Kwan Hospital|url=http://www.amkh.com.sg|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Recreational amenities include the Ang Mo Kio Park located on a hilly area surrounded by Avenues 4, 5, and 6 and alongside Mayflower estate, and also [[Bishan Park]] along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 which is frequented by people from both Ang Mo Kio and [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]] estates.\n\nSeveral shopping malls are also found in Ang Mo Kio Central:\n* [[AMK Hub]]\n* Broadway Plaza\n* Djitsun Mall\n* Jubilee Square\n*\n\n==Education==\nThe area has a total of 8 MOE primary schools, 8 MOE secondary schools, [[Anderson Serangoon Junior College]], [[ITE College Central]] and [[Nanyang Polytechnic]].<ref>[http://sis.moe.gov.sg/ School Information Service]</ref>\n\nSeveral preschools can be found in Ang Mo Kio including the Al-Muttaqin Mosque Kindergarten, childcare centres operated by the [[National Trades Union Congress]] named My First Skool and also kindergartens managed under the [[PAP Community Foundation]]. Two special schools may also be found, Chaoyang School (APSN) which caters for children with mild intellectual disability aged 7\u201312 years old,<ref>{{cite web|title=Chaoyang School|url=http://www.apsn.org.sg/chaoyang-school/about-us/|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> and [[Pathlight School]] with two campuses in Ang Mo Kio with a focus on autism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pathlight School|url=http://www.pathlight.org.sg/main/contact.php|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nThe jurisdiction of the area has been largely handled by Ang Mo Kio Town Council which oversees [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency]] since 1991. The current [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], [[Lee Hsien Loong]], is a member of Ang Mo Kio Town Council and the constituency of the same name. \n\nAnother constituency had assumed control over part of Ang Mo Kio which was [[Nee Soon Group Representation Constituency]] for the Kebun Baru division. In light of the [[2020 Singaporean general election|2020 general election]], the Kebun Baru division of Nee Soon GRC will become an [[Kebun Baru Single Member Constituency|SMC of its own]].\n\nPreviously, the [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]] from 1988 to 2001 have handled parts of Ang Mo Kio such as Cheng San, Chong Boon and Jalan Kayu. Chong Boon was transferred to Ang Mo Kio GRC in 1997. [[Yio Chu Kang Single Member Constituency]] have handled parts of Ang Mo Kio from 2006 to 2011.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n{{Places in Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Places in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Ang Mo Kio|*]]\n[[Category:North-East Region, Singapore]]\n[[Category:Hokkien place names]]\n[[Category:New towns started in the 1970s]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name = Ang Mo Kio\n| settlement_type = [[Planning Areas of Singapore|Planning Area]] and [[New towns of Singapore|HDB Town]]\n| translit_lang1 = Other\n| translit_lang1_type1 = [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]]\n| translit_lang1_info1 = \u5b8f\u8302\u6865\n| translit_lang1_type2 = [[Malay language|Malay]]\n| translit_lang1_info2 = Ang Mo Kio\n| translit_lang1_type3 = [[Tamil language|Tamil]]\n| translit_lang1_info3 = \u0b86\u0b99\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bcb \u0b95\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bcb\n| image_skyline = {{Photomontage\n| photo1a = PHS Clock Tower.jpg\n| photo2a = NYPcampus.JPG\n| photo2b = AngMoKio.JPG\n| photo3a = Ang Mo Kio St 52.jpg\n| photo3b = AngMoKioMRT-TopView.JPG\n| photo4a = 1 bishan park panorama 2012.jpg\n| size = 280\n| spacing = 2\n| color = transparent\n| border = 0\n}}\n| image_caption = From top left to right: Clock tower of [[Presbyterian High School]], [[Nanyang Polytechnic]], Aerial view of Ang Mo Kio, Ang Mo Kio Street 52, [[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]], [[Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park]]\n| image_map                       = {{maplink|frame=yes|plain=yes|type=shape|stroke-width=2|stroke-color=#000000|zoom=13|frame-latitude=1.3691|frame-longitude=103.8454}}\n| map_caption                     = Location of Ang Mo Kio in Singapore\n| pushpin_map                     = #Singapore#Asia#Earth\n| pushpin_mapsize                 = 300px\n| pushpin_map_caption             = {{Legend inline|#CC0000|outline=black}} '''Ang Mo Kio''' in {{Legend inline|#FEFEEF|outline=black}} '''[[Singapore]]'''\n| coordinates = {{coord|1|22|12.6|N|103|50|44.23|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type = Country\n| subdivision_name = {{flag|Singapore}}\n| subdivision_type1 = Region\n| subdivision_name1 = [[North-East Region, Singapore|North-East Region]]\n----\n| subdivision_type2 = [[Community Development Council|CDCs]]\n| subdivision_name2 = * [[Central Singapore Community Development Council|Central Singapore CDC]]\n*[[North West Community Development Council|North West CDC]]\n| subdivision_type3 = Town councils\n| subdivision_name3 = * Ang Mo Kio Town Council\n* Nee Soon Town Council\n| subdivision_type4 = [[Constituencies of Singapore|Constituencies]]\n| subdivision_name4 = * [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency|Ang Mo Kio GRC]]\n* [[Nee Soon Group Representation Constituency|Nee Soon GRC]]\n| established_title = Town announced\n| established_date = * 4 August 1973<ref>{{cite news|title=The next new town: Ang Mo Kio|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19730805-1.2.9.aspx|date=5 August 1973|publisher=[[The Straits Times|The Sunday Times]]}}</ref>\n| established_title1 = Town completed\n| established_date1 = * 1980<ref name=NLBAMK>{{cite web|title=Singapore Infopedia: Ang Mo Kio|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_230_2005-01-25.html|publisher=[[National Library Board]]}}</ref>\n| established_title2 = [[Development guide plan|DGP]] exhibited\n| established_date2 = * 1996<ref name=DGP>{{cite web|title=Singapore Infopedia - Development guide plan|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1371_2009-01-05.html|publisher=[[National Library Board]]}}</ref>\n| established_title3 = [[Planning Areas of Singapore|PA]] incorporated\n| established_date3 = * 22 January 1999<ref name=DGP/>\n| leader_title = Mayors\n| leader_name = '''Central Singapore DC'''\n* [[Denise Phua]]\n'''North West CDC'''\n* [[Teo Ho Pin]]\n----\n| leader_title1 = Members of Parliament\n| leader_name1 = '''Ang Mo Kio GRC'''\n{{Bulleted list|list_style=line-height: inherit;

Although not technically located within Ang Mo Kio itself, the [[Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park]] in the adjacent town of Bishan was designed to serve residents of both towns.

Lady Windsor was the wife of Lord Windsor, a wealthy merchant who had a huge estate in the Upper Thomson Area in the 1920s until after World War II. Ang Mo Kio could also have been named in reference to Mr John Turnbull Thomson, a British civil engineer and artist who played an instrumental role in the development of the early infrastructure of late 19th century Singapore and New Zealand. Old survey maps relate the area as the \"Region of Ang Mo Kio\".<ref>{{cite web|title=An early surveyor in Singapore : John Turnbull Thomson in Singapore, 1841\u20131853 / John Hall-Jones, Christopher Hooi.|url=http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=4082509|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> The area has also been historically referred to as Kou Teu Kio.<ref>{{cite web|title=HDB Towns, Your Home - Ang Mo Kio|url=http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/ang-mo-kio|publisher=[[Housing and Development Board]]}}</ref>\n\n===Lady Jennifer Windsor===\nLady Windsor was linked to an unnamed crossing that bridged a stream running off the Peirce Reservoir. It suggested where the name \"Ang Mo Kio\" might have originated. An incident happened in 1923 when Lady Windsor lost 3 of her children; Harry, Paul and Angela. The 3 children were supposed to have visited a family friend staying in the Upper Thomson area, and were lost in the woods. It was later found that the 2 boys were playing by the wooden crossing when a sudden gush swept them away. Their bodies were found about 2 miles from the bridge. However, the body of Angela was never found.\n\nIt was said that locals started hearing cries of a little girl and that prompted Lady Windsor to stay by the bridge for the rest of her life. She thought that it was a ghost. She told her close friends that she had heard her daughter's voice by the bridge and she wanted to accompany her soul. Lady Windsor would spend the whole day by the bridge, reading or knitting. People soon got used to her perpetual presence by the bridge that they soon referred to the bridge as the \"Red Hair Bridge\"; which in its right sense should have been called \"Lady Windsor Bridge\".\n\nLady Windsor died in 1963 and it was only thereafter that locals no longer heard the voice of the little girl.\n\n===John Turnbull Thomson===\nJohn Turnbull Thomson (1821\u20131884) was responsible for building a bridge during the colonial days of Singapore, to facilitate logistic transportation to the nearby British military bases at Seletar until the British military withdrawal in the 1970s. After the bridge was completed, the locals often referred to it as Ang Mo Kio or \"Caucasian Bridge\" or \"Red Hair Bridge\", since it was built by a Caucasian; John Turnbull Thomson had a distinctive red-coloured hair. Nowadays, \"Ang Mo\" is a popular term to refer to Caucasians in Singapore.\n\nThe name \"Thomson\" was also used extensively in the naming of several roads in and around Ang Mo Kio. This explanation is currently being listed at the Heritage Corridor in Deyi Secondary School located in Ang Mo Kio. The explanation is also more widely accepted by the local historians and listed in the National Library Board. The bridge, however, no longer exists. It was, according to local historians, located at the junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Upper Thomson Road. Little of the bridge built by Thomson remains.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nAng Mo Kio Planning Area, as defined by the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]], sits within the North-East Region of Singapore. [[Yishun]] bounds Ang Mo Kio to the north, [[Sengkang]] to the northeast, [[Serangoon]] to the east, [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]] to the south and [[Central Water Catchment]] to the west.\n\nThe main component of the planning area, Ang Mo Kio New Town, is located within it. The town itself has seven neighbourhoods, with Neighbourhood 1 to the west, cycling in an anti-clockwise direction to Neighbourhood 6 to the north, and ending with Neighbourhood 7 for the town centre. The town centre is located in the heart of Ang Mo Kio and is sandwiched by two town gardens set on natural hillocks.\n\n===Subzones===\nAng Mo Kio Planning Area is officially divided into 12 subzones for urban planning and statistical purposes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name of estates\n!Location\n!Notable structures\n!Accessibility\n|-\n|Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\n|Areas around Ang Mo Kio Central 1, Ang Mo Kio Central 2 and Ang Mo Kio Central 3\n|Ang Mo Kio Public Library, [[Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange]] and [[AMK Hub]]\n|[[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]] and buses\n|-\n|[[Cheng San]]\n|Estates along Ang Mo Kio Street 51, Ang Mo Kio Street 52, Ang Mo Kio Street 53 and Ang Mo Kio Street 54\n|[[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]], [[Ang Mo Kio Town Garden East]] and [[Anderson Secondary School]]\n|[[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]] and buses\n|-\n|[[Chong Boon]]\n|Southeast Ang Mo Kio\n[[Deyi Secondary School]] and [[Pathlight School]]\n|Buses\n|-\n|[[Kebun Baru]]\n|Precincts west of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\n|[[Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West]], Kebun Baru Community Club, Kebun Baru Neighbourhood Police Post, [[CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School]] and the future [[Mayflower MRT station]]\n|Buses\n|-\n|Sembawang Hills\n|Estates along Seraya Crescent, Casuarina Road, Nemesu Avenue, Old Upper Thomson Road, Sembawang Hills Drive and Thomson Hills Drive\n|Sembawang Hills Food Centre\n|Buses\n|-\n|Shangri-La\n|Southwest Ang Mo Kio\n|[[Mayflower Secondary School]], Ang Mo Kio Primary School, [[Ang Mo Kio Secondary School]] and Ang Mo Kio Community Centre\n|Buses\n|-\n|Tagore\n|Northwest Ang Mo Kio\n|Teacher's Estate, Tagore Industrial Estate and the future [[Lentor MRT station]]\n|Buses\n|-\n|Townsville\n|Areas around Ang Mo Kio Street 31 and Ang Mo Kio Street 32\n|Ang Mo Kio Swimming Complex, Teck Ghee Neighbourhood Police Post and Townsville Primary School\n|Buses\n|-\n|[[Yio Chu Kang]]\n|Areas north of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\n|[[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]], [[Yio Chu Kang Bus Interchange]], [[Yio Chu Kang Stadium]], Yio Chu Kang Swimming Complex, [[Ang Mo Kio Police Division]] Headquarters, Ang Mo Kio North Neighbourhood Police Post, Ang Mo Kio Fire Station, Ang Mo Kio Bus Depot (SBS Transit) and [[Anderson Junior College]]\n|[[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]] and buses\n|-\n|Yio Chu Kang East\n|Northeast Ang Mo Kio\n|[[Nanyang Polytechnic]], [[ITE College Central]] and Amoy Quee Camp\n|[[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]] and buses\n|-\n|Yio Chu Kang North\n|Areas bounded by [[Seletar Expressway]], [[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway]], [[Yio Chu Kang Road]] and [[Lentor Avenue]]\n|Sungei Seletar Simpang Kiri\n|Buses\n|-\n|Yio Chu Kang West\n|Areas bounded by Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 and [[Yio Chu Kang Road]]\n|[[Anderson Primary School]], [[Presbyterian High School]] and [[Yio Chu Kang Secondary School]]\n|[[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]] and buses\n|}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe present-day Ang Mo Kio area remained largely uninhabited throughout the 19th century. Settlers were attracted to the area only around the start of the 20th century, as a result of the rubber boom. In the old maps of Singapore, much of the area was labelled as the Ang Mo Kio Forest Reserve with many plantation estates.\n\nThe village that sprang up with the clearing of the land took on the name \"Ang Mo Kio\". The immigrant Chinese, mostly Hokkiens were engaged in rubber-planting and tapping. Cheng San Village where Ang Mo Kio New Town now stands was once a huge rubber plantation. The 1922 to 1932 world slump in rubber prices made many tappers and labourers turn to pig and poultry farming or market gardening. During World War II when Singapore was occupied, more people moved to Ang Mo Kio to take up farming.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Ang mo kio.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre.]]\nThe development of the present Ang Mo Kio Town began in 1973,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ang Mo Kio, My Hometown of 25 years|url=http://remembersingapore.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/ang-mo-kio-my-hometown|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> and was the seventh [[New town]] to be built in Singapore. The first part of Ang Mo Kio was being built by 1979, and the Yio Chu Kang part of the town was completed in 1981. The present {{convert|29|ha}} self-contained town centre was built over an elongated valley formerly occupied by squatters. It has commercial offices, cultural and community facilities serving up to 200,000 residents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.gov.sg/dataset/estimated-resident-population-living-in-hdb-flats?view_id%3D31afe0d7-b8e7-41bd-b868-2d1bdac87779%26resource_id%3Db29c1af8-e11a-4e61-b813-933db9f69633|title=Estimated Singapore Resident Population in HDB Flats|website=Data.gov.sg|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the town won the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) Outstanding Buildings Award in 1983. The swimming complex at Avenue 1 also won the 1986 SIA Architectural Award for its unique \"tetrahedral skylight\" design. It was the first town to be designed in metric measurements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_230_2005-01-25.html|title=Ang Mo Kio {{!}} Infopedia|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\nFollowing the norm in the 1970s, most of the flats are organised in 12-storey long blocks or 25-storey point blocks. In recent years, certain parts of the estate have been rebuilt as part of the long process of renewal. As a result, segments of higher blocks clustered together can be seen interleaved with the older blocks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nWith Ang Mo Kio becoming an matured estate, several plots of residential land have been cleared up and sold to private developers for redevelopment. Many private residential projects are being constructed on these sites.\n\n===Transportation===\n\n==== Road network ====\n[[File:AngMoKioMRT-TopView.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]] mainly serves the New Town.]]The town's road system utilize a hierarchy of road sizes by design: the major roads are referred to as \"Avenues\", and the local-access roads referred to as \"Streets\". Ang Mo Kio Avenue 12 is an exception as it is a small road in an industrial estate in Ang Mo Kio. The town's avenues are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with the streets filtering traffic from the avenues to the individual blocks. The town itself is served by the [[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway]], providing a rapid link from the town to the rest of the island via the expressway network.\n\nIn the town's road numbering system, avenues running from east to west are assigned odd numbers, with numbers increasing from south to north, while north-south avenues are assigned even numbers, increasing from west to east. Street numbers consist of two digits, with the first digit corresponding to the neighbourhood it belongs to and the second running in numerical sequence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Map of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3/5, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6/8, Central Expressway (CTE) and Bishan Park in Singapore|url=http://map.sg/area/n5050|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAng Mo Kio Town was the first town to introduce this road numbering system, and it has since been replicated in other towns such as [[Hougang]], [[Jurong West]] and [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]]. The newer towns such as [[Sengkang]] and [[Punggol]] no longer follow this system.\n\n==== Mass Rapid Transit ====\nThe town is well served by a multi-modal public transport system. Two [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] stations currently serve the town, both of which are on the [[North South MRT line|North South Line]]. They are:\n\n*{{SMRT code|NS|15}} [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang]]\n*{{SMRT code 2I/C|NS|16|CR|11}} [[Ang Mo Kio MRT station|Ang Mo Kio]]\n\nIn addition, two upcoming stations on the [[Thomson-East Coast MRT Line]] and one station on the [[Cross Island MRT Line]] will serve the town alongside the existing stations on the North South Line. They are: \n\n*{{SMRT code|TE|5}} [[Lentor MRT station|Lentor]]\n*{{SMRT code|TE|6}} [[Mayflower MRT station|Mayflower]]\n*{{SMRT code|CR|12}} [[Teck Ghee MRT station|Teck Ghee]]\n\n[[Lentor MRT station]] will be located at the junction between Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 and Yio Chu Kang Road, and [[Mayflower MRT station]] will be located along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, within the [[Kebun Baru]] subzone. The two stations will be opened in 2020 and the line will parallel the North South line towards [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] and the city centre as well as offering direct connections to the eastern parts of Singapore. \n\n[[Teck Ghee MRT station]] will be located underneath Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, between the junctions of Ang Mo Kio Street 31 and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and will open in 2028.\n\n==== Bus ====\nThe [[Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange]] is directly linked to the [[Ang Mo Kio MRT station]] via an underground pedestrian walkway, and provides feeder bus services from the MRT stations to each neighbourhood. [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station]] is also served by bus services via the [[Yio Chu Kang Bus Terminal]] sited beside the station. Both the bus interchange and terminal offers trunk bus services to connect the town with the rest of the island, including a rapid connection to the city centre in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], as well as other financial and commercial districts in the [[Central Region, Singapore|central region of Singapore]], including [[Shenton Way]], [[Orchard Road]], [[Marina Centre]] and [[Marine Parade]].\n\n===Amenities===\nAdministrative, legal, medical, religious, and social services catering towards the general public may also be found in the Ang Mo Kio area, with a major community hospital Ang Mo Kio Thye Hua Kwan Hospital that offers rehabilitative care.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ang Mo Kio \u2013 Thye Hua Kwan Hospital|url=http://www.amkh.com.sg|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Recreational amenities include the Ang Mo Kio Park located on a hilly area surrounded by Avenues 4, 5, and 6 and alongside Mayflower estate, and also [[Bishan Park]] along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 which is frequented by people from both Ang Mo Kio and [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]] estates.\n\nSeveral shopping malls are also found in Ang Mo Kio Central:\n* [[AMK Hub]]\n* Broadway Plaza\n* Djitsun Mall\n* Jubilee Square\n*\n\n==Education==\nThe area has a total of 8 MOE primary schools, 8 MOE secondary schools, [[Anderson Serangoon Junior College]], [[ITE College Central]] and [[Nanyang Polytechnic]].<ref>[http://sis.moe.gov.sg/ School Information Service]</ref>\n\nSeveral preschools can be found in Ang Mo Kio including the Al-Muttaqin Mosque Kindergarten, childcare centres operated by the [[National Trades Union Congress]] named My First Skool and also kindergartens managed under the [[PAP Community Foundation]]. Two special schools may also be found, Chaoyang School (APSN) which caters for children with mild intellectual disability aged 7\u201312 years old,<ref>{{cite web|title=Chaoyang School|url=http://www.apsn.org.sg/chaoyang-school/about-us/|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> and [[Pathlight School]] with two campuses in Ang Mo Kio with a focus on autism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pathlight School|url=http://www.pathlight.org.sg/main/contact.php|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nThe jurisdiction of the area has been largely handled by Ang Mo Kio Town Council which oversees [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency]] since 1991. The current [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], [[Lee Hsien Loong]], is a member of Ang Mo Kio Town Council and the constituency of the same name. \n\nAnother constituency had assumed control over part of Ang Mo Kio which was [[Nee Soon Group Representation Constituency]] for the Kebun Baru division. In light of the [[2020 Singaporean general election|2020 general election]], the Kebun Baru division of Nee Soon GRC will become an [[Kebun Baru Single Member Constituency|SMC of its own]].\n\nPreviously, the [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]] from 1988 to 2001 have handled parts of Ang Mo Kio such as Cheng San, Chong Boon and Jalan Kayu. Chong Boon was transferred to Ang Mo Kio GRC in 1997. [[Yio Chu Kang Single Member Constituency]] have handled parts of Ang Mo Kio from 2006 to 2011.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n{{Places in Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Places in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Ang Mo Kio|*]]\n[[Category:North-East Region, Singapore]]\n[[Category:Hokkien place names]]\n[[Category:New towns started in the 1970s]]\n", "name_user": "Deoma12", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio"}

Its mission is to end hunger in its community.\n\nFounded in 1987, REFB is [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]]'s largest hunger-relief organization, serving 133 charitable organizations, including emergency food pantries/closets, shelters and dining rooms, childcare centers/youth programs, group homes, and disaster relief agencies. Seniors, children, and working families come to food distributions seeking supplemental groceries.\n\nREFB acquires food and distributes it through a network of charitable agencies and its own food assistance programs and also provides food to [[Lake County, California|Lake]], [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino]], [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt]], and [[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte Counties]] through smaller food banks. In addition, the REFB advocates for legislation to provide long-term solutions to hunger in its community.\n\n== Recipients ==\nIn 2018, The Redwood Empire Food Bank distributed the equivalent of 40 million meals, or 40,000 per day. Each year, the Redwood Empire Food Bank serves 82,000 people across five counties \u2014 Sonoma County, Lake County, Mendocino County, Humboldt County, and Del Norte County. A January 2010 report estimated that REFB was providing emergency food for over 110,000 different people annually, and that in any given week about 26,000 different people were receiving emergency food assistance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hunger in America 2010: Local Report Prepared for The Redwood Empire Food Bank, Final Report|publisher=Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.|date=January 2010|url=http://www.cafoodbanks.org/docs/HungerStudy_REFB.pdf|accessdate=2012-10-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924115804/http://cafoodbanks.org/docs/HungerStudy_REFB.pdf|archivedate=2010-09-24}}</ref> In late 2010, REFB was serving 78,000 monthly meals, an increase of more than 11 percent over 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://healdsburg.patch.com/articles/does-the-food-pantry-and-redwood-empire-food-bank-have-increased-need-this-year|title=Does the Food Pantry and Redwood Empire Food Bank Have Increased Need This Year?|publisher=Healdsburg Patch|author=Pat Wyman|date=December 18, 2010|accessdate=2012-10-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201044452/http://healdsburg.patch.com/articles/does-the-food-pantry-and-redwood-empire-food-bank-have-increased-need-this-year|archivedate=February 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\n=== Food collection and distribution ===\nThe vast majority of Redwood Empire Food Bank's work is direct service.
