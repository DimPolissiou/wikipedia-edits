As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 45,924.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/22095.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> The [[parish seat]] is [[Edgard, Louisiana|Edgard]],<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> an [[unincorporated area]], and the largest city is [[LaPlace, Louisiana|LaPlace]], which is also unincorporated.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish was established in 1807 as one of the original 19 parishes of the [[Territory of Orleans]], which became the state of Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccet.louisiana.edu/tourism/parishes/Acadiana_Parishes/saintjohnthebaptist.html|title=St. John the Baptist Parish|publisher=Center for Cultural and Eco-Tourism|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish is part of the [[New Orleans]]\u2013[[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], LA [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nThis was considered part of the [[German Coast]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, named for numerous German immigrants who settled along the Mississippi River here in the 1720s.  On January 8, 1811, the largest [[slave rebellion|slave insurrection]] in US history, known as the [[1811 German Coast Uprising|German Coast Uprising]], started here.  It was short-lived, but more than 200 [[History of slavery in Louisiana|slaves]] gathered from [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] along the river and marched through [[St. Charles Parish]] toward New Orleans. This is part of the Sugarland or sugar parishes, which were devoted to sugar cane cultivation. Planters used large numbers of enslaved African-American workers before the war, and numerous [[freedmen]] stayed in the area to work on these plantations afterward.\n\nThe parish includes three nationally significant examples of 19th-century plantation architecture: [[Evergreen Plantation (Wallace, Louisiana)|Evergreen Plantation]], [[Whitney Plantation Historic District]], and [[San Francisco Plantation House]].\n\n==History==\nPresent-day St. John the Baptist Parish includes the third permanent settlement in what is now the state of Louisiana, after Natchitoches (1714) and New Orleans (1718). It was considered part of the [[German Coast]] http://www.gachgs.com/. The area was settled in the early 1720s by a group of [[Germany|German]] [[colonists]]. Many families established towns close to the [[Mississippi River]] in the areas now known as Lucy, Garyville, and Reserve. The area was under the French regime until 1763, when France ceded Louisiana to Spain after losing the [[Seven Years' War]] to Great Britain (this was known as the French and Indian War on the North American front).\n\nAt the beginning of the Spanish colonial period, many Acadians, people of French descent, began arriving in south Louisiana due to being expelled by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] from what is now [[Nova Scotia]]. The British took over French territory in [[Canada]] and in North America east of the Mississippi river. The first Acadian village was established in what is now [[Wallace, Louisiana]]. The German and French cultures thrived alongside one another, but [[French language|French]] came to be the dominant language. They developed a culture known as [[Cajun]].\n\nThe early settlers in the area received land grants from the Spanish or French royal governments, depending upon which country owned the territory at the time of application. The French style of property allotments was made up of narrow frontage on the river so that each plantation had access for transportation of goods to and from New Orleans and world markets. The main house and supporting outbuildings were constructed near the river. The remaining property extended away from the river deeply into the wetlands, where land was cleared for cultivation of sugar cane.\n\nMost transportation was done by boat, mainly on the bayous and lakes of the area, but via the Mississippi River as well, for decades into the 19th century.  St. John, with its fertile land being nine feet above sea level, proved to be an excellent settlement for farming and agriculture. In the late 18th century, [[planters]] began to invest more in labor-intensive [[sugar cane]] cultivation and processing, increasing their demand for slave labor. Sugar production meant prosperity for the planters and New Orleans. Planters held large numbers of slaves, to the extent that the sugar and cotton parishes all had black majorities before the Civil War.\n\nWith the sugar wealth, some wealthy planters built elaborate houses and outbuildings.  Three survive in St. John parish; each is recognized for its national architectural and historic significance. On the west bank are the major complex of house and outbuildings designated as the [[Whitney Plantation Historic District]] and the [[National Historic Landmark]] (NHL) of [[Evergreen Plantation (Wallace, Louisiana)|Evergreen Plantation]].  [[San Francisco Plantation House]], also a designated NHL, is on the east bank.  San Francisco and Evergreen plantations are open to the public for tours. The Whitney plantation house is planned for renovation. Whitney and Evergreen plantations are both included among the first 26 sites on the [[Louisiana African American Heritage Trail]].\n\nIn January 1811, the [[1811 German Coast Uprising|German Coast Uprising]] started in this parish.  It was the largest slave insurrection in US history, but it was short-lived.  The slaves killed two whites, but suffered 96 deaths among their forces at the hands of the militia and in executions after quick trials afterward. They attacked five plantations and burned three houses to the ground.  [[Charles Deslondes]], a [[mulatto]] or [[mixed-race]] slave brought from [[Saint-Domingue]] before the success of its revolution, was one of the leaders of the insurrection.  He and his followers were influenced by the ideals and promises of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[Haitian Revolution|Haitian revolutions]]. Slavery was ended on Saint-Domingue after the French Revolution, but reimposed before the slaves gained independence.<ref name=\"rothman\"/>\n\nDeslondes gathered more than 200 slaves from plantations along the way, marching upriver into [[St. Charles Parish]] toward [[New Orleans]] before meeting much resistance.  Unable to get the arms they had planned on, the slaves were defeated by the well-armed informal and territorial militias.  During these confrontations and executions after brief trials, Deslondes and ninety-five slaves were killed.  Decades before the [[American Civil War]] and [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], their actions expressed African Americans' deep desire for freedom.<ref name=\"rothman\">Adam Rothman, ''Slave Country: American Expansion and the Origins of the Deep South'', pp. 106-117, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2007 paperback</ref>\n\nAs the number of white families in the settlement increased, they wanted education for their children. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], typically planters would hire tutors, often college graduates from [[Northern United States|the North]], who would live with the family for an extended period of time, typically two years.  The tutor would teach all of the planter's children, and sometimes the family would arrange for other neighborhood children to join the classes as well.\n\nIn 1869, following the Civil War, families wanting [[French language|French]] instruction founded private schools to continue their culture.  The [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] legislature established the first public schools in the state during this period, but it took time for the state to arrange adequate funding for public education. The first high schools at Edgard and Reserve were not built until 1909. Students traveled to the schools by horse-drawn buses or by train.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|348|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|213|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|135|sqmi}} (39%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref> It is the third-smallest parish in Louisiana by land area and fifth-smallest by total area.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana is located on the [[Mississippi River]] approximately {{convert|130|mi|km}} upriver from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and {{convert|30|mi|km}} upriver from the City of [[New Orleans]].  The area, known as the River Region, has an abundance of natural resources and a mild \"Sunbelt\" climate.  The average monthly temperature in New Orleans ranges from 55.1\u00b0 in January to 83.7\u00b0 in July, and rainfall averages 53.2\u00b2 per year with monthly averages running from 2.52\u00b2 in October to 7.17\u00b2 in July.  The New Orleans/River Region contains a good supply of raw materials, which has helped Louisiana maintain a high rank in the United States in the production of natural gas, petroleum, sulphur, salt, and fur pelts.  High silica sands, lime, clays, timber, seafood, and various agricultural products are also produced in abundance.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish is bisected by the Mississippi River. Though the River separates the Parish into northern and southern parts, the former is still referred to as the \"east bank\" and the latter as the \"west bank,\" referring to the direction of the river as it reaches the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi provides an important transportation corridor which supports the heavy industry located in the area.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish is bordered by St. Charles Parish and [[Lake Pontchartrain]] to the east, Lake Pontchartrain and [[Lake Maurepas]] to the north, [[Lafourche Parish]] and [[Lac des Allemands]] to the south, and [[St. James Parish, Louisiana|St. James Parish]] to the west. It is one of four parishes which comprise the \"River Parishes;\" St. John Parish is the heart of the \"River Parishes.\"\n\nThis section of the state, also consisting of St. James, Ascension, and St. Charles Parishes, makes up the area along the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Since the mid-20th century, when the oil industry developed from resources found here, all of these parishes are home to at least one major chemical- and/or petroleum-processing facility. The industry is the major source of employment in the region but it has had adverse environmental effects. St. John the Baptist parish has the highest rate of environmental cancer of any census tract in the United States.<ref>https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/02/AirPollutionList12-1550942329.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90</ref>\n\nMuch of the parish is either open water or [[wetlands]]. The wetlands are currently protected by federal law and development is limited to what is permitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Federal Wildlife and Fisheries Department.\n\nHigher ground in the parish is found in an [[alluvial plain]] which generally borders the Mississippi River on both sides.  Soil deposits from the Mississippi's annual flooding created a rich and fertile area which has historically been intensively farmed (sugar cane, soybeans, feed corn, and occasional cotton). This fact, and the natural transportation corridor supplied by the river, resulted in the creation of numerous plantations and farms along the lower Mississippi Valley.\n\nMany of these plantations were large tracts of land with modest or average-sized homes and outbuildings found on the higher ground. Several, however, were improved with palatial mansions.  Three of the larger homes have survived in St. John Parish, as noted in the History above.\n\nThe higher ground along the banks was used to grow crops, while the wetlands were valued for their abundant timber, hunting and fishing.  For years development in the River Parishes was limited to those areas that were naturally higher and less prone to [[flood]]ing.  Until the existing levees and pump systems were built, however, few places were truly safe from high water. Even today, most of the parish is considered a flood hazard area according to [[FEMA]] Flood Maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjbparish.com/pdfs/floodmaps/22095CIND0A.pdf|title=Flood Insurance Rate Map: St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana (November 4, 2010)|publisher=|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent parishes===\n* [[Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana|Tangipahoa Parish]] (north)\n* [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles Parish]] (southeast)\n* [[Lafourche Parish, Louisiana|Lafourche Parish]] (south)\n* [[St. James Parish, Louisiana|St. James Parish]] (west)\n* [[Ascension Parish, Louisiana|Ascension Parish]] (northwest)\n* [[Livingston Parish, Louisiana|Livingston Parish]] (northwest)\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Major highways===\n{{div col}}\n* [[File:I-10.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 10 (Louisiana)|Interstate 10]]\n* [[File:I-55.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 55]]\n* [[File:US 51.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 51]]\n* [[File:US 61.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 61]]\n* [[File:Louisiana 18.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 18]]\n* [[File:Louisiana 44.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 44]]\n* [[File:Louisiana 3127.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 3127]]\n* [[File:Louisiana 3188.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 3188]]\n* [[File:Louisiana 3213.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 3213]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''East Bank''' - The primary artery on the east bank of St. John Parish is Airline Highway (U.S. Highway 61).  This five-lane, asphalt-paved road was once the predominant route linking [[Baton Rouge]] and New Orleans.  Though it is still heavily traveled, much of the New Orleans-Baton Rouge traffic has been diverted to Interstate 10, located in the northern part of the parish.  Interstate 10, a divided, [[controlled-access highway]], has two interchanges in St. John Parish; one at Belle Terre Boulevard and the second at U.S. Highway 51/Interstate 55, both in LaPlace.  Both Belle Terre Boulevard and Highway 51 intersect Airline Highway approximately {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} south of Interstate 10.\n\nInterstate 55, a north-south route leading to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and beyond, intersects Interstate 10 in the northeastern sector of LaPlace.  A third Interstate 10 interchange exists just west of the St. John Parish line near Gramercy (St. James Parish).\n\n[[River Road, Louisiana|River Road]], also known as Jefferson Highway or Louisiana Highway 44, is a two-lane, asphalt-paved, winding highway which parallels the Mississippi River.  Most of the heavy industry in the parish fronts on this road.\n\n'''West Bank''' - Most of the development on the west bank lies along Louisiana Highway 18 (the [[River Road, Louisiana|Great River Road]]), a two-lane, asphalt-paved highway which parallels the Mississippi River similarly to Highway 44 on the east bank.  In addition to Louisiana 18, the west bank has Louisiana Highway 3127 or the ''River Parishes Highway'', which is roughly equivalent to the east bank's Airline Highway in that it follows the Mississippi.  It is not as winding nor as populated as River Road.  Highway 3127 leads to [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]] upriver from St. John Parish.  It is home of the \"Sunshine Bridge\" over the Mississippi River in [[Ascension Parish]].  This road has little development on either side and is generally surrounded by wetlands in St. John Parish.\n\nVeterans Memorial Bridge or Gramercy Bridge - (Louisiana Highway 3213) This bridge originates on the east bank of St. James Parish near Gramercy/Lutcher and has access to I-10 and Airline Highway via Louisiana Highway 641.  The foot of the bridge on the west bank is in St. John Parish near Wallace, with a tie-in to Louisiana Highway 3127 that opened June 18, 2008.  The opening of this bridge has spurred the development hoped for along the west bank of St. John Parish. (The bridge is known as the \"Bridge to Nowhere.\")\n\nAccess to the west bank of St. John Parish is also provided by a [[ferry]] crossing at Reserve/Edgard and by the [[Hale Boggs Bridge]] over the Mississippi in [[St. Charles Parish]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 3854\n|1830= 5677\n|1840= 5776\n|1850= 7317\n|1860= 7930\n|1870= 6762\n|1880= 9686\n|1890= 11359\n|1900= 12330\n|1910= 14338\n|1920= 11896\n|1930= 14078\n|1940= 14766\n|1950= 14861\n|1960= 18439\n|1970= 23813\n|1980= 31924\n|1990= 39996\n|2000= 43044\n|2010= 45924\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=43184\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/la190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

In 1892, Ruddock founded by the Ruddock Cypress Company was made into a [[sawmill]] town. In September 1915, the [[1915 New Orleans Hurricane]] hit Ruddock and the nearby town of Frenier, destroying the towns and killing some of the residents. Today, Ruddock and Frenier are ghost towns in the parish as well as memorials to themselves. All that remains of Ruddock is rotted wood from Buildings and vegetation. Yet Freneir still has a few buildings being seafood restaurants and a small number of houses all of which are built high to prevent flooding. Nevertheless, Ruddock is still marked on an [[Interstate 55|I-55]] exit sign and both are seen on Louisiana road maps, Freneir still has an entrance sign on Highway 51 marking it as a fishing village. It can be seen off [[Interstate 10|I-10]] on [[Lake Pontchartrain]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana]]\n* [[German Coast]]\n** [[1811 German Coast Uprising]]\n* [[River Parishes]]\n* [[Etienne J.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 45,924.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/22095.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> The [[parish seat]] is [[Edgard, Louisiana|Edgard]],<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> an [[unincorporated area]], and the largest city is [[LaPlace, Louisiana|LaPlace]], which is also unincorporated.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish was established in 1807 as one of the original 19 parishes of the [[Territory of Orleans]], which became the state of Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccet.louisiana.edu/tourism/parishes/Acadiana_Parishes/saintjohnthebaptist.html|title=St. John the Baptist Parish|publisher=Center for Cultural and Eco-Tourism|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish is part of the [[New Orleans]]&ndash;[[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], LA [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nThis was considered part of the [[German Coast]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, named for numerous German immigrants who settled along the Mississippi River here in the 1720s.  On January 8, 1811, the largest [[slave rebellion|slave insurrection]] in US history, known as the [[1811 German Coast Uprising|German Coast Uprising]], started here.  It was short-lived, but more than 200 [[History of slavery in Louisiana|slaves]] gathered from [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] along the river and marched through [[St. Charles Parish]] toward New Orleans. This is part of the Sugarland or sugar parishes, which were devoted to sugar cane cultivation. Planters used large numbers of enslaved African-American workers before the war, and numerous [[freedmen]] stayed in the area to work on these plantations afterward.\n\nThe parish includes three nationally significant examples of 19th-century plantation architecture: [[Evergreen Plantation (Wallace, Louisiana)|Evergreen Plantation]], [[Whitney Plantation Historic District]], and [[San Francisco Plantation House]].\n\n==History==\nPresent-day St. John the Baptist Parish includes the third permanent settlement in what is now the state of Louisiana, after Natchitoches (1714) and New Orleans (1718). It was considered part of the [[German Coast]] http://www.gachgs.com/. The area was settled in the early 1720s by a group of [[Germany|German]] [[colonists]]. Many families established towns close to the [[Mississippi River]] in the areas now known as Lucy, Garyville, and Reserve. The area was under the French regime until 1763, when France ceded Louisiana to Spain after losing the [[Seven Years' War]] to Great Britain (this was known as the French and Indian War on the North American front).\n\nAt the beginning of the Spanish colonial period, many Acadians, people of French descent, began arriving in south Louisiana due to being expelled by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] from what is now [[Nova Scotia]]. The British took over French territory in [[Canada]] and in North America east of the Mississippi river. The first Acadian village was established in what is now [[Wallace, Louisiana]]. The German and French cultures thrived alongside one another, but [[French language|French]] came to be the dominant language. They developed a culture known as [[Cajun]].\n\nThe early settlers in the area received land grants from the Spanish or French royal governments, depending upon which country owned the territory at the time of application. The French style of property allotments was made up of narrow frontage on the river so that each plantation had access for transportation of goods to and from New Orleans and world markets. The main house and supporting outbuildings were constructed near the river. The remaining property extended away from the river deeply into the wetlands, where land was cleared for cultivation of sugar cane.\n\nMost transportation was done by boat, mainly on the bayous and lakes of the area, but via the Mississippi River as well, for decades into the 19th century.  St. John, with its fertile land being nine feet above sea level, proved to be an excellent settlement for farming and agriculture. In the late 18th century, [[planters]] began to invest more in labor-intensive [[sugar cane]] cultivation and processing, increasing their demand for slave labor. Sugar production meant prosperity for the planters and New Orleans. Planters held large numbers of slaves, to the extent that the sugar and cotton parishes all had black majorities before the Civil War.\n\nWith the sugar wealth, some wealthy planters built elaborate houses and outbuildings.  Three survive in St. John parish; each is recognized for its national architectural and historic significance. On the west bank are the major complex of house and outbuildings designated as the [[Whitney Plantation Historic District]] and the [[National Historic Landmark]] (NHL) of [[Evergreen Plantation (Wallace, Louisiana)|Evergreen Plantation]].  [[San Francisco Plantation House]], also a designated NHL, is on the east bank.  San Francisco and Evergreen plantations are open to the public for tours. The Whitney plantation house is planned for renovation. Whitney and Evergreen plantations are both included among the first 26 sites on the [[Louisiana African American Heritage Trail]].\n\nIn January 1811, the [[1811 German Coast Uprising|German Coast Uprising]] started in this parish.  It was the largest slave insurrection in US history, but it was short-lived.  The slaves killed two whites, but suffered 96 deaths among their forces at the hands of the militia and in executions after quick trials afterward. They attacked five plantations and burned three houses to the ground.  [[Charles Deslondes]], a [[mulatto]] or [[mixed-race]] slave brought from [[Saint-Domingue]] before the success of its revolution, was one of the leaders of the insurrection.  He and his followers were influenced by the ideals and promises of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[Haitian Revolution|Haitian revolutions]]. Slavery was ended on Saint-Domingue after the French Revolution, but reimposed before the slaves gained independence.<ref name=\"rothman\"/>\n\nDeslondes gathered more than 200 slaves from plantations along the way, marching upriver into [[St. Charles Parish]] toward [[New Orleans]] before meeting much resistance.  Unable to get the arms they had planned on, the slaves were defeated by the well-armed informal and territorial militias.  During these confrontations and executions after brief trials, Deslondes and ninety-five slaves were killed.  Decades before the [[American Civil War]] and [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], their actions expressed African Americans' deep desire for freedom.<ref name=\"rothman\">Adam Rothman, ''Slave Country: American Expansion and the Origins of the Deep South'', pp. 106-117, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2007 paperback</ref>\n\nAs the number of white families in the settlement increased, they wanted education for their children. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], typically planters would hire tutors, often college graduates from [[Northern United States|the North]], who would live with the family for an extended period of time, typically two years.  The tutor would teach all of the planter's children, and sometimes the family would arrange for other neighborhood children to join the classes as well.\n\nIn 1869, following the Civil War, families wanting [[French language|French]] instruction founded private schools to continue their culture.  The [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] legislature established the first public schools in the state during this period, but it took time for the state to arrange adequate funding for public education. The first high schools at Edgard and Reserve were not built until 1909. Students traveled to the schools by horse-drawn buses or by train.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|348|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|213|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|135|sqmi}} (39%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref> It is the third-smallest parish in Louisiana by land area and fifth-smallest by total area.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana is located on the [[Mississippi River]] approximately {{convert|130|mi|km}} upriver from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and {{convert|30|mi|km}} upriver from the City of [[New Orleans]].  The area, known as the River Region, has an abundance of natural resources and a mild \"Sunbelt\" climate.  The average monthly temperature in New Orleans ranges from 55.1\u00b0 in January to 83.7\u00b0 in July, and rainfall averages 53.2\u00b2 per year with monthly averages running from 2.52\u00b2 in October to 7.17\u00b2 in July.  The New Orleans/River Region contains a good supply of raw materials, which has helped Louisiana maintain a high rank in the United States in the production of natural gas, petroleum, sulphur, salt, and fur pelts.  High silica sands, lime, clays, timber, seafood, and various agricultural products are also produced in abundance.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish is bisected by the Mississippi River. Though the River separates the Parish into northern and southern parts, the former is still referred to as the \"east bank\" and the latter as the \"west bank,\" referring to the direction of the river as it reaches the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi provides an important transportation corridor which supports the heavy industry located in the area.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish is bordered by St. Charles Parish and [[Lake Pontchartrain]] to the east, Lake Pontchartrain and [[Lake Maurepas]] to the north, [[Lafourche Parish]] and [[Lac des Allemands]] to the south, and [[St. James Parish, Louisiana|St. James Parish]] to the west. It is one of four parishes which comprise the \"River Parishes;\" St. John Parish is the heart of the \"River Parishes.\"\n\nThis section of the state, also consisting of St. James, Ascension, and St. Charles Parishes, makes up the area along the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Since the mid-20th century, when the oil industry developed from resources found here, all of these parishes are home to at least one major chemical- and/or petroleum-processing facility. The industry is the major source of employment in the region but it has had adverse environmental effects. St. John the Baptist parish has the highest rate of environmental cancer of any census tract in the United States.<ref>https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/02/AirPollutionList12-1550942329.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90</ref>\n\nMuch of the parish is either open water or [[wetlands]]. The wetlands are currently protected by federal law and development is limited to what is permitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Federal Wildlife and Fisheries Department.\n\nHigher ground in the parish is found in an [[alluvial plain]] which generally borders the Mississippi River on both sides.  Soil deposits from the Mississippi's annual flooding created a rich and fertile area which has historically been intensively farmed (sugar cane, soybeans, feed corn, and occasional cotton). This fact, and the natural transportation corridor supplied by the river, resulted in the creation of numerous plantations and farms along the lower Mississippi Valley.\n\nMany of these plantations were large tracts of land with modest or average-sized homes and outbuildings found on the higher ground. Several, however, were improved with palatial mansions.  Three of the larger homes have survived in St. John Parish, as noted in the History above.\n\nThe higher ground along the banks was used to grow crops, while the wetlands were valued for their abundant timber, hunting and fishing.  For years development in the River Parishes was limited to those areas that were naturally higher and less prone to [[flood]]ing.  Until the existing levees and pump systems were built, however, few places were truly safe from high water. Even today, most of the parish is considered a flood hazard area according to [[FEMA]] Flood Maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjbparish.com/pdfs/floodmaps/22095CIND0A.pdf|title=Flood Insurance Rate Map: St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana (November 4, 2010)|publisher=|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent parishes===\n*[[Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana|Tangipahoa Parish]] (north)\n*[[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles Parish]] (southeast)\n*[[Lafourche Parish, Louisiana|Lafourche Parish]] (south)\n*[[St. James Parish, Louisiana|St. James Parish]] (west)\n*[[Ascension Parish, Louisiana|Ascension Parish]] (northwest)\n*[[Livingston Parish, Louisiana|Livingston Parish]] (northwest)\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Major highways===\n{{div col}}\n*[[File:I-10.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 10 (Louisiana)|Interstate 10]]\n*[[File:I-55.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 55]]\n*[[File:US 51.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 51]]\n*[[File:US 61.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 61]]\n*[[File:Louisiana 18.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 18]]\n*[[File:Louisiana 44.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 44]]\n*[[File:Louisiana 3127.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 3127]]\n*[[File:Louisiana 3188.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 3188]]\n*[[File:Louisiana 3213.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 3213]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''East Bank''' - The primary artery on the east bank of St. John Parish is Airline Highway (U.S. Highway 61).  This five-lane, asphalt-paved road was once the predominant route linking [[Baton Rouge]] and New Orleans.  Though it is still heavily traveled, much of the New Orleans-Baton Rouge traffic has been diverted to Interstate 10, located in the northern part of the parish.  Interstate 10, a divided, [[controlled-access highway]], has two interchanges in St. John Parish; one at Belle Terre Boulevard and the second at U.S. Highway 51/Interstate 55, both in LaPlace.  Both Belle Terre Boulevard and Highway 51 intersect Airline Highway approximately {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} south of Interstate 10.\n\nInterstate 55, a north-south route leading to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and beyond, intersects Interstate 10 in the northeastern sector of LaPlace.  A third Interstate 10 interchange exists just west of the St. John Parish line near Gramercy (St. James Parish).\n\n[[River Road, Louisiana|River Road]], also known as Jefferson Highway or Louisiana Highway 44, is a two-lane, asphalt-paved, winding highway which parallels the Mississippi River.  Most of the heavy industry in the parish fronts on this road.\n\n'''West Bank''' - Most of the development on the west bank lies along Louisiana Highway 18 (the [[River Road, Louisiana|Great River Road]]), a two-lane, asphalt-paved highway which parallels the Mississippi River similarly to Highway 44 on the east bank.  In addition to Louisiana 18, the west bank has Louisiana Highway 3127 or the ''River Parishes Highway'', which is roughly equivalent to the east bank's Airline Highway in that it follows the Mississippi.  It is not as winding nor as populated as River Road.  Highway 3127 leads to [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]] upriver from St. John Parish.  It is home of the \"Sunshine Bridge\" over the Mississippi River in [[Ascension Parish]].  This road has little development on either side and is generally surrounded by wetlands in St. John Parish.\n\nVeterans Memorial Bridge or Gramercy Bridge - (Louisiana Highway 3213) This bridge originates on the east bank of St. James Parish near Gramercy/Lutcher and has access to I-10 and Airline Highway via Louisiana Highway 641.  The foot of the bridge on the west bank is in St. John Parish near Wallace, with a tie-in to Louisiana Highway 3127 that opened June 18, 2008.  The opening of this bridge has spurred the development hoped for along the west bank of St. John Parish. (The bridge is known as the \"Bridge to Nowhere.\")\n\nAccess to the west bank of St. John Parish is also provided by a [[ferry]] crossing at Reserve/Edgard and by the [[Hale Boggs Bridge]] over the Mississippi in [[St. Charles Parish]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 3854\n|1830= 5677\n|1840= 5776\n|1850= 7317\n|1860= 7930\n|1870= 6762\n|1880= 9686\n|1890= 11359\n|1900= 12330\n|1910= 14338\n|1920= 11896\n|1930= 14078\n|1940= 14766\n|1950= 14861\n|1960= 18439\n|1970= 23813\n|1980= 31924\n|1990= 39996\n|2000= 43044\n|2010= 45924\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=43184\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/la190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

In 1892, Ruddock founded by the Ruddock Cypress Company was made into a [[sawmill]] town. In September 1915, the [[1915 New Orleans Hurricane]] hit Ruddock and the nearby town of Frenier, destroying the towns and killing some of the residents. Today, Ruddock and Frenier are ghost towns in the parish as well as memorials to themselves. All that remains of Ruddock is rotted wood from Buildings and vegetation. Yet Freneir still has a few buildings being seafood restaurants and a small number of houses all of which are built high to prevent flooding. Nevertheless, Ruddock is still marked on an [[Interstate 55|I-55]] exit sign and both are seen on Louisiana road maps, Freneir still has an entrance sign on Highway 51 marking it as a fishing village. It can be seen off [[Interstate 10|I-10]] on [[Lake Pontchartrain]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana]]\n*[[German Coast]]\n**[[1811 German Coast Uprising]]\n*[[River Parishes]]\n*[[Etienne J.
