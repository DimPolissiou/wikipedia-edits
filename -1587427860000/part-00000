The total number of homeless people in the United States is unknown, since counts from independent shelter providers and statistics managed by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] vary greatly. While federal HUD counts hover annually at around 500,000 people, independent shelter providers estimate at least 4,000,000 people are homeless in the United States. Point-in-time counts are also not precise measures of homeless populations.\n\nHomeless people may use shelters, or may sleep in cars, tents, on couches, or in other public places. Separate counts of sheltered people and unsheltered people are critical in understanding the homeless population.\n\nEach state has different laws, social services and medical policies, and other conditions which influence the number of homeless persons, and what services are available to homeless people in each state.\n\nThe state by state counts of people listed below are derived from under-reported federal HUD statistics.\n\n==Alaska==\nMental illness in Alaska is a current epidemic that the state struggles to maintain.

Aggressive measures have been taken in order to address this issue. The state of Arizona has been very active in attempting to criminalize acts of panhandling. Measures have included arresting and jailing individuals caught in the act. Arizona's Revised Statutes title 13.

The state of California has one of the highest concentrations of homelessness in the United States. As agricultural migrations have occurred and with urbanization spreading, empirical research and data analysis will be pivotal in understanding the major causes of homelessness. In order to determine solutions to mitigate and minimize homelessness, sociologist, non-governmental agencies (NGO\u2019s), and federal and state government agencies will need to work collectively to collaborate on curbing homelessness, not only in the state of California but throughout the entire United States. Current research has proven that people entering homelessness after the age of fifty, become homeless for environmental purposes rather than mental illness and substance abuse. \nAs the baby boomer generation retires and housing costs and financial crisis become more rampant and prevalent, understanding the difference between environmental causes versus traditional causes such as mental illness and drug addiction will be necessary. According to Individuals who first became homeless before age 50 had a higher prevalence of recent mental health and substance use problems and more difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (p.&nbsp;1)\u201d. Thus, education and compassion training will be extremely important, especially for Gen X and Gen Y, in order to understand reasonings behind homelessness and creating solutions.  In addition, housing programs and civic engagement will be extremely important and necessary as well.<ref>Brown, R. T., Goodman, L., Guzman, D., Tieu, L., Ponath, C., & Kushel, M. B. (2016).

Homelessness is a growing problem in the State of Colorado and is considered the most important social determinants of health (State of Colorado). Every individual deserves to live in good conditions and have their own home based on rights for housing. Some people do not realize that homelessness is very difficult for many individuals to escape with the continuous increase in costs for housing in Colorado along with mental health treatments and other factors. When people are forced to live without stable shelter they are then exposed to a number of risk factors that affect physical and mental health (State of Colorado). Although it is difficult to pin point any one cause of homelessness, there is a complicated combination of societal and individual causes. With the hard work of community organizations along with some helpful state initiatives, one would believe that homelessness can be escaped and even prevented.\n\nWhile he was Mayor of [[Denver, Colorado]], Colorado Governor [[John Hickenlooper]] made dealing with the issues that underlie homelessness a top priority on his agenda, speaking heavily on the issue during his first \"State of the City\" address in 2003. While Denver's homeless population is much lower than other major cities, the homeless residents have often suffered when without shelter during the cold winters. In 2006, officials said that this number had risen over the past few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/Homelessness/default.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512010632/http://www.denvergov.org/homelessness/Default.asp|url-status=dead|title=Redirect<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=May 12, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSome findings of the factors contributing to homelessness involve many issues. Among them was factual data about the number of residents that have moved to Colorado since 2011, totaling nearly 650 thousand.<ref>(United States Census Bureau, n.d)</ref> This influx of residents has caused a shortage in affordable housing and contributed to the price of homeownership and renting to increase yearly. The costs have become so expensive that a person has to make nearly four times the states minimum wage to afford a medium-priced rental. This model is unsustainable per the <ref>United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, [USICH], (2014)</ref> which describes rent as being considered affordable if it is less than thirty percent of total monthly income.  Another factor, is the perception that most people are homeless due to their own actions. While this may be true for a rare few, the majority are reluctant to seek services that could help better their situation due to fear of discrimination. Research conducted by,<ref>Johnston, Jetten, Dingle, Parsell and Walter (2016)</ref> shows that the homeless population are perceived as less than human and are not worthy of support or assistance, often they face contempt and prejudice amongst fellow homeless and the community. This is contributing to the perpetuation of chronic homelessness as people are too afraid to seek assistance and support. A third factor identified, is in how the cities are handling this demographic. There have been 350 \"anti-homeless\u201d ordinances enacted, which criminalize daily survival necessities of the homeless, but criminalizing these behaviors fails to mitigate the root causes, and maintains conditions that keep people homeless.<ref>(Ruan, 2018)</ref> While the cities have enacted these ordinances to combat hazards associated with the homeless such as fires, trash, crime and tent cities, it creates a revolving door of street to jail, jail to street.\n\nResearch has also indicated a vast shortage in shelter capabilities and resources. The number of homeless people, which in 2018 was nearly eleven thousand, consisted of families, veterans and chronically homeless.<ref>(USICH, n.d)</ref> According to,<ref>Ruan (2018)</ref> Denver, the state's capitol, can shelter less than ten percent of its homeless population, and other cities advertise their lack of shelters and resources in an effort to deter people from going to those cities. This means that people are forced to seek shelter wherever available and is usually in violation of one of the city ordinances, like the no camping ban. During the winter months shelters are on a first come, first serve basis, and people are often waiting for hours in the cold for the doors to open. This is especially challenging for those trying to work because if they are not in line at a certain time, they will likely not get shelter that evening. There are simply not enough shelters or resources to handle the entire homeless demographic, and too many limitations on getting into a shelter for the evening. This creates another burden on resources, accountable care organizations (ACO\u2019s) conducted research and found that housing needs had to be addressed before a person could effectively engage in medical treatment, and by addressing this issue first, medical cost were reduced by 53%.<ref>(Fraze, Lewis, Rodriguez and Fisher, 2016)</ref> Therefore, addressing housing needs can reduce medical treatment and further strain on resources. The research conducted has given great insight into the immense challenges the state and its homeless residents face. There are numerous factors contributing to homelessness, both individually and partially because of the cities themselves. The lack of shelters and strain on resources, contributes to the limited progress of addressing this issue. In order to make a significant impact, the state can adopt multiple new methods that were proven effective in other places to help curb the demographic much faster\n\nIn April 2012,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dezzutti|first1=Dominic|title=The True Motivation behind the Denver Camping Ban|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2012/04/01/the-true-motivation-behind-the-denver-camping-ban/|website=CBS Denver|publisher=CBS|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=April 2012}}</ref> Denver enacted the Urban Camping Ban due to the occupy Denver protest and the number of homeless on the 16th Street Mall. The ordinance was developed because businesses and individuals in Denver complained to the Mayor's office and City Council that the number of people who were sleeping in front of their business doorways and this was disruptive and made it uncomfortable for individuals to enter their businesses. In addition, Occupy Denver had taken over public space near the capital building in Denver and it became a homeless compound consisting of tents and other structures. The pressure to clean up Denver by businesses and other individuals on the Councilman Albus Brooks sponsored the legislation. Mayor Michael Hancock and City Council passed the urban camping ban which prohibited individuals from sleeping in public places with a blanket over them or something between them and the ground. Those who enact these laws often state it is the tool needed to encourage those who are not accessing services to find ways to address the issues that caused them to be homeless. The Civil Liberties Union wrote a strong letter in opposition to the Denver ordinance.\n\nThe number of homeless peoples increased from 2016 to 2017 by 1,121 <ref>Henry, M., Watt, R., Rosenthal, L., Shivji, A., & Associates A.

There is a shortage in Denver of mental health services for homeless people. The most common mental health issues among the homeless include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.<ref>Jervis, R. (August 28, 2014). Mental Disorders Keep Thousands of Homeless On Streets. , from https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/27/mental-health-homeless-series/14255283/</ref> Therapy sessions, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and prescription drugs are the most common mental health treatment options for the public. However, the homeless are unable to afford them. There are organizations who strive to help the homeless by providing food, shelter, and clothes, but there are currently not many organizations focused only on improving the mental health in the homeless community of Denver. Housing the homeless has been proven to help reduce homelessness, but that does not solve the mental health issue that a lot of homeless people possess. If organizations adopt a new program to house the homeless, get them counseling, and then help them get a job and food on the table, this will enhance their quality of life and their recovery process. Thee effects of mental health and the number of homeless people with mental health issues would be drastically diminished through programs of this nature. Organizations currently use government funding, grants from private companies, and donations. New and more dynamic services for the homeless affected by mental health could be paid for in the same way. Those that oppose more dynamic mental health services for the homeless often rely on their own opinions rather than on facts such as \"the more help the homeless get, the more likely they are to get back on their feet and succeed\".<ref>Webster, P. (December 9, 2017). Treatment and Recovery Are Not Optional in Solving Homelessness. from http://solutionsforchange.org/treatment-recovery-not-optional-solving-homelessness/</ref>\n\nThe homeless population over the last four years within the state of Colorado has remained fairly constant.  However, this does not mean that this is not an issue that needs to be addressed.  This is because while the overall population has remained stagnant the number of people who are choosing to be unsheltered is actually increasing steadily.  Why the homeless population total has remained constant within the midst of such a drastic economic boom can be seen within the data taken during the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Point-in-Time (PIT) Count.  According to HUD's PIT Count (2018)<ref>HUD 2018 Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Programs Homeless Populations and Subpopulations. (2018). Retrieved from https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/reportmanagement/published/CoC_PopSub_State_CO_2018.pdf.</ref> there are 10,857 people who are currently homeless within the state of Colorado.  This report also breaks down several aspects of the homeless population to include the biggest demographics that are currently homeless.  The biggest portion of homeless people can be categorized as those with mental illnesses.  These 2,171 people make up roughly 20 percent of the total population.  According to Bharadwaj, Pai, and Suziedelyte (2017)<ref>Bharadwaj, P., Pai, M., & Suziedelyte, A. (2017). Mental Health Stigma. Economics Letters, 159, 57-60. doi: 10.1016/j.econlet.2017.06.028.</ref> people are less likely to report that they have a mental health issue when compared to other medical conditions that may be ailing them.  This stigma and fear of reporting is leading to many people deciding not to try and fight there disease on their own rather than seeking help.  Unfortunately this can lead to many of them becoming homeless or even worse suicide.  The second highest portion comes from those who are considered to be chronic substance abusers.  This population (1,999 people) make up approximately 18 percent.  The third highest demographic is Veterans who make up almost 10 percent of the total population or 1,073 people.  While the leading causes can be seen there is still a matter of how to handle this issue in order to reduce the number of people living on the street.  The best way to do this is to follow in Denver's footsteps and start a statewide outreach program that provides aid to the homeless population.  Currently Denver does this through and outreach court that is ran by the Denver Rescue Mission in which they help enroll them in Medicaid programs or help them get mental health assistance if they need it.  This program is currently ran every other Wednesday and since this is where the biggest portion of homeless people reside it would be beneficial for the state's program to run on the opposite Wednesdays.  The community also needs to buy into helping with this issue by getting drug and alcohol counselors, rehabilitation centers, and the VA Hospital engaged with helping the population during these outreach days.  The community must ban together in order to take care of the homeless population and get more people off of the streets and into a home.\n\n'''Organizational Contribution and Youth Homelessness'''\n\nThe Colorado Coalition for the Homeless has been around since 1984 and claims to have turned around tens of thousands of homeless people in Colorado. The Stout Street Health Center provided 114,706 care visits and helped 778 U.S. veterans with various health services and housing, as of 2018 (Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, n.d.).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coloradocoalition.org/|title=Colorado Coalition for the Homeless|website=www.coloradocoalition.org|access-date=July 24, 2019}}</ref> Other organizations, such as Urban Peak Colorado Springs (UPCS), are helping to support homeless youth in the area by providing clean clothes, connections to shelters, or even housing in the area (n.d.).<ref name=\"About Urban Peak Colorado Springs\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanpeak.org/colorado-springs/about-us/about-urban-peak/about-urban-peak-colorado-springs/|title=About Urban Peak Colorado Springs|website=Urban Peak|access-date=July 24, 2019}}</ref> Regardless of how positive the organizations are with services and how many people have gone through successfully, more help is needed. As the housing market continues to grow and rise in price, more people become homeless every day and these organizations are simply not enough to keep up with the economy. With additional help from each community, shelters and solutions centers may be able to provide the support needed to help those who are in need.\n\nTo compare on a national level, According to Yoonsook, Thomas, Narendorf, & Maria, one out of ten young adults, ages 18 to 24, have experienced homelessness in any given year and additionally, over 53,000 youthful adults were said to experience homelessness on any night (2018).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yoonsook|first=Ha|last2=Thomas|first2=Margaret M.C.|last3=Narendorf|first3=Sarah Carter|last4=Maria|first4=Diane Santa|date=November 2018|title=Correlates of shelter use among young adults experiencing homelessness|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume=94|pages=477\u2013484|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.015|issn=0190-7409}}</ref> According to an assessment report by The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in Colorado alone, 3,250 families with children were reported homeless in 2018 (2018).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Housing and Urban Development|first=U.S. Department of|date=2010|title=The Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (2009)|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1680873|issn=1556-5068}}</ref> Urban Peak recorded that services in 2018, helped nearly 700 youth between the ages of 15 and 20 (n.d.).<ref name=\"About Urban Peak Colorado Springs\"/> Some facts are noted from 2015 when a count from a single night was performed, revealing that 93 youths, ages 18\u201324 were homeless.

When focusing on the laws against begging and panhandling it is important to begin with the fact that people become beggars and panhandlers for various reasons. They could be in that situation because of socio-economic issues, disability, loss of income due to natural disasters, discrimination due to being a minority group, lack of education, health issues and many more. Consequently, the approach to these social issues must be responsive to people's needs to help them escape poverty and the need to beg.\n\nThe state of Florida deals with panhandling and begging in a variety of ways, like the rest of the United States.

Measures include criminalizing sitting or lying on sidewalks and transportation of homeless to the mainland.<ref name=NYtimes2016>{{cite news|last1=Nagourney|first1=Adam|title=Aloha and Welcome to Paradise.

Prohibitions, including loitering and sleeping outdoors, have expanded to include strict panhandling restraints. These do not necessarily include complete bans, but can cover when, where and how panhandling can be legally conducted. Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the [[National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]], gives that this is a result of gentrification coupled with Hawaii's dependence on tourism.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Loew|first1=Tracy|title=Panhandling laws spreading|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jan/24/ln/hawaii801240357.html|accessdate=December 18, 2016|newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=January 27, 2008}}</ref> In 2013 alone, tourism in Hawaii generated $14.5 billion, which averaged $39 million per day.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Hawaii Tourism Authority|title=Hawaii Tourism Facts |url=http://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/default/assets/File/9_1%20HTA%20Factsheet%20as%20of%20May%201%202014%20Final.pdf|website=Hawaii Tourism Authority|publisher=State of Hawaii|accessdate=December 18, 2016|date=January 5, 2014}}</ref> This major sector is therefore a vital consideration in panhandling legislation.\n\nHawaiian locals and business operators such as Dave Moskowitz agree with these restraints, arguing that panhandling is bad for tourism.<ref name=HonoluluAdvertiser2007 />\n\nPolice, on the other hand, give that panhandling is not a prominent issue, nor is it prioritized.<ref name=Scott2002>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Michael S.|title=Panhandling|url=https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/cd_rom/inaction1/pubs/Panhandling.pdf|accessdate=December 18, 2016|agency=Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)|issue=13|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222002932/https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/cd_rom/inaction1/pubs/Panhandling.pdf|archive-date=December 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Legally, ethically and practically, it is difficult for police to enforce strict panhandling laws at all times, thus police discretion plays a vital role in determining who is cited and how many citations are given.\n\nFor the panhandling population who are cited, there is a general feeling of indifference, perhaps even disregard. Ralph McCarroll, for example, says that he has 30 citations and that law enforcement knows that he is never going to pay them.<ref name=NYtimes2016 /> A number of studies indicate that the average panhandler is an unmarried, unemployed male in his 30s to 40s, often with drug/alcohol problems, a lack of social support and laborer's skills.<ref name=Scott2002 /> These factors are likely to affect the poor perception of these laws in the panhandling population.\n\nSocial justice advocates and non-governmental organizations will argue that this approach is therefore counter-intuitive. They argue that panhandling laws violate free speech, criminalize homelessness and remove an essential part of destitute people's lives. Doran Porter, executive director of the Affordable Housing and Homeless Alliance, argues that these laws merely deal with the symptoms of homelessness rather than fixing the problem.<ref name=HonoluluAdvertiser2007 />\n\nThe role of the court is essential in clarifying whether the laws are constitutionally valid. In 2015, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Hawaii foundation (ACLUH) paired with Davis Levin Livingston Law Firm to represent Justin Guy in suit against the Hawaii County. Guy's lawyers argued that prohibiting their client from holding up a sign that read 'Homeless Please Help' offended his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.<ref name=ACLU2016>{{cite web|author1=American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii|title=Settlement in Hawaii County|url=https://acluhi.org/2015/09/14/settlement-in-hawaii-county-free-speech-case/|website=American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii|accessdate=December 18, 2016|date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> Matthew Winter, a lawyer on the case, made reference to political candidates (who are lawfully able to hold signs), to contrast against the inability of the poor to hold up signs asking for help.<ref name=ACLU2016 /> The court ruled in Guy's favour, which led to an award of $80,000 compensation and repeal of subsections 14-74, 14-75, 15-9, 15-20, 15-21, 15-35 and 15-37 of the Hawaii County Code. In a statement, Guy emphasized the need for the State of Hawaii to treat the homeless with the same dignity as the general population.<ref name=ACLU2016 /> This court ruling is a positive step in that direction.\n\nThe future of panhandling laws in Hawaii is reliant on legislators and their perception of panhandling's impact on tourism. By utilizing aggressive political language, such as 'the war on homelessness' and 'emergency state,' Hawaiian politics will continue to criminalize the behaviours of destitute populations. On the other hand, with pressure from state/federal departments and non-governmental organizations, restrictions on panhandling laws may be possible. The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]], for example, has stated that it would not provide homeless assistance funds to states that criminalize homelessness.<ref name=NYtimes2016 /> Given that Hawaii has one of the USA's largest growing homeless populations (between 2007 and 2016, Hawaii saw a 30.5% increase in homelessness), it is in a poor position to reject federal funding and assistance from non-governmental organizations.<ref>{{cite news|author1=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=The 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress |url=https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2016-AHAR-Part-1.pdf|accessdate=December 18, 2016 |agency=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|publisher=United States Federal Government|date=November 2016}}</ref> Due to these factors, recent court disapproval, repeals and police discretion, it is likely that over time strict panhandling laws in Hawaii will lessen in severity.\n\n==Illinois==\nOver the years, the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]] has gained a reputation as the city with the most homeless people, rivaling Los Angeles and [[New York City]], although no statistical data have backed this up. The reputation stems primarily from the subjective number of beggars found on the streets rather than any sort of objective statistical census data.

The boys stated that they were 'not from around here', smirked and walked away. Pothoff then decided to join the boys on the side of the road, holding up his own sign, which read 'Offered these guys a job, they said no, don't give them money'.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court case, United States v Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 725 (1990), the right to beg for money is protected speech under the First Amendment.<ref name=\"Regulation of Panhandling\">{{cite web|title=Regulation of Panhandling|url=http://www.sunsetvalley.org/vertical/sites/%7B8963FD9D-CEFE-410A-A38B-1611D53E7AA1%7D/uploads/%7B836D236B-63FA-4F3A-80B0-B9870A62C6A2%7D.PDF|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref> Therefore, panhandling cannot be entirely prohibited.

Between 2008 and 2011, there were approximately 400 arrests made by Grand Rapids under an old law that criminalizes the act of begging - 211 of these cases resulted in jail time.<ref name=\"aclumich.org\"/> The ACLU focused on the cases of two men.

Under the new ordinances the following situations could lead to legal apprehension by the police - remaining idly within 25 feet of an intersection without a license; soliciting money from anyone near building entrances, restrooms, ATMS or in line; panhandling between sunset and sunrise on public property without an official license or permit; approaching another person in a way that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, intimidated or harassed; forcing oneself upon another i.e. continuing to ask for money after being turned down.

Individual responses neither collectively favoured negative or positive responses for the interaction between police and panhandlers. Examples of responses include that the police 'give you trouble', tell them to 'get the hell out of here' and 'give you a ticket', while other individuals believed that police were 'usually understanding', 'gentle' and 'very friendly and helpful'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ststephensmpls.org/sites/default/files/why-i-beg.pdf|title=Why I Beg|last=|first=|date=|website=Ststephensmpls.org|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Minneapolis' anti-begging law was overturned due to its breach of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the right to free speech. As a result of this response, the city council of Minneapolis collectively agreed to implement a modified version of the anti begging law.

However, law in the state of Minnesota does not prohibit passive panhandling, such as holding a sign without verbal interaction and focuses on [[aggressive panhandling]] as a breach of the law.

An example of this is 'Give Real Change', a campaign that began in 2009 with the aim to end homelessness for 300 to 500 people in areas within Minneapolis by the end of 2025. Billboards implemented by the campaign that display 'Say NO To Panhandling and YES To Giving,' urge community members to stop giving money to beggars and alternatively donate it to an organization that allocates money to shelters to end homelessness.

Through a demographic examination it becomes evident that New Mexico has a high proportion of ethnographies that are currently and historically socioeconomically disadvantaged.<ref>Norris, Tina; Vines, Paula L.; Hoeffel, Elizabeth M. (February 2012). \"The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010\" (PDF). Census 2010 Brief. United States Census Bureau. Retrieved May 1, 2012.</ref> Native Americans as a proportion of the US population represent the second highest amongst all States with only Alaska  having a higher ratio, while it also has a large Hispanic population. Homelessness is a direct cause from an individual not being able to provide themselves with the most basic of necessities to maintain a healthy life hence having a higher proportion of individuals in poverty places a greater risk of an individual becoming homeless. A study into cost of homelessness on the state government of New Mexico concluded that, on a per nightly basis, emergency shelter costs $30; supportive housing $33, state penitentiary $77, Santa Fe County Detention Centre $82, St Vincent Hospital $550 and UNM Hospital $71.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Which study?  Cite the study.}}  Homelessness by and large is caused by or as a result of health care complications.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=}} One need only  consider ailments such as addiction, psychological disorders, HIV/AIDS and an array of other ailments that require consistent long term care that cannot be well managed in an unsafe, unpredictable environment that confronts most homeless.\n\nInability to adequately manage these medical problems places a further economic burden on the state as the frequency and duration of hospital visits may increase. This phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that on average homeless spent four days longer than comparable non-homeless, costing the State approximately $2,414 per hospitalization. Homelessness causes both serious mental and physical anguish as evidenced by the fact that a homeless person's psychiatric hospitalization rate is 100 times more than their non-homeless compatriot.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=There are no citations for any of the info in this paragraph.}}\n\nDue to New Mexico's strong laws against loitering, sleeping in cars and begging (traits a lot of homeless people are forced to do) they are disproportionately over-represented in the prison system. Police officials can accuse any person they believe may have attempted to disrupt the peace, regardless of whether or not the offense presents danger to the community. Panhandling is an umbrella term that represents begging, sponging and spanging. In the state of New Mexico there are strict regulations on panhandling. Moreover, homeless people are prohibited to beg after dark and if they do they are often sent to jail. In an attempt to remove homeless people from the streets, it is common for the police to dispose of their property.  The above conditions cause the mere act of being homeless to become a self-perpetuating cycle of crime.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=There are no citations for any of the info in this entire paragraph.}}\n\n==New York==\nIn 1979, a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class action suit before the courts, ''Callahan v. Carey'', against the City and State, arguing for a person's state constitutional \"right to shelter\". It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards. By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, the New York City Department of Homeless Services reported that the sheltered homeless population consisted of:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf |title=NYC Department of Homeless Services |publisher=Nyc.gov |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126233718/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf |archivedate=January 26, 2012  }}</ref>\n* 27,844 adults\n* 20,627 children\n* 48,471 total individuals\n\nAccording to the [[Coalition for the Homeless]], the homeless population of New York rose to an all-time high in 2011.

Several were denied because they were said to have family who could house them when in actuality this might not have been the case. Applicants may have faced overcrowding, unsafe conditions, or may have had relatives unwilling to house them. According to Mary Brosnaham, spokeswoman for Coalition for the Homeless, the administration of Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] employs a deliberate policy of \"active deterrence\".\n\nPart of the problem lies with long-term joblessness that characterizes the United States' economic crisis. According to the [[Center for an Urban Future]] about a third of the adult workers in New York City are low-wage earners, making under $11.54 an hour. Affordable rent rates considered to be no more than a third of the renter's wages. A family in New York City must earn at least $54,000 to find an affordable home. The median household income for renters in the Bronx and Brooklyn is barely $30,000 and $35,000 respectively. According to the Community Service Society, \"Two-thirds of poor New Yorkers and over one-third of near poor households\u2014up to twice the poverty level\u2014spend at least half of their incomes on rent&nbsp;... and place millions of low-income New Yorkers at risk of housing hardships and displacement.\"\n\nThe [[New York City Housing Authority]] is experiencing record demand for subsidized housing assistance. However, just 13,000 of the 29,000 families who applied were admitted into the public housing system or received federal housing vouchers known as [Section 8] in 2010. Due to budget cuts there have been no new applicants accepted to receive Section 8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/11/budget-cuts-threaten-nyc-homeless-program/ |title=NYC Program To Help Homeless Won't Have The Funds To Help More \u00ab CBS New York |publisher=Newyork.cbslocal.com |date=March 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, there were protests about the Governor's proposed cut of $65 million in annual funding to the homeless adult services system.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/press/pr032310.shtml \"Council, Public Advocate, Department of Homeless Services, and Coalition for the Homeless unite to oppose State's $65 million cut to the Adult Shelter System\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601195913/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/press/pr032310.shtml |date=June 1, 2010 }}, News Brief, NYC Department of Homeless Services, March 23, 2010</ref> The Bloomberg administration announced an immediate halt to the Advantage program, threatening to cast 15,000 families back into the shelters or onto the streets.

Many of the state of New York's largest cities have introduced laws in the last decade prohibiting 'aggressive begging' in some form.

In 1990, the ban on begging in New York City's subway was challenged in ''Young v. New York City Transit Authority'', and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the ban in this case did not infringe on First Amendment rights to free speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahcuah.com/lawsuit/federal/young.htm|title=Young v. New York City Transit Authority|website=Ahcuah.com |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> However, this precedent did not last long as it was seemingly overturned in 1993, in ''Loper v.

New York City Police Department rarely issued fines under this law, but used it to 'move on' beggars.<ref name=\":10\" /> In ''Loper'', the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found begging in this case to be a First Amendment right. And clarified that the ban on the subway system in the ''Young'' case was a reasonable limit as, even though it was publicly owned, panhandling in the confined space of the subway system can disrupt and startle passengers and potentially cause harm.<ref name=\":11\" /> Whereas, the blanket ban in all public spaces in the ''Loper'' case would leave beggars nowhere else for begging, which was considered an 'expressive activity' and thus protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA similar judgement was made in ''International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee'' in regard to New York City's airports, which found it reasonable to ban such activities in airports.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/672/case.html|title=International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.

Even within the legislation, the definitions and language tends to be of a broad and very subjective nature. There is also conflicting motivations for further restricting panhandling in the area, with discourses around both the safety as well as the legitimacy of panhandling taking place, particularly in the local media.\n\n==Washington, D.C.==\nThe [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] estimated in 2013 the number of homeless in [[Washington, D.C.]] as 6,865, which was a 29 percent increase after 2007.<ref>Wiener, Aaron.

While begging is protected under the First Amendment, certain cities have attempted to find ambiguity's in this right to freedom of speech, while others use more discretion when it comes to panhandling.\n\nThe city of Tacoma has passed laws which have quashed any form of panhandling in public forums.

This case has also led to a discussion surrounding whether to charge an individual with obstructing traffic or with begging.\n\n===City of Seattle===\n{{Main|Homelessness in Seattle}}\nThe city of Seattle's stance on panhandling is not as hardline as many other cities in Washington. For example, in 2010 an amendment was sponsored which would enable stronger panhandling laws that included a regulation against 'intimidating words and gestures' and obstructing someone's walking path.<ref name=\":31\">{{cite web|url=http://w.seattlestar.net/2014/10/brother-can-you-spare-a-dime/|title=The Seattle Star|last=Murphy|first=Raymond|date=|website=The Seattle Star|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> Moreover, a $50 fine was proposed to be the punishment for anyone found to be 'aggressively panhandling.' While the bill was initially passed, Mayor Mike McGinn vetoed the bill. Yet despite this opposition to a call for certain regulations on panhandling, Mayor Ed Murray believed that it is imperative that existing laws are enforced. These current laws were enacted in 1987 and they are effectively an ordinance against aggressive panhandling. While this does represent similarities with Everett's laws, the laws in Seattle have been seen as largely discretionary and 'feel good legislation' which have been viewed ambiguously.<ref name=\":31\" /> \n\nThere are about 8,000 homeless individuals in Seattle on an average day.

Aggressive measures have been taken in order to address this issue. The state of Arizona has been very active in attempting to criminalize acts of panhandling. Measures have included arresting and jailing individuals caught in the act. Arizona's Revised Statutes title 13.

The state of California has one of the highest concentrations of homelessness in the United States. As agricultural migrations have occurred and with urbanization spreading, empirical research and data analysis will be pivotal in understanding the major causes of homelessness. In order to determine solutions to mitigate and minimize homelessness, sociologist, non-governmental agencies (NGO\u2019s), and federal and state government agencies will need to work collectively to collaborate on curbing homelessness, not only in the state of California but throughout the entire United States. Current research has proven that people entering homelessness after the age of fifty, become homeless for environmental purposes rather than mental illness and substance abuse. \nAs the baby boomer generation retires and housing costs and financial crisis become more rampant and prevalent, understanding the difference between environmental causes versus traditional causes such as mental illness and drug addiction will be necessary. According to Individuals who first became homeless before age 50 had a higher prevalence of recent mental health and substance use problems and more difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (p.&nbsp;1)\u201d. Thus, education and compassion training will be extremely important, especially for Gen X and Gen Y, in order to understand reasonings behind homelessness and creating solutions.  In addition, housing programs and civic engagement will be extremely important and necessary as well.<ref>Brown, R. T., Goodman, L., Guzman, D., Tieu, L., Ponath, C., & Kushel, M. B. (2016).

Homelessness is a growing problem in the State of Colorado and is considered the most important social determinants of health (State of Colorado). Every individual deserves to live in good conditions and have their own home based on rights for housing. Some people do not realize that homelessness is very difficult for many individuals to escape with the continuous increase in costs for housing in Colorado along with mental health treatments and other factors. When people are forced to live without stable shelter they are then exposed to a number of risk factors that affect physical and mental health (State of Colorado). Although it is difficult to pin point any one cause of homelessness, there is a complicated combination of societal and individual causes. With the hard work of community organizations along with some helpful state initiatives, one would believe that homelessness can be escaped and even prevented.\n\nWhile he was Mayor of [[Denver, Colorado]], Colorado Governor [[John Hickenlooper]] made dealing with the issues that underlie homelessness a top priority on his agenda, speaking heavily on the issue during his first \"State of the City\" address in 2003. While Denver's homeless population is much lower than other major cities, the homeless residents have often suffered when without shelter during the cold winters. In 2006, officials said that this number had risen over the past few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/Homelessness/default.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512010632/http://www.denvergov.org/homelessness/Default.asp|url-status=dead|title=Redirect<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=May 12, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSome findings of the factors contributing to homelessness involve many issues. Among them was factual data about the number of residents that have moved to Colorado since 2011, totaling nearly 650 thousand.<ref>(United States Census Bureau, n.d)</ref> This influx of residents has caused a shortage in affordable housing and contributed to the price of homeownership and renting to increase yearly. The costs have become so expensive that a person has to make nearly four times the states minimum wage to afford a medium-priced rental. This model is unsustainable per the <ref>United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, [USICH], (2014)</ref> which describes rent as being considered affordable if it is less than thirty percent of total monthly income.  Another factor, is the perception that most people are homeless due to their own actions. While this may be true for a rare few, the majority are reluctant to seek services that could help better their situation due to fear of discrimination. Research conducted by,<ref>Johnston, Jetten, Dingle, Parsell and Walter (2016)</ref> shows that the homeless population are perceived as less than human and are not worthy of support or assistance, often they face contempt and prejudice amongst fellow homeless and the community. This is contributing to the perpetuation of chronic homelessness as people are too afraid to seek assistance and support. A third factor identified, is in how the cities are handling this demographic. There have been 350 \"anti-homeless\u201d ordinances enacted, which criminalize daily survival necessities of the homeless, but criminalizing these behaviors fails to mitigate the root causes, and maintains conditions that keep people homeless.<ref>(Ruan, 2018)</ref> While the cities have enacted these ordinances to combat hazards associated with the homeless such as fires, trash, crime and tent cities, it creates a revolving door of street to jail, jail to street.\n\nResearch has also indicated a vast shortage in shelter capabilities and resources. The number of homeless people, which in 2018 was nearly eleven thousand, consisted of families, veterans and chronically homeless.<ref>(USICH, n.d)</ref> According to,<ref>Ruan (2018)</ref> Denver, the state's capitol, can shelter less than ten percent of its homeless population, and other cities advertise their lack of shelters and resources in an effort to deter people from going to those cities. This means that people are forced to seek shelter wherever available and is usually in violation of one of the city ordinances, like the no camping ban. During the winter months shelters are on a first come, first serve basis, and people are often waiting for hours in the cold for the doors to open. This is especially challenging for those trying to work because if they are not in line at a certain time, they will likely not get shelter that evening. There are simply not enough shelters or resources to handle the entire homeless demographic, and too many limitations on getting into a shelter for the evening. This creates another burden on resources, accountable care organizations (ACO\u2019s) conducted research and found that housing needs had to be addressed before a person could effectively engage in medical treatment, and by addressing this issue first, medical cost were reduced by 53%.<ref>(Fraze, Lewis, Rodriguez and Fisher, 2016)</ref> Therefore, addressing housing needs can reduce medical treatment and further strain on resources. The research conducted has given great insight into the immense challenges the state and its homeless residents face. There are numerous factors contributing to homelessness, both individually and partially because of the cities themselves. The lack of shelters and strain on resources, contributes to the limited progress of addressing this issue. In order to make a significant impact, the state can adopt multiple new methods that were proven effective in other places to help curb the demographic much faster\n\nIn April 2012,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dezzutti|first1=Dominic|title=The True Motivation behind the Denver Camping Ban|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2012/04/01/the-true-motivation-behind-the-denver-camping-ban/|website=CBS Denver|publisher=CBS|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=April 2012}}</ref> Denver enacted the Urban Camping Ban due to the occupy Denver protest and the number of homeless on the 16th Street Mall. The ordinance was developed because businesses and individuals in Denver complained to the Mayor's office and City Council that the number of people who were sleeping in front of their business doorways and this was disruptive and made it uncomfortable for individuals to enter their businesses. In addition, Occupy Denver had taken over public space near the capital building in Denver and it became a homeless compound consisting of tents and other structures. The pressure to clean up Denver by businesses and other individuals on the Councilman Albus Brooks sponsored the legislation. Mayor Michael Hancock and City Council passed the urban camping ban which prohibited individuals from sleeping in public places with a blanket over them or something between them and the ground. Those who enact these laws often state it is the tool needed to encourage those who are not accessing services to find ways to address the issues that caused them to be homeless. The Civil Liberties Union wrote a strong letter in opposition to the Denver ordinance.\n\nThe number of homeless peoples increased from 2016 to 2017 by 1,121 <ref>Henry, M., Watt, R., Rosenthal, L., Shivji, A., & Associates A.

There is a shortage in Denver of mental health services for homeless people. The most common mental health issues among the homeless include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.<ref>Jervis, R. (2014, August 28). Mental Disorders Keep Thousands of Homeless On Streets. , from https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/27/mental-health-homeless-series/14255283/</ref> Therapy sessions, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and prescription drugs are the most common mental health treatment options for the public. However, the homeless are unable to afford them. There are organizations who strive to help the homeless by providing food, shelter, and clothes, but there are currently not many organizations focused only on improving the mental health in the homeless community of Denver. Housing the homeless has been proven to help reduce homelessness, but that does not solve the mental health issue that a lot of homeless people possess. If organizations adopt a new program to house the homeless, get them counseling, and then help them get a job and food on the table, this will enhance their quality of life and their recovery process. Thee effects of mental health and the number of homeless people with mental health issues would be drastically diminished through programs of this nature. Organizations currently use government funding, grants from private companies, and donations. New and more dynamic services for the homeless affected by mental health could be paid for in the same way. Those that oppose more dynamic mental health services for the homeless often rely on their own opinions rather than on facts such as \"the more help the homeless get, the more likely they are to get back on their feet and succeed\".<ref>Webster, P. (2017, December 9). Treatment and Recovery Are Not Optional in Solving Homelessness. from http://solutionsforchange.org/treatment-recovery-not-optional-solving-homelessness/</ref>\n\nThe homeless population over the last four years within the state of Colorado has remained fairly constant.  However, this does not mean that this is not an issue that needs to be addressed.  This is because while the overall population has remained stagnant the number of people who are choosing to be unsheltered is actually increasing steadily.  Why the homeless population total has remained constant within the midst of such a drastic economic boom can be seen within the data taken during the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Point-in-Time (PIT) Count.  According to HUD's PIT Count (2018)<ref>HUD 2018 Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Programs Homeless Populations and Subpopulations. (2018). Retrieved from https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/reportmanagement/published/CoC_PopSub_State_CO_2018.pdf.</ref> there are 10,857 people who are currently homeless within the state of Colorado.  This report also breaks down several aspects of the homeless population to include the biggest demographics that are currently homeless.  The biggest portion of homeless people can be categorized as those with mental illnesses.  These 2,171 people make up roughly 20 percent of the total population.  According to Bharadwaj, Pai, and Suziedelyte (2017)<ref>Bharadwaj, P., Pai, M., & Suziedelyte, A. (2017). Mental Health Stigma. Economics Letters, 159, 57-60. doi: 10.1016/j.econlet.2017.06.028.</ref> people are less likely to report that they have a mental health issue when compared to other medical conditions that may be ailing them.  This stigma and fear of reporting is leading to many people deciding not to try and fight there disease on their own rather than seeking help.  Unfortunately this can lead to many of them becoming homeless or even worse suicide.  The second highest portion comes from those who are considered to be chronic substance abusers.  This population (1,999 people) make up approximately 18 percent.  The third highest demographic is Veterans who make up almost 10 percent of the total population or 1,073 people.  While the leading causes can be seen there is still a matter of how to handle this issue in order to reduce the number of people living on the street.  The best way to do this is to follow in Denver's footsteps and start a statewide outreach program that provides aid to the homeless population.  Currently Denver does this through and outreach court that is ran by the Denver Rescue Mission in which they help enroll them in Medicaid programs or help them get mental health assistance if they need it.  This program is currently ran every other Wednesday and since this is where the biggest portion of homeless people reside it would be beneficial for the state's program to run on the opposite Wednesdays.  The community also needs to buy into helping with this issue by getting drug and alcohol counselors, rehabilitation centers, and the VA Hospital engaged with helping the population during these outreach days.  The community must ban together in order to take care of the homeless population and get more people off of the streets and into a home.\n\n'''Organizational Contribution and Youth Homelessness'''\n\nThe Colorado Coalition for the Homeless has been around since 1984 and claims to have turned around tens of thousands of homeless people in Colorado.

When focusing on the laws against begging and panhandling it is important to begin with the fact that people become beggars and panhandlers for various reasons. They could be in that situation because of socio-economic issues, disability, loss of income due to natural disasters, discrimination due to being a minority group, lack of education, health issues and many more. Consequently, the approach to these social issues must be responsive to people's needs to help them escape poverty and the need to beg.\n\nThe state of Florida deals with panhandling and begging in a variety of ways, like the rest of the United States.

Prohibitions, including loitering and sleeping outdoors, have expanded to include strict panhandling restraints. These do not necessarily include complete bans, but can cover when, where and how panhandling can be legally conducted. Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the [[National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]], gives that this is a result of gentrification coupled with Hawaii's dependence on tourism.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Loew|first1=Tracy|title=Panhandling laws spreading|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jan/24/ln/hawaii801240357.html|accessdate=December 18, 2016|newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=January 27, 2008}}</ref> In 2013 alone, tourism in Hawaii generated $14.5 billion, which averaged $39 million per day.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Hawaii Tourism Authority|title=Hawaii Tourism Facts |url=http://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/default/assets/File/9_1%20HTA%20Factsheet%20as%20of%20May%201%202014%20Final.pdf|website=Hawaii Tourism Authority|publisher=State of Hawaii|accessdate=December 18, 2016|date=January 5, 2014}}</ref> This major sector is therefore a vital consideration in panhandling legislation.\n\nHawaiian locals and business operators such as Dave Moskowitz agree with these restraints, arguing that panhandling is bad for tourism.<ref name=HonoluluAdvertiser2007 />\n\nPolice, on the other hand, give that panhandling is not a prominent issue, nor is it prioritized.<ref name=Scott2002>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Michael S.|title=Panhandling|url=https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/cd_rom/inaction1/pubs/Panhandling.pdf|accessdate=December 18, 2016|agency=Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)|issue=13|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222002932/https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/cd_rom/inaction1/pubs/Panhandling.pdf|archive-date=December 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Legally, ethically and practically, it is difficult for police to enforce strict panhandling laws at all times, thus police discretion plays a vital role in determining who is cited and how many citations are given.\n\nFor the panhandling population who are cited, there is a general feeling of indifference, perhaps even disregard. Ralph McCarroll, for example, says that he has 30 citations and that law enforcement knows that he is never going to pay them.<ref name=NYtimes2016 /> A number of studies indicate that the average panhandler is an unmarried, unemployed male in his 30s to 40s, often with drug/alcohol problems, a lack of social support and laborer's skills.<ref name=Scott2002 /> These factors are likely to affect the poor perception of these laws in the panhandling population.\n\nSocial justice advocates and non-governmental organizations will argue that this approach is therefore counter-intuitive. They argue that panhandling laws violate free speech, criminalize homelessness and remove an essential part of destitute people's lives. Doran Porter, executive director of the Affordable Housing and Homeless Alliance, argues that these laws merely deal with the symptoms of homelessness rather than fixing the problem.<ref name=HonoluluAdvertiser2007 />\n\nThe role of the court is essential in clarifying whether the laws are constitutionally valid. In 2015, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Hawaii foundation (ACLUH) paired with Davis Levin Livingston Law Firm to represent Justin Guy in suit against the Hawaii County. Guy's lawyers argued that prohibiting their client from holding up a sign that read 'Homeless Please Help' offended his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.<ref name=ACLU2016>{{cite web|author1=American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii|title=Settlement in Hawaii County|url=https://acluhi.org/2015/09/14/settlement-in-hawaii-county-free-speech-case/|website=American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii|accessdate=December 18, 2016|date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> Matthew Winter, a lawyer on the case, made reference to political candidates (who are lawfully able to hold signs), to contrast against the inability of the poor to hold up signs asking for help.<ref name=ACLU2016 /> The court ruled in Guy's favour, which led to an award of $80,000 compensation and repeal of subsections 14-74, 14-75, 15-9, 15-20, 15-21, 15-35 and 15-37 of the Hawaii County Code. In a statement, Guy emphasized the need for the State of Hawaii to treat the homeless with the same dignity as the general population.<ref name=ACLU2016 /> This court ruling is a positive step in that direction.\n\nThe future of panhandling laws in Hawaii is reliant on legislators and their perception of panhandling's impact on tourism. By utilizing aggressive political language, such as 'the war on homelessness' and 'emergency state,' Hawaiian politics will continue to criminalize the behaviours of destitute populations. On the other hand, with pressure from state/federal departments and non-governmental organizations, restrictions on panhandling laws may be possible. The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]], for example, has stated that it would not provide homeless assistance funds to states that criminalize homelessness.<ref name=NYtimes2016 /> Given that Hawaii has one of the USA's largest growing homeless populations (between 2007 and 2016, Hawaii saw a 30.5% increase in homelessness), it is in a poor position to reject federal funding and assistance from non-governmental organizations.<ref>{{cite news|author1=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=The 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress |url=https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2016-AHAR-Part-1.pdf|accessdate=December 18, 2016 |agency=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|publisher=United States Federal Government|date=November 2016}}</ref> Due to these factors, recent court disapproval, repeals and police discretion, it is likely that over time strict panhandling laws in Hawaii will lessen in severity.\n\n==Illinois==\nOver the years, the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]] has gained a reputation as the city with the most homeless people, rivaling Los Angeles and [[New York City]], although no statistical data have backed this up. The reputation stems primarily from the subjective number of beggars found on the streets rather than any sort of objective statistical census data.

There has also been widespread concern about the legitimacy of panhandlers and the significant amount of money that some are making. Cedar Rapids panhandler, Dawn, admitted that she has come across many illegitimate panhandlers. These include people who already have access to housing and financial assistance, and even some who pretend to be disabled or to be a veteran.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Brady|title=Possible ban on aggressive panhandling, panhandling at controlled intersections, on horizon in Cedar Rapids|url=http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Possible-ban-on-aggressive-panhandling-panhandling-at-controlled-intersections-on-horizon-in-Cedar-Rapids-380904721.html|accessdate=December 16, 2016|agency=KCRG-TV9|date=May 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA famous incident in Muscatine, Iowa, photos of which went viral, provides a prime example of the tensions that exist around the legitimacy of panhandlers.

The boys stated that they were 'not from around here', smirked and walked away. Pothoff then decided to join the boys on the side of the road, holding up his own sign, which read 'Offered these guys a job, they said no, don't give them money'.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court case, United States v Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 725 (1990), the right to beg for money is protected speech under the First Amendment.<ref name=\"Regulation of Panhandling\">{{cite web|title=Regulation of Panhandling|url=http://www.sunsetvalley.org/vertical/sites/%7B8963FD9D-CEFE-410A-A38B-1611D53E7AA1%7D/uploads/%7B836D236B-63FA-4F3A-80B0-B9870A62C6A2%7D.PDF|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref> Therefore, panhandling cannot be entirely prohibited.

In 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan (ACLU) filed a federal lawsuit challenging a law that makes begging a crime as a violation of free speech.<ref name=\"aclumich.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aclumich.org/article/anti-begging-law-struck-down|title=Anti-Begging Law Struck Down|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan}}</ref> Prior to this, the ACLU discovered that police officers had been arresting, prosecuting and jailing individual people for requesting financial assistance on the streets. Between 2008 and 2011, there were approximately 400 arrests made by Grand Rapids under an old law that criminalizes the act of begging - 211 of these cases resulted in jail time.<ref name=\"aclumich.org\"/> The ACLU focused on the cases of two men.

Under the new ordinances the following situations could lead to legal apprehension by the police - remaining idly within 25 feet of an intersection without a license; soliciting money from anyone near building entrances, restrooms, ATMS or in line; panhandling between sunset and sunrise on public property without an official license or permit; approaching another person in a way that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, intimidated or harassed; forcing oneself upon another i.e. continuing to ask for money after being turned down.

Individual responses neither collectively favoured negative or positive responses for the interaction between police and panhandlers. Examples of responses include that the police 'give you trouble', tell them to 'get the hell out of here' and 'give you a ticket', while other individuals believed that police were 'usually understanding', 'gentle' and 'very friendly and helpful'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ststephensmpls.org/sites/default/files/why-i-beg.pdf|title=Why I Beg|last=|first=|date=|website=Ststephensmpls.org|access-date=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Minneapolis' anti-begging law was overturned due to its breach of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the right to free speech. As a result of this response, the city council of Minneapolis collectively agreed to implement a modified version of the anti begging law. Although panhandlers are protected by the First Amendment, those who aggressively solicit and/or in prohibited locations are in the act of violating the Minneapolis City Ordinance 385.60.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofbrooklyncenter.org/index.aspx?NID=1074|title=Brooklyn Center, MN - Official Website - Panhandlers|website=Cityofbrooklyncenter.org |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> This regulation is violated when an individual offers a service of low value for a donation or verbally requests for an object or money in locations such as the entry way of a government building, near a parked vehicle, near public transport, in or near a restroom, on a crosswalk, entertainment venues, petrol station, convenience store or near a financial establishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legalbeagle.com/12010836-can-arrested-panhandling.html|title=Can You Get Arrested for Panhandling?|website=Legal Beagle |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> The individual must also use either physical contact, threaten criminal activity upon property, block entrances, stalk, use abusive language, suggest body mutilation if not given money, beg in groups of more than one person, beg under the influence of drugs or alcohol and solicit in the night hours after sunset and before sunrise in those areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minneapolismn.gov/police/report/police_crime-reporting_aggressivepanhandling|title=Aggressive Panhandling|website=Minneapolismn.gov |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> The purpose of the Minneapolis city ordinance 385.60 is to protect the public for being hounded by panhandlers at certain locations. However, law in the state of Minnesota does not prohibit passive panhandling, such as holding a sign without verbal interaction and focuses on [[aggressive panhandling]] as a breach of the law. Other cities in Minnesota such as [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], [[Brooklyn Center, Minnesota|Brooklyn Center]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St Paul]] have similar versions of the ordinance and have all avoided judicial scrutiny on the grounds of protecting individual privacy against [[assault]] based behaviour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/is-minneapolis-begging-law-doomed/363962261/|title=Is Minneapolis' begging law doomed?|newspaper=Star Tribune|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEfforts by the population of Minnesota to redirect the money given to panhandlers to organizations that aim to end homelessness have been implemented in the city of Minneapolis. An example of this is 'Give Real Change', a campaign that began in 2009 with the aim to end homelessness for 300 to 500 people in areas within Minneapolis by the end of 2025. Billboards implemented by the campaign that display 'Say NO To Panhandling and YES To Giving,' urge community members to stop giving money to beggars and alternatively donate it to an organization that allocates money to shelters to end homelessness.

Through a demographic examination it becomes evident that New Mexico has a high proportion of ethnographies that are currently and historically socioeconomically disadvantaged.<ref>Norris, Tina; Vines, Paula L.; Hoeffel, Elizabeth M. (February 2012). \"The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010\" (PDF). Census 2010 Brief. United States Census Bureau. Retrieved May 1, 2012.</ref> Native Americans as a proportion of the US population represent the second highest amongst all States with only Alaska  having a higher ratio, while it also has a large Hispanic population. Homelessness is a direct cause from an individual not being able to provide themselves with the most basic of necessities to maintain a healthy life hence having a higher proportion of individuals in poverty places a greater risk of an individual becoming homeless. A study into cost of homelessness on the state government of New Mexico concluded that, on a per nightly basis, emergency shelter costs $30; supportive housing $33, state penitentiary $77, Santa Fe County Detention Centre $82, St Vincent Hospital $550 and UNM Hospital $71.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Which study?  Cite the study.}}  Homelessness by and large is caused by or as a result of health care complications.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=}} One need only  consider ailments such as addiction, psychological disorders, HIV/AIDS and an array of other ailments that require consistent long term care that cannot be well managed in an unsafe, unpredictable environment that confronts most homeless.\n\nInability to adequately manage these medical problems places a further economic burden on the state as the frequency and duration of hospital visits may increase. This phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that on average homeless spent four days longer than comparable non-homeless, costing the State approximately $2,414 per hospitalization. Homelessness causes both serious mental and physical anguish as evidenced by the fact that a homeless person's psychiatric hospitalization rate is 100 times more than their non-homeless compatriot.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=There are no citations for any of the info in this paragraph.}}\n\nDue to New Mexico's strong laws against loitering, sleeping in cars and begging (traits a lot of homeless people are forced to do) they are disproportionately over-represented in the prison system. Police officials can accuse any person they believe may have attempted to disrupt the peace, regardless of whether or not the offense presents danger to the community. Panhandling is an umbrella term that represents begging, sponging and spanging. In the state of New Mexico there are strict regulations on panhandling. Moreover, homeless people are prohibited to beg after dark and if they do they are often sent to jail. In an attempt to remove homeless people from the streets, it is common for the police to dispose of their property.  The above conditions cause the mere act of being homeless to become a self-perpetuating cycle of crime.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=There are no citations for any of the info in this entire paragraph.}}\n\n==New York==\nIn 1979, a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class action suit before the courts, ''Callahan v. Carey'', against the City and State, arguing for a person's state constitutional \"right to shelter\". It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards. By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, the New York City Department of Homeless Services reported that the sheltered homeless population consisted of:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf |title=NYC Department of Homeless Services |publisher=Nyc.gov |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126233718/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf |archivedate=January 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* 27,844 adults\n* 20,627 children\n* 48,471 total individuals\n\nAccording to the [[Coalition for the Homeless]], the homeless population of New York rose to an all-time high in 2011.

Several were denied because they were said to have family who could house them when in actuality this might not have been the case. Applicants may have faced overcrowding, unsafe conditions, or may have had relatives unwilling to house them. According to Mary Brosnaham, spokeswoman for Coalition for the Homeless, the administration of Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] employs a deliberate policy of \"active deterrence\".\n\nPart of the problem lies with long-term joblessness that characterizes the United States' economic crisis. According to the [[Center for an Urban Future]] about a third of the adult workers in New York City are low-wage earners, making under $11.54 an hour. Affordable rent rates considered to be no more than a third of the renter's wages. A family in New York City must earn at least $54,000 to find an affordable home. The median household income for renters in the Bronx and Brooklyn is barely $30,000 and $35,000 respectively. According to the Community Service Society, \"Two-thirds of poor New Yorkers and over one-third of near poor households\u2014up to twice the poverty level\u2014spend at least half of their incomes on rent&nbsp;... and place millions of low-income New Yorkers at risk of housing hardships and displacement.\"\n\nThe [[New York City Housing Authority]] is experiencing record demand for subsidized housing assistance. However, just 13,000 of the 29,000 families who applied were admitted into the public housing system or received federal housing vouchers known as [Section 8] in 2010. Due to budget cuts there have been no new applicants accepted to receive Section 8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/11/budget-cuts-threaten-nyc-homeless-program/ |title=NYC Program To Help Homeless Won't Have The Funds To Help More \u00ab CBS New York |publisher=Newyork.cbslocal.com |date=March 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, there were protests about the Governor's proposed cut of $65 million in annual funding to the homeless adult services system.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/press/pr032310.shtml \"Council, Public Advocate, Department of Homeless Services, and Coalition for the Homeless unite to oppose State's $65 million cut to the Adult Shelter System\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601195913/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/press/pr032310.shtml |date=June 1, 2010 }}, News Brief, NYC Department of Homeless Services, March 23, 2010</ref> The Bloomberg administration announced an immediate halt to the Advantage program, threatening to cast 15,000 families back into the shelters or onto the streets.

In 1990, the ban on begging in New York City's subway was challenged in ''Young v. New York City Transit Authority'', and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the ban in this case did not infringe on First Amendment rights to free speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahcuah.com/lawsuit/federal/young.htm|title=Young v. New York City Transit Authority|website=Ahcuah.com |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> However, this precedent did not last long as it was seemingly overturned in 1993, in ''Loper v. New York City Police Department''.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Circuit.|first=United States Court of Appeals, Second|date=January 1, 1993 |title=999 F2d 699 Loper v.

New York City Police Department rarely issued fines under this law, but used it to 'move on' beggars.<ref name=\":10\" /> In ''Loper'', the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found begging in this case to be a First Amendment right. And clarified that the ban on the subway system in the ''Young'' case was a reasonable limit as, even though it was publicly owned, panhandling in the confined space of the subway system can disrupt and startle passengers and potentially cause harm.<ref name=\":11\" /> Whereas, the blanket ban in all public spaces in the ''Loper'' case would leave beggars nowhere else for begging, which was considered an 'expressive activity' and thus protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA similar judgement was made in ''International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee'' in regard to New York City's airports, which found it reasonable to ban such activities in airports.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/672/case.html|title=International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.

The airports and subways of New York, while being public places, are not public forums as the free exchange of ideas has never been considered its principal purpose, unlike the streets of New York.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThe ''Loper'' judgement is narrow in that it only forbade a blanket ban of begging, in fact it suggested city councils introduce more targeted begging laws, such as those for aggressive begging, and spoke favourably of the laws in Seattle Washington.<ref name=\":11\" /> After the ''Loper'' case which found \u00a7240.35(1) of the state's Penal Code to be unconstitutional, the New York City Police Department stopped enforcing that section of the code.

Some prohibit panhandling in specific areas (such as shopping centres and intersections), other counties have proposed the possibility of permits, and others are still very unclear on their position both in legislation and enforcement.<ref name=\":0a\">{{cite web|url=http://legalbeagle.com/8696837-begging-laws-virginia.html|title=Begging Laws in Virginia|website=Legal Beagle |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> Generally, exclusions for panhandling may include on public streets, if impeding traffic, within 50 feet of a retailer, or on sidewalks of a certain size.<ref name=\":0a\" /> Furthermore, activities such as playing loud music and preventing the movement of others are also prohibited. Some laws are said to be in place to reduce public harassment caused by people asking for money.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe city of [[Manassas, Virginia]] goes into more detail about its definitions around panhandling regulations. Specifically, it prohibits an aggressive manner which is explained as the persistent requesting of money after the person being solicited has made a negative response that induces some sort of fear or intimidation.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.municode.com/library/va/manassas/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_CH78OFMIPR_ARTVIIOFAGPEOR_DIV2BEPAPUPL&searchText|title=Municode Library|website=Municode.com |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> It further prohibits intentionally blocking or interfering with the passage of another person, and abusive language or gestures.<ref name=\":1\" /> The city of Manassas also lists a number of intersections that prohibits panhandling within 150 feet.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other cities in Virginia vary in their regulations, for example, the City of Colonial Heights takes a preventative approach, although it does not state specifically how it would work to provide the prevention of street begging, whether through law enforcement or social assistance policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.lis.virginia.gov/charters/colonial-heights/|title=Charter - Colonial Heights|website=law.lis.virginia.gov |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> The [[Lee County, Virginia]], in Jonesville, has a much stronger approach in their legislation aiming to 'restrain and punish' begging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.lis.virginia.gov/charters/jonesville/|title=Charter - Jonesville|website=law.lis.virginia.gov |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> [[Tazewell County, Virginia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.lis.virginia.gov/charters/richlands/|title=Charter - Richlands|website=law.lis.virginia.gov |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> and the City of [[Buena Vista, Virginia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.lis.virginia.gov/charters/buena-vista/|title=Charter - Buena Vista|website=law.lis.virginia.gov |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> both merely state that begging is prohibited without expanding much further.\n\nIn some counties in Virginia, there was discussion proposals to introduce permits for panhandlers. Permits proposed would be required for people verbally asking for donations, as well as actions and behaviours requesting donations within a public space.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea has been quite contentious.\n\nSome media reports reflect calls for increased enforcement of laws against panhandlers,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/22450468/panhandling-at-stop-lights-raises-enforcement-questions|title=Panhandling at Stop Lights Raises Enforcement Questions |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> and others report that the ban on panhandling in public spaces is against the civil liberties of individuals, and unconstitutional as it infringes on the First Amendment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsytype.com/8323-charlottesville-panhandling-ban/|title=Lawsuit filed by ACLU over Charlottesville panhandling ban|date=June 28, 2011 |newspaper=NewsyType|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> In regards to the permit proposal, community opinion was split, with some calling strongly for the implementation of a $25 permit that would need to be carried by panhandlers.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/councilman-proposes-panhandling-permits/Content?oid=1381499|title=Councilman Proposes Panhandling Permits|last=Biegelsen|first=Amy|website=Style Weekly |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> The proposal is yet to be approved, with many opposing the idea, questioning where people would be able to get the money and documents required to purchase the permit, who would be allowed to attain a permit and who would be excluded, and how these permits would restrict the accessibility, and monitor the livelihoods of, panhandlers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA lot of the calls for increasing panhandling restrictions are reporting that it is for the safety of people engaging in panhandling, and for motorists in regards to begging on motorways.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, the Arlington Police Department in Virginia reportedly discouraged citizens from giving to panhandlers in the area, in that \"there's no telling what the cash will be used for\".<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.arlnow.com/2015/09/18/police-dont-give-to-roadside-panhandlers/|title=Arlington Police: Don't Give to Roadside Panhandlers|date=September 18, 2015 |website=ARLnow.com - Arlington, Va. Local News |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> While many are discouraging giving to panhandlers on motorways due to the context of 'risk', they also appear to portray an underlining negative bias and view of illegitimacy toward people who engage in panhandling. As police in some counties cannot directly arrest someone for begging, the Arlington Police Department note that they do arrest panhandlers for other offences for jaywalking and other traffic related offences.<ref name=\":3\" /> This was mirrored in a media article in Chesterfield, VA, where it was reported in 2011 that 14 panhandlers were arrested for steeping on to the street under traffic offenses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc12.com/story/15954326/special-investigation-about-panhandling-in-chesterfield-county|title=Special investigation about panhandling in Chesterfield County |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe laws and regulations in Virginia are incredibly varied, making it difficult for panhandlers to know their rights and legitimacy in the area, particularly if one does not have access to the resources in order to find this information. Even within the legislation, the definitions and language tends to be of a broad and very subjective nature. There is also conflicting motivations for further restricting panhandling in the area, with discourses around both the safety as well as the legitimacy of panhandling taking place, particularly in the local media.\n\n==Washington, D.C.==\nThe [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] estimated in 2013 the number of homeless in [[Washington, D.C.]] as 6,865, which was a 29 percent increase after 2007.<ref>Wiener, Aaron.

While begging is protected under the First Amendment, certain cities have attempted to find ambiguity's in this right to freedom of speech, while others use more discretion when it comes to panhandling.\n\nThe city of Tacoma has passed laws which have quashed any form of panhandling in public forums. Panhandling is banned anywhere which is within 15 feet of ATMs, bus stops, pay phones, parked cars, gas stations, outdoor stations, cafes and carwashes within the city.<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite news|url=http://crosscut.com/2007/12/tacomas-panhandling-ban-where-did-they-all-go/|title=Tacoma's panhandling ban: Where did they all go?|date=December 4, 2007 |newspaper=Crosscut|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> More specifically, it is illegal on buses, freeway ramps and on intersections. Moreover, in the hours between sunset and sunrise, it is prohibited entirely. Those who are found to be in breach of this ordinance could be penalized with 90 days in jail or be fined $1000.<ref name=\":29\" /> While the city of Arlington's laws are not as strict, with panhandling being banned anywhere within 300 feet of these certain areas, violators too can be met with the same harsh forms of punishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realchangenews.org/2014/08/06/ban-panhandling-snohomish-county-city-arlington-exemplifies-national-trend|title=With ban on panhandling, Snohomish County city of Arlington exemplifies national trend|last=Burkhalter|first=Aaron|date=August 6, 2014 |website=Real Change |publisher=Disqus |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> A more controversial law was passed in October 2015, when the city of Everett amended previous code which categorised 'aggressive panhandling' as just a misdemeanour.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/news/everett-passes-measure-against-aggressive-panhandling/|title=Everett passes measure against 'aggressive panhandling' {{!}} HeraldNet.com|date=October 28, 2015 |newspaper=HeraldNet.com|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> This new law prevents begging 'in a manner that hinders or obstructs the free passage of any person in a public place' or begging that 'intentionally causes or attempts to cause another person to reasonably fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon their person, or upon property in their immediate possession.' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codepublishing.com/WA/Everett/?Everett09/Everett0952.html|title=Everett Municipal Code|website=Codepublishing.com|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> The passing of the law has been met with mass condemnation, with many critics saying it criminalizes homelessness, while the ACLU called it 'unconstitutional, ineffective and unnecessarily costly and punitive.' <ref name=\":30\" />\n\nFurther opposition to criminalising begging was demonstrated recently when the city of Lakewood's anti-panhandling ordinance was deemed unconstitutional in the case ''The City of Lakewood v Robert W. Willis.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aclu-wa.org/node/7552|title=WA Supreme Court: Lakewood's ban on panhandling violates free speech rights|date=July 22, 2016 |website=American Civil Liberties Union of Washington|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> Laws were considered 'overbroad' by the courts as they restrict panhandling in several locations without seeing if there is actually obstruction of traffic. This case has also led to a discussion surrounding whether to charge an individual with obstructing traffic or with begging.\n\n===City of Seattle===\n{{Main|Homelessness in Seattle}}\nThe city of Seattle's stance on panhandling is not as hardline as many other cities in Washington. For example, in 2010 an amendment was sponsored which would enable stronger panhandling laws that included a regulation against 'intimidating words and gestures' and obstructing someone's walking path.<ref name=\":31\">{{cite web|url=http://w.seattlestar.net/2014/10/brother-can-you-spare-a-dime/|title=The Seattle Star|last=Murphy|first=Raymond|date=|website=The Seattle Star|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> Moreover, a $50 fine was proposed to be the punishment for anyone found to be 'aggressively panhandling.' While the bill was initially passed, Mayor Mike McGinn vetoed the bill. Yet despite this opposition to a call for certain regulations on panhandling, Mayor Ed Murray believed that it is imperative that existing laws are enforced. These current laws were enacted in 1987 and they are effectively an ordinance against aggressive panhandling. While this does represent similarities with Everett's laws, the laws in Seattle have been seen as largely discretionary and 'feel good legislation' which have been viewed ambiguously.<ref name=\":31\" /> \n\nThere are about 8,000 homeless individuals in Seattle on an average day. The \"One Night Count\" in 2015 found 10,047 individuals homeless in the 3rd week in January, in King County. 3,772 individuals were without shelter in King County. 2,804 were without shelter in Seattle.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Kadi, J., & Ronald, R.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

late March. On 25 March 2020, the Robert Koch Institute announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be allowed to get tested, and prioritised loosened restrictions to test health care workers.<ref name=\"Focus2503\">{{Cite news |last=Schneider |first=Paula |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/es-grassiert-ungewissheit-repraesentative-tests-sollen-wahres-ausmass-in-deutschland-zeigen_id_11813688.html |title=Statistikerin fordert Tests, die endlich das wahre Corona-Ausma\u00df in Deutschland zeigen |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020 |publisher=Focus}}</ref> RKI criticised that too many people without symptoms were tested.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/RKI-kassiert-Kriterium-fuer-Corona-Tests-article21667740.html |title=RKI kassiert Kriterium f\u00fcr Corona-Tests |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020 |publisher=ntv}}</ref> On 26 March, virologist Streeck said that testing labs were at the limit of their capacity.<ref name=\"Focus2703\">{{Cite news |last=Obermeier |first=Ludwig |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/covid-19-pandemie-top-virologe-wir-stecken-in-einem-dilemma-weil-uns-entscheidende-daten-fehlen_id_11811994.html |title=Zahlen-Chaos: Bonner Virologe zeigt mit 3 Beispielen, warum wir im Corona-Dilemma stecken |date=26 March 2020 |access-date=27 March 2020 |publisher=Focus}}</ref> The more a pandemic has spread, the harder it becomes to increase the number of tests because the healthcare system becomes overburdened.<ref name=\"Focus2403\" />\n\n====Reporting lag====\nIncubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of about five to ten days.<ref name=\"Focus2503\" />\n\nBecause of the federal health care system in Germany, states vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public. Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Ergaenzung_Pandemieplan_Covid.pdf |title=Erg\u00e4nzung zum Nationalen Pandemieplan \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 neuartige Coronaviruserkrankung |last=[[Robert Koch-Institut]] |date=4 March 2020 |language=de |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> Four major targets are included in this plan:\n\n* Reduce morbidity and mortality\n* Ensure treatment of infected persons\n* Upkeep of essential public services\n* Short and accurate information for decision-makers, media and public\n\nThe plan has three stages which might eventually overlap:\n* Containment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)\n* Protection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)\n* Mitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)\n\nIn the ''containment stage'' health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted. New numbers were published once a day in the afternoon.
