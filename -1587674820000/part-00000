Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), an international [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggler]]. The offense had occurred 10 years before the start of the series and in that time Chapman had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's [[upper middle class]]. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fianc\u00e9, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest), and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the \"Federal Department of Corrections\" (a fictional version of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), and was in a later season acquired by the Management & Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company.\n\nThe fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues. During the riot, some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically wounded by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, [[SWAT]] raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally wounded by a corrupt \"strike team\", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken the guard hostage. All inmates are transported to other prisons.\n\nThe consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned as a consequence of the riot (she had been moved to the minimum security prison). Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality.\n\nThe seventh season provides an ending to various inmate's stories. Chapman and Vause continue their on/off again relationship. The season shows how some prisoners are able to move beyond their time in prison while others are captured by the system and through their own flaws and/or systemic problems in the structure of US society and its \u201cjustice\u201d system are unable to progress. In addition to the established setting of Litchfield Max, a significant portion of the season takes place in a newly created [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] detention centre for detained presumed illegal immigrants, showing their struggles and lack of access to outside help in large part because of complete or extreme disregard of the law. \n\nThroughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts by the corporate owner to increase profit by millions, [[private prison|privatization of prison]], overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination (among other issues), affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being; the correctional officers\u2019 lives; and the prison's basic inability to fulfill its fundamental legal responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Terry|first=April|date=July 2016|title=Surveying Issues That Arise in Women's Prisons: A Content Critique of Orange Is the New Black: OITNB: Women's Prisons|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=10|issue=7|pages=553\u2013566|doi=10.1111/soc4.12388}}</ref> One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum-security prison's Director of Human Activities (aka the warden, under privatization nomenclature), Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a [[Prison warden|warden]] constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down. This theme is continued when a new forward-thinking & caring warden is hired at the maximum security prison, and unlike Caputo actually institutes educational programs and positive changes. She is fired for these actions and her attitude toward the corporate corruption, although her short-lived changes have profound positive results.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Orange Is the New Black characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n<!-- Main cast is determined by opening credits billing, not popularity or episode count -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Taylor Schilling]] as [[Piper Chapman]]\n* [[Laura Prepon]] as [[Alex Vause]], inmate  {{Small|(seasons 1, 3\u20137; recurring season 2)}}\n* [[Michael Harney]] as Sam Healy, correctional officer {{Small|(seasons 1\u20134; guest season 6 and 7)}}{{efn|Michael J.

Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), an international [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggler]]. The offense had occurred 10 years before the start of the series and in that time Chapman had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's [[upper middle class]]. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fianc\u00e9, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest), and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the \"Federal Department of Corrections\" (a fictional version of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), and was in a later season acquired by the Management & Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company.\n\nThe fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues. During the riot, some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically wounded by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, [[SWAT]] raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally wounded by a corrupt \"strike team\", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken the guard hostage. All inmates are transported to other prisons.\n\nThe consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned as a consequence of the riot (she had been moved to the minimum security prison). Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality.\n\nThe seventh season provides an ending to various inmate's stories. Chapman and Vause continue their on/off again relationship. The season shows how some prisoners are able to move beyond their time in prison while others are captured by the system and through their own flaws and/or systemic problems in the structure of US society and its \u201cjustice\u201d system are unable to progress. In addition to the established setting of Litchfield Max, a significant portion of the season takes place in a newly created [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] detention centre for detained presumed illegal immigrants, showing their struggles and lack of access to outside help in large part because of complete or extreme disregard of the law. \n\nThroughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts by the corporate owner to increase profit by millions, [[private prison|privatization of prison]], overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination (among other issues), affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being; the correctional officers\u2019 lives; and the prison's basic inability to fulfill its fundamental legal responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Terry|first=April|date=July 2016|title=Surveying Issues That Arise in Women's Prisons: A Content Critique of Orange Is the New Black: OITNB: Women's Prisons|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=10|issue=7|pages=553\u2013566|doi=10.1111/soc4.12388}}</ref> One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum-security prison's Director of Human Activities (aka the warden, under privatization nomenclature), Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a [[Prison warden|warden]] constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down. This theme is continued when a new forward-thinking & caring warden is hired at the maximum security prison, and unlike Caputo actually institutes educational programs and positive changes. She is fired for these actions and her attitude toward the corporate corruption, although her short-lived changes have profound positive results.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Orange Is the New Black characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n<!-- Main cast is determined by opening credits billing, not popularity or episode count -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Taylor Schilling]] as [[Piper Chapman]]\n* [[Laura Prepon]] as [[Alex Vause]], inmate  {{Small|(seasons 1, 3\u20137; recurring season 2)}}\n* [[Michael Harney]] as Sam Healy, correctional officer {{Small|(seasons 1\u20134; guest season 6 and 7)}}{{efn|Michael J.

However, a sense of Aberdeen as a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], with its own city council, can be traced back to 1900, when the [[Counties of Scotland|city of county]] of Aberdeen was created.\n \nIn 1975, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the county of city was combined with [[Bucksburn]], [[Dyce]], Newhills, Old Machar, [[Peterculter]] and the Stoneywood areas of the [[county of Aberdeen]] and, the [[Nigg, Aberdeen|Nigg]] area of the [[county of Kincardine]], (including [[Cove Bay]]) to form the Aberdeen district of the [[Grampian]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. This district became the now existing [[unitary council area]] in 1996.\n\nOn 9 May 1995, by resolution under section 23 of the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], The City of Aberdeen Council changed the name of the local government area of \"City of Aberdeen\" to \"Aberdeen City\".\n\n==Composition==\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the council was under the control of a [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] and [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party|Conservative]] coalition, holding 23 of the 43 seats on the council. Prior to the 2003 election, the council had been considered a [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] stronghold.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott|last=David|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1443312002|title=Labour is set to lose council strongholds in elections|work=The Scotsman|date=2002-12-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109233442/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1443312002|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following the [[2007 Aberdeen City Council election|May 2007 election]], contested for the first time using a system of [[proportional representation]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) formed a coalition to run the council, holding 27 of the 43 seats (following an SNP by-election gain from the Conservatives on 16 August 2007, the Liberal Democrat/SNP coalition held 28 of the 43 seats). At the [[2012 Aberdeen City Council election|May 2012 election]], Labour entered into a coalition with the Conservatives and the [[Independent (politics)|independents]] to run the council, with 23 out of the 43 seats.\n\nAberdeen City Council comprises forty-three councillors, who represent the city's thirteen [[ward (politics)|wards]], and is chaired by the [[List of Provosts and Lord Provosts of Aberdeen|Lord Provost]].\n\n==New wards from May 2007==\nBefore May 2007, councillors represented 43 single-member wards, but since then, all seats were contested by the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system. On 5 May 2007, it was the first [[2007 Aberdeen City Council election|election]] to use the [[single transferable vote]] system of election and multi-member [[ward (politics)|ward]]s, each ward electing three or four councillors. The [[Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland]] completed its final recommendations for new wards for all the [[council areas of Scotland]] and for [[Aberdeen]] it was concluded that there would be 13 multi-member wards with a total of 43 councillors. This system was introduced as a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], and was designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/your-area/scotelections2007.cfm|title=Scottish elections 2007|publisher=The Electoral Commission|accessdate=2007-02-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127122545/http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/your-area/scotelections2007.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}</ref>\n\nThe composition of wards changed to:\n\n'''3 councillors:'''\n*(11) Airyhall/[[Broomhill, Aberdeen|Broomhill]]/[[Garthdee]]\n*(8) George Street/Harbour\n*(5) [[Hilton, Aberdeen|Hilton]]/Stockethill\n*(13) [[Kincorth]]/Loirston\n*(3) [[Kingswells]]/Sheddocksley\n*(9) Lower Deeside\n*(7) [[Midstocket]]/[[Rosemount, Aberdeen|Rosemount]]\n*(4) Northfield\n*(6) [[Tillydrone]]/Seaton/[[Old Aberdeen]]\n\n'''4 councillors:'''\n*(2) [[Bridge of Don]]\n*(1) [[Dyce]]/[[Bucksburn]]/[[Danestone]]\n*(10) [[Hazlehead, Aberdeen|Hazlehead]]/Ashley/[[Queen's Cross|Queens Cross]]\n*(12) [[Torry]]/[[Ferryhill, Aberdeen|Ferryhill]]\n\n'''Name changes'''\n*(3) Kingswells/Sheddocksley to [[Kingswells]]/Sheddocksley/[[Summerhill, Aberdeen|Summerhill]]\n*(4) Northfield to Northfield/[[Mastrick]] North\n*(5) Hilton/Stockethill to [[Hilton, Aberdeen|Hilton]]/[[Woodside, Aberdeen|Woodside]]/Stockethill\n*(13) Kincorth/Loirston to [[Kincorth]]/[[Nigg, Aberdeen|Nigg]]/[[Cove Bay|Cove]]\n\n==Composition (2012\u20132017)==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|width=\"180\"|'''Ward'''\n|width=\"180\"|'''Councillors'''\n|width=\"180\"|'''Party'''\n|width=\"5\"|\n|-\n|Dyce/Bucksburn/Danestone\n|Barney Crockett\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Graeme Lawrence\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Neil MacGregor\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Gill Samarai\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Bridge of Don\n|Muriel Jaffrey\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|John Reynolds\n|Independent\n|\n|-\n|\n|Sandy Stuart\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Willie Young\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Kingswells/Sheddocksley/Summerhill\n|David Cameron\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Steve Delaney\n|Liberal Democrat\n|bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Democrats (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Len Ironside\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Northfield/Mastrick North\n|Scott Carle\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Jackie Dunbar\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Gordon Graham\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Hilton/Woodside/Stockethill\n|George Adam\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Kirsty Blackmann (\"n\u00e9e\" West)\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Lesley Dunbar\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Tillydrone/Seaton/Old Aberdeen\n|Ross Grant\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Ramsey Milne\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Jim Noble\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Midstocket/Rosemount\n|Bill Cormie\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Fraser Forsyth\n|Independent\n|\n|-\n|\n|Jenny Laing\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|George Street/Harbour\n|Andrew May\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Jean Morrison\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Nathan Morrison\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Lower Deeside\n|Mary Boulton\n|Independent\n|\n|-\n|\n|M.

[[2011 Scottish Parliament election]] to determine whether Scotland should become an [[Sovereign state|independent nation]] or remain a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved part]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Of the 3,623,344 votes cast (on a turnout of 84.6%) 2,001,926 were in favour of a \"No\" vote (55.3%) while 1,617,989 were \"Yes\" (44.7%): leading to Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Aberdeen City local authority area had a higher than average No vote. 84,094 voters in the area voted against independence (58.6%) while 59,390 voted in favour of independence (41.4%). The Aberdeen City council area had the third lowest turnout in Scotland with 143,484 valid ballot papers on a turnout of 81.7%, ahead of [[Dundee]] and [[Glasgow]].\n\n==Twinned cities==\nAberdeen is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with several cities across Europe and throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/ACCI/web/site/Tourism/SL/tur_TownTwinning.asp|title=Twinning|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> These include:\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* {{flagicon|Zimbabwe}} - [[Bulawayo]], [[Zimbabwe]]\n* {{flagicon|France}} - [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[France]]\n* {{flagicon|Belarus}} - [[Gomel]], [[Belarus]]\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* {{flagicon|United States}} - [[Houston]], [[United States]] (as part of [[Grampian]])\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} - [[Regensburg]], [[Germany]]\n* {{flagicon|Norway}} - [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aberdeen City Youth Council]]\n*[[Politics of Dundee]]\n*[[Politics of Edinburgh]]\n*[[Politics of Glasgow]]\n*[[Politics of Scotland]]\n*[[Politics of the Highland council area]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070307172247/http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/ACCI/web/site/home/home.asp Council website]\n\n{{Aberdeen}}\n{{Former local government regions of Scotland}} \n\n[[Category:Politics of Aberdeen| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\nThe '''Politics of [[Aberdeen]]''', [[Scotland]] have changed significantly in recent years. In 1996, under the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]], [[Grampian|Grampian Regional Council]] and Aberdeen District Council were dissolved, creating the new unitary [[Aberdeen City Council]] to represent the city's [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]].\n\n==Aberdeen City Council==\n[[Aberdeen City Council]] represents the Aberdeen City [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]] of [[Scotland]].\n\nThe council area was created in 1996, under the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]]. However, a sense of Aberdeen as a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], with its own city council, can be traced back to 1900, when the [[Counties of Scotland|city of county]] of Aberdeen was created.\n \nIn 1975, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the county of city was combined with [[Bucksburn]], [[Dyce]], Newhills, Old Machar, [[Peterculter]] and the Stoneywood areas of the [[county of Aberdeen]] and, the [[Nigg, Aberdeen|Nigg]] area of the [[county of Kincardine]], (including [[Cove Bay]]) to form the Aberdeen district of the [[Grampian]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. This district became the now existing [[unitary council area]] in 1996.\n\nOn 9 May 1995, by resolution under section 23 of the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], The City of Aberdeen Council changed the name of the local government area of \"City of Aberdeen\" to \"Aberdeen City\".\n\n==Composition==\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the council was under the control of a [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] and [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party|Conservative]] coalition, holding 23 of the 43 seats on the council. Prior to the 2003 election, the council had been considered a [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] stronghold.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott|last=David|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1443312002|title=Labour is set to lose council strongholds in elections|work=The Scotsman|date=2002-12-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109233442/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1443312002|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following the [[2007 Aberdeen City Council election|May 2007 election]], contested for the first time using a system of [[proportional representation]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) formed a coalition to run the council, holding 27 of the 43 seats (following an SNP by-election gain from the Conservatives on 16 August 2007, the Liberal Democrat/SNP coalition held 28 of the 43 seats). At the [[2012 Aberdeen City Council election|May 2012 election]], Labour entered into a coalition with the Conservatives and the [[Independent (politics)|independents]] to run the council, with 23 out of the 43 seats.\n\nAberdeen City Council comprises forty-three councillors, who represent the city's thirteen [[ward (politics)|wards]], and is chaired by the [[List of Provosts and Lord Provosts of Aberdeen|Lord Provost]].\n\n==New wards from May 2007==\nBefore May 2007, councillors represented 43 single-member wards, but since then, all seats were contested by the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system. On 5 May 2007, it was the first [[2007 Aberdeen City Council election|election]] to use the [[single transferable vote]] system of election and multi-member [[ward (politics)|ward]]s, each ward electing three or four councillors. The [[Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland]] completed its final recommendations for new wards for all the [[council areas of Scotland]] and for [[Aberdeen]] it was concluded that there would be 13 multi-member wards with a total of 43 councillors. This system was introduced as a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], and was designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/your-area/scotelections2007.cfm|title=Scottish elections 2007|publisher=The Electoral Commission|accessdate=2007-02-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127122545/http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/your-area/scotelections2007.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}</ref>\n\nThe composition of wards changed to:\n\n'''3 councillors:'''\n*(11) Airyhall/[[Broomhill, Aberdeen|Broomhill]]/[[Garthdee]]\n*(8) George Street/Harbour\n*(5) [[Hilton, Aberdeen|Hilton]]/Stockethill\n*(13) [[Kincorth]]/Loirston\n*(3) [[Kingswells]]/Sheddocksley\n*(9) Lower Deeside\n*(7) [[Midstocket]]/[[Rosemount, Aberdeen|Rosemount]]\n*(4) Northfield\n*(6) [[Tillydrone]]/Seaton/[[Old Aberdeen]]\n\n'''4 councillors:'''\n*(2) [[Bridge of Don]]\n*(1) [[Dyce]]/[[Bucksburn]]/[[Danestone]]\n*(10) [[Hazlehead, Aberdeen|Hazlehead]]/Ashley/[[Queen's Cross|Queens Cross]]\n*(12) [[Torry]]/[[Ferryhill, Aberdeen|Ferryhill]]\n\n'''Name changes'''\n*(3) Kingswells/Sheddocksley to [[Kingswells]]/Sheddocksley/[[Summerhill, Aberdeen|Summerhill]]\n*(4) Northfield to Northfield/[[Mastrick]] North\n*(5) Hilton/Stockethill to [[Hilton, Aberdeen|Hilton]]/[[Woodside, Aberdeen|Woodside]]/Stockethill\n*(13) Kincorth/Loirston to [[Kincorth]]/[[Nigg, Aberdeen|Nigg]]/[[Cove Bay|Cove]]\n\n==Composition (2012\u20132017)==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|width=\"180\"|'''Ward'''\n|width=\"180\"|'''Councillors'''\n|width=\"180\"|'''Party'''\n|width=\"5\"|\n|-\n|Dyce/Bucksburn/Danestone\n|Barney Crockett\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Graeme Lawrence\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Neil MacGregor\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Gill Samarai\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Bridge of Don\n|Muriel Jaffrey\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|John Reynolds\n|Independent\n|\n|-\n|\n|Sandy Stuart\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Willie Young\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Kingswells/Sheddocksley/Summerhill\n|David Cameron\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Steve Delaney\n|Liberal Democrat\n|bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Democrats (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Len Ironside\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Northfield/Mastrick North\n|Scott Carle\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Jackie Dunbar\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Gordon Graham\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Hilton/Woodside/Stockethill\n|George Adam\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Kirsty Blackmann (\"n\u00e9e\" West)\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Lesley Dunbar\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Tillydrone/Seaton/Old Aberdeen\n|Ross Grant\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Ramsey Milne\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Jim Noble\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Midstocket/Rosemount\n|Bill Cormie\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Fraser Forsyth\n|Independent\n|\n|-\n|\n|Jenny Laing\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|George Street/Harbour\n|Andrew May\n|Scottish National Party\n|bgcolor=\"{{Scottish National Party/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Jean Morrison\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|\n|Nathan Morrison\n|Labour\n|bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|\n|-\n|Lower Deeside\n|Mary Boulton\n|Independent\n|\n|-\n|\n|M.

A women's group in Gainesville organized a literary society called the Twentieth Century Club. The club issued a call for donated material and money to help initiate the town's first library. By 1905, Gainesville two subscription libraries, for which a small fee was required. In January 1905, Nora Norton established the Gainesville Circulating Library, held in the Gainesville Sewing Machine company, which required a five dollar a year fee. The Twentieth Century Club  opened a library in the Miller Law Exchange with assistance of 200 donated books and a yearly fee of two dollars.\n\nIn January 1906, the Gainesville Public Library on West Liberty (now University Avenue) opened with a collection of 800 books, combining books from the Twentieth Century Club, the library of the [[East Florida Seminary]] (recently absorbed into the University of Florida), and the Gainesville Circulating Library. However, a small fee was still required.\n\nBy 1914 the library moved to several locations, finally ending up at a small building owned by attorney B.A. Thrasher. The Library Association requested assistance from the City Council to make the Gainesville Library a free public library (fees were still 2 dollars a year). To be eligible for Carnegie funds to build a library, the city was required to pay 1000 dollars a year to acquire the deed to 419 East University Avenue. On October 13th 1915, the Gainesville Public Library was established at that location, with the first Library Board including:\u00a0 Dr. A.A. Murphree, Captain C.R. Layton, Hon. W.M. Pepper, Hon. George P. Morris, and Dr. H.W. Cox.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ask.aclib.us/faq/190238|title=What is the history of the library? - Alachua Ask Us!|website=ask.aclib.us|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> The Gainesville Public Library became a free library in 1918, supported by funds from city taxes, and in a building constructed with the aid of a [[Carnegie library|Carnegie grant]].

The Carver Branch closed in 1969, after the main library had been [[Desegregation|desegregated]]. In 1958, the City of Gainesville and Alachua County agreed to jointly operate the library for the whole county.\n\nBranch libraries were opened in High Springs, Hawthorne and Micanopy the next year, and a bookmobile was put into service. Alachua County joined with [[Bradford County, Florida|Bradford County]] to operate the Santa Fe Regional Library. After Bradford County withdrew from the Regional Library, the Alachua County Library District was formally established in 1986. In 1987 funds were approved by vote for a new main library.

More than 27,000 cards were distributed the first year of the program.<ref>https://www.aclib.us/studentcards</ref> The program was then continued into the 2019-2020 school year and expanded to include students at P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School. Student cards allow for:\n\n* Check out of 3 Print or Audiobooks\n* Borrowing eBooks, downloadable music and digital magazine\n* Use of eSources, including tutoring help and research resources.\n* Ability to log on to computers at any of the Library District\u2019s 12 branches.\n\nStudents new to the program receive a welcome letter along with the card at the school and then are able to use the library card to access services online as well as in the branches.  Although the Alachua County Library District charges no late fees, students are still expected to return materials and parents may receive a quarterly statement from the library for anything not returned.\n\n==Checkouts and returns==\nLibrary card holders can checkout and return items at any branch located in Alachua County, including the two bookmobiles. Total checkout is limited to 100 items with a max of 8 DVDs per account. Books and audiobooks check out for 4 weeks, music CDs check out for 2 weeks, and DVDs check out for 1 week. Items may be renewed twice, as long as they are not on hold for another patron. Audiobooks, eBooks, music, TV shows and movies are available to library card holders as downloadable digital media from the ACLD website.\n\nIf a library card holder wishes to checkout an item that is not currently available, they may place a hold request on that item through the online catalog. By entering their library card number, a patron can then choose the branch they wish to have the item delivered to once it becomes available.<ref>{{cite web |title=Q.

Sillero-Zubiri, Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n==Wolf population dynamics==\n[[File:Canis lupus laying.jpg|thumb|right|The wolf is the prominent predator on Isle Royale.]]\nWolves on the island have, historically, been separated into three or four packs, with each pack usually having between three and eight members, including two or three [[Names given to animals young|pup]]s. The number of wolves in a pack depends mainly on the amount of snow that fell in the previous winter. In winters with light snow, pups tend to leave the pack to find mates, so packs run at four or five members; in heavily snowy winters, the pups stay with the pack, which can reach ten to twelve members. If many members of a pack die, the pack dissolves and a new one forms within a year. One pack will dissolve about once every thirty years.<ref name=\"vucetich\" />\n\nIn 2006, the wolf population, with the exception of 10 loners and separate pairs, formed three [[pack (canine)|pack]]s; the ''east pack'', the ''middle pack'', and the ''Chippewa Harbor pack''.<ref name=\"moosedecline\">\"Moose population decline leaves Isle Royale wolves scrapping for food.\" The America's Intelligence Wire (March 11, 2006): NA.</ref> Wolf packs on the island have been known to fight to try to extend their [[territoriality|territory]] and, thus, supply of moose. In 2006, the east pack killed Chippewa Harbor pack's alpha male, as witnessed by John Vucetich, a professor at [[Michigan Technological University]] and one of the lead researchers on the island, who believed that the Chippewa Harbor pack may die off without their leader.<ref name=\"moosedecline\"/>\n\n===Old Gray Guy===\n\nDuring the winter of 1997 a particularly virile wolf (later named \"Old Gray Guy\" and wolf No. 93) crossed the 15 miles of ice to Isle Royale. Old Gray Guy was larger and more territorial than the other Isle Royale wolves.   His own pack grew to an unusually large 10 wolves, and displaced and drove to extinction one of the other 4 packs.<ref name =OldGray/>   He was so-named because as he aged his fur became very pale, an unusual phenomenon. It was determined that by 2009, 56% of the wolves on Isle Royale had descended from Old Gray Guy.<ref name =OldGray/>\n\n\"We don't know of any other instance \u2014 except when they first came \u2014 of wolves crossing the ice,\" said John A. Vucetich, the lead author of a study of the wolves published online in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2011. \"The entire population is descended from a single female.\" <ref name =OldGray/>\n\nThe wolf population on Isle Royale is small, averaging only about 23 wolves. By the end of his eight years of breeding, he produced 34 pups, those had produced an additional 45 pups.<ref name =OldGray/>\n\nSuch a genetic impact is evidence for substantially greater fitness of Old Gray compared to the other inbred wolves on the island. Scientists expected that such an introduction would create a \"genetic rescue\" population boom, but it did not happen. \"A co-author of the study, Rolf O. Peterson, a research professor at Michigan Technological University, said that the population of Isle Royale hangs on by a thread, as it has for decades. The average reproduction after the Old Gray Guy arrived was no different from before. Yet this does not mean that he had no effect.\"<ref name =OldGray/>\n\n\"The simple interpretation is that genetic rescue doesn't work,\" said Dr. Vucetich, an assistant professor of wildlife ecology at Michigan Technological University. \"But what happened here is that when the immigrant came in 1997, in the decade that followed, the moose population declined radically. It's plausible that we didn't see an effect because the wolves were suffering from some other trouble that disguised the benefit. What if wolf No. 93 had never arrived? Dr. Vucetich said that it is impossible to know for sure, but the Isle Royale wolves might have disappeared completely. It may be that the Old Gray Guy arrived just in time.\"<ref name =\"OldGray\">Nicholas Bakalar, New York Times April 4, 2011 https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/science/05wolf.html?_r=1 Wolf Crosses the Lake Superior Ice to Become Leader of the Pack\"</ref>\n\n==Other species==\n[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|A snowshoe hare, one of the other species impacting the wolf and moose on Isle Royale.]]\nOnce a moose is brought down and killed, wolves have to compete with [[scavenger|scavenging]] [[raven]]s. Ravens are tenacious scavengers that can easily dodge the strike of a wolf and are unbothered by them. Ravens can eat and store up to {{convert|2|lb|kg|spell=in}} in a few days, which is minuscule compared to the storage capacity of wolves, which is up to {{convert|18|lb|kg|spell=in}} in just a few hours.<ref name=\"vucetich\"/>\n\nOther anti-social species have an effect, though rather small, on the relationship between wolves and moose on Isle Royale. Before wolves hunted them to [[extinction]], [[coyote]]s used to inhabit the island. Beavers and snowshoe hares also have an effect on both populations, because beavers and snowshoe hares are the only two animals that wolves prey on excluding moose, constituting a tenth of an Isle Royale wolf's diet.<ref name=\"overview\"/> The beaver population has sharply declined since the arrival of wolves, but they still are present, and though they are not a prime food source for typical wolves, they are the second to moose as the most consumed animal by the wolves on the island.<ref name=\"species\">\"Species of Lesser Significance.\" [http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/fauna7/fauna5l.htm ParkNet]. July 4, 2002. National Park Service. May 18, 2006</ref>  Beavers benefit both species. They are as easy prey for wolves and they create aquatic [[macrophyte]]s, very nutritional plants for moose, although the macrophytes are also consumed by the beavers.<ref name=\"mclaren\" /> Though wolves are thought to contribute to the decline in beaver, researchers believe that the decline of aspen, the primary food source of beavers, which used to be plentiful, could have led to their decrease. Beavers have been exposed to predation by having to travel long distances to find only parts of the island where aspen remains.\n\nSnowshoe hares, the third most consumed animal by wolves on Isle Royale constitute a very small portion of the wolves' diet, because snowshoe hares are so difficult to catch. Researchers have found that wolves do not show much interest in preying on hares, and only feed on them incidentally.<ref name=\"species\" />  Snowshoe hares have a negative effect on moose as they eat some of the same vegetation that moose eat, which only contributes to the decline in appropriate forage for moose.<ref name=\"mclaren\" />  The red fox is yet another animal that inhabits Isle Royale; red foxes mainly feed on snowshoe hares and occasionally scavenge on moose, or any other meat a wolf leaves behind. Wolves do not commonly hunt foxes, though wolves have been observed killing foxes when they attempt to feed on an animal carcass.<ref name=\"species\" />\n\n==Studies==\n\nIn 1958, as a graduate student at Purdue University, [[L. David Mech]] began studying the wolves of Isle Royale.<ref name =TheFarReach>''The Far Reach: The lifework of a Minnesota biologist circles the world'' by Greg Breining  Pages 32-41 Minnesota Department of Resources Conservation Volunteer Magazine. January\u2013February 2004</ref>  One of the first publications on the subject of the Wolves on the Island of Isle Royale  was the book \"The Wolves of Isle Royale\" by Mech which led to the prominence of both the author and the topic.  The book was published in 1966 by the Department of the Interior, having evolved from his doctoral thesis.  Mech's project  would become the world's longest-running predator-prey study.<ref name = \"Mihell\">''A Reasonable Illusion'' by Conor Mihell ''Sierra'' magazine November/December 2019 issue Pages 30-35 </ref>\n\n==Climate effects==\n[[Climate]] plays a major role in the moose-wolf relationship as well. Since [[El Ni\u00f1o]] hit in 1998, the climate has warmed up, which has significantly affected the moose population across North America.<ref name=\"predatorsandprey\">\"Predators and prey affected by warming. (Ecology)(decline in numbers of North American moose, increase in number of wolves)(Brief Article).\" USA Today (Magazine) 133.2711 (August 2004): 7(1).</ref>  The warmer climate in recent years has produced more [[Moose winter tick]]s, which consume the blood of animals, making them more susceptible to [[anemia]], and induce the moose to scratch off their hair, exposing them to [[hypothermia]] in cold weather.<ref name=\"predatorsandprey\" />  A moose can have tens of thousands of ticks feeding on its blood at one time, each sucking up to one milliliter of blood. The biting ticks cause a lot of discomfort for the moose, so they try to get the ticks off their bodies by biting off their hair, and rubbing up against trees. This preoccupies moose, and keeps them from browsing for food, which can lead to malnutrition. Compounded with blood loss, moose weakened by ticks are easier for wolves to kill.<ref name=\"goodrich\">Goodrich, Marcia. \"Isle Royale Wolf-Moose Study Report.\" [http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/news/media_relations/211/ Michigan Tech News/Media]. March 4, 2004. Michigan Technological University.

Otherwise, they die out.<ref name=\"roach\">Roach, John. \"Wolves, Ticks, Send Michigan Moose Numbers Plummeting.\" [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0606_050606_wolves.html National Geographic] June 6, 2005.

Hot summers also lead to moose resting in the shade, or in the water to keep cool, making them easier prey for wolves. Also, hot summers lead to tougher foraging for moose which makes them less prepared and more vulnerable to the winter. Not only has the recent warming of Isle Royale hurt the moose, but completely opposite problems harm them also. Harsh winters pose significant problems to moose, because moose have problems finding food when there is too much snow on the ground.<ref name=\"isleroyalestudy\" />  The less snow there is, the more freely moose can move around the island. When there is a significant amount of snow, moose stay in [[conifer]] [[swamp]]s, making them easier prey for wolves, because they are more confined, and immobilized due to the snow.<ref name=\"moosedecline\" />    Deep or heavy snow decreases the speed and agility of moose that is necessary to evade wolf attacks, and calves born during a winter with particularly deep snow are more vulnerable to being weaker prey for wolves later on in their lives because of foraging problems that occur when the snow is deep.<ref name=\"mclaren\" />\nThe keen survival instincts of moose have been clearly evident from the studying of their actions on Isle Royale. Female moose (called \"cows\") have been spotted on nearby smaller islands, around the main island of Isle Royale, because they swim across to give birth. This allows for them to give birth and raise their young without the threat of wolves preying on their young when they are vulnerable. This also causes trouble for moose that are born in the winter, because they can no longer swim across the water to another island, and must raise the new calf in the snow. Once the calves are physically mature, they are able to swim back, and are then able to better protect themselves from wolves, as they are then in their prime years.<ref name=\"weier\" />\n\n==Trends==\nInitially, it was thought that the wolf and moose populations would reach a stable balance,<ref name=IRWO/>.

The number of wolves in a pack depends mainly on the amount of snow that fell in the previous winter. In winters with light snow, pups tend to leave the pack to find mates, so packs run at four or five members; in heavily snowy winters, the pups stay with the pack, which can reach ten to twelve members. If many members of a pack die, the pack dissolves and a new one forms within a year. One pack will dissolve about once every thirty years.<ref name=\"vucetich\" />\n\nIn 2006, the wolf population, with the exception of 10 loners and separate pairs, formed three [[pack (canine)|pack]]s; the ''east pack'', the ''middle pack'', and the ''Chippewa Harbor pack''.<ref name=\"moosedecline\">\"Moose population decline leaves Isle Royale wolves scrapping for food.\" The America's Intelligence Wire (March 11, 2006): NA.</ref> Wolf packs on the island have been known to fight to try to extend their [[territoriality|territory]] and, thus, supply of moose. In 2006, the east pack killed Chippewa Harbor pack's alpha male, as witnessed by John Vucetich, a professor at [[Michigan Technological University]] and one of the lead researchers on the island, who believed that the Chippewa Harbor pack may die off without their leader.<ref name=\"moosedecline\"/>\n\n===Old Gray Guy===\n\nDuring the winter of 1997 a particularly virile wolf (later named \"Old Gray Guy\" and wolf No. 93) crossed the 15 miles of ice to Isle Royale. Old Gray Guy was larger and more territorial than the other Isle Royale wolves.   His own pack grew to an unusually large 10 wolves, and displaced and drove to extinction one of the other 4 packs.<ref name =OldGray/>   He was so-named because as he aged his fur became very pale, an unusual phenomenon. It was determined that by 2009, 56% of the wolves on Isle Royale had descended from Old Gray Guy.<ref name =OldGray/>\n\n\"We don't know of any other instance \u2014 except when they first came \u2014 of wolves crossing the ice,\" said John A. Vucetich, the lead author of a study of the wolves published online in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2011. \"The entire population is descended from a single female.\" <ref name =OldGray/>\n\nThe wolf population on Isle Royale is small, averaging only about 23 wolves. By the end of his eight years of breeding, he produced 34 pups, those had produced an additional 45 pups.<ref name =OldGray/>\n\nSuch a genetic impact is evidence for substantially greater fitness of Old Gray compared to the other inbred wolves on the island. Scientists expected that such an introduction would create a \"genetic rescue\" population boom, but it did not happen. \"A co-author of the study, Rolf O. Peterson, a research professor at Michigan Technological University, said that the population of Isle Royale hangs on by a thread, as it has for decades. The average reproduction after the Old Gray Guy arrived was no different from before. Yet this does not mean that he had no effect.\"<ref name =OldGray/>\n\n\"The simple interpretation is that genetic rescue doesn't work,\" said Dr. Vucetich, an assistant professor of wildlife ecology at Michigan Technological University. \"But what happened here is that when the immigrant came in 1997, in the decade that followed, the moose population declined radically. It's plausible that we didn't see an effect because the wolves were suffering from some other trouble that disguised the benefit. What if wolf No. 93 had never arrived? Dr. Vucetich said that it is impossible to know for sure, but the Isle Royale wolves might have disappeared completely. It may be that the Old Gray Guy arrived just in time.\"<ref name =\"OldGray\">Nicholas Bakalar, New York Times April 4, 2011 https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/science/05wolf.html?_r=1 Wolf Crosses the Lake Superior Ice to Become Leader of the Pack\"</ref>\n\n==Other species==\n[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|A snowshoe hare, one of the other species impacting the wolf and moose on Isle Royale.]]\nOnce a moose is brought down and killed, wolves have to compete with [[scavenger|scavenging]] [[raven]]s. Ravens are tenacious scavengers that can easily dodge the strike of a wolf and are unbothered by them. Ravens can eat and store up to {{convert|2|lb|kg|spell=in}} in a few days, which is minuscule compared to the storage capacity of wolves, which is up to {{convert|18|lb|kg|spell=in}} in just a few hours.<ref name=\"vucetich\"/>\n\nOther anti-social species have an effect, though rather small, on the relationship between wolves and moose on Isle Royale. Before wolves hunted them to [[extinction]], [[coyote]]s used to inhabit the island. Beavers and snowshoe hares also have an effect on both populations, because beavers and snowshoe hares are the only two animals that wolves prey on excluding moose, constituting a tenth of an Isle Royale wolf's diet.<ref name=\"overview\"/> The beaver population has sharply declined since the arrival of wolves, but they still are present, and though they are not a prime food source for typical wolves, they are the second to moose as the most consumed animal by the wolves on the island.<ref name=\"species\">\"Species of Lesser Significance.\" [http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/fauna7/fauna5l.htm ParkNet]. July 4, 2002. National Park Service. May 18, 2006</ref>  Beavers benefit both species. They are as easy prey for wolves and they create aquatic [[macrophyte]]s, very nutritional plants for moose, although the macrophytes are also consumed by the beavers.<ref name=\"mclaren\" /> Though wolves are thought to contribute to the decline in beaver, researchers believe that the decline of aspen, the primary food source of beavers, which used to be plentiful, could have led to their decrease. Beavers have been exposed to predation by having to travel long distances to find only parts of the island where aspen remains.\n\nSnowshoe hares, the third most consumed animal by wolves on Isle Royale constitute a very small portion of the wolves' diet, because snowshoe hares are so difficult to catch. Researchers have found that wolves do not show much interest in preying on hares, and only feed on them incidentally.<ref name=\"species\" />  Snowshoe hares have a negative effect on moose as they eat some of the same vegetation that moose eat, which only contributes to the decline in appropriate forage for moose.<ref name=\"mclaren\" />  The red fox is yet another animal that inhabits Isle Royale; red foxes mainly feed on snowshoe hares and occasionally scavenge on moose, or any other meat a wolf leaves behind. Wolves do not commonly hunt foxes, though wolves have been observed killing foxes when they attempt to feed on an animal carcass.<ref name=\"species\" />\n\n==Studies==\n\nIn 1958, as a graduate student at Purdue University, [[L. David Mech]] began studying the wolves of Isle Royale.<ref name =TheFarReach>''The Far Reach: The lifework of a Minnesota biologist circles the world'' by Greg Breining  Pages 32-41 Minnesota Department of Resources Conservation Volunteer Magazine. January\u2013February 2004</ref>  One of the first publications on the subject of the Wolves on the Island of Isle Royale  was the book \"The Wolves of Isle Royale\" by Mech which led to the prominence of both the author and the topic.  The book was published in 1966 by the Department of the Interior, having evolved from his doctoral thesis.  Mech's project  would become the world's longest-running predator-prey study.<ref name = \"Mihell\">''A Reasonable Illusion'' by Conor Mihell ''Sierra'' magazine November/December 2019 issue Pages 30-35 </ref>\n\n==Climate effects==\n[[Climate]] plays a major role in the moose-wolf relationship as well. Since [[El Ni\u00f1o]] hit in 1998, the climate has warmed up, which has significantly affected the moose population across North America.<ref name=\"predatorsandprey\">\"Predators and prey affected by warming. (Ecology)(decline in numbers of North American moose, increase in number of wolves)(Brief Article).\" USA Today (Magazine) 133.2711 (August 2004): 7(1).</ref>  The warmer climate in recent years has produced more [[Moose winter tick]]s, which consume the blood of animals, making them more susceptible to [[anemia]], and induce the moose to scratch off their hair, exposing them to [[hypothermia]] in cold weather.<ref name=\"predatorsandprey\" />  A moose can have tens of thousands of ticks feeding on its blood at one time, each sucking up to one milliliter of blood. The biting ticks cause a lot of discomfort for the moose, so they try to get the ticks off their bodies by biting off their hair, and rubbing up against trees. This preoccupies moose, and keeps them from browsing for food, which can lead to malnutrition. Compounded with blood loss, moose weakened by ticks are easier for wolves to kill.<ref name=\"goodrich\">Goodrich, Marcia. \"Isle Royale Wolf-Moose Study Report.\" [http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/news/media_relations/211/ Michigan Tech News/Media]. March 4, 2004. Michigan Technological University.

Otherwise, they die out.<ref name=\"roach\">Roach, John. \"Wolves, Ticks, Send Michigan Moose Numbers Plummeting.\" [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0606_050606_wolves.html National Geographic] June 6, 2005. April 5, 2006</ref>  Then, if the summer is hot, ticks are able to reproduce at a higher rate. Hot summers also lead to moose resting in the shade, or in the water to keep cool, making them easier prey for wolves. Also, hot summers lead to tougher foraging for moose which makes them less prepared and more vulnerable to the winter. Not only has the recent warming of Isle Royale hurt the moose, but completely opposite problems harm them also. Harsh winters pose significant problems to moose, because moose have problems finding food when there is too much snow on the ground.<ref name=\"isleroyalestudy\" />  The less snow there is, the more freely moose can move around the island. When there is a significant amount of snow, moose stay in [[conifer]] [[swamp]]s, making them easier prey for wolves, because they are more confined, and immobilized due to the snow.<ref name=\"moosedecline\" />    Deep or heavy snow decreases the speed and agility of moose that is necessary to evade wolf attacks, and calves born during a winter with particularly deep snow are more vulnerable to being weaker prey for wolves later on in their lives because of foraging problems that occur when the snow is deep.<ref name=\"mclaren\" />\nThe keen survival instincts of moose have been clearly evident from the studying of their actions on Isle Royale. Female moose (called \"cows\") have been spotted on nearby smaller islands, around the main island of Isle Royale, because they swim across to give birth. This allows for them to give birth and raise their young without the threat of wolves preying on their young when they are vulnerable. This also causes trouble for moose that are born in the winter, because they can no longer swim across the water to another island, and must raise the new calf in the snow. Once the calves are physically mature, they are able to swim back, and are then able to better protect themselves from wolves, as they are then in their prime years.<ref name=\"weier\" />\n\n==Trends==\nInitially, it was thought that the wolf and moose populations would reach a stable balance,<ref name=IRWO/>. However, during the nearly sixty years of the study, the populations of both species have fluctuated up and down with the number of moose ranging from a high of nearly 2500 down to 500 and the number of wolves ranging from a high of 50<ref name=IRWO/> down to one in 2017/18.\n\nDuring 2016, the wolf population is now nearly extirpated with only two severely inbred wolves present.<ref name=\"detroitnews.com\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Bhanoo|first1=Sindya|title=Only Three Wolves Left on an Island Full of Prey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/science/only-three-wolves-left-on-an-island-full-of-prey.html|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=New York Times|date=27 April 2015}}</ref> The moose population was about 2/3rd of its historical maximum with ample forage and growing rapidly.
