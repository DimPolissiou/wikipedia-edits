Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic United States version of the ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\", because of numerous local [[pretzel]] bakeries. Currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists.

Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, [[Sir William Penn]].\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn (sons of William Penn) mapped out the town of Reading with [[Conrad Weiser]]. Taking its name from [[Reading, Berkshire]], England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western [[Germany]], who bought land from the Penns.

The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation ([[Conrail]]).\n\nThe [[Charles Evans Cemetery]] is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s.

From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\nIn 1972, [[Hurricane Agnes]] caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the [[Schuylkill River]]. A similar, though not as devastating, [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|flood]] occurred during June 2006.\n\nThe 2000 census showed that Reading's population decline had ceased. This was attributed to an influx of [[Hispanic]] residents from [[New York City]], as well as from the extension of [[suburban sprawl]] from [[Philadelphia]]'s northwest suburbs.\n\nReading has its share of obstacles to overcome, namely crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#METRO|title=City Crime Rankings by Population Group|work=morganquitno.com}}</ref> However, new crime fighting strategies appear to have had an impact.

The Reading area is considered a [[humid subtropical climate]], with areas just to the north designated as a [[humid continental climate]]. Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 85&nbsp;\u00b0F. Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 15\u201320 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90&nbsp;\u00b0F. Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs in mid to late October.\n\nWinters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38; the average January low is 22&nbsp;\u00b0F, but it is not unusual for winter temperatures to be much lower or higher than the averages. The all-time record low (not including wind chill) was \u221221&nbsp;\u00b0F during a widespread [[1994 North American cold wave|cold wave in January 1994]]. Snow is common in some winters, but the harsher winter conditions experienced to the north and west are not typical of Greater Reading.

The Astor, Embassy, Loew's Colonial, and Rajah Shrine Theater were grand monuments of architecture and entertainment. Today, after depression, recession, and urban renewal, the Rajah is the only one to remain. The Astor Theater was demolished in 1998 to make way for The [[Sovereign Center]]. Certain steps were taken to retain mementos of the Astor, including its ornate [[Art Deco]] chandelier and gates. These are on display and in use inside the arena corridors, allowing insight into the ambiance of the former movie house. In 2000, the Rajah was purchased from the [[Shriners]]. After a much needed restoration, it was renamed the [[Sovereign Performing Arts Center]].\n\nThe [[Mid-Atlantic Air Museum]] is a membership-supported museum and restoration facility located at [[Carl A.

Beginning in 1990, the museum has hosted \"World War II Weekend Air Show\", scheduled to coincide with [[June 6, 1944|D-Day]]. On display are period wartime aircraft (many of which fly throughout the show) vehicles, and weapons.\n\nThe mechanical ice cream scoop was invented in Reading by William Clewell in 1878.

Locally, it is called the \"[[Pagoda (Reading, Pennsylvania)|Pagoda]]\". It is currently the home of a caf\u00e9 and a gift shop. It remains a popular tourist attraction.\n\nAnother fixture in Reading's skyline is the William Penn Memorial Fire Tower, one mile from the Pagoda on Skyline Drive.

Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic United States version of the ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\", because of numerous local [[pretzel]] bakeries. Currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists.

Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, [[Sir William Penn]].\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn (sons of William Penn) mapped out the town of Reading with [[Conrad Weiser]]. Taking its name from [[Reading, Berkshire]], England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western [[Germany]], who bought land from the Penns.

Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.\n\nCensus data showed that, from 1810 to 1950, Reading was among the nation's top one hundred largest urban places.\n\nThe [[Schuylkill Canal]], a north\u2013south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the [[Schuylkill River]] and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the [[Delaware River]].

Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the [[Long Depression]] following the [[Panic of 1873]], a [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|statewide railroad strike]] in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.<ref>Zinn, Howard.

The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation ([[Conrail]]).\n\nThe [[Charles Evans Cemetery]] is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s.

From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\nIn 1972, [[Hurricane Agnes]] caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the [[Schuylkill River]]. A similar, though not as devastating, [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|flood]] occurred during June 2006.\n\nThe 2000 census showed that Reading's population decline had ceased. This was attributed to an influx of [[Hispanic]] residents from [[New York City]], as well as from the extension of [[suburban sprawl]] from [[Philadelphia]]'s northwest suburbs.\n\nReading has its share of obstacles to overcome, namely crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#METRO|title=City Crime Rankings by Population Group|work=morganquitno.com}}</ref> However, new crime fighting strategies appear to have had an impact.

The average January high is 38; the average January low is 22&nbsp;\u00b0F, but it is not unusual for winter temperatures to be much lower or higher than the averages. The all-time record low (not including wind chill) was \u221221&nbsp;\u00b0F during a widespread [[1994 North American cold wave|cold wave in January 1994]]. Snow is common in some winters, but the harsher winter conditions experienced to the north and west are not typical of Greater Reading. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 32&nbsp;inches. Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s later in Spring. The last killing frost usually is in later April, but freezing temperatures have occurred in May. Total precipitation for the entire year is around 45&nbsp;inches (112&nbsp;cm).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Reading Regional Airport]], Pennsylvania (1981\u20132010 normals,{{efn|Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1981 to 2010.}} extremes 1894\u2013present){{efn|Official precipitation measurements for Reading were taken at an undisclosed location from January 1894 to February 1973, a COOP {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} north-northwest of downtown from March 1973 to January 1999, and Reading Regional since February 1999.<ref>[http://threadex.rcc-acis.org/ ThreadEx]; search for location= \"PA - Reading\", variable= \"Station thread\"</ref>  Temperature, snowfall and snow depth records date to February 1903, 23 November 1897, and 26 September 1908, respectively.<ref name= \"NWS Mount Holly, NJ\"/>}}\n|collapsed =\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 37.7\n|Feb high F = 41.3\n|Mar high F = 50.7\n|Apr high F = 62.4\n|May high F = 72.4\n|Jun high F = 81.2\n|Jul high F = 85.2\n|Aug high F = 83.4\n|Sep high F = 75.7\n|Oct high F = 64.2\n|Nov high F = 53.4\n|Dec high F = 41.7\n|year high F =62.5\n|Jan low F = 21.7\n|Feb low F = 23.2\n|Mar low F = 31.4\n|Apr low F = 40.7\n|May low F = 49.9\n|Jun low F = 59.8\n|Jul low F = 64.3\n|Aug low F = 62.5\n|Sep low F = 55.0\n|Oct low F = 43.2\n|Nov low F = 34.7\n|Dec low F = 26.1\n|year low F =42.8\n|Jan avg record high F =59.1\n|Feb avg record high F =60.6\n|Mar avg record high F =72.9\n|Apr avg record high F =83.6\n|May avg record high F =88.6\n|Jun avg record high F =92.5\n|Jul avg record high F =95.1\n|Aug avg record high F =93.5\n|Sep avg record high F =88.9\n|Oct avg record high F =80.8\n|Nov avg record high F =71.8\n|Dec avg record high F =60.7\n|year avg record high F=96.8\n|Jan avg record low F =  3.5\n|Feb avg record low F =  6.8\n|Mar avg record low F = 14.4\n|Apr avg record low F = 27.1\n|May avg record low F = 36.1\n|Jun avg record low F = 46.2\n|Jul avg record low F = 53.0\n|Aug avg record low F = 50.5\n|Sep avg record low F = 40.2\n|Oct avg record low F = 29.9\n|Nov avg record low F = 21.2\n|Dec avg record low F = 10.6\n|year avg record low F=  0.8\n|Jan record high F =  77\n|Feb record high F =  82\n|Mar record high F =  88\n|Apr record high F =  97\n|May record high F =  96\n|Jun record high F = 102\n|Jul record high F = 107\n|Aug record high F = 105\n|Sep record high F = 102\n|Oct record high F =  94\n|Nov record high F =  84\n|Dec record high F =  77\n\n|Jan record low F = \u221220\n|Feb record low F = \u221211\n|Mar record low F =  \u22122\n|Apr record low F =  16\n|May record low F =  26\n|Jun record low F =  36\n|Jul record low F =  46\n|Aug record low F =  42\n|Sep record low F =  30\n|Oct record low F =  20\n|Nov record low F =   4\n|Dec record low F =  \u22126\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.05\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.48\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.48\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.77\n|May precipitation inch = 4.24\n|Jun precipitation inch = 3.78\n|Jul precipitation inch = 4.52\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.64\n|Sep precipitation inch = 4.34\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.22\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.46\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.29\n|year precipitation inch=43.27\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name= \"NWS Mount Holly, NJ\">{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=phi\n  |title = NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = 2017-09-08\n}}</ref><ref name=\"NOAA-txt-Phily1981\">{{cite web\n|url=ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USW00014712.normals.txt\n|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |title=Station Name: PA READING SPAATZ FLD\n|accessdate=2017-09-08\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Geography==\nReading is located at {{coord|40|20|30|N|75|55|35|W|region:US-PA_type:city}} (40.341692, \u221275.926301)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in southeastern [[Pennsylvania]], roughly {{convert|65|mi|km}} northwest of [[Philadelphia]].

The Astor, Embassy, Loew's Colonial, and Rajah Shrine Theater were grand monuments of architecture and entertainment. Today, after depression, recession, and urban renewal, the Rajah is the only one to remain. The Astor Theater was demolished in 1998 to make way for The [[Sovereign Center]]. Certain steps were taken to retain mementos of the Astor, including its ornate [[Art Deco]] chandelier and gates. These are on display and in use inside the arena corridors, allowing insight into the ambiance of the former movie house. In 2000, the Rajah was purchased from the [[Shriners]]. After a much needed restoration, it was renamed the [[Sovereign Performing Arts Center]].\n\nThe [[Mid-Atlantic Air Museum]] is a membership-supported museum and restoration facility located at [[Carl A.

Beginning in 1990, the museum has hosted \"World War II Weekend Air Show\", scheduled to coincide with [[June 6, 1944|D-Day]]. On display are period wartime aircraft (many of which fly throughout the show) vehicles, and weapons.\n\nThe mechanical ice cream scoop was invented in Reading by William Clewell in 1878.

Locally, it is called the \"[[Pagoda (Reading, Pennsylvania)|Pagoda]]\". It is currently the home of a caf\u00e9 and a gift shop. It remains a popular tourist attraction.\n\nAnother fixture in Reading's skyline is the William Penn Memorial Fire Tower, one mile from the Pagoda on Skyline Drive.
