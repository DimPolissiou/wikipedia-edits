Prabhakar Vardhana was the first king of the Vardhana dynasty with his capital at [[Thanesar|Thaneswar]].\nAfter Prabhakar Vardhana's death in 605, his eldest son, Rajya Vardhana, ascended the throne.

This king, some years later, had been defeated and killed by king Devagupta of Malwa and after his death Rajyashri had been cast into prison by the victor. Harsha's brother, Rajya Vardhana, then the king at [[Thanesar]], could not accept this affront on his family.  So he marched against Devagupta and defeated him.  However, [[Shashanka]], king of Gauda in Eastern [[Bengal]], then entered [[Magadha]] as a friend of Rajyavardhana, but in secret alliance with the [[Malwa]] king. Accordingly, Shashanka treacherously murdered Rajyavardhana.<ref name=\"Sinha1977\">{{cite book |author=Bindeshwari Prasad Sinha |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC&pg=PA151 |year=1977 |publisher=Abhinav |page=151 }}</ref> On hearing about the murder of his brother, Harsha resolved at once to march against the treacherous king of Gauda, but this campaign remained inconclusive and beyond a point he turned back.

He organized an annual assembly of global scholars, and bestowed charitable alms on them. Every five years, he held a great assembly called [[Moksha]].

His and other people's efforts to gain access to schools were denied. Parents on Beacon Hill organized to hold classes for a school at the home of Hall's son, [[Primus Hall]], starting in 1798. Ten years later the school was moved to the African Meeting House. Parents gained partial support from the city in 1812 for the school, but continued to press for a regular public school. In the 1820s the city government provided 2 primary schools for black children.<ref>[http://www.afroammuseum.org/site13.htm ''Abiel Smith School, 46 Joy Street''], Museum of African American History, Boston and Nantucket.

White wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...black separatists sought to control the Boston \"African\" school mastership. This attempt undermined a movement by black and white abolitionists to integrate Boston's schools. From the black community, integrationists John T. Hilton, a barber, and Thomas Dalton, a tailor, with as many as eighty-eight others had petitioned the school committee three times between 1844 and 1846. They earnestly requested that 'exclusive schools be abolished' and that their children be allowed to attend schools in their respective districts. Consistently refused, blacks boycotted in the late 1840s, lowering African school attendance by 65%. In the state legislature, they lobbied a bill outlawing race as a criterion for school admission. By 1848, blacks had engaged Robert Morris, one of the first black lawyers in America, to file suit in the court of common pleas against the city to test the constitutionality of school segregation.<ref>{{cite book|author=White, Arthur T.|title=A Portrait of Charles Sumner \u2014 Advocate for Civil Rights, 1840-1874: Implications for Educational Leadership in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW_SnU2aTUC&pg=PA76|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=25 May 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-92519-3|pages=76}}</ref> Repeated petitions and demands to integrate Boston's schools were resisted by the Boston School Committee for eleven years.

His and other people's efforts to gain access to schools were denied. Parents on Beacon Hill organized to hold classes for a school at the home of Hall's son, [[Primus Hall]], starting in 1798. Ten years later the school was moved to the African Meeting House. Parents gained partial support from the city in 1812 for the school, but continued to press for a regular public school. In the 1820s the city government provided 2 primary schools for black children.<ref>[http://www.afroammuseum.org/site13.htm ''Abiel Smith School, 46 Joy Street''], Museum of African American History, Boston and Nantucket.

Caples and George Washington founded the \"Infant School Association\", which was approved on February 20, 1836 by the governor of Massachusetts.

Children of color were excluded from Boston's high school and Latin school. The efforts to create a separate but equal school system in Boston failed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">White, Arthur T. \"The Black Leadership Class and Education in Antebellum Boston.\" ''The Journal of Negro Education,'' 1973: 9.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1840s, through successful lawsuits, the towns of Nantucket and Salem were forced to integrate their  schools. Dalton led seventy other fellow citizens in a renewed effort to gain access for their children into the white public schools of Boston. Together with [[William Cooper Nell]], and attorney [[Robert Morris (lawyer)|Robert Morris]], they sent petitions imploring the Boston School Committee: \"It is very hard to retain self-respect if we see ourselves set apart and avoided as a degraded race by others. Do not say to our children that however well-behaved their very presence is in a public school, is contamination to your children.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThey said that black schools were not providing the same level of education as the multiple forms of white schools, including \"primary, grammar, Latin and high schools.\"<ref name=\"Moss2010\">{{cite book|author=Hilary J.

White wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...black separatists sought to control the Boston \"African\" school mastership. This attempt undermined a movement by black and white abolitionists to integrate Boston's schools. From the black community, integrationists John T. Hilton, a barber, and Thomas Dalton, a tailor, with as many as eighty-eight others had petitioned the school committee three times between 1844 and 1846. They earnestly requested that 'exclusive schools be abolished' and that their children be allowed to attend schools in their respective districts. Consistently refused, blacks boycotted in the late 1840s, lowering African school attendance by 65%. In the state legislature, they lobbied a bill outlawing race as a criterion for school admission. By 1848, blacks had engaged Robert Morris, one of the first black lawyers in America, to file suit in the court of common pleas against the city to test the constitutionality of school segregation.<ref>{{cite book|author=White, Arthur T.|title=A Portrait of Charles Sumner \u2014 Advocate for Civil Rights, 1840-1874: Implications for Educational Leadership in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW_SnU2aTUC&pg=PA76|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=25 May 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-92519-3|pages=76}}</ref> Repeated petitions and demands to integrate Boston's schools were resisted by the Boston School Committee for eleven years.

The inaugural event was held on July 9, 2011 and was won by [[Kyle Busch]]. From 2012 to 2014, the race was held the week before the [[Coke Zero 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend. From 2015 to 2017, the event moved back two weeks, preceding Daytona and New Hampshire, In 2018, the Quaker State became the 19th race of the season as the [[Overton's 301|New Hampshire 301]] at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]] will become the 20th race of the season. [[Kurt Busch]] is the defending winner.\n\n[[NASCAR on NBC|NBC]] returned to NASCAR broadcasting with the 2015 running of the Quaker State 400 after four years on [[NASCAR on TNT|TNT]].\n\n==History==\nThe event eventuated following a [[Ferko v. National Ass'n for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc.#Related litigation|lawsuit]] in which Kentucky Speedway claimed NASCAR had violated federal antitrust laws in 2005. In 2008, the speedway was sold to [[Bruton Smith]], hoping that the track could hold a race by 2011 and after four years, the former speedway owners abandoned the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=4755641 |title=Former Kentucky Speedway owners abandon NASCAR lawsuit&nbsp;\u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref> In August 2010, NASCAR announced that the track could hold a Cup Series event in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wlwt.com/sports/24575307/detail.html |title=Kentucky Speedway Announces 2011 Sprint Cup Race&nbsp;\u2013 Sports News Story&nbsp;\u2013 WLWT Cincinnati |publisher=Wlwt.com |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=March 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718073259/http://www.wlwt.com/sports/24575307/detail.html |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Seven months later, [[Royal Dutch Shell]]'s Quaker State brand was announced as sponsor and the 267 lap<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentuckyspeedway.com/newsline/news.aspx?newsID=984 |title=News |publisher=Kentucky Speedway |accessdate=March 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713143925/http://www.kentuckyspeedway.com/newsline/news.aspx?newsID=984 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> race held on July 9, was won by [[Kyle Busch]]. The race was plagued by a massive traffic problem where many of the fans who expected to attend the race were turned away after several hours on [[Interstate 71]]. Following the problem, Kentucky Speedway announced that they bought more land for parking and began to work with the state government to improve traffic around the speedway in time for the 2012 race.<ref>Jensen, Tom.

Next, [[Nick Lachey]] performed the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]], and [[Steve Beshear]], Kentucky's Governor, gave the command for drivers to start their engines. Two drivers had to start at the end of the grid because of changes that were not approved during practice; they were Hamlin and [[Dave Blaney]].<ref name=summary /> However, the race was largely overshadowed by [[2011 Quaker State 400#Traffic issues|major traffic issues]] that resulted in as many as 20,000 ticketed fans being unable to enter the track.\n* '''2012:''' The race, the 17th of the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season began at 7:48 EDT. The race was televised live in the United States on TNT. Jimmie Johnson started on pole position. The Kentucky Army National Guard and the Boone County Sheriff's Office presented the flag. The invocation was offered by Pastor John Roberts of Raceway Ministries. Laura Bell Bundy performed the national anthem. The grand marshal was Quaker State Official Steve Reindl. Brad Keselowski stretched his final tank of fuel the final 59 laps to the win. \n* '''2013:''' The race was scheduled to start Saturday at 8:00&nbsp;p.m., but pushed to Sunday afternoon due to rain, at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. E.T., This prompted NASCAR to have a competition caution on Lap 30. The third caution of the race flew on lap 48 for a huge crash in the front straightaway, Brad Keselowski, Greg Biffle, Kurt Busch and others were involved in the incident, it started with Brad Keselowski spinning in the grass, and took out multiple cars, The red flag was displayed with Jimmie Johnson the race leader, it was lifted after 5 minutes and 3 seconds. Jimmie Johnson dominated the race, leading a race-high 182 laps, but spun on a late restart after pitting. Matt Kenseth stayed out on strategy, and became the third different winner.\n* '''2014:''' The race served as the last year on TNT, before the acquisition of the $10.1 billion deal for NBC Sports, Prior to the start of the race, there was a downpour that soaked the track. This prompted NASCAR to schedule a competition caution at lap 30. Logano led the field to the restart on lap 85, before Keselowski was able to retake the lead two laps later. Another lengthy green-flag run ensued, before debris forced the third caution of the race, on lap 125. Prior to the caution, Matt Kenseth suffered a flat right-front tire, and had to pit from sixth position. Logano retook the lead during the pit cycle, while Jeff Gordon suffered a slow pit stop due to a malfunctioning air hose; he lost a total of 16 positions, dropping from 7th to 23rd. Logano and Keselowski swapped the lead positions once again, prior to the fourth caution, on lap 153, for a multi-car wreck on the backstretch involving Aric Almirola, Alex Bowman, Kasey Kahne and Jamie McMurray. Bowman locked up his brakes and tires, causing a large cloud of smoke that made it difficult for trailing cars to see what was in front of them. When the smoke cleared, Almirola swerved to his right to avoid Bowman, but in the process got into the left side of McMurray's car. After leading 199 laps from the Pole, Keselowski became the first repeat winner of the event.\n* '''2015:''' NBC returned with the fifth running of the Quaker State 400, aired live on NBCSN, The race had a new track record of eleven caution flag periods for 49 laps, [[Carl Edwards]] went three wide underneath his teammate to take the lead with 54 laps to go. He got loose in turn 1 and Hamlin took back the lead with 53 laps to go. After Busch got around Logano with 20 laps to go, he drove off to become the second repeat winner at the track.\n* '''2016:''' Kentucky Speedway underwent a reconfiguration and repave back in the Spring. The race aired on NBCSN for a second year, A multi-car wreck on the backstretch brought out the seventh caution of the race on lap 94. Exiting turn 2, [[Brian Scott]] got loose, saved the car, got turned by [[Kyle Larson]] and got t-boned by [[Chris Buescher]]. [[A. J. Allmendinger]], Buescher, [[Ty Dillon]], Larson, [[Danica Patrick]], [[Regan Smith]], Scott and [[Cole Whitt]] were all collected in the melee.,<ref>{{cite news|last=Goheen|first=Kevin|title=Brad Keselowski wins his third Quaker State 400 at Kentucky Speedway|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/motors/auto-racing/kentucky-speedway/2016/07/09/brad-keselowski-wins-his-third-quaker-state-400-kentucky-speedway/86908958/|accessdate=July 10, 2016|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=July 10, 2016|location=[[Sparta, Kentucky]]}}</ref> In the final 10 laps, a number of cars began pitting so to have enough fuel to make the finish. Kenseth briefly took the lead from Keselowski before he pitted with four laps to go and handed the lead back to Keselowski. Keselowski decreased his speed dramatically to conserve fuel. This allowed [[Carl Edwards]] to pull to within a car-length with one lap remaining. He blocked Edwards's advance as he re-fired his engine and drove on to score the victory.<ref>{{cite news|last=Graves|first=Gary|title=Keselowski wins for 3rd time at Kentucky Speedway|url=http://racing.ap.org/article/keselowski-wins-3rd-time-kentucky-speedway|accessdate=July 10, 2016|work=Associated Press|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=AP Sports|date=July 10, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710183250/http://racing.ap.org/article/keselowski-wins-3rd-time-kentucky-speedway|archivedate=July 10, 2016|location=[[Sparta, Kentucky]]}}</ref>\n*'''2017:''' [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] dominated the seventh running of the event leading 152 laps. He won both stages 1 and 2 (NASCAR's new race format that saw stage lengths of 80 laps, 80 laps, and the final 107) and had a 15-second lead with two laps to go until the caution came out setting up an overtime finish for the first time in the event's history. Truex Jr. stayed out while everyone else pitted, but he chose the preferred outside lane for the restart. He took off from the start passing Kyle Busch and the race ended under caution due to a crash on the frontstretch after Truex Jr. had just taken the white flag. He took the yellow and checkered-flags ahead of Kyle Larson for his third win of the season. He became just the fourth driver to win at Kentucky, and the first new winner since [[Matt Kenseth]] in 2013.\n*'''2018:''' Martin Truex Jr. did a repeat of his 2017 performance by winning both stages, dominating the race, and ultimately winning the race. It was the last win for Furniture Row Racing after they shut down at the end of the season.\n*'''2019:''' The Busch brothers would dominate the event with eldest brother [[Kurt Busch]] winning stage 1, and [[Kyle Busch]] winning stage 2. Late in the race [[Joey Logano]] passed Busch and looked as if he was on his way to an easy win until the caution came out, forcing the race to go into overtime. Kurt restarted in fourth on four tires, and passed leader Logano and his younger brother on the outside. On the final lap, the brothers stayed side-by-side, and in a photo finish Kurt edged Kyle by 0.076-seconds.

The inaugural event was held on July 9, 2011 and was won by [[Kyle Busch]]. From 2012 to 2014, the race was held the week before the [[Coke Zero 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend. From 2015 to 2017, the event moved back two weeks, preceding Daytona and New Hampshire, In 2018, the Quaker State became the 19th race of the season as the [[Overton's 301|New Hampshire 301]] at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]] will become the 20th race of the season. [[Kurt Busch]] is the defending winner.\n\n[[NASCAR on NBC|NBC]] returned to NASCAR broadcasting with the 2015 running of the Quaker State 400 after four years on [[NASCAR on TNT|TNT]].\n\n==History==\nThe event eventuated following a [[Ferko v. National Ass'n for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc.#Related litigation|lawsuit]] in which Kentucky Speedway claimed NASCAR had violated federal antitrust laws in 2005. In 2008, the speedway was sold to [[Bruton Smith]], hoping that the track could hold a race by 2011 and after four years, the former speedway owners abandoned the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=4755641 |title=Former Kentucky Speedway owners abandon NASCAR lawsuit&nbsp;\u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref> In August 2010, NASCAR announced that the track could hold a Cup Series event in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wlwt.com/sports/24575307/detail.html |title=Kentucky Speedway Announces 2011 Sprint Cup Race&nbsp;\u2013 Sports News Story&nbsp;\u2013 WLWT Cincinnati |publisher=Wlwt.com |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=March 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718073259/http://www.wlwt.com/sports/24575307/detail.html |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Seven months later, [[Royal Dutch Shell]]'s Quaker State brand was announced as sponsor and the 267 lap<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentuckyspeedway.com/newsline/news.aspx?newsID=984 |title=News |publisher=Kentucky Speedway |accessdate=March 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713143925/http://www.kentuckyspeedway.com/newsline/news.aspx?newsID=984 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> race held on July 9, was won by [[Kyle Busch]]. The race was plagued by a massive traffic problem where many of the fans who expected to attend the race were turned away after several hours on [[Interstate 71]].

Next, [[Nick Lachey]] performed the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]], and [[Steve Beshear]], Kentucky's Governor, gave the command for drivers to start their engines. Two drivers had to start at the end of the grid because of changes that were not approved during practice; they were Hamlin and [[Dave Blaney]].<ref name=summary /> However, the race was largely overshadowed by [[2011 Quaker State 400#Traffic issues|major traffic issues]] that resulted in as many as 20,000 ticketed fans being unable to enter the track.\n* '''2012:''' The race, the 17th of the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season began at 7:48 EDT. The race was televised live in the United States on TNT. Jimmie Johnson started on pole position. The Kentucky Army National Guard and the Boone County Sheriff's Office presented the flag. The invocation was offered by Pastor John Roberts of Raceway Ministries. Laura Bell Bundy performed the national anthem. The grand marshal was Quaker State Official Steve Reindl. Brad Keselowski stretched his final tank of fuel the final 59 laps to the win. \n* '''2013:''' The race was scheduled to start Saturday at 8:00&nbsp;p.m., but pushed to Sunday afternoon due to rain, at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. E.T., This prompted NASCAR to have a competition caution on Lap 30. The third caution of the race flew on lap 48 for a huge crash in the front straightaway, Brad Keselowski, Greg Biffle, Kurt Busch and others were involved in the incident, it started with Brad Keselowski spinning in the grass, and took out multiple cars, The red flag was displayed with Jimmie Johnson the race leader, it was lifted after 5 minutes and 3 seconds. Jimmie Johnson dominated the race, leading a race-high 182 laps, but spun on a late restart after pitting. Matt Kenseth stayed out on strategy, and became the third different winner.\n* '''2014:''' The race served as the last year on TNT, before the acquisition of the $10.1 billion deal for NBC Sports, Prior to the start of the race, there was a downpour that soaked the track. This prompted NASCAR to schedule a competition caution at lap 30. Logano led the field to the restart on lap 85, before Keselowski was able to retake the lead two laps later. Another lengthy green-flag run ensued, before debris forced the third caution of the race, on lap 125. Prior to the caution, Matt Kenseth suffered a flat right-front tire, and had to pit from sixth position. Logano retook the lead during the pit cycle, while Jeff Gordon suffered a slow pit stop due to a malfunctioning air hose; he lost a total of 16 positions, dropping from 7th to 23rd. Logano and Keselowski swapped the lead positions once again, prior to the fourth caution, on lap 153, for a multi-car wreck on the backstretch involving Aric Almirola, Alex Bowman, Kasey Kahne and Jamie McMurray. Bowman locked up his brakes and tires, causing a large cloud of smoke that made it difficult for trailing cars to see what was in front of them. When the smoke cleared, Almirola swerved to his right to avoid Bowman, but in the process got into the left side of McMurray's car. After leading 199 laps from the Pole, Keselowski became the first repeat winner of the event.\n* '''2015:''' NBC returned with the fifth running of the Quaker State 400, aired live on NBCSN, The race had a new track record of eleven caution flag periods for 49 laps, [[Carl Edwards]] went three wide underneath his teammate to take the lead with 54 laps to go. He got loose in turn 1 and Hamlin took back the lead with 53 laps to go. After Busch got around Logano with 20 laps to go, he drove off to become the second repeat winner at the track.\n* '''2016:''' Kentucky Speedway underwent a reconfiguration and repave back in the Spring. The race aired on NBCSN for a second year, A multi-car wreck on the backstretch brought out the seventh caution of the race on lap 94. Exiting turn 2, [[Brian Scott]] got loose, saved the car, got turned by [[Kyle Larson]] and got t-boned by [[Chris Buescher]]. [[A. J. Allmendinger]], Buescher, [[Ty Dillon]], Larson, [[Danica Patrick]], [[Regan Smith]], Scott and [[Cole Whitt]] were all collected in the melee.,<ref>{{cite news|last=Goheen|first=Kevin|title=Brad Keselowski wins his third Quaker State 400 at Kentucky Speedway|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/motors/auto-racing/kentucky-speedway/2016/07/09/brad-keselowski-wins-his-third-quaker-state-400-kentucky-speedway/86908958/|accessdate=July 10, 2016|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=July 10, 2016|location=[[Sparta, Kentucky]]}}</ref> In the final 10 laps, a number of cars began pitting so to have enough fuel to make the finish. Kenseth briefly took the lead from Keselowski before he pitted with four laps to go and handed the lead back to Keselowski. Keselowski decreased his speed dramatically to conserve fuel. This allowed [[Carl Edwards]] to pull to within a car-length with one lap remaining. He blocked Edwards's advance as he re-fired his engine and drove on to score the victory.<ref>{{cite news|last=Graves|first=Gary|title=Keselowski wins for 3rd time at Kentucky Speedway|url=http://racing.ap.org/article/keselowski-wins-3rd-time-kentucky-speedway|accessdate=July 10, 2016|work=Associated Press|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=AP Sports|date=July 10, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710183250/http://racing.ap.org/article/keselowski-wins-3rd-time-kentucky-speedway|archivedate=July 10, 2016|location=[[Sparta, Kentucky]]}}</ref>\n*'''2017:''' [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] dominated the seventh running of the event leading 152 laps. He won both stages 1 and 2 (NASCAR's new race format that saw stage lengths of 80 laps, 80 laps, and the final 107) and had a 15-second lead with two laps to go until the caution came out setting up an overtime finish for the first time in the event's history. Truex Jr. stayed out while everyone else pitted, but he chose the preferred outside lane for the restart. He took off from the start passing Kyle Busch and the race ended under caution due to a crash on the frontstretch after Truex Jr. had just taken the white flag. He took the yellow and checkered-flags ahead of Kyle Larson for his third win of the season. He became just the fourth driver to win at Kentucky, and the first new winner since [[Matt Kenseth]] in 2013.\n*'''2018:''' Martin Truex Jr. did a repeat of his 2017 performance by winning both stages, dominating the race, and ultimately winning the race. It was the last win for Furniture Row Racing after they shut down at the end of the season.\n*'''2019:''' The Busch brothers would dominate the event with eldest brother [[Kurt Busch]] winning stage 1, and [[Kyle Busch]] winning stage 2. Late in the race [[Joey Logano]] passed Busch and looked as if he was on his way to an easy win until the caution came out, forcing the race to go into overtime. Kurt restarted in fourth on four tires, and passed leader Logano and his younger brother on the outside. On the final lap, the brothers stayed side-by-side, and in a photo finish Kurt edged Kyle by 0.076-seconds.
