Once a significant [[cotton]]-producing community along the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]], the town has now shifted its economy to one supported primarily by [[tourism]]. Gruene, (pronounced \"Green\") is now a district within the city limits of [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]], and much of it was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 21, 1975. It is part of the [[Greater San Antonio|San Antonio-New Braunfels Metropolitan Area]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and rise to prominence===\nGerman farmers arriving in the mid 1840s became the first European settlers of what is now known as Gruene, Texas. Ernst Gruene, one such German immigrant, arrived in New Braunfels in 1845, but acreage was scarce there. With his two sons he then purchased land along the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]], and he built the first home in Gruene in early ''[[Timber framing#German tradition (Fachwerkh\u00e4user)|Fachwerk]]'', German timber framing house style.<ref name=gruenetexasAbout>{{cite web |title=The History of Gruene Historic District |url=http://gruenetexas.com/about.php |publisher=Gruene Historic District.}}</ref>\n\nErnst Gruene's second son, Heinrich (Henry) D. Gruene, built his own house ([[Gruene Family Home]]) and planted [[cotton]]. As cotton was a top crop it lured up to 30 families to Henry D.'s lands. In addition to his Victorian-style home (now Gruene Mansion Inn), Henry D. was responsible for several buildings in various styles, many still standing: a Victorian cottage, a large brick home, and, for his farm foreman, a frame house (now Gruene Haus).<ref name=gruenetexasAbout/> In 1878, Gruene opened a mercantile store to serve the several dozen or so families [[sharecropper|sharecropping]] on his land. Originally known as \"Goodwin\", the town benefited by its location along the [[stagecoach]] route between [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], the store thrived for many years and stimulated local commercial growth. A cotton gin (now Gristmill River Restaurant and Bar) powered by the Guadalupe River was added soon after.<ref name=gruenetexasAbout/> [[Gruene Hall]], which opened in 1878, is one of the oldest dance halls in Texas. The Thorn Hill School and three large cotton gins soon followed. By the time the [[International-Great Northern Railroad]] was built across Comal County in the 1880s, the small community was bustling with commercial and farming activity, and officially took the name \"Gruene\" after its founding father and most prominent citizen.\n\n===Decline and abandonment===\nBy 1900, Gruene was a prominent banking, ginning, and shipping center for area cotton farming. Though it never had a post office of its own, the community did possess two freight rail stations by the 1910s. In 1922, the original cotton gin burned and was replaced by a modern electric model down the road (now Adobe Verde). Gruene was decimated, however, by the [[boll weevil]] blight of the 1920s, and further doomed by the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. By 1930, the population had fallen to 75, and post-[[World War II]] highway construction bypassed the town. By 1950, Gruene had become a [[ghost town]].\n\n===Revival and renaissance===\nIn 1974, Chip Kaufman, a [[University of Texas at Austin|UT Austin]] architecture student, began working to get Gruene on the National Register of Historic Places and sought new owners for properties in the historic district.<ref name=gruenetexasAbout/>\n\nAmong the new owners was Pat Molak, who purchased Gruene Hall in 1975. Molak and his friend Mary Jane Nalley purchased and repaired several of the town's notable structures and transformed them into thriving businesses.<ref name=gruenetexasAbout/> Mary Jane Nalley was later given the Besserung Award by the New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce.<ref name=radionbMaryJaneBesserung>{{cite web|title=Nalley Wins Chamber's Citizen of the Year Award |url=http://innewbraunfels.com/chamber/2015/02/02/nalley-wins-chambers-citizen-year-award/|author=New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce website}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the restoration of area structures, such as Gruene Hall and the old mercantile store, Gruene began a rebirth of sorts in the early 1970s. Redevelopment and restoration of the area continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s and today, and though no longer an autonomous community (it was annexed by New Braunfels in 1979<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/gruene-peace/ |title=Gruene Peace |work=Texas Monthly |last=Reid |first=Jan |date=November 1996 |access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref>), Gruene maintains a thriving tourist business.

Once a significant [[cotton]]-producing community along the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]], the town has now shifted its economy to one supported primarily by [[tourism]]. Gruene, (pronounced \"Green\") is now a district within the city limits of [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]], and much of it was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 21, 1975. It is part of the [[Greater San Antonio|San Antonio-New Braunfels Metropolitan Area]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and rise to prominence===\nGerman farmers arriving in the mid 1840s became the first European settlers of what is now known as Gruene, Texas. Ernst Gruene, one such German immigrant, arrived in New Braunfels in 1845, but acreage was scarce there. With his two sons he then purchased land along the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]], and he built the first home in Gruene in early ''[[Timber framing#German tradition (Fachwerkh\u00e4user)|Fachwerk]]'', German timber framing house style.<ref name=gruenetexasAbout>{{cite web |title=The History of Gruene Historic District |url=http://gruenetexas.com/about.php |publisher=Gruene Historic District.}}</ref>\n\nErnst Gruene's second son, Heinrich (Henry) D. Gruene, built his own house ([[Gruene Family Home]]) and planted [[cotton]]. As cotton was a top crop it lured up to 30 families to Henry D.'s lands. In addtion to his Victorian-style home (now Gruene Mansion Inn), Henry D. was responsible for several buildings in various styles, many still standing: a Victorian cottage, a large brick home, and, for his farm foreman, a frame house (now Gruene Haus).<ref name=gruenetexasAbout/> In 1878, Gruene opened a mercantile store to serve the several dozen or so families [[sharecropper|sharecropping]] on his land. Originally known as \"Goodwin\", the town benefited by its location along the [[stagecoach]] route between [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], the store thrived for many years and stimulated local commercial growth. A cotton gin (now Gristmill River Restaurant and Bar) powered by the Guadalupe River was added soon after.<ref name=gruenetexasAbout/> [[Gruene Hall]], which opened in 1878, is one of the oldest dance halls in Texas. The Thorn Hill School and three large cotton gins soon followed. By the time the [[International-Great Northern Railroad]] was built across Comal County in the 1880s, the small community was bustling with commercial and farming activity, and officially took the name \"Gruene\" after its founding father and most prominent citizen.\n\n===Decline and abandonment===\nBy 1900, Gruene was a prominent banking, ginning, and shipping center for area cotton farming. Though it never had a post office of its own, the community did possess two freight rail stations by the 1910s. In 1922, the original cotton gin burned and was replaced by a modern electric model down the road (now Adobe Verde). Gruene was decimated, however, by the [[boll weevil]] blight of the 1920s, and further doomed by the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. By 1930, the population had fallen to 75, and post-[[World War II]] highway construction bypassed the town. By 1950, Gruene had become a [[ghost town]].\n\n===Revival and renaissance===\nIn 1974, Chip Kaufman, a [[University of Texas at Austin|UT Austin]] architecture student, began working to get Gruene on the National Register of Historic Places and sought new owners for properties in the historic district.<ref name=gruenetexasAbout/>\n\nAmong the new owners was Pat Molak, who purchased Gruene Hall in 1975. Molak and his friend Mary Jane Nalley purchased and repaired several of the town's notable structures and transformed them into thriving businesses.<ref name=gruenetexasAbout/> Mary Jane Nalley was later given the Besserung Award by the New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce.<ref name=radionbMaryJaneBesserung>{{cite web|title=Nalley Wins Chamber's Citizen of the Year Award |url=http://innewbraunfels.com/chamber/2015/02/02/nalley-wins-chambers-citizen-year-award/|author=New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce website}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the restoration of area structures, such as Gruene Hall and the old mercantile store, Gruene began a rebirth of sorts in the early 1970s. Redevelopment and restoration of the area continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s and today, and though no longer an autonomous community (it was annexed by New Braunfels in 1979<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/gruene-peace/ |title=Gruene Peace |work=Texas Monthly |last=Reid |first=Jan |date=November 1996 |access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref>), Gruene maintains a thriving tourist business. Many original structures from the town's heyday still exist, including the [[Gruene Family Home]], a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style edifice built in 1872 which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and today operates as the Gruene Mansion Inn.

He was  well known for being an innovator of the church bus ministry that brought thousands of people each week from surrounding towns to Hammond for services.<ref name=\"Janega\">Janega, James Rev. \"Jack Hyles; Led bus ministry\", ''Chicago Tribune'', February 9, 2001.</ref> Hyles built First Baptist up from fewer than a thousand members to a membership of 100,000.

Hyles often described his less-than-ideal upbringing which, he said, included a distant father. At the age of eighteen, Hyles enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and served as a [[paratrooper]] with the [[82nd Airborne Division]] during [[World War II]]. He and his wife, Beverly, were married during the war.\n\nAfter the war was over, Hyles completed his college education at [[East Texas Baptist University]] (then College) in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], the seat of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]]. After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, [[Bogata, Texas]]; Grange Hall Baptist Church, [[Marshall, Texas]]; and Southside Baptist Church, [[Henderson, Texas]]. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members.<ref name=\"Janega\" /> It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.<ref name=\"Janega\" /><ref name=\"BJH\">Falsani, Cathleen. \"Brother Jack Hyles of Hammond dies at 74\" ''Chicago Sun Times'', February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\n===The move to Hammond, Indiana===\nIn 1959, Hyles moved to the church provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood avenue, [[Munster, Indiana]], and became the pastor of [[First Baptist Church of Hammond]]. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, said to be mostly \"high-society types.\"  About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles' preaching style, which was much different than that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church\u2014freeing it from its ties with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]]s. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.<ref name=\"Chalfant\" /><ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nBeginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, [[Elmer Towns]] wrote a book called ''The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow'' which analyzed First Baptist's Sunday School.<ref name=\"FBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbchammond.com/the_voice/01%20decembervoice2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=First Baptist Church...

As early as 1975, ''Time'' magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, \"Superchurch.\"  The ''Time'' article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913788,00.html Superchurch]'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]] December 1, 1975 (retrieved June 4, 2006).</ref>  In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday.<ref name=\"Time\" />  In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nHyles spoke at '[[The Sword of the Lord]]' conferences with [[John R. Rice]] and his own annual \"Pastors School\". The school continues to attract as many as seven thousand annual visitors to the Hammond area.<ref>{{cite web | last = Zabroski | first = Steve | year = 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414133420/http://nwitimes.com/articles/1997/10/04/export247369.txt|archivedate=April 14, 2009|url = http://nwitimes.com/articles/2006/03/24/news/lake_county/2970eb71e3fc94308625713b0014b869.txt | title = Faithful flock to Hammond | work = [[Northwest Indiana Times]] | accessdate = March 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles wrote approximately fifty works in his lifetime with over 14 million total copies in circulation, including the popular ''Is There A Hell?'', based on a sermon he preached at a National Sword of the Lord Conference.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  Another work, ''Enemies of Soul Winning'' tackled many issues considered controversial in fundamentalist and evangelical circles, which include the doctrine of repentance, [[Lordship salvation]], and the role of the church in soul winning. The ''Calvary Contender'' wrote, \"Hyles will be remembered as a one-of-a-kind, ever controversial leader whose ministry touched the lives of multitudes.\"<ref>{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | title = Jack Hyles Succumbs To Heart Attack | work = [[Calvary Contender]] | accessdate = May 1, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060512171223/http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | archivedate = May 12, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles was better known as \"Brother Hyles\" to his tens of thousands of congregants.<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles often held nationwide speaking engagements. In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]], Texas, the seat of [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]], hosted by pastor Luther Wallace \"Buck\" Hatfield (1929\u20131995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder. Hatfield and Spencer also adapted the bus ministry approach for their congregations.\n\nIn his book, ''Enemies of Soulwinning'', Hyles taught that one could not be born again unless the [[King James Version]] was used somewhere along the line in that person's life.<ref>''Enemies of Soulwinning'' by Jack Hyles, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> He did not teach [[Landmarkism]]/[[Baptist successionism]] (the belief that the Baptist church is the original church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at [[Pentecost]]), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in AD 313.<ref name=\"landmark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Printed%20Books/Dr%20Jack%20Hyles/The%20Church/fundamental_baptist_church-chap_23.htm|title=What Is a Fundamental Baptist Church?}}</ref>\n\n=== Honors, award, and praise ===\nHyles attracted praise, an honorary doctorate, and other accolades throughout the course of his life; he also was the subject of frequent criticism. The ''Washington Post'' compared the \"meek\" preaching style of [[Jerry Falwell]] to the \"spit and fire\" of Hyles. The Post suggested that after you heard a preacher like Hyles, \"you knew that you'd been preached to\".<ref>Harrington, Walt. \"What Hath Falwell Wrought?\" ''Washington Post'', July 24, 1988, p.

After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, [[Bogata, Texas]]; Grange Hall Baptist Church, [[Marshall, Texas]]; and Southside Baptist Church, [[Henderson, Texas]]. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members.<ref name=\"Janega\" /> It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.<ref name=\"Janega\" /><ref name=\"BJH\">Falsani, Cathleen. \"Brother Jack Hyles of Hammond dies at 74\" ''Chicago Sun Times'', February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\n===The move to Hammond, Indiana===\nIn 1959, Hyles moved to the church provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood avenue, [[Munster, Indiana]], and became the pastor of [[First Baptist Church of Hammond]]. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, said to be mostly \"high-society types.\"  About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles' preaching style, which was much different than that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church\u2014freeing it from its ties with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]]s. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.<ref name=\"Chalfant\" /><ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nBeginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, [[Elmer Towns]] wrote a book called ''The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow'' which analyzed First Baptist's Sunday School.<ref name=\"FBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbchammond.com/the_voice/01%20decembervoice2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=First Baptist Church...

As early as 1975, ''Time'' magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, \"Superchurch.\"  The ''Time'' article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913788,00.html Superchurch]'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]] December 1, 1975 (retrieved June 4, 2006).</ref>  In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday.<ref name=\"Time\" />  In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nHyles spoke at '[[The Sword of the Lord]]' conferences with [[John R.

In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]], Texas, the seat of [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]], hosted by pastor Luther Wallace \"Buck\" Hatfield (1929\u20131995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder. Hatfield and Spencer also adapted the bus ministry approach for their congregations.\n\nIn his book, ''Enemies of Soulwinning'', Hyles taught that one could not be born again unless the [[King James Version]] was used somewhere along the line in that person's life.<ref>''Enemies of Soulwinning'' by Jack Hyles, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> He did not teach [[Landmarkism]]/[[Baptist successionism]] (the belief that the Baptist church is the original church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at [[Pentecost]]), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in AD 313.<ref name=\"landmark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Printed%20Books/Dr%20Jack%20Hyles/The%20Church/fundamental_baptist_church-chap_23.htm|title=What Is a Fundamental Baptist Church?}}</ref>\n\n=== Honors, award, and praise ===\nHyles attracted praise, an honorary doctorate, and other accolades throughout the course of his life; he also was the subject of frequent criticism. The ''Washington Post'' compared the \"meek\" preaching style of [[Jerry Falwell]] to the \"spit and fire\" of Hyles. The Post suggested that after you heard a preacher like Hyles, \"you knew that you'd been preached to\".<ref>Harrington, Walt. \"What Hath Falwell Wrought?\" ''Washington Post'', July 24, 1988, p. W19.</ref> Falwell said that \"Hyles will be remembered as a leader in evangelism through the local church.\"  Falwell also said, \"He inspired me as a young pastor to win others to Christ through Sunday school, the pulpit, and personal witnessing. He made a great contribution to the cause of Christ\".<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Midwestern Baptist College]], an unaccredited Bible college in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].<ref>As discussed along with his misuse of the title on [[Preying from the Pulpit]] in May 1993 by [[WJBK]] of [[Detroit]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Chicago Sun Times'' wrote about Hyles on the occasion of his death, \"When he chose the interests of poor, inner-city kids over millionaire church members, they said he'd never keep the doors of his church open.\" However, Hyles \"proved them all wrong. In the process he built one of the largest congregations in the country, a college, six schools, and a vibrant ministry that will now have to survive without him.\"<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\n[[Matthew Barnett]], while discussing his work at an inner-city Los Angeles ministry, explained how he learned from Hyles.

The city's administration is run by the [[Seremban Municipal Council|Seremban City Council]]. On 9 September 2009, Seremban was to be declared as a city, but it was later deferred due to technical reasons. However, the idea of granting city status has been brought up again and Seremban is expected to become a city in 2020. Seremban officially gained city status on 20 January 2020.<ref name=\"BeritaHarian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/wilayah/2020/01/648530/seremban-diisytiharkan-bandar-raya|author=Azzman Abdul Jamal|title=Seremban diisytiharkan bandar raya|trans-title=Seremban declared as a city|website=[[Berita Harian]]|language=ms|date=20 January 2020|accessdate=5 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Toponymy ==\nSeremban was founded as '''Sungei Ujong''' (or '''Sungai Ujong'''), named after a nearby river of the same name. While the town was renamed Seremban thereafter, the Sungai Ujong name most prominently persists as a street name for a road adjoining the southern side of town (Sungai Ujong Road, or ''Jalan Sungai Ujong'').\n\nThe town is also referred alternately as \"Fu Rong\" in Mandarin or \"Fu Yong\" in Cantonese ({{zh|t=\u8299\u84c9}}\uff0cliterally \"hibiscus\") among the [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese-speaking community]].\n\n== History ==\nSungai Ujong came into existence with the discovery of [[tin ore]] in the 1870s like most major towns in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The discovery of tin in a nearby area called [[Rasah]], saw an influx of [[Arab]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and Chinese immigrants to work on the mines and trade there. Most of the local Malays were farmers.\n\nRenamed to Seremban, the town flourished not only as a mining area but also a business centre. The [[Linggi River]] served as the sole outlet to ferry [[tin]] and supplies in and out of the town. Revenue came not only from tin trade but also from the large amount of taxes collected, much to the displeasure of the traders and the [[British colonial]]ists at the neighbouring port of [[Malacca]].\n\nThe local chieftains, namely the Dato' Kelana and the Dato' Shahbandar of Sungai Ujong were at odds with each other on the rights to collect taxes and ownership and control of the mines. The rivalry to assert influence and authority opened the door for British intervention in Negeri Sembilan. The British sided with the Dato' Kelana upon invitation and defeated the forces of the Dato' Bandar who was later sent into exile to Singapore. In a show of gratitude to the British for helping him win the war, the Dato' Kelana had no choice but to accept a British Resident whose job was to advise him on matters other than religion and [[Malay customs]].\n\n[[Captain Murray]] was appointed the first resident and later set-up his residence at Channer Road, now renamed Jalan Dato' Siamang Gagap. Soon after, the people living around Rasah moved to Channer Road for the sake of security and its orderly administration.<ref name=\"Administration in Seremban\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mpsns.gov.my/mps_v2/BI/profile_history.htm |title=Administration in Seremban |author= |work=[[Majlis Perbandaran Seremban]] |accessdate=14 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080108022157/http://www.mpsns.gov.my/mps_v2/BI/profile_history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 8 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===City status===\nSeremban is one of four state capitals that has not achieved city status (Bandar raya); the other three being [[Kota Bharu]] ([[Kelantan]]), [[Kuantan]] ([[Pahang]]) and [[Kangar]] ([[Perlis]]).

It is located in the Linggi River valley, at the foothills of the Titiwangsa Range. The terrain is generally hilly, and the soil is mostly reddish [[laterite]] soil, suitable for the cultivation of rubber and [[palm oil]], thus making Seremban the agricultural centre for the state. Since the establishment of Seremban, the Linggi River has played an important role in the development of the town. During the boom period of [[tin]] mining, the Linggi River served as the major transportation route for tin traders. Today, it is one of the major sources of water for Seremban and Negeri Sembilan.\n\n===Weather===\nThe climate of Seremban, like most parts of [[West Malaysia]], is generally hot and humid (tropical) with a mean temperature of about 26\u201330&nbsp;degrees Celsius. Most of the rainfall is experienced during the inter-[[monsoon]] periods of April and October. The weather remains generally dry for the rest of the year with occasional showers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Main|Transportation in Seremban}}\n[[Image:Bandar Seremban.jpg|thumb|left|Major Intersection of Seremban]]\n\n===Public transportation===\nThe rail connection was first constructed in the late 1890s as a stop on the [[Kuala Lumpur]]\u2013Singapore main line, and until today, the [[Seremban railway station]] (code: <span style=\"background-color:blue\"><span style=\"color:white;\">'''&nbsp;KB13'''&nbsp;</span></span>) still serves as one of the major stops along the line.

The city's administration is run by the [[Seremban Municipal Council|Seremban City Council]]. On 9 September 2009, Seremban was to be declared as a city, but it was later deferred due to technical reasons. However, the idea of granting city status has been brought up again and Seremban is expected to become a city in 2020. Seremban officially gained city status on 20 January 2020.<ref name=\"BeritaHarian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/wilayah/2020/01/648530/seremban-diisytiharkan-bandar-raya|author=Azzman Abdul Jamal|title=Seremban diisytiharkan bandar raya|trans-title=Seremban declared as a city|website=[[Berita Harian]]|language=ms|date=20 January 2020|accessdate=5 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Toponymy ==\nSeremban was founded as '''Sungei Ujong''' (or '''Sungai Ujong'''), named after a nearby river of the same name. While the town was renamed Seremban thereafter, the Sungai Ujong name most prominently persists as a street name for a road adjoining the southern side of town (Sungai Ujong Road, or ''Jalan Sungai Ujong'').\n\nThe town is also referred alternately as \"Fu Rong\" in Mandarin or \"Fu Yong\" in Cantonese ({{zh|t=\u8299\u84c9}}\uff0cliterally \"hibiscus\") among the [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese-speaking community]].\n\n== History ==\nSungai Ujong came into existence with the discovery of [[tin ore]] in the 1870s like most major towns in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The discovery of tin in a nearby area called [[Rasah]], saw an influx of [[Arab]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and Chinese immigrants to work on the mines and trade there. Most of the local Malays were farmers.\n\nRenamed to Seremban, the town flourished not only as a mining area but also a business centre. The [[Linggi River]] served as the sole outlet to ferry [[tin]] and supplies in and out of the town. Revenue came not only from tin trade but also from the large amount of taxes collected, much to the displeasure of the traders and the [[British colonial]]ists at the neighbouring port of [[Malacca]].\n\nThe local chieftains, namely the Dato' Kelana and the Dato' Shahbandar of Sungai Ujong were at odds with each other on the rights to collect taxes and ownership and control of the mines. The rivalry to assert influence and authority opened the door for British intervention in Negeri Sembilan. The British sided with the Dato' Kelana upon invitation and defeated the forces of the Dato' Bandar who was later sent into exile to Singapore. In a show of gratitude to the British for helping him win the war, the Dato' Kelana had no choice but to accept a British Resident whose job was to advise him on matters other than religion and [[Malay customs]].\n\n[[Captain Murray]] was appointed the first resident and later set-up his residence at Channer Road, now renamed Jalan Dato' Siamang Gagap. Soon after, the people living around Rasah moved to Channer Road for the sake of security and its orderly administration.<ref name=\"Administration in Seremban\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mpsns.gov.my/mps_v2/BI/profile_history.htm |title=Administration in Seremban |author= |work=[[Majlis Perbandaran Seremban]] |accessdate=14 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080108022157/http://www.mpsns.gov.my/mps_v2/BI/profile_history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 8 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===City status===\nSeremban is one of four state capitals that has not achieved city status (Bandar raya); the other three being [[Kota Bharu]] ([[Kelantan]]), [[Kuantan]] ([[Pahang]]) and [[Kangar]] ([[Perlis]]).

It is located in the Linggi River valley, at the foothills of the Titiwangsa Range. The terrain is generally hilly, and the soil is mostly reddish [[laterite]] soil, suitable for the cultivation of rubber and [[palm oil]], thus making Seremban the agricultural centre for the state. Since the establishment of Seremban, the Linggi River has played an important role in the development of the town. During the boom period of [[tin]] mining, the Linggi River served as the major transportation route for tin traders. Today, it is one of the major sources of water for Seremban and Negeri Sembilan.\n\n===Weather===\nThe climate of Seremban, like most parts of [[West Malaysia]], is generally hot and humid (tropical) with a mean temperature of about 26\u201330&nbsp;degrees Celsius. Most of the rainfall is experienced during the inter-[[monsoon]] periods of April and October. The weather remains generally dry for the rest of the year with occasional showers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Main|Transportation in Seremban}}\n[[Image:Bandar Seremban.jpg|thumb|left|Major Intersection of Seremban]]\n\n===Public transportation===\nThe rail connection was first constructed in the late 1890s as a stop on the [[Kuala Lumpur]]\u2013Singapore main line, and until today, the [[Seremban railway station]] (code: <span style=\"background-color:blue\"><span style=\"color:white;\">'''&nbsp;KB13'''&nbsp;</span></span>) still serves as one of the major stops along the line. The station also serves as the southern terminal of the [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] electrified commuter network, [[KTM Komuter]], which links the town to [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the Klang Valley on [[Seremban Line]].<ref name=\"Commuter service in Seremban\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1633 |title=Commuter service in Seremban |author= |work=[[Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad]] |accessdate=14 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003756/http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1633 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 11 October 2007}}</ref> Since October 2015, the Komuter service has been extended to [[Gemas railway station|Gemas]], though passengers are required to alight at Seremban and switch trains to the Gemas extension line (much akin to the [[Tanjung Malim]]\u2013Rawang stretch).\n\nNegeri Sembilan is one of the two states in Malaysia that are not accessible via air transportation ([[Perlis]] being the other state). However the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA) is less than a 30&nbsp;minutes drive from Seremban, essentially making the airport closer to Seremban rather than Kuala Lumpur.\n\n===Car===\n[[Malaysia Federal Route 1|Federal Route]] {{JKR|1}}, the oldest major roadway that connects the major towns and cities of the West Coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] runs through Seremban. It connects Seremban with neighbouring towns such as [[Rembau District|Rembau]] and [[Tampin]] to the south and [[Kajang]], Selangor to the north. Seremban also provides access to the towns of [[Kuala Klawang]] (through [[Malaysia Federal Route 86|highway]] {{JKR|86}}), [[Kuala Pilah]] to the east (through [[Malaysia Federal Route 51|highway]] {{JKR|51}}) and the well-known coastal town of [[Port Dickson]] (through [[Malaysia Federal Route 53|highway]] {{JKR|53}} or [[Seremban\u2013Port Dickson Highway|SPDH]] {{MES-E|29}}) to the west.\n\nFor a faster alternative, the [[North\u2013South Expressway Southern Route|North\u2013South Expressway]] {{MES-E|2}} serves Seremban through exit 218.
