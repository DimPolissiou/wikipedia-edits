The film takes place in the future in [[Scotland]], which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in [[London]], political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair ([[Rhona Mitra]]) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. ''Doomsday'' was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including ''[[Mad Max]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]''.\n\nMarshall had a budget three times the size of his previous two films, ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'', and the director filmed the larger-scale ''Doomsday'' in Scotland and [[South Africa]]. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 14 March 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008. ''Doomsday'' did not perform well at the box office, and critics gave the film mixed reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2008, an unknown killer virus, known as the \"Reaper Virus\", has infected the country of [[Scotland]]. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of [[Great Britain]]. Whilst the quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. Now a [[pariah state]], the UK collapses into a [[dystopia]], rife with unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil.\n\n27 years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper Virus during a routine investigation. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] John Hatcher shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair, to lead the team. Sinclair is originally from Scotland, having escaped as the quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.\n\nSinclair's team crosses the wall to [[Glasgow]], Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals, led by the power-hungry Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army [[Invasion|to start their invasion of England]], which will bring Great Britain into the [[Golden Age]]. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of the gang, who burn Dr. Talbot alive before devouring his body. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's second-in-command. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol abolishes [[martial law]] by creating his own army.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reaper Virus turns everyone present into primal savages, destroying everything in sight in an ongoing riot. Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection when an infected man breaks into Hatcher\u2019s office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the infected man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Hatcher is quarantined by his right hand man, Michael Canaris,  who also takes his place as ''de facto'' prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide, unable to take much more of his successor's scam.\n\nAfter leaving the train, Sinclair's group are arrested by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the rest of the group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.\n\nSinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact [[Bentley Continental GT|2007 Bentley Continental GT]], which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper once and for all. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.\n\nUsing a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris then tricks Sinclair into trading Cally (whose blood can be used to create a vaccine to treat the virus), revealing his scheme to use the virus all over the UK as both a form of population control and for profit.\n\nCally and Stirling board the gunship with Canaris while Sinclair returns to her old house in search of her mother, followed by Nelson, who flew into the quarantine zone to speak with his top-ranking officer. While Sinclair confirms that her mother has perished due to the virus, she is able to retrieve a picture of her. Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of Canaris's [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] scheme. The recording is later broadcasted to the rest of the country, much to Canaris's shock as it spells doom to his career. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang; she throws the head onto the ground, announcing to the marauders, \u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, try a piece of your friend\u201d. The marauders stand in shock for a moment before bursting into cheering, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rhona Mitra (Straighten Colors).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A seated woman with brown hair extending below her shoulders and wearing a blue shirt smiles as she looks to her right.|Actress Rhona Mitra starred in ''Doomsday'' as Major Eden Sinclair.]]\n\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Major Eden Sinclair of the Department of Domestic Security, selected to lead a team to find a cure.<ref name=mitra/> The heroine was inspired by the character [[Snake Plissken]].<ref name=hot>{{cite news | first=Justine | last=Elias | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/30/2007-09-30_hot_heroines_in_apocalyptic_flicks-1.html | title=Hot heroines in apocalyptic flicks | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date=30 September 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007}}</ref> Mitra worked out and fight trained for eleven weeks for the film.

The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: \"I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets\u2014clearly from the future\u2014facing a medieval knight on horseback.\" The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.<ref name=cfq>{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Biodrowski| url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday| title=Interview: Neil Marshall Directs \"Doomsday\"| publisher=Cinefantastique.com|accessdate=15 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe lethal virus in ''Doomsday'' differs from contemporary films like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' by being an authentic plague that actually devastates the population, instead of infecting people so they become aggressive cannibals or zombies. Marshall intended the virus as the backdrop to the story, having survivors scavenge for themselves and set up a primitive society. The director drew from tribal history around the world to design the society. Though the survivors are depicted as brutal, Marshall sought to have \"shades of gray\" by characterising some people in England as selfishly manipulative.<ref name=cfq/>\n\nThe director intended ''Doomsday'' as a tribute to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, \"Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. I wanted to make a movie for a new generation of audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema\u2014hadn't seen them at all maybe\u2014and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them.

While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved [[Matte painting|matte paint]] and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in ''Doomsday'' was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news | first=Thomas J. | last=McLean | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3578 | title=''Doomsday'': A VFX Cure for the Reaper Virus | publisher=VFXWorld.com | date=14 March 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNeil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects. A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions. A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics. Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the \"rabbit explosion\" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors. The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasise its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\n=== Music ===\nMarshall originally intended to include 1980s [[synthesizer|synth]] music in his film, but he found it difficult to combine the music with the intense action. Instead, composer [[Tyler Bates]] composed a score using heavy orchestra music.<ref name=sayer/> The film also included songs from the bands [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Fine Young Cannibals]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], and [[Kasabian]].<ref name=credits/> The song \"[[Two Tribes]]\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was the only song to remain in the film from the first draft of the screenplay. \"[[Spellbound (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Spellbound]]\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees was a favourite song of the director, who sought to include it. Marshall also hoped to include the song \"Into the Light\" by the Banshees, but it was left out due to the producer disliking it and the cost being too high to licence it.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tim| last=Masters| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7390688.stm| title= Talking Shop: Neil Marshall| publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=9 May 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nFor its theatrical run, the film was originally intended to be distributed by [[Focus Features]] under [[Rogue Pictures]], but the company transferred ''Doomsday'' among other films to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] for larger-scale distribution and marketing beginning in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dade | last=Hayes | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974078.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Rogue marketing moves to Universal | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=15 October 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007 }}</ref> ''Doomsday'' was commercially released on 14 March 2008 in the United States and Canada in 1,936 theatres, grossing US$4,926,565 in its opening weekend and ranking seventh in the box office,<ref name=bom>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> which ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' reported as a \"failed\" opening.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brandon | last=Gray | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2465&p=.htm | title='Horton' Hits It Big | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | date=17 March 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> Its theatrical run in the United States and Canada lasted 28 days, ending on 10 April 2008, having grossed US$11,008,770.<ref name=bom/> The film opened in the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[Malta]] on 9 May 2008, grossing a total of US$2,027,749 in its entire run.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) - International Box Office Results | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=13 October 2008 }}</ref> The film's performance in the UK was considered a \"disappointing run\".<ref name=tanks>{{cite news | first=Orlando | last=Parfitt | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/speed_racer/news/1728059/uk_box_office_breakdown_speed_racer_tanks | title=UK Box Office Breakdown: Speed Racer Tanks | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=14 May 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> The film premiered in Italy in August 2008, grossing an overall US$500,000.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Frank |last=Segers |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |title='Knight' tops overseas with $19 mil |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082644/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |archivedate=13 September 2008 }}</ref> Worldwide, ''Doomsday'' has grossed US$22,211,426.<ref name=bom/>\n\n{{Anchor|Reception|Critical reception|Critics}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"The director of top horror flicks ''The Descent'' and ''Dog Soldiers'' was given more money for his latest effort, but many thought he wasted it on a collection of flashy set pieces without much interlinking plot in between.\"\n | source = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] on UK's general consensus<ref name=tanks/>\n | width = 300px\n | align = right\n}}\n''Doomsday'' was not screened for critics in advance of its commercial opening in cinemas.<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Ratliff | title=Latest virus film put in quarantine | work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] | date=14 March 2008 }}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics.

The film takes place in the future in [[Scotland]], which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in [[London]], political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair ([[Rhona Mitra]]) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. ''Doomsday'' was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including ''[[Mad Max]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]''.\n\nMarshall had a budget three times the size of his previous two films, ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'', and the director filmed the larger-scale ''Doomsday'' in Scotland and [[South Africa]]. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 14 March 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008. ''Doomsday'' did not perform well at the box office, and critics gave the film mixed reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2008, an unknown killer virus, known as the \"Reaper Virus\", has infected the country of [[Scotland]]. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of [[Great Britain]]. Whilst the quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. Now a [[pariah state]], the UK collapses into a [[dystopia]], rife with unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil.\n\n27 years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper Virus during a routine investigation. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] John Hatcher shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair is originally from Scotland, having escaped as the quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.\n\nSinclair's team crosses the wall to [[Glasgow]], Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|to start their invasion of England]], which will bring Great Britain into the [[Golden Age]]. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of the gang, who burn Dr. Talbot alive before devouring his body. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's second-in-command. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol abolishes [[martial law]] by creating his own army.\n\nMeanwhile, Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection. Later, an infected man breaks into Hatcher\u2019s office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the infected man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Hatcher is quarantined by his right hand man, Michael Canaris,  who also takes his place as ''de facto'' prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide.\n\nAfter leaving the train, Sinclair's group are arrested by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the rest of the group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.\n\nSinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact [[Bentley Continental GT|2007 Bentley Continental GT]], which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper's death. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.\n\nUsing a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris reveals he will let the virus continue to spread in London, as a both a form of population control and for profit, despite the revelation that Cally's blood can be used to create a vaccine to treat the virus. Cally and Stirling board the gunship, while Sinclair chooses to stay behind. Nelson flies into the quarantine zone to speak with Sinclair, who has returned to her old house in search of her mother; while there is no sign of Sinclair's mother who has presumably perished, she is able to retrieve a picture of her. Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of her conversation with Canaris. The recording is later broadcast to the rest of the country, much to Canaris's shock as it spells doom to his career. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang. She throws the head onto the ground, shouting to the marauders \u201cif you\u2019re hungry, try a piece of your friend\u201d. The marauders are silent for a moment before  cheering, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rhona Mitra (Straighten Colors).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A seated woman with brown hair extending below her shoulders and wearing a blue shirt smiles as she looks to her right.|Actress Rhona Mitra starred in ''Doomsday'' as Major Eden Sinclair.]]\n\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Major Eden Sinclair of the Department of Domestic Security, selected to lead a team to find a cure.<ref name=mitra/> The heroine was inspired by the character [[Snake Plissken]].<ref name=hot>{{cite news | first=Justine | last=Elias | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/30/2007-09-30_hot_heroines_in_apocalyptic_flicks-1.html | title=Hot heroines in apocalyptic flicks | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date=30 September 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007}}</ref> Mitra worked out and fight trained for eleven weeks for the film.

The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: \"I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets\u2014clearly from the future\u2014facing a medieval knight on horseback.\" The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.<ref name=cfq>{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Biodrowski| url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday| title=Interview: Neil Marshall Directs \"Doomsday\"| publisher=Cinefantastique.com|accessdate=15 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe lethal virus in ''Doomsday'' differs from contemporary films like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' by being an authentic plague that actually devastates the population, instead of infecting people so they become aggressive cannibals or zombies. Marshall intended the virus as the backdrop to the story, having survivors scavenge for themselves and set up a primitive society. The director drew from tribal history around the world to design the society. Though the survivors are depicted as brutal, Marshall sought to have \"shades of gray\" by characterising some people in England as selfishly manipulative.<ref name=cfq/>\n\nThe director intended ''Doomsday'' as a tribute to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, \"Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. I wanted to make a movie for a new generation of audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema\u2014hadn't seen them at all maybe\u2014and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them.

While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved [[Matte painting|matte paint]] and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in ''Doomsday'' was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news | first=Thomas J. | last=McLean | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3578 | title=''Doomsday'': A VFX Cure for the Reaper Virus | publisher=VFXWorld.com | date=14 March 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNeil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects. A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions. A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics. Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the \"rabbit explosion\" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors. The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasise its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\n=== Music ===\nMarshall originally intended to include 1980s [[synthesizer|synth]] music in his film, but he found it difficult to combine the music with the intense action.

He worked in early film on the East Coast, and eventually in Hollywood with companies such as [[Universal Film Manufacturing Company]], [[Victor Film Company]], [[Triangle Film Corporation]], and also with [[Christie Film Company]]. In 1911, he starred in [[Klaw & Erlanger]]'s \"[[The Pink Lady (musical)|The Pink Lady]],\" a musical comedy by Ivan Caryll and C.M.S. McLellan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Variety|last=|first=|date=January 21, 1911|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1916 and 1917 he worked for [[Mack Sennett]], often being cast for supporting roles that required impersonation of female characters. He later joined Universal where he continued [[cross-dressing]] to a degree.<ref name=\"Ginibre1\">{{cite book |last1=Ginibre |first1=Jean-Louis |title=Ladies Or Gentlemen: A Pictorial History of Male Cross-dressing in the Movies |date=2005 |publisher=Filipacchi |isbn=9781933231044 |page=69 |edition=1st |language=en |chapter=When Drag was Queen}}</ref>\n\nHe had an extensive filmography, and was not only a featured comedic player with Triangle, Christie, Universal, Warner Brothers, but continued acting in small parts through the 1940s, even as Catterson - The Chemist in [[Leave Her to Heaven]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037865/fullcredits|title=IMDB Leave Her To Heaven}}</ref> He continued to work as a character actor in many films through the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nAt some point in the 1920s, he suffered partial facial paralysis, and was not able to continue acting.

In 1904, it launched an American subsidiary, '''Path\u00e9 Company''', based in [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\nIn 1909, Path\u00e9 was asked to join the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] (MPPC). As a result, Path\u00e9 utilized MPPC's [[General Film Company]] distribution company to distribute its films.\n\nBeginning in 1914, the [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]]' film production studios in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] produced the successful serialized episodes, [[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|''The Perils of Pauline'']]. Path\u00e9 stopped all production in the US by 1914 and in 1915 re-incorporated Path\u00e9 Company to '''Path\u00e9 Exchange'''.\n\nPath\u00e9 Exchange was spun off from its French parent company in 1921, with a controlling stake held by [[Merrill Lynch]]. [[Charles Path\u00e9]] stayed on as a director of the American firm.<ref>[[Mira Wilkins]], ''The History of Foreign Investment in the United States, 1914\u20131945'', p. 89</ref>\n\nBy 1923, after coming under the control of Merrill Lynch, Path\u00e9 Exchange was once again re-incorporated to '''American Path\u00e9'''.\n\nFor many years, Path\u00e9 was closely associated with the distribution company [[Associated Exhibitors]] which handled [[independent film|independent]] productions. In late 1926 the struggling Associated Exhibitors was subsumed into Path\u00e9, as part of a trend of mergers in the American film industry. In March 1927, American Path\u00e9 was acquired by [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], and in 1928 merged with the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] theaters, along with [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s independent [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] to create what would eventually come to be known as [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. In that interim period, production of short subjects credited to American Path\u00e9 increased to about 150 in five years, under the nameplates \"Manhattan Comedies\", \"Campus Comedies\", \"Melody Comedies\", \"Checker Comedies\", \"Folly Comedies\", \"Rainbow Comedies\", \"Rodeo Comedies\", and \"Capitol Comedies\", featuring players such as [[Franklin Pangborn]], [[Thelma White]], [[John W. Bubbles|Buck and Bubbles]], and [[Alan Hale, Sr.|Alan Hale]].\n\nAmong American Path\u00e9's independent productions are the very influential documentary feature ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' in 1922, and a large number of [[film serial]]s.\n\nBy 1932, the company switched to producing newsreels & documentaries only.\n\nIn 1941, the company acquired [[Producers Releasing Corporation]]. However, they were sold off in a merger in 1947 with [[Eagle-Lion Films]]. Also in 1947, the newsreel operations were sold by RKO to [[Warner Bros.]]<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| title = WARNER BROTHERS BUYS PATHE NEWS; Transfer of the RKO Newsreel Takes Place Next

In 1904, it launched an American subsidiary, '''Path\u00e9 Company''', based in [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\nIn 1909, Path\u00e9 was asked to join the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] (MPPC). As a result, Path\u00e9 utilized MPPC's [[General Film Company]] distribution company to distribute its films. \n\nBeginning in 1914, the [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]]' film production studios in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] produced the successful serialized episodes, [[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|''The Perils of Pauline'']]. Path\u00e9 stopped all production in the US by 1914 and in 1915 re-incorporated Path\u00e9 Company to '''Path\u00e9 Exchange'''.\n\nPath\u00e9 Exchange was spun off from its French parent company in 1921, with a controlling stake held by [[Merrill Lynch]]. [[Charles Path\u00e9]] stayed on as a director of the American firm.<ref>[[Mira Wilkins]], ''The History of Foreign Investment in the United States, 1914\u20131945'', p. 89</ref>\n\nBy 1923, after coming under the control of Merrill Lynch, Path\u00e9 Exchange was once again re-incorporated to '''American Path\u00e9'''.\n\nFor many years, Path\u00e9 was closely associated with the distribution company [[Associated Exhibitors]] which handled [[independent film|independent]] productions. In late 1926 the struggling Associated Exhibitors was subsumed into Path\u00e9, as part of a trend of mergers in the American film industry. In March 1927, American Path\u00e9 was acquired by [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], and in 1928 merged with the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] theaters, along with [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s independent [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] to create what would eventually come to be known as [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. In that interim period, production of short subjects credited to American Path\u00e9 increased to about 150 in five years, under the nameplates \"Manhattan Comedies\", \"Campus Comedies\", \"Melody Comedies\", \"Checker Comedies\", \"Folly Comedies\", \"Rainbow Comedies\", \"Rodeo Comedies\", and \"Capitol Comedies\", featuring players such as [[Franklin Pangborn]], [[Thelma White]], [[John W. Bubbles|Buck and Bubbles]], and [[Alan Hale, Sr.|Alan Hale]].\n\nAmong American Path\u00e9's independent productions are the very influential documentary feature ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' in 1922, and a large number of [[film serial]]s.\n\nBy 1932, the company switched to producing newsreels & documentaries only.\n\nIn 1941, the company acquired [[Producers Releasing Corporation]]. However, they were sold off in a merger in 1947 with [[Eagle-Lion Films]]. Also in 1947, the newsreel operations were sold by RKO to [[Warner Bros.]]<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| title = WARNER BROTHERS BUYS PATHE NEWS; Transfer of the RKO Newsreel Takes Place Next

{"title_page": "Business marketing", "text_new": "{{expert needed|Business|reason=The article is confusing and appears to contradict itself|talk=yes|date=September 2013}}\n{{Marketing}}\n'''Business marketing''' is a [[marketing]] practice of individuals or organizations (including commercial businesses, governments and institutions). It allows them to [[sales|sell]] products or services to other companies or organizations that [[resell]] them, use them in their products or services or use them to support their works. It is a way to promote business and improve profit too.\n\nBusiness marketing is also known as [[industrial marketing]] or [[business-to-business]] (B2B) marketing. Business-to-government marketing, while still classified within the B2B discipline due to the sharing of dynamics, does differ slightly.\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe practice of a [[purveyor]] of [[goods]] [[trading]] with another may be as old as [[commerce]] itself. In relation to marketing today, its history is more recent. Michael Morris, Leyland Pitt, and Earl Dwight Honeycutt say that for several years business marketing took \"a back seat\" to [[consumer marketing]].<ref>Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt, pg. xix</ref> This entailed providers of goods or services selling directly to households through [[mass media]] and retail channels. David Lichtenthal (professor of marketing at [[Zicklin School of Business]]) notes in his research that business marketing has existed since the mid-19th century. He adds that the bulk of research on business marketing has come in the last 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chauhan|first1=Gyan|last2=Anbalagan|first2=C|title=Strategy and Trends in B2B Business: Opportunities and Challenges - A Global Prospective|url=http://www.ifsmrc.org/sites/default/files/journals/pdf/6.%20AIJRM%202305JJ14%20Mani%20paper%20for%20AIJRM%20issue%203.pdf|website=International Faculty and Student Multi-Research Consortium|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThis began to change in the middle to late 1970s.

According to Jeremy Kourdi, more than half of marketing majors start their careers in business marketing rather than consumer marketing.<ref>{{cite book|title=More Great Ideas A Day: 365 more business ideas for each day of the year|date=2013|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2013|isbn=978-9814484664|page=266|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SSJAAAAQBAJ&dq=marketing+majors+begin+their+careers+in+business+marketing+today+than+in+consumer+marketing.&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=6 August 2015|chapter=Business-To-Business Marketing}}</ref>\n\n== Business and consumer markets ==\n\nBusiness markets have derived demand \u2013 a demand in them exists because of demand in the [[consumer market]]. An example would be a government wishing to purchase equipment for a [[nuclear power plant]]. The underlying consumer demand that has triggered this is that people are [[electricity consumption|consuming more electricity]] (by using more [[home appliance|household device]]s such as washing machines and computers). Business markets do not exist in isolation.\n\nA single consumer market demand can give rise to hundreds of business market demands. The [[car industry|demand for cars]] creates demands for castings, forgings, plastic components, steel and tires. In turn, this creates demands for casting sand, forging machines, mining materials, polymers, rubber. Each of these growing demands has triggered more demands.\n\nAs the spending power of citizens increases, countries generally see an upward wave in their economy. Cities or countries with growing consumption are generally growing business markets.\n\n== Vs. consumer marketing ==\n\nDespite the differences between business and consumer marketing from a surface perspective being seemingly obvious, there are more subtle distinctions between the two with substantial ramifications. Dwyer and Tanner note that business marketing generally entails shorter and more direct channels of distribution.\n\nWhile consumer marketing is aimed at large groups through [[mass media]] and [[retailer]]s, the negotiation process between the buyer and seller is more personal in business marketing. According to Hutt and Speh (2004), most business marketers commit only a small part of their promotional budgets to advertising, and that is usually through [[Direct marketing|direct mail]] efforts and trade journals. While advertising is limited, it often helps the business marketer set up successful sales calls.\n\nMarketing to a business is trying to make a profit (business-to-business marketing) as opposed to an individual for personal use ([[Business-to-consumer|Business-to-Consumer]], or B2C marketing) is similar in terms of the fundamental principles of marketing. In [[B2C]], [[business-to-business|B2B]] and [[government marketing|B2G]] marketing situations, the marketer must always:\n\n* successfully match the product or service strengths with the needs of a definable target market;\n* position and price to align the product or service with its market, often an intricate balance; and\n* communicate and sell it in the fashion that demonstrates its value effectively to the target market.\n\nThese are the fundamental principles of the 4 Ps of marketing (the [[marketing mix]]) first documented by [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] in 1960.<ref>McCarthy, Jerome E.: \"Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach\". Homewood, IL: Irwin, 1996</ref>\n\nWhile \"other businesses\" might seem like the simple answer, Dwyer and Tanner say business customers fall into four broad categories: companies that consume products or services, government agencies, institutions and resellers.\n\nThe first category includes [[original equipment manufacturers]], such as large auto-makers who buy [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]] to put in their cars and also small firms owned by 1-2 individuals who purchase products to run their business. The second category - government agencies, is the biggest. In fact, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] is the biggest single purchaser of products and services in the country, spending more than $300 billion annually. But this category also includes state and [[local government]]s. The third category, institutions, includes schools, hospitals and [[nursing home]]s, churches and charities. Finally, resellers consist of wholesalers, brokers and industrial distributors.\n\nSo what are the meaningful differences between B2B and B2C marketing?\n* A notable characteristic of B2B marketing is that it is rarely 'product first' or 'service first'. Marketing messages lead with significant context that acknowledges the customer's need or problem first and then establishes the relevance of the vendor's product or service to the customer's situation.   In B2C marketing, the product or service features and benefits are called out up front. The customer is expected to already know why they need the product or service.\n* The buyer or customer is often a group or committee or department comprising several individuals who have specific roles in evaluating the proposed product or service.  In B2C, the buyer is mostly an individual who needs the product or service for his or her own use. Offerings are evaluated mainly on price, reviews and word of mouth, although these are factors in B2B marketing as well\n\nA B2C sale is to a \"Consumer\" i.e. to a single person who pays for the transaction. A B2B sale is to a \"Business\" i.e. organization or firm. Given the complexity of [[organizational structure]], B2B sales typically involve multiple decision makers.\n\nWhile the structure of a B2B sale involving an organization is understood, the psychology of a B2B sale, particularly from a marketing perspective, is not always devoid of human emotion. According to Bill Blaney (2012), a B2C and a B2B sale can be differentiated by the customer as either a \"want\" or a \"need.\" While retail consumer sales rarely hinge upon a product or service that customers \"need\" in order to survive (pharmaceutical and other health industry products notwithstanding), business sales are more directly applied to the growth and survival of that particular company, organization or institution. As a result, marketing to businesses relies on communication that can provide the company buyer with a level of comfort in the long-term performance of their product or service, and support in its continued efficacy.\n\nThe marketing mix is affected by the B2B uniqueness which include complexity of business products and services, diversity of demand and the differing nature of the sales itself (including fewer customers buying larger volumes).<ref>Kotler & Pfoertsch: \"B2B Brand Management\", page 21. Springer Berlin, 2006</ref> Because there are some important subtleties to the B2B sale, the issues are broken down beyond just the original 4 Ps of marketing developed by McCarthy.\n\n== Strategies ==\n\n===B2B branding===\nB2B branding is different from B2C in some crucial ways, including the need to align corporate brands, divisional brands and product/service brands and to apply brand standards to material often considered \u201cinformal\u201d such as email and other electronic correspondence. It is mainly of large scale when compared with B2C.\n\n=== Product (or service) ===\nDue to the fact that business customers are focused on creating [[shareholder value]] for themselves, the cost-saving or revenue-producing benefits of products and services are important to factor in throughout the [[New product development|product development]] and marketing cycles.\n\n=== Target market ===\n[[File:B2B buyer decision map.jpg|thumbnail|right|B2B Buyer Decision Map: Problem, solution alternatives, decision support]]Quite often, the [[target market]] for a business product or service is smaller and has more specialized needs reflective of a specific industry or niche.<ref>Malaval: \"Strategy and Management of Industrial Brands: Business to Business Products and Services\", page 16. 2001</ref> A B2B niche, a segment of the market, can be described in terms of [[firmographics]] which requires marketers to have good business intelligence in order to increase response rates.  Regardless of the size of the target market, the business customer is making an organizational purchase decision and the dynamics of this, both procedurally and in terms of how they value the product offered, differ dramatically from the consumer market. There may be multiple [[influencer marketing|influencers]] on the purchase decision, which may also have to be marketed to, though they may not be members of the [[decision making unit]].<ref>Brown, Duncan and Hayes, Nick. Influencer Marketing: Who really influences your customers?, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008</ref>  In addition the research and decision making process a B2B buyer undertakes will be more extensive.<ref>Glynn. Business-to-business Brand Management, Emerald Group Publishing, 2009</ref>  Finally the purchase information that buyers are researching changes as they go through the buying process (see sample decision map).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brainrider.com/better-content-blog/b2b-buyer-decision-map/| title=B2B Buyer Decision Map: Understanding Decision Stages - Brainrider | work=Brainrider | accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Pricing ===\nThe business market can be convinced to pay premium prices more often than the consumer market with appropriate pricing structure and payment terms. This pricing premium is particularly achievable if it is supported with a strong brand.<ref>Kotler & Pfoertsch: \"B2B Brand Management\", page 53. Springer Berlin, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Promotion ===\n[[marketing promotion|Promotion]] planning is relatively easy when the decision making habits of the [[customer base]] and the vocabulary unique to their segment are known. Specific [[Trade fair|trade shows]], analysts, publications, blogs and retail/wholesale outlets tend to be fairly common to each industry/product area. Once it is figured out for the industry/product, writing the promotion plan is simple. Promotion techniques rely heavily on [[marketing communications]] strategies (see below).<ref>{{cite web|title=BANT - Budget Authority Need Timeline - A lead scoring methodology developed by IBM|url=https://bant.io/how|publisher=Bant.io|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Sales and distribution ===\nThe importance of a knowledgeable, experienced and effective direct (inside or outside) [[sales]] force is often critical in the business market. When selling through [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]] also, the number and type of sales forces can vary tremendously and success as a marketer is highly dependent on their success.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of the B2B sales cycle is its comparably longer lead times compared to B2C.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.leadagency.com.au/marketing-consultant-melbourne/expertise/ | title=B2B Marketing Expertise - Strategy and campaigns}}</ref> The result of this longer lead cycle affects the entire B2B marketing process.\n\n=== Communications methodologies ===\n\nThe purpose of B2B marketing communications is to support the organizations' sales effort and improve company profitability. B2B marketing communications tactics generally include advertising, [[public relations]], direct mail, trade show support, sales collateral, branding, and interactive services such as [[Web design|website design]] and [[search engine optimization]]. The Business Marketing Association<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.marketing.org/ | title=ANA Business Marketing &#124; ANA}}</ref> is the [[Industry trade group|trade organization]] that serves B2B marketing professionals. It was founded in 1922 and offers [[Professional certification|certification programs]], research services, conferences, industry awards and training programs.\n\n==== Positioning statement ====\nAn important first step in business to business marketing is the development of a positioning statement. This is a statement of what is done and how it will be better and more efficient than competitors.\n\n==== Developing messages ====\nThe next step is to develop messages.  There is usually a primary message that conveys more strongly to customers, what is done and how the customers benefit from it. This is often supported by a number of secondary messages, each of which may have a number of supporting arguments, facts and figures.\n\n==== Campaign plans ====\nA comprehensive plan to target resources where they will deliver the best [[return on investment]]. The infrastructure to support each stage of the marketing process has to be in place and the entire organization must be geared up to handle the inquiries appropriately.\n\n==== Briefing an agency ====\nA standard briefing document is usually a good idea for briefing an agency, as well as focusing the agency on what is important in the campaign.

Technology is changing at an unprecedented pace, and these changes are speeding up the pace of new product and service development. A large part of that has to do with the Internet, which is discussed in more detail below. Technology and [[Strategic management|business strategy]] go hand in hand. Both are correlated.  While technology supports forming organization strategy, the business strategy is also helpful in [[Research and development|technology development]]. Both play a role in business marketing.\n#Entrepreneurial revolution. To stay competitive, many companies have downsized and reinvented themselves. Adaptability, flexibility, speed, aggressiveness and innovativeness are the keys to remaining competitive today. Marketing is taking the entrepreneurial lead by finding [[market segment]]s, untapped needs and new uses for existing products, and by creating new processes for sales, distribution and customer service.\n#(Occurring within marketing itself) Companies are looking beyond traditional assumptions and they are adopting new frameworks, theories, models and concepts. They are also moving away from the mass market and the preoccupation with the transaction. Relationships, partnerships and alliances are what define marketing today. The [[Cookie cutter|cookie-cutter]] approach is out. Companies are customizing marketing programs to individual accounts.\n\n== Impact of the Internet ==\n\nThe Internet has become an integral component of the [[customer relationship management]] strategy for business marketers. Dwyer and Tanner (2006) note that business marketers not only use the Internet to improve [[customer service]] but also to gain opportunities with distributors.\n\nAccording to Anderson and Narus (2004), two new types of resellers have emerged as by-products of the Internet: infomediaries and metamediaries. Infomediaries, such as [[Google]] and [[Yahoo]], are [[search engine]] companies that also function as brokers, or middlemen, in the business marketing world. They charge companies fees to find information on the Web as well as for banner and [[pop-up ad]]s and search engine optimization services. Metamediaries are companies with robust Internet sites that furnish customers with multiproduct, multivendor and multiservice marketspace in return for commissions on sales.\n\nWith the advent of b-to-b exchanges, the Internet ushered in an enthusiasm for collaboration that never existed before\u2014and in fact might have even seemed ludicrous 10 years ago. For example, a decade ago who would have imagined Ford, [[General Motors]] and [[DaimlerChrysler]] entering into a joint venture? That's exactly what happened after all three of [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|the Big Three]] began moving their purchases online in the late 1990s. All three companies were pursuing their own initiatives when they realized the [[Returns to scale|economies of scale]] they could achieve by pooling their efforts. Thus was born what then was the world's largest [[Dot-com company|Internet business]] when Ford's Auto-Xchange and GM's TradeXchange merged, with DaimlerChrysler representing the third partner.\n\nWhile this exchange did not stand the test of time, others have, including [[Agentrics]], which was formed in 2005 with the merger of WorldWide Retail Exchange and GlobalNetXchange, or GNX. Agentrics serves more 50 retailers around the world and more than 300 customers, and its members have combined sales of about $1 trillion. Hutt and Speh (2001) note that such virtual marketplaces enable companies and their suppliers to conduct business in real time as well as simplify purchase processes and cut costs.\n\n== Design ==\n\nB2B design often relies heavily on gradients.

It allows them to [[sales|sell]] products or services to other companies or organizations that [[resell]] them, use them in their products or services or use them to support their works. It is a way to promote business and improve profit too.\n\nBusiness marketing is also known as [[industrial marketing]] or [[business-to-business]] (B2B) marketing. Business-to-government marketing, while still classified within the B2B discipline due to the sharing of dynamics, does differ slightly.\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe practice of a [[purveyor]] of [[goods]] [[trading]] with another may be as old as [[commerce]] itself. In relation to marketing today, its history is more recent. Michael Morris, Leyland Pitt, and Earl Dwight Honeycutt say that for several years business marketing took \"a back seat\" to [[consumer marketing]].<ref>Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt, pg. xix</ref> This entailed providers of goods or services selling directly to households through [[mass media]] and retail channels. David Lichtenthal (professor of marketing at [[Zicklin School of Business]]) notes in his research that business marketing has existed since the mid-19th century. He adds that the bulk of research on business marketing has come in the last 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chauhan|first1=Gyan|last2=Anbalagan|first2=C|title=Strategy and Trends in B2B Business: Opportunities and Challenges - A Global Prospective|url=http://www.ifsmrc.org/sites/default/files/journals/pdf/6.%20AIJRM%202305JJ14%20Mani%20paper%20for%20AIJRM%20issue%203.pdf|website=International Faculty and Student Multi-Research Consortium|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThis began to change in the middle to late 1970s.

According to Jeremy Kourdi, more than half of marketing majors start their careers in business marketing rather than consumer marketing.<ref>{{cite book|title=More Great Ideas A Day: 365 more business ideas for each day of the year|date=2013|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2013|isbn=978-9814484664|page=266|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SSJAAAAQBAJ&dq=marketing+majors+begin+their+careers+in+business+marketing+today+than+in+consumer+marketing.&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=6 August 2015|chapter=Business-To-Business Marketing}}</ref>\n\n== Business and consumer markets ==\n\nBusiness markets have derived demand \u2013 a demand in them exists because of demand in the [[consumer market]]. An example would be a government wishing to purchase equipment for a [[nuclear power plant]]. The underlying consumer demand that has triggered this is that people are [[electricity consumption|consuming more electricity]] (by using more [[home appliance|household device]]s such as washing machines and computers). Business markets do exist in isolation.\n\nA single consumer market demand can give rise to hundreds of business market demands. The [[car industry|demand for cars]] creates demands for castings, forgings, plastic components, steel and tires. In turn, this creates demands for casting sand, forging machines, mining materials, polymers, rubber. Each of these growing demands has triggered more demands.\n\nAs the spending power of citizens increases, countries generally see an upward wave in their economy. Cities or countries with growing consumption are generally growing business markets.\n\n== Vs. consumer marketing ==\n\nDespite the differences between business and consumer marketing from a surface perspective being seemingly obvious, there are more subtle distinctions between the two with substantial ramifications. Dwyer and Tanner note that business marketing generally entails shorter and more direct channels of distribution.\n\nWhile consumer marketing is aimed at large groups through [[mass media]] and [[retailer]]s, the negotiation process between the buyer and seller is more personal in business marketing. According to Hutt and Speh (2004), most business marketers commit only a small part of their promotional budgets to advertising, and that is usually through [[Direct marketing|direct mail]] efforts and trade journals. While advertising is limited, it often helps the business marketer set up successful sales calls.\n\nMarketing to a business is trying to make a profit (business-to-business marketing) as opposed to an individual for personal use ([[Business-to-consumer|Business-to-Consumer]], or B2C marketing) is similar in terms of the fundamental principles of marketing. In [[B2C]], [[business-to-business|B2B]] and [[government marketing|B2G]] marketing situations, the marketer must always:\n\n* successfully match the product or service strengths with the needs of a definable target market;\n* position and price to align the product or service with its market, often an intricate balance; and\n* communicate and sell it in the fashion that demonstrates its value effectively to the target market.\n\nThese are the fundamental principles of the 4 Ps of marketing (the [[marketing mix]]) first documented by [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] in 1960.<ref>McCarthy, Jerome E.: \"Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach\". Homewood, IL: Irwin, 1996</ref>\n\nWhile \"other businesses\" might seem like the simple answer, Dwyer and Tanner say business customers fall into four broad categories: companies that consume products or services, government agencies, institutions and resellers.\n\nThe first category includes [[original equipment manufacturers]], such as large auto-makers who buy [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]] to put in their cars and also small firms owned by 1-2 individuals who purchase products to run their business. The second category - government agencies, is the biggest. In fact, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] is the biggest single purchaser of products and services in the country, spending more than $300 billion annually. But this category also includes state and [[local government]]s. The third category, institutions, includes schools, hospitals and [[nursing home]]s, churches and charities. Finally, resellers consist of wholesalers, brokers and industrial distributors.\n\nSo what are the meaningful differences between B2B and B2C marketing?\n* A notable characteristic of B2B marketing is that it is rarely 'product first' or 'service first'. Marketing messages lead with significant context that acknowledges the customer's need or problem first and then establishes the relevance of the vendor's product or service to the customer's situation.   In B2C marketing, the product or service features and benefits are called out up front. The customer is expected to already know why they need the product or service.\n* The buyer or customer is often a group or committee or department comprising several individuals who have specific roles in evaluating the proposed product or service.  In B2C, the buyer is mostly an individual who needs the product or service for his or her own use. Offerings are evaluated mainly on price, reviews and word of mouth, although these are factors in B2B marketing as well\n\nA B2C sale is to a \"Consumer\" i.e. to a single person who pays for the transaction. A B2B sale is to a \"Business\" i.e. organization or firm. Given the complexity of [[organizational structure]], B2B sales typically involve multiple decision makers.\n\nWhile the structure of a B2B sale involving an organization is understood, the psychology of a B2B sale, particularly from a marketing perspective, is not always devoid of human emotion. According to Bill Blaney (2012), a B2C and a B2B sale can be differentiated by the customer as either a \"want\" or a \"need.\" While retail consumer sales rarely hinge upon a product or service that customers \"need\" in order to survive (pharmaceutical and other health industry products notwithstanding), business sales are more directly applied to the growth and survival of that particular company, organization or institution. As a result, marketing to businesses relies on communication that can provide the company buyer with a level of comfort in the long-term performance of their product or service, and support in its continued efficacy.\n\nThe marketing mix is affected by the B2B uniqueness which include complexity of business products and services, diversity of demand and the differing nature of the sales itself (including fewer customers buying larger volumes).<ref>Kotler & Pfoertsch: \"B2B Brand Management\", page 21. Springer Berlin, 2006</ref> Because there are some important subtleties to the B2B sale, the issues are broken down beyond just the original 4 Ps of marketing developed by McCarthy.\n\n== Strategies ==\n\n===B2B branding===\nB2B branding is different from B2C in some crucial ways, including the need to align corporate brands, divisional brands and product/service brands and to apply brand standards to material often considered \u201cinformal\u201d such as email and other electronic correspondence. It is mainly of large scale when compared with B2C.\n\n=== Product (or service) ===\nDue to the fact that business customers are focused on creating [[shareholder value]] for themselves, the cost-saving or revenue-producing benefits of products and services are important to factor in throughout the [[New product development|product development]] and marketing cycles.\n\n=== Target market ===\n[[File:B2B buyer decision map.jpg|thumbnail|right|B2B Buyer Decision Map: Problem, solution alternatives, decision support]]Quite often, the [[target market]] for a business product or service is smaller and has more specialized needs reflective of a specific industry or niche.<ref>Malaval: \"Strategy and Management of Industrial Brands: Business to Business Products and Services\", page 16. 2001</ref> A B2B niche, a segment of the market, can be described in terms of [[firmographics]] which requires marketers to have good business intelligence in order to increase response rates.  Regardless of the size of the target market, the business customer is making an organizational purchase decision and the dynamics of this, both procedurally and in terms of how they value the product offered, differ dramatically from the consumer market. There may be multiple [[influencer marketing|influencers]] on the purchase decision, which may also have to be marketed to, though they may not be members of the [[decision making unit]].<ref>Brown, Duncan and Hayes, Nick. Influencer Marketing: Who really influences your customers?, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008</ref>  In addition the research and decision making process a B2B buyer undertakes will be more extensive.<ref>Glynn. Business-to-business Brand Management, Emerald Group Publishing, 2009</ref>  Finally the purchase information that buyers are researching changes as they go through the buying process (see sample decision map).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brainrider.com/better-content-blog/b2b-buyer-decision-map/| title=B2B Buyer Decision Map: Understanding Decision Stages - Brainrider | work=Brainrider | accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Pricing ===\nThe business market can be convinced to pay premium prices more often than the consumer market with appropriate pricing structure and payment terms. This pricing premium is particularly achievable if it is supported with a strong brand.<ref>Kotler & Pfoertsch: \"B2B Brand Management\", page 53. Springer Berlin, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Promotion ===\n[[marketing promotion|Promotion]] planning is relatively easy when the decision making habits of the [[customer base]] and the vocabulary unique to their segment are known. Specific [[Trade fair|trade shows]], analysts, publications, blogs and retail/wholesale outlets tend to be fairly common to each industry/product area. Once it is figured out for the industry/product, writing the promotion plan is simple. Promotion techniques rely heavily on [[marketing communications]] strategies (see below).<ref>{{cite web|title=BANT - Budget Authority Need Timeline - A lead scoring methodology developed by IBM|url=https://bant.io/how|publisher=Bant.io|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Sales and distribution ===\nThe importance of a knowledgeable, experienced and effective direct (inside or outside) [[sales]] force is often critical in the business market. When selling through [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]] also, the number and type of sales forces can vary tremendously and success as a marketer is highly dependent on their success.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of the B2B sales cycle is its comparably longer lead times compared to B2C.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.leadagency.com.au/marketing-consultant-melbourne/expertise/ | title=B2B Marketing Expertise - Strategy and campaigns}}</ref> The result of this longer lead cycle affects the entire B2B marketing process.\n\n=== Communications methodologies ===\n\nThe purpose of B2B marketing communications is to support the organizations' sales effort and improve company profitability. B2B marketing communications tactics generally include advertising, [[public relations]], direct mail, trade show support, sales collateral, branding, and interactive services such as [[Web design|website design]] and [[search engine optimization]]. The Business Marketing Association<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.marketing.org/ | title=ANA Business Marketing &#124; ANA}}</ref> is the [[Industry trade group|trade organization]] that serves B2B marketing professionals. It was founded in 1922 and offers [[Professional certification|certification programs]], research services, conferences, industry awards and training programs.\n\n==== Positioning statement ====\nAn important first step in business to business marketing is the development of a positioning statement. This is a statement of what is done and how it will be better and more efficient than competitors.\n\n==== Developing messages ====\nThe next step is to develop messages.  There is usually a primary message that conveys more strongly to customers, what is done and how the customers benefit from it. This is often supported by a number of secondary messages, each of which may have a number of supporting arguments, facts and figures.\n\n==== Campaign plans ====\nA comprehensive plan to target resources where they will deliver the best [[return on investment]]. The infrastructure to support each stage of the marketing process has to be in place and the entire organization must be geared up to handle the inquiries appropriately.\n\n==== Briefing an agency ====\nA standard briefing document is usually a good idea for briefing an agency, as well as focusing the agency on what is important in the campaign. It serves as a checklist of all the important things to consider as part of the brief.  Typical elements to an agency brief are: objectives, target market, [[target audience]], product, campaign description, product positioning, graphical considerations, corporate guidelines, and any other supporting material and distribution.\n\n==== Measuring results ====\nThe value in results measurement is in tying the marketing campaign back to business results. Metrics to measure the impact are  e.g. [[cost per acquisition]], [[cost per lead]] or tangible changes in customer perception.\n\n== Size ==\n\nHutt and Speh (2001) note that \"business marketers serve the largest market of all; the dollar volume of transactions in the industrial or business market significantly exceeds that of the ultimate consumer market.\" For example, they note that companies such as GE, [[DuPont]] and IBM spend more than $60 million a day on purchases to support their operations.\n\nDwyer and Tanner (2006) say the purchases made by companies, government agencies and institutions \"account for more than half of the economic activity in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] such as the United States, Canada and France.\"\n\nA 2003 study sponsored by the Business Marketing Association estimated that business-to-business marketers in the United States spend about $85 billion a year to promote their [[goods and services]].

The company is best known for its line of interchangeable-barrel, single-shot pistols and rifles. Thompson/Center also manufactures [[muzzle-loading]] rifles and is credited with creating the resurgence of their use in the 1970s.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol in his basement workshop that later became known as the Contender. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967. Although it sold for more than comparable hunting revolvers, the flexibility of being able to shoot multiple calibers by simply changing out the barrel and sights and its higher accuracy soon made it popular with handgun hunters.<ref name=\"Zwoll\">{{cite book | last = Van Zwoll | first = Wayne| title = Hunter's Guide to Long-Range Shooting | publisher = Stackpole Books| year = 2006| location = | page = 332 | isbn = }}</ref> As K.W. Thompson Tool began marketing Center's Contender pistol, the company name was changed to Thompson/Center Arms Company. Then, in 1970, Thompson/Center created the modern black powder industry, introducing Warren Center's Hawken-styled black powder muzzle-loader rifle.<ref name=\"CS1\">{{cite book | last = Stephens | first = Charles| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Thompson/Center Contender Pistol: How To Tune, Time, Load, And Shoot For Accuracy | publisher = Paladin Press| year = 1996| location = Boulder, CO | pages = 64 | isbn = 978-0-87364-885-1 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2007, Thompson/Center was purchased by [[Smith & Wesson]].<ref>[http://ir.smith-wesson.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=90977&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=942841&highlight 13009 - Smith&Wesson: Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2010, Smith & Wesson announced that the original Rochester, New Hampshire plant would be closed and manufacturing was transferred to Springfield, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101210/GJNEWS_01/712109872/0/SEARCH|title=In Rochester: Thompson/Center Arms plant to close|first=Jake| last=O'Donnell|date= December 10, 2010|publisher=Fosters Daily Democrat}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Thompson/Center arms in Rochester, New Hampshire, Thompson Investment Casting opened in the same town continuing production of metal products for various companies including Smith & Wesson.\n\n==Break-action pistols==\nThompson/Center's success came with the emergence of long range [[handgun hunting]], target shooting, and, especially, [[metallic silhouette shooting]].<ref name=\"Layne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |last=Simpson |first=Layne |title=The Contender's Magnificent 7 |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2009 |issue=2 |date=January 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160921095258/http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Their [[break-action]], [[single-shot]] design brought [[rifle]]-like accuracy and power in a handgun, which was a new concept at the time. Originally designed only for interchangeable barrels in [[.38 Special]] and [[.22 LR]], subsequent handgun developments by Thompson/Center led to a wider range of interchangeable barrels for use with many more cartridges. Opening and closing the break-open action is accomplished by squeezing the outside bottom of the trigger guard toward the grip/buttstock, at which time the action opens, and an extractor manually extracts the cartridge.\n\n===Contender===\n{{Main|Thompson/Center Contender}}\n[[File:TC-Contender.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Contender in 45 Colt/.410 with ventilated rib]]\nThe Contender, first introduced in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle with a number of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.<ref name=\"Ayoob2012\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Massad Ayoob's Greatest Handguns of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYmgHFwqT2gC&pg=PA266 |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=F+W Media |isbn=978-1-4402-2877-3 |pages=241\u2013266 |chapter=Thompson Center Single Shots}}</ref>\n\n===The Encore===\nThe Encore was released in 1983. The Encore uses a different trigger mechanism, designed to be stronger than the original Contender's and to make the break-action easier to open. The Encore uses a considerably larger and stronger frame than the Contender, and accordingly, is found in over 86 cartridges - ranging from [[.22 Hornet]] to the huge [[.416 Rigby]].

The company is best known for its line of interchangeable-barrel, single-shot pistols and rifles. Thompson/Center also manufactures [[muzzle-loading]] rifles and is credited with creating the resurgence of their use in the 1970s.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol in his basement workshop that later became known as the Contender. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967. Although it sold for more than comparable hunting revolvers, the flexibility of being able to shoot multiple calibers by simply changing out the barrel and sights and its higher accuracy soon made it popular with handgun hunters.<ref name=\"Zwoll\">{{cite book | last = Van Zwoll | first = Wayne| title = Hunter's Guide to Long-Range Shooting | publisher = Stackpole Books| year = 2006| location = | page = 332 | isbn = }}</ref> As K.W. Thompson Tool began marketing Center's Contender pistol, the company name was changed to Thompson/Center Arms Company. Then, in 1970, Thompson/Center created the modern black powder industry, introducing Warren Center's Hawken-styled black powder muzzle-loader rifle.<ref name=\"CS1\">{{cite book | last = Stephens | first = Charles| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Thompson/Center Contender Pistol: How To Tune, Time, Load, And Shoot For Accuracy | publisher = Paladin Press| year = 1996| location = Boulder, CO | pages = 64 | isbn = 978-0-87364-885-1 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2007, Thompson/Center was purchased by [[Smith & Wesson]].<ref>[http://ir.smith-wesson.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=90977&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=942841&highlight 13009 - Smith&Wesson: Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2010, Smith & Wesson announced that the original Rochester, New Hampshire plant would be closed and manufacturing was transferred to Springfield, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101210/GJNEWS_01/712109872/0/SEARCH|title=In Rochester: Thompson/Center Arms plant to close|first=Jake| last=O'Donnell|date= December 10, 2010|publisher=Fosters Daily Democrat}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Thompson/Center arms in Rochester, New Hampshire, Thompson Investment Casting opened in the same town continuing production of metal products for various companies including Smith & Wesson.\n\n==Break-action pistols==\nThompson/Center's success came with the emergence of long range [[handgun hunting]], target shooting, and, especially, [[metallic silhouette shooting]].<ref name=\"Layne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |last=Simpson |first=Layne |title=The Contender's Magnificent 7 |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2009 |issue=2 |date=January 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160921095258/http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Their [[break-action]], [[single-shot]] design brought [[rifle]]-like accuracy and power in a handgun, which was a new concept at the time. Originally designed only for interchangeable barrels in [[.38 Special]] and [[.22 LR]], subsequent handgun developments by Thompson/Center led to a wider range of interchangeable barrels for use with many more cartridges. Opening and closing the break-open action is accomplished by squeezing the outside bottom of the trigger guard toward the grip/buttstock, at which time the action opens, and an extractor manually extracts the cartridge.\n\n===Contender===\n{{Main|Thompson/Center Contender}}\n[[File:TC-Contender.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Contender in 45 Colt/.410 with ventilated rib]]\nThe Contender, first introduced in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle with a number of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.<ref name=\"Ayoob2012\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Massad Ayoob's Greatest Handguns of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYmgHFwqT2gC&pg=PA266 |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=F+W Media |isbn=978-1-4402-2877-3 |pages=241\u2013266 |chapter=Thompson Center Single Shots}}</ref>\n\n===The Encore===\nThe Encore was released in 1983. The Encore uses a different trigger mechanism, designed to be stronger than the original Contender's and to make the break-action easier to open. The Encore uses a considerably larger and stronger frame than the Contender, and accordingly, is found in over 86 cartridges - ranging from [[.22 Hornet]] to the huge [[.416 Rigby]]. There has even been one pistol-length stainless barrel made in .600 Nitro Express. The Encore barrel list also includes shotgun barrels in 28, 20, and 12 gauge, and muzzleloading barrels in .45, .50 caliber, and 12 gauge using #209 shotgun primers. In 2007, Encore rimfire barrels became available in 22 LR and 17 HMR, featuring a unique monoblock design that required no alteration to the frame assembly.\n\nAn upgraded Encore is called the Pro Hunter which generally includes stocks with rubber \"Flex Tech\" inserts and are stainless or carbon steel with weather shielding.

[[Steve Tsang]] of [[Oxford University]] wrote in the September 1994 edition of ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', \"Evidence now suggests that Zhou knew of the plot beforehand and secretly changed his travel plans, though he did not stop a decoy delegation of lesser cadres from taking his place.\"<ref>\"Target Zhou Enlai: The `Kashmir Princess' Incident of 1955,\" ''[[The China Quarterly]]''. Number 139, September 1994.</ref>\n\n== Investigation ==\nChinese prime minister chou en lai asked his indian counterpart to send indian officials in investigation. The day after the crash, China's [[Foreign Ministry]] issued a statement that described the bombing as \"a murder by the special service organizations of the United States and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]\"<ref>Steve Tsang, The Cold War's Odd Couple: The Unintended Partnership Between the Republic of China and the UK (New York: IB Tauris, 2006), 181.</ref>, while [[Hong Kong Governor]] Sir [[Alexander Grantham]] maintained that the plane was not tampered with in Hong Kong. However, on 26 May, an Indonesian board of inquiry later announced that a time bomb with an American-made MK-7 detonator was responsible for the crash and it was highly probable that the bomb was placed on the plane in Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nThe Hong Kong authorities offered [[HK$]]100,000 for information leading to the arrest of those responsible. They questioned 71 people connected with the servicing of the Air India flight. When police began to focus on Chow Tse-ming, a janitor for Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co., he stowed away to Taiwan on a [[CIA]]-owned [[Civil Air Transport]] aircraft. The Hong Kong police reported that a warrant charging a murder conspiracy was issued, but the man with the name Chow Tse-ming in the warrant had flown to Taiwan on 18 May 1955, and Chow Tse-ming had three aliases.<ref>\"Police Seek Chinese in Crash Case\" from Daytona Beach Morning Journal, 3 September 1955</ref>\n\nThe Hong Kong police concluded that the [[Kuomintang]] had recruited Chow to plant the bomb to kill Zhou Enlai. Apparently, he had bragged to friends about his role in the bombing, and had also spent large amounts of money before he left Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Police tried to [[extradite]] Chow, but Taiwan refused and denied that Chow was a [[Kuomintang|KMT]] agent.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nSteve Tsang collected evidence from British, Taiwanese, American and Hong Kong archives that points directly to KMT agents operating in Hong Kong as the perpetrators of the aircraft bombing. According to him, the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] had a special-operations group stationed in Hong Kong responsible for assassination and sabotage. Designated the Hong Kong Group under [[Major-General]] Kong Hoi-ping, it operated a network of 90 agents. In March 1955, the group recruited Chow for the assassination because his job at the airport gave him easy access to the Air India plane, and offered him HK$600,000 and refuge in Taiwan, if necessary.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nA [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Foreign Ministry]] document declassified in 2004 also indicates that the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] secret service was responsible for the bombing.<ref>{{cite news |title=\u5916\u4ea4\u90e8\u63ed\u5bc6\"\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u516c\u4e3b\u53f7\"\u5468\u603b\u7406\u5ea7\u673a\u88ab\u70b8\u6848(\u56fe) |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2004-07-20/07153133667s.shtml |accessdate=27 March 2019 |agency=\u4eac\u534e\u65f6\u62a5 |publisher=\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 |date=20 July 2004}}</ref>\n\nChina had from the outset accused the United States of involvement in the bombing, but while the CIA had considered a plan to assassinate Zhou Enlai at this time,<ref>Minnick, Wendell L. \"Target: Zhou Enlai\", Far Eastern Economic Review, 1995-07-13, pages 54\u201355.</ref> the [[Church Committee]] reported that these plans were disapproved of and \"strongly censured\" by Washington.<ref>Arthur M.

An emergency [[appendectomy]] delayed his arrival in Hong Kong;<ref name=\"Itoh2017\">{{cite book|author=Mayumi Itoh|title=''The Making of China\u2019s Peace with Japan: What Xi Jinping Should Learn from Zhou Enlai''| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weAqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=13 July 2017| publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-10-4008-5|page=37}}</ref> he left China three days after the crash and flew to [[Rangoon]] to meet with [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] before continuing on to Bandung to attend the conference.<ref name=\"CD\"/>\n\nSome historians have argued that Zhou may have known about the assassination plot beforehand and that the premier did not undergo an appendectomy at the time. [[Steve Tsang]] of [[Oxford University]] wrote in the September 1994 edition of ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', \"Evidence now suggests that Zhou knew of the plot beforehand and secretly changed his travel plans, though he did not stop a decoy delegation of lesser cadres from taking his place.\"<ref>\"Target Zhou Enlai: The `Kashmir Princess' Incident of 1955,\" ''[[The China Quarterly]]''. Number 139, September 1994.</ref>\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe day after the crash, China's [[Foreign Ministry]] issued a statement that described the bombing as \"a murder by the special service organizations of the United States and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]\"<ref>Steve Tsang, The Cold War's Odd Couple: The Unintended Partnership Between the Republic of China and the UK (New York: IB Tauris, 2006), 181.</ref>, while [[Hong Kong Governor]] Sir [[Alexander Grantham]] maintained that the plane was not tampered with in Hong Kong. However, on 26 May, an Indonesian board of inquiry later announced that a time bomb with an American-made MK-7 detonator was responsible for the crash and it was highly probable that the bomb was placed on the plane in Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nThe Hong Kong authorities offered [[HK$]]100,000 for information leading to the arrest of those responsible. They questioned 71 people connected with the servicing of the Air India flight. When police began to focus on Chow Tse-ming, a janitor for Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co., he stowed away to Taiwan on a [[CIA]]-owned [[Civil Air Transport]] aircraft. The Hong Kong police reported that a warrant charging a murder conspiracy was issued, but the man with the name Chow Tse-ming in the warrant had flown to Taiwan on 18 May 1955, and Chow Tse-ming had three aliases.<ref>\"Police Seek Chinese in Crash Case\" from Daytona Beach Morning Journal, 3 September 1955</ref>\n\nThe Hong Kong police concluded that the [[Kuomintang]] had recruited Chow to plant the bomb to kill Zhou Enlai. Apparently, he had bragged to friends about his role in the bombing, and had also spent large amounts of money before he left Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Police tried to [[extradite]] Chow, but Taiwan refused and denied that Chow was a [[Kuomintang|KMT]] agent.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nSteve Tsang collected evidence from British, Taiwanese, American and Hong Kong archives that points directly to KMT agents operating in Hong Kong as the perpetrators of the aircraft bombing. According to him, the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] had a special-operations group stationed in Hong Kong responsible for assassination and sabotage. Designated the Hong Kong Group under [[Major-General]] Kong Hoi-ping, it operated a network of 90 agents. In March 1955, the group recruited Chow for the assassination because his job at the airport gave him easy access to the Air India plane, and offered him HK$600,000 and refuge in Taiwan, if necessary.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nA [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Foreign Ministry]] document declassified in 2004 also indicates that the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] secret service was responsible for the bombing.<ref>{{cite news |title=\u5916\u4ea4\u90e8\u63ed\u5bc6\"\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u516c\u4e3b\u53f7\"\u5468\u603b\u7406\u5ea7\u673a\u88ab\u70b8\u6848(\u56fe) |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2004-07-20/07153133667s.shtml |accessdate=27 March 2019 |agency=\u4eac\u534e\u65f6\u62a5 |publisher=\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 |date=20 July 2004}}</ref>\n\nChina had from the outset accused the United States of involvement in the bombing, but while the CIA had considered a plan to assassinate Zhou Enlai at this time,<ref>Minnick, Wendell L. \"Target: Zhou Enlai\", Far Eastern Economic Review, 1995-07-13, pages 54\u201355.</ref> the [[Church Committee]] reported that these plans were disapproved of and \"strongly censured\" by Washington.<ref>Arthur M.

The Singapore Botanical Gardens, a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] is a 52 hectares tropical garden, among its main attractions includes the National Orchid collection with over 3000 types of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] growing. Jurong Bird Park, is a bird zoo with extensive specimens of exotic bird life from around the world, including a flock of one thousand flamingos. The bird park is largest in the world in terms of the number of birds. Gardens By The Bay, designed as a series of large tropical leaf-shaped gardens, each with its own specific landscaping design, character and theme. Its main attractions are the two conservatories, the Flower Dome, which replicates a mild, dry climate and features plants found in the Mediterranean and other semi-arid tropical regions, and the Cloud Forest, which replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions between 1,000 metres (3,300&nbsp;ft) and 3,000 metres (9,800&nbsp;ft) above sea level, found in South-East Asia, Middle- and South America. Other main attractions include the Supertree Grove, which features tree-like structures, known as Supertrees that dominate the Gardens' landscape. They are vertical gardens that perform a multitude of functions, which include planting, shading and working as environmental engines for the gardens.\n\nSingapore also has two [[ASEAN Heritage Parks]], which are the [[Bukit Timah Nature Reserve]], an extensive [[nature reserve]] which covers much of the [[Bukit Timah Hill]], and is the only remaining place where primary rainforest still exists on the island, and the [[Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve]], which is known for its high variety of bird species, crabs, mudskippers and flora and fauna.\n\n[[Pulau Ubin]], is an offshore island where the last of undeveloped ''[[Kampong Glam|kampongs]]'' (villages) and wooden jetties, relaxed inhabitants, rich and preserved wildlife, abandoned quarries and plantations, and untouched nature still exists. One of the more popular spots on the island is, [[Chek Jawa]], a previous coral reef 5000 years ago, where several ecosystems can be observed in one area.\n\n==Dining==\n{{Main article|Cuisine of Singapore}}\nThe '''cuisine of Singapore''' is often viewed by its population as a prime example of the ethnic diversity of the [[culture of Singapore]]. In [[Singapore]]'s [[hawker centre]]s \u2013 a technical misnomer, to be precise \u2013 for example, traditionally Malay [[hawker centre|hawker]] stalls selling [[halal]] food may serve halal versions of traditionally Tamil or Chinese food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay or Indian ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering. Some dishes introduce elements from all three cultures, while others incorporate influences from the rest of [[Asia]] and [[Western Hemisphere|the West]].\n\nThis phenomenon makes the cuisine of Singapore significantly rich and a cultural attraction. Much prepared food is available in the hawker centres or [[food court]]s (e.g. [[Lau Pa Sat]], [[Newton Food Centre]]) rather than actual [[restaurant]]s.  These centres are relatively [[supply and demand|abundant]] which often leads to low prices, and encourages a large consumer base.\n\nFood in itself has been heavily promoted as an attraction for [[tourist]]s, and is usually promoted by various initiatives undertaken by the [[Singapore Tourism Board]] or the associations it deals with as one of Singapore's best attractions alongside [[shopping]]. The government organises the [[Singapore Food Festival]] in July annually to celebrate Singapore's cuisine. The multiculturalism of local food, the ready availability of international cuisine, and their wide range in prices to fit all budgets at all times of the day and year helps create a \"food paradise\" to rival other contenders claiming the same [[moniker]]. The availability of variety of food is often aided by the fact [[port of Singapore|Singapore's port]] lies along strategic routes.

The Singapore Botanical Gardens, a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] is a 52 hectares tropical garden, among its main attractions includes the National Orchid collection with over 3000 types of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] growing. Jurong Bird Park, is a bird zoo with extensive specimens of exotic bird life from around the world, including a flock of one thousand flamingos. The bird park is largest in the world in terms of the number of birds. Gardens By The Bay, designed as a series of large tropical leaf-shaped gardens, each with its own specific landscaping design, character and theme. Its main attractions are the two conservatories, the Flower Dome, which replicates a mild, dry climate and features plants found in the Mediterranean and other semi-arid tropical regions, and the Cloud Forest, which replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions between 1,000 metres (3,300&nbsp;ft) and 3,000 metres (9,800&nbsp;ft) above sea level, found in South-East Asia, Middle- and South America. Other main attractions include the Supertree Grove, which features tree-like structures, known as Supertrees that dominate the Gardens' landscape. They are vertical gardens that perform a multitude of functions, which include planting, shading and working as environmental engines for the gardens.\n\nSingapore also has two [[ASEAN Heritage Parks]], which are the [[Bukit Timah Nature Reserve]], an extensive [[nature reserve]] which covers much of the [[Bukit Timah Hill]], and is the only remaining place where primary rainforest still exists on the island, and the [[Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve]], which is known for its high variety of bird species, crabs, mudskippers and flora and fauna.\n\n[[Pulau Ubin]], is an offshore island where the last of undeveloped ''[[Kampong Glam|kampongs]]'' (villages) and wooden jetties, relaxed inhabitants, rich and preserved wildlife, abandoned quarries and plantations, and untouched nature still exists. One of the more popular spots on the island is, [[Chek Jawa]], a previous coral reef 5000 years ago, where several ecosystems can be observed in one area.\n\n==Dining==\n{{Main article|Cuisine of Singapore}}\nThe '''cuisine of Singapore''' is often viewed by its population as a prime example of the ethnic diversity of the [[culture of Singapore]]. In [[Singapore]]'s [[hawker centre]]s \u2013 a technical misnomer, to be precise \u2013 for example, traditionally Malay [[hawker centre|hawker]] stalls selling [[halal]] food may serve halal versions of traditionally Tamil or Chinese food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay or Indian ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering. Some dishes introduce elements from all three cultures, while others incorporate influences from the rest of [[Asia]] and [[Western Hemisphere|the West]].\n\nThis phenomenon makes the cuisine of Singapore significantly rich and a cultural attraction. Much prepared food is available in the hawker centres or [[food court]]s (e.g. [[Lau Pa Sat]], [[Newton Food Centre]]) rather than actual [[restaurant]]s.  These centres are relatively [[supply and demand|abundant]] which often leads to low prices, and encourages a large consumer base.\n\nFood in itself has been heavily promoted as an attraction for [[tourist]]s, and is usually promoted by various initiatives undertaken by the [[Singapore Tourism Board]] or the associations it deals with as one of Singapore's best attractions alongside [[shopping]]. The government organises the [[Singapore Food Festival]] in July annually to celebrate Singapore's cuisine. The multiculturalism of local food, the ready availability of international cuisine, and their wide range in prices to fit all budgets at all times of the day and year helps create a \"food paradise\" to rival other contenders claiming the same [[moniker]]. The availability of variety of food is often aided by the fact [[port of Singapore|Singapore's port]] lies along strategic routes. Catherine Ling of ''[[CNN]]'' listed [[Fish soup bee hoon]], [[Bak kut teh]], [[Chilli crab]], [[Nasi Padang]], [[Hainanese chicken rice]], and [[Kaya toast]] as some of the \"40 Singapore foods we can't live without\".<ref name=\"CNN 1\">\n{{cite news |newspaper=[[CNN]] |last=Ling |first=Catherine |url=http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/none/40-singapore-foods-we-cant-live-without-810208 |title=40 Singapore foods we can't live without |date=April 14, 2010 |access-date=10 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804163358/http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/none/40-singapore-foods-we-cant-live-without-810208 |archive-date=4 August 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nThere is also a proliferation of [[fast-food]] chains, such as [[McDonald's]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[KFC]], [[Burger King]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Long John Silver's]], and [[Mos Burger]].\n\n[[Halal]] and [[vegetarian]] food are also easily available.\n\n==Tourist events==\n[[File:Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park and its surrounds.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park and its surrounds]]\n[[Singapore Tourism Board]] promotes a variety of events all year round for tourists.
