As a teenager, Platt worked at a confectionery shop in [[Surrey]] before travelling to [[New Zealand]] at the age of 19 after what was rumoured to be a broken romance.  Platt remained in New Zealand until 1927 when she moved to Australia to live in [[Sydney]].<ref name=\"adb\"/> There she worked at a cinema in the city and lived in a boarding house on Darlinghurst Road in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] where accounts tell she entertained young, attractive men. Platt was a heavy drinker and a [[Jazz Age]] party-goer who had difficulty adjusting to stability. Her marriage to Italian-born Antonio Agostini (1903-1969), in a Sydney registry office during 1930, was the beginning of an unhappy time that would see the couple leave for [[Melbourne]] to remove her from the influence of her Sydney friends.\n\n==Discovery and initial investigation==\nAgostini disappeared from friends and family in late August 1934, around a week before the unidentified Pyjama Girl was found in Splitter's Creek, near [[Albury]], on the [[New South Wales]] side of the border with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\nThe victim's body was discovered by a local man named Tom Griffith. Griffith had been leading a prize bull along the side of Howlong Road near Albury when he saw the body in a [[culvert]] running under the road and noticed a strong smell of kerosene. Slightly concealed by a hessian grain sack and badly burnt, the body would not have been visible to anybody driving by.\n\nThe victim's head was wrapped in a towel. She had been badly beaten and an x-ray revealed a bullet in her neck. In a detail that came to define the case, she was wearing yellow silk pyjamas with a Chinese dragon motif \u2013 in [[Great Depression in Australia|Depression-era Australia]], such clothing was luxurious, youthful and bohemian.<ref name=\"AustScreenOnline\"/>\n\nIt soon became apparent that the body was of a petite woman in her twenties, but her identity could not be established. After the initial investigation failed to identify her, the body was taken to [[Sydney]] where it was put on public exhibition. She was preserved in a bath of [[formalin]] for this purpose at the Sydney University Medical School, until 1942, when her body was transferred to police headquarters where it remained until 1944.<ref name=\"random-house\"/>\n\nSeveral names were suggested for the identity of the dead woman, among them Anna Philomena Morgan and Linda Agostini. Both women were missing, both bore a likeness to the Pyjama Girl and both were of the right age. However, New South Wales police satisfied themselves that neither of the missing women was the Pyjama Girl and she remained unidentified.<ref name=\"daily-telegraph-2015\"/>\n\n==Reopening of the case==\nIn 1944, ten years after the body had been discovered, the forensic evidence was re-examined and the [[Forensic dentistry|dental analysis]] of the victim was matched to Agostini.<ref name=\"adb\"/>\n\nTony Agostini had recently returned to Sydney after being held in internment camps at [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] and [[Loveday, South Australia|Loveday]] from 1940 to 1944 due to his nationalist sympathies. The [[police commissioner]], William MacKay, who had known him before the war when he worked as a waiter at the restaurant that MacKay frequented, interviewed him. Noticing that he seemed to be in a nervous state, MacKay asked him what had come over him. Antonio Agostini then confessed to killing his wife.\n\nIn his statement, he admitted that he had accidentally shot and killed his wife when they were living in Melbourne. Worried that he might be accused of murder, he had driven the body over the state border to Albury and had dumped it in the culvert. He had poured [[petrol]] over the body and set fire to it, to destroy the evidence.<ref name=\"adb\"/>\n\nThe identification came just as public confidence in the New South Wales Police Force began to wane at their failure to catch the decade's most prolific killer. The circumstances under which Antonio Agostini \"confessed\" to killing his wife in their Melbourne townhouse are still very dubious today.\n\nThe arrest of Agostini was a sensation, as it meant that the Pyjama Girl had been identified. He was charged with murder and was extradited to Melbourne, where he was tried for murder. He was acquitted but was found guilty of manslaughter instead, and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He was released in 1948 and deported to [[Italy]], where he died in 1969.\n\n==New evidence==\nThe case might have been left there, but some cast doubt on its conclusion. In his 2004 book, ''The Pyjama Girl Mystery: A True Story of Murder, Obsession and Lies'', historian Richard Evans pointed out discrepancies with the evidence, calling Antonio Agostini's conviction the result of \"police corruption and a miscarriage of justice\".<ref name=\"evans-2004\"/> The Pyjama Girl had brown eyes; Agostini's were blue. The victim had a different bust size to Agostini and she had a different shaped nose. Evans also points out that 125 women were originally on the police's list of possible identities, but that these other leads remained \"uneliminated and untraced\".<ref name=\"AHN\"/>\n\nEvans also suggests that Agostini was murdered around the same time as the Albury victim, and most likely in the confines of the couple's Melbourne townhouse, but that she was not the Pyjama Girl.<ref name=\"AHN\"/>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe case was turned into a short film, ''[[The Pyjama Girl Murder Case]]'' in 1939 by director [[Rupert Kathner]].\n\nA film entitled ''[[La ragazza dal pigiama giallo]]'' (''The Pyjama Girl Case''), directed by Italian [[Flavio Mogherini]], was produced in 1977.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> A book written by [[Hugh Atkinson (novelist)|Hugh Geddes]], based on the film and bearing the same title, appeared in 1978.<ref name=\"geddes-1978\"/>\n\nA short film by Canberra film maker Huck Tyrrell, entitled ''Roadside'', was produced in 1998 and inspired by the murder. In the film the victim returns as a hitch-hiker who tells her story to the unsuspecting driver and eventually leads him to her remains.\n\nIn 2013, the [[HotHouse Theatre|Hothouse Theatre]] in Albury/Wodonga commissioned a play entitled ''The Pyjama Girl'' from Canberra playwright Emma Gibson which it performed.<ref name=\"hothouse\"/>\n\n==See also== \n* [[List of solved missing persons cases]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"adb\">{{Cite AuDB|first=Bruce|last=Pennay|title=Agostini, Linda (1905 - 1934)|id2=agostini-linda-9966|volume=13|year=1993|access-date=2007-05-02}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AustScreenOnline\">{{cite AV media| medium=Motion Picture| title=Australia Today \u2013 The Pyjama Girl Murder Case| year=1939| url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/australia-today-pyjama-girl/clip1/| publisher=[[Australian Screen Online]]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"random-house\">{{cite book| title='Pyjama girl' murderer sentenced| work=Australia Through Time| edition=7th| publisher=Random House Australia| year=1999| isbn=978-0091838157}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daily-telegraph-2015\">{{cite news| title=The Pyjama Girl murder| work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]| date=5 November 2015| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/the-pyjama-girl-murder/story-fnknbqfy-1227591025452|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"evans-2004\">Evans, Richard (2004).

Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Indian coalition and, by the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed.<ref>{{Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Philips-War| title=King Philip's War BRITISH-NATIVE AMERICAN CONFLICT| last=Warren| first=Jason W.| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope where he was killed by the militia.\n\nThe war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\">{{cite book |last=Drake |first=James David |date=1999 |title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/1 1\u201315] |isbn=1558492240 }}</ref> In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\">{{cite journal| first=Philip| last=Gould| title=Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America| work=Journal of the Early Republic| volume=16| date=Winter 1996|doi=10.2307/3124421}}</ref>{{rp|656}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Schultz| first=Eric B.| author2=Michael J.

The New England colonists faced their enemies without support from any outside government or military, and this began to give them a group identity separate and distinct from Britain.<ref>Lepore (1998), ''The Name of War'' (1999) pp 5-7</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\n[[Plymouth Colony]] was established in 1620 with significant early help from local Indians, particularly [[Squanto]] and Massasoit. Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet. He reported to the governor of [[Plymouth Colony]] that Metacomet planned to gather allies for Indian attacks on widely dispersed colonial settlements.<ref name=Philbrick>{{cite book |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick| year=2006| title=Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War|url=https://archive.org/details/mayflower00nath |url-access=registration | location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]| authorlink=Nathaniel Philbrick}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nMetacomet was brought before a public court, where court officials admitted that they had no proof but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if they had any further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors. A jury that included six Indian elders convicted the men of Sassamon's murder, and they were executed by hanging on June 8, 1675 [[Julian calendar|(O.S.)]], at Plymouth.\n\n==Southern theater, 1675==\n\n=== Raid on Swansea ===\nA band of [[Pokanoket]]s attacked several isolated homesteads in the small Plymouth colony settlement of [[Swansea, Massachusetts|Swansea]] on June 20, 1675.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t5m90c088;view=1up;seq=78| title=The History of King Philip's War| author=Church, Benjamin (1639-1718)| publisher=HathiTrust| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675, near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign.

Philip led a force of 1,500 [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] Indians in a dawn attack on the isolated village, which then included all or part of the neighboring modern communities of [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]] and [[Clinton, Massachusetts|Clinton]]. They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people. Rowlandson's wife [[Mary Rowlandson|Mary]] was taken prisoner, and afterward wrote a best-selling [[captivity narrative]] of her experiences. Many of the community's other houses were destroyed before the Indians retreated northward.\n\n=== Plymouth Plantation Campaign ===\n[[File:Site of Nine Men's Misery (Cumberland, Rhode Island).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Site of \"[[Nine Men's Misery]]\" in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]] where Captain Pierce's troops were tortured]]\nThe spring of 1676 marked the high point for the combined tribes when they attacked Plymouth Plantation on March 12. The town withstood the assault, but the Indians had demonstrated their ability to penetrate deep into colonial territory. They attacked three more settlements; [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts|Longmeadow]] (near Springfield), Marlborough, and Simsbury were attacked two weeks later. They killed Captain Pierce<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/53528344| title=Capt Michael Pierce's Defeat (1615 - 1676) - Find a Grave Memorial| publisher=| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> and a company of Massachusetts soldiers between Pawtucket and the Blackstone's settlement. Several colonial men were tortured and buried at [[Nine Men's Misery]] in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island|Cumberland]] as part of the Indians' ritual torture of enemies. They also burned the settlement of Providence to the ground on March 29. At the same time, a small band of Indians infiltrated and burned part of Springfield while the militia was away.\n\n[[File:Early American Conflict.jpg|thumb|right|Colonists defending their settlement (non-contemporary depiction)]]\nThe settlements within the modern-day [[State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|state of Rhode Island]] became a literal island colony for a time as the settlements at [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] were sacked and burned, and the residents were driven to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]]. The Connecticut River towns had thousands of acres of cultivated crop land known as the bread basket of New England, but they had to limit their plantings and work in large armed groups for self-protection.<ref name=\"Phelps\">{{cite book| last=Phelps| first=Noah Amherst| title=History of Simsbury, Granby, and Canton; from 1642 to 1845| url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsimsbur00phel| publisher=Press of Case, Tiffany and Burnham| location=[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] |year=1845}}</ref>{{rp|20}} Towns such as [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Hatfield, Massachusetts|Hatfield]], [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]], and [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], fortified themselves, reinforced their militias, and held their ground, though attacked several times. The small towns of [[Northfield, Massachusetts|Northfield]], [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], and several others were abandoned as the surviving settlers retreated to the larger towns. The towns of the Connecticut colony were largely unharmed in the war, although more than 100 Connecticut militia died in their support of the other colonies.\n\n=== Attack on Sudbury ===\nThe [[Attack on Sudbury]] was fought in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]], on April 21, 1676. The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict. Captives who had participated in attacks on the many settlements were hanged, enslaved, or put to [[indentured servitude]], depending upon the colony involved.\n\n=== Battle of Mount Hope ===\n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]]: Father of [[United States Army Ranger|American Rangers]]]]\nMetacomet's allies began to desert him, and more than 400 had surrendered to the colonists by early July. Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He was shot and killed by an Indian named [[John Alderman]] on August 12, 1676.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\"/>{{rp|647}} Metacomet's corpse was beheaded, then [[drawn and quartered]], a traditional treatment of criminals in this time period.

The Countryman Press. 1999. p. 290</ref>\n\nCaptain Church and his soldiers captured Pocasset war chief Anawan on August 28, 1676, at [[Anawan Rock]] in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]]. He was an old man at the time, and a chief captain of [[Metacomet]]. His capture marked the final event in King Philip's War, as he was also beheaded.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Northern Theater (Maine and Acadia) ==\n[[File:Night Attack of Indians.jpg|thumb|right|Indian revenge on [[Richard Waldron]] for his role in King Philip's War, [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1689)]]\nFrench interests in Maine originated in the fur trade and the sale of fish, both to France. The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]]. Skirmishes continued until [[Father Rale's War]], after which the French left Maine.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Kingphilip.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The site of King Philip's death in Miery Swamp on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\n\n=== Southern New England ===\nThe war in southern New England largely ended with Metacomet's death.

About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century.

Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Indian coalition and, by the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed.<ref>{{Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Philips-War| title=King Philip's War BRITISH-NATIVE AMERICAN CONFLICT| last=Warren| first=Jason W.| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope where he was killed by the militia.\n\nThe war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\">{{cite book |last=Drake |first=James David |date=1999 |title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/1 1\u201315] |isbn=1558492240 }}</ref> In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\">{{cite journal| first=Philip| last=Gould| title=Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America| work=Journal of the Early Republic| volume=16| date=Winter 1996|doi=10.2307/3124421}}</ref>{{rp|656}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Schultz| first=Eric B.| author2=Michael J.

The New England colonists faced their enemies without support from any outside government or military, and this began to give them a group identity separate and distinct from Britain.<ref>Lepore (1998), ''The Name of War'' (1999) pp 5-7</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\n[[Plymouth Colony]] was established in 1620 with significant early help from local Indians, particularly [[Squanto]] and Massasoit. Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet. He reported to the governor of [[Plymouth Colony]] that Metacomet planned to gather allies for Indian attacks on widely dispersed colonial settlements.<ref name=Philbrick>{{cite book |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick| year=2006| title=Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War|url=https://archive.org/details/mayflower00nath |url-access=registration | location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]| authorlink=Nathaniel Philbrick}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nMetacomet was brought before a public court, where court officials admitted that they had no proof but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if they had any further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors. A jury that included six Indian elders convicted the men of Sassamon's murder, and they were executed by hanging on June 8, 1675 [[Julian calendar|(O.S.)]], at Plymouth.\n\n==Southern theater, 1675==\n\n=== Raid on Swansea ===\nA band of [[Pokanoket]]s attacked several isolated homesteads in the small Plymouth colony settlement of [[Swansea, Massachusetts|Swansea]] on June 20, 1675.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t5m90c088;view=1up;seq=78| title=The History of King Philip's War| author=Church, Benjamin (1639-1718)| publisher=HathiTrust| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675, near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign. The nearby towns in Rhode Island provided care for the wounded until they could return to their homes.<ref>Leach (1954), ''Flintlock and Tomahawk'', pp. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\n=== Mohawk intervention ===\nIn December 1675, Metacomet established a winter camp in [[Schaghticoke (village), New York|Schaghticoke]], New York.<ref name=\"eric17\">{{cite book|last1=Tougias|first1=Michael|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|date=2017|publisher=Countryman Press|isbn=1581574908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I422DAAAQBAJ&dq}}</ref> His reason for moving into New York has been attributed to a desire to enlist [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] aid in the conflict.<ref name=\"drake\">{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=James|title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676|date=1999|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=1558492240|page=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/122 122]|url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration}}</ref> Though New York was a non-belligerent, Governor [[Edmund Andros]] was nonetheless concerned at the arrival of the Wampanoag sachem.<ref name=\"eric17\"/> Either with Andros' sanction, or of their own accord, the Mohawk\u2014traditional rivals of the Algonquian people\u2014launched a surprise assault against a 500-warrior band under Metacomet's command the following February.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref name=\"drake\"/> The \"ruthless\" ''[[coup de main]]'' resulted in the death of between 70 and as many as 460 of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"barr\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/> His forces crippled, Metacomet withdrew to New England, pursued \"relentlessly\" by Mohawk forces who attacked Algonquian settlements and ambushed their supply parties.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Calloway|first1=Colin|title=After King Philip's War: Presence and Persistence in Indian New England|date=2000|publisher=University Press of New England|isbn=1611680611|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXrgK29zl2QC&dq}}</ref><ref name=\"barr\">{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Daniel|title=Unconquered: The Iroquois League at War in Colonial America|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0275984664|page=[https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73 73]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73}}</ref>\n\nOver the next several months, fear of Mohawk attack led some Wampanoag to surrender to the colonists, and one historian described the decision of the Mohawk to engage Metacomet's forces as \"the blow that lost the war for Philip\".<ref name=\"drake\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/>\n\n===Indian campaign===\nIndians attacked and destroyed more settlements throughout the winter of 1675\u201376 in their effort to annihilate the colonists.

The Connecticut River towns had thousands of acres of cultivated crop land known as the bread basket of New England, but they had to limit their plantings and work in large armed groups for self-protection.<ref name=\"Phelps\">{{cite book| last=Phelps| first=Noah Amherst| title=History of Simsbury, Granby, and Canton; from 1642 to 1845| url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsimsbur00phel| publisher=Press of Case, Tiffany and Burnham| location=[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] |year=1845}}</ref>{{rp|20}} Towns such as [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Hatfield, Massachusetts|Hatfield]], [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]], and [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], fortified themselves, reinforced their militias, and held their ground, though attacked several times. The small towns of [[Northfield, Massachusetts|Northfield]], [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], and several others were abandoned as the surviving settlers retreated to the larger towns. The towns of the Connecticut colony were largely unharmed in the war, although more than 100 Connecticut militia died in their support of the other colonies.\n\n=== Attack on Sudbury ===\nThe [[Attack on Sudbury]] was fought in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]], on April 21, 1676. The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict. Captives who had participated in attacks on the many settlements were hanged, enslaved, or put to [[indentured servitude]], depending upon the colony involved.\n\n=== Battle of Mount Hope ===\n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]]: Father of [[United States Army Ranger|American Rangers]]]]\nMetacomet's allies began to desert him, and more than 400 had surrendered to the colonists by early July. Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He was shot and killed by an Indian named [[John Alderman]] on August 12, 1676.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\"/>{{rp|647}} Metacomet's corpse was beheaded, then [[drawn and quartered]], a traditional treatment of criminals in this time period. His head was displayed in Plymouth for a generation.<ref>Schultz, Eric and Michael Tougias. ''King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict\". The Countryman Press. 1999. p. 290</ref>\n\nCaptain Church and his soldiers captured Pocasset war chief Anawan on August 28, 1676 at [[Anawan Rock]] in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]]. He was an old man at the time, and a chief captain of [[Metacomet]]. His capture marked the final event in King Philip's War, as he was also beheaded.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Northern Theater (Maine and Acadia) ==\n[[File:Night Attack of Indians.jpg|thumb|right|Indian revenge on [[Richard Waldron]] for his role in King Philip's War, [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1689)]]\nFrench interests in Maine originated in the fur trade and the sale of fish, both to France. The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]]. Skirmishes continued until [[Father Rale's War]], after which the French left Maine.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Kingphilip.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The site of King Philip's death in Miery Swamp on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\n\n=== Southern New England ===\nThe war in southern New England largely ended with Metacomet's death.

About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century.

During the 1960s, China Airlines was able to establish its first scheduled routes. In October 1962, a flight from Taipei to [[Hualien City|Hualien]] became the airline's first domestic service.<ref name=history>{{cite web | title= Company History | publisher = China Airlines | url = https://www.china-airlines.com/tw/en/about-us/history | accessdate = 22 December 2016}}</ref> Later, with the introduction of [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] and [[Boeing 727-100]]s, the airlines introduced international flights to [[South Vietnam]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} With the airlines' first two Boeing 707 aircraft, trans-Pacific flights to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] via Tokyo were initiated on 2 February 1970. The expansion of the company's 707 fleet also permitted more services in Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and North America (via Japan and Hawaii). {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== International Expansion (1970\u20131995) ===\nFollowing the standard utilization of the wide-body 747 on the highly profitable Trans-Pacific \u2013 USA routes, China Airlines introduced its first two 747-100s (ex-[[Delta Air Lines]] aircraft) in 1976 and immediately placed them on its Hong Kong-Taipei-Tokyo-Honolulu-Los Angeles route. Shortly thereafter, four brand new Boeing 747SPs (Special Performance) were introduced in 1977. Due to political pressure, Japan ended its diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1972, and all flights between Taiwan and Japan were stopped. The 747SP aircraft made it possible for China Airlines to fly daily nonstop services from Taipei to its North American destinations without stopping over in Japan. It also allowed the airlines to introduce flights to [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[South Africa]]. In 1979, the airlines switched all operations from the smaller [[Taipei Songshan Airport]] to the newly built Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport (now [[Taoyuan International Airport]]). Following the introduction of 747-200s, the airlines introduced its first European destination, Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1978, Japan allowed China Airlines to return to Tokyo International Airport at Haneda after relocating all other airlines at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, leaving China Airlines as the sole international operator at [[Haneda International Airport|Haneda]], which at the time was an exclusive domestic facility, the premise being that air carriers from the [[PRC|PR China]] and Taiwan were prevented from crossing paths at any Japanese airports. Eva Air joined China Airlines later on although both moved to New Tokyo (Now Narita International) with CAL moving on April 18, 2002.\n\nThe next 20 years saw sporadic but far-reaching growth for the company. Later, the airline inaugurated its own round-the-world flight: ([[Taipei]]-[[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]-[[New York City|New York]]-[[Amsterdam]]-[[Dubai]]-Taipei).{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} 1993 saw China Airlines listed on the [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]]. Later CAL would place one of the largest orders for the new Boeing 747-400s. The new 747-400s and an earlier order with [[Airbus]] for over a dozen [[A300B4]] and A300-600Rs wide body regional jets allowed for addition destination growth. During the 1990s, China Airlines also bought the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and had to compete with a new competitor, EVA Air. They also found [[Mandarin Airlines|another airline]] to deal with the PRC-ROC dispute which borrowed aircraft from China Airlines itself.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Boeing 747-409, China Airlines AN0198833.jpg|alt=China Airlines Boeing 747-400 at Los Angeles International Airport (B-162).

As a result, in the mid-1990s, China Airlines subsidiary [[Mandarin Airlines]] took over some of its Sydney and Vancouver international routes. Starting from October 7, 1995, partly as a way to avoid the international controversy, China Airlines unveiled its \"plum blossom\" logo,<ref name=history /> replacing the [[flag of the Republic of China|national flag]], which had previously appeared on the tail fins ([[empennage]]), and the [[aircraft livery]] from the red-white-blue national colors on the fuselage of its aircraft.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/14/news/14iht-tainote_0.html|title=Taipei Notebook : A Flag-Carrier That Won't|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|date=1995-08-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-11|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The plum blossom (''[[Prunus mume]]'') is Taiwan's [[National Flower of the Republic of China|National Flower]].\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the airline employed many ex-ROC Air Force pilots. Due to the company's poor safety record in the 1990s, China Airlines began to change its pilot recruitment practices and the company began to actively recruit civilian-trained pilots with proven track records.  In addition, the company began recruiting university graduates as trainees in its own pilot training program. The company also modified its maintenance and operational procedures. These decisions were instrumental in the company's improved safety record, culminating in the company's recognition by the [[IATA Operational Safety Audit]] (IOSA).<ref>{{Cite press release  | title = China Airlines Once Again Passes Rigorous Safety Audit  | publisher = China Airlines  | date = 2009-03-18  | url = http://www.china-airlines.com/en/newsen/newsen000542.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120228/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/newsen/newsen000542.htm | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | accessdate = 22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:B-18201 B747-400 China Airlines (6340376056).jpg|thumb|left|China Airlines [[Boeing 747-400]] at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] in 2011.]]\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, China Airlines placed orders for various airliners including the [[Airbus A330]], [[Airbus A340]], [[Boeing 737-800]], and the [[Boeing 747-400]] (both the passenger and freighter version).\n\nDue to improving [[cross-strait relations]], the first [[cross-strait charter]] flights between Taiwan and China were introduced in 2003, with China Airlines' flight 585, operated by a Boeing 747-400, being the first Taiwanese flight to legally land in China. (The aircraft took off from [[Taoyuan Airport]], stopped over at [[Hong Kong Airport]], and landed at [[Shanghai Pudong Airport]].) In 2005, the first nonstop cross-strait charter flights were initiated, with China Airlines' flight 581 ([[Taoyuan Airport]] to [[Beijing Capital Airport]]) being the first flight of the program to depart from Taiwan. In 2008, the first regular weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China started operating, with daily charter flights introduced later in the year.

During the 1960s, China Airlines was able to establish its first scheduled routes. In October 1962, a flight from Taipei to [[Hualien City|Hualien]] became the airline's first domestic service.<ref name=history>{{cite web | title= Company History | publisher = China Airlines | url = https://www.china-airlines.com/tw/en/about-us/history | accessdate = 22 December 2016}}</ref> Later, with the introduction of [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] and [[Boeing 727-100]]s, the airlines introduced international flights to [[South Vietnam]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} With the airlines' first two Boeing 707 aircraft, trans-Pacific flights to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] via Tokyo were initiated on 2 February 1970. The expansion of the company's 707 fleet also permitted more services in Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and North America (via Japan and Hawaii). {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== International Expansion (1970\u20131995) ===\nFollowing the standard utilization of the wide-body 747 on the highly profitable Trans-Pacific \u2013 USA routes, China Airlines introduced its first two 747-100s (ex-[[Delta Air Lines]] aircraft) in 1976 and immediately placed them on its Hong Kong-Taipei-Tokyo-Honolulu-Los Angeles route. Shortly thereafter, four brand new Boeing 747SPs (Special Performance) were introduced in 1977. Due to political pressure, Japan ended its diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1972, and all flights between Taiwan and Japan were stopped. The 747SP aircraft made it possible for China Airlines to fly daily nonstop services from Taipei to its North American destinations without stopping over in Japan. It also allowed the airlines to introduce flights to [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[South Africa]]. In 1979, the airlines switched all operations from the smaller [[Taipei Songshan Airport]] to the newly built Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport (now [[Taoyuan International Airport]]). Following the introduction of 747-200s, the airlines introduced its first European destination, Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1978, Japan allowed China Airlines to return to Tokyo International Airport at Haneda after relocating all other airlines at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, leaving China Airlines as the sole international operator at [[Haneda International Airport|Haneda]], which at the time was an exclusive domestic facility, the premise being that air carriers from the [[PRC|PR China]] and Taiwan were prevented from crossing paths at any Japanese airports. Eva Air joined China Airlines later on although both moved to New Tokyo (Now Narita International) with CAL moving on April 18, 2002.\n\nThe next 20 years saw sporadic but far-reaching growth for the company. Later, the airline inaugurated its own round-the-world flight: ([[Taipei]]-[[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]-[[New York City|New York]]-[[Amsterdam]]-[[Dubai]]-Taipei).{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} 1993 saw China Airlines listed on the [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]]. Later CAL would place one of the largest orders for the new Boeing 747-400s. The new 747-400s and an earlier order with [[Airbus]] for over a dozen [[A300B4]] and A300-600Rs wide body regional jets allowed for addition destination growth. During the 1990s, China Airlines also bought the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and had to compete with a new competitor, EVA Air. They also found [[Mandarin Airlines|another airline]] to deal with the PRC-ROC dispute which borrowed aircraft from China Airlines itself.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Boeing 747-409, China Airlines AN0198833.jpg|alt=China Airlines Boeing 747-400 at Los Angeles International Airport (B-162).

As a result, in the mid-1990s, China Airlines subsidiary [[Mandarin Airlines]] took over some of its Sydney and Vancouver international routes. Starting from October 7, 1995, partly as a way to avoid the international controversy, China Airlines unveiled its \"plum blossom\" logo,<ref name=history /> replacing the [[flag of the Republic of China|national flag]], which had previously appeared on the tail fins ([[empennage]]), and the [[aircraft livery]] from the red-white-blue national colors on the fuselage of its aircraft.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/14/news/14iht-tainote_0.html|title=Taipei Notebook : A Flag-Carrier That Won't|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|date=1995-08-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-11|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The plum blossom (''[[Prunus mume]]'') is Taiwan's [[National Flower of the Republic of China|National Flower]].\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the airline employed many ex-ROC Air Force pilots. Due to the company's poor safety record in the 1990s, China Airlines began to change its pilot recruitment practices and the company began to actively recruit civilian-trained pilots with proven track records.  In addition, the company began recruiting university graduates as trainees in its own pilot training program. The company also modified its maintenance and operational procedures. These decisions were instrumental in the company's improved safety record, culminating in the company's recognition by the [[IATA Operational Safety Audit]] (IOSA).<ref>{{Cite press release  | title = China Airlines Once Again Passes Rigorous Safety Audit  | publisher = China Airlines  | date = 2009-03-18  | url = http://www.china-airlines.com/en/newsen/newsen000542.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120228/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/newsen/newsen000542.htm | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | accessdate = 22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:B-18201 B747-400 China Airlines (6340376056).jpg|thumb|left|China Airlines [[Boeing 747-400]] at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] in 2011.]]\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, China Airlines placed orders for various airliners including the [[Airbus A330]], [[Airbus A340]], [[Boeing 737-800]], and the [[Boeing 747-400]] (both the passenger and freighter version).\n\nDue to improving [[cross-strait relations]], the first [[cross-strait charter]] flights between Taiwan and China were introduced in 2003, with China Airlines' flight 585, operated by a Boeing 747-400, being the first Taiwanese flight to legally land in China. (The aircraft took off from [[Taoyuan Airport]], stopped over at [[Hong Kong Airport]], and landed at [[Shanghai Pudong Airport]].) In 2005, the first nonstop cross-strait charter flights were initiated, with China Airlines' flight 581 ([[Taoyuan Airport]] to [[Beijing Capital Airport]]) being the first flight of the program to depart from Taiwan. In 2008, the first regular weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China started operating, with daily charter flights introduced later in the year.

He also said that the Iraqi government believed the fall of Ramadi was due to mismanagement and poor planning by some senior military commanders in charge. General [[Qasem Soleimani]], the head of the elite [[Quds Force]] in [[Iran]]'s [[Revolutionary Guard Corps]] blamed the fall of Ramadi on the US military for its lack of will to fight against the ISIL and support the Iraqi troops against ISIL.

Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for al-Abadi, said his government was surprised by Carter's comments and the whole army should not be judged based on one incident. He also said that the Iraqi government believed the fall of Ramadi was due to mismanagement and poor planning by some senior military commanders in charge. General [[Qasem Soleimani]], the head of the elite [[Quds Force]] in [[Iran]]'s [[Revolutionary Guard Corps]] blamed the fall of Ramadi on the US military for its lack of will to fight against the ISIL and support the Iraqi troops against ISIL. On the same day, Iraqi government vowed to retake Ramadi within days. [[Joe Biden]] assured the Iraqi forces of full support against the ISIL. He also praised the Iraqi troops for fighting against the ISIL in Ramadi and elsewhere. On 18 June 2015, British army's brigadier Christopher Ghiks blamed the loss of Ramadi on the Anbar Operations commander who ordered an unnecessary withdrawal from the city. Staff Major Gen Mohammed Khalaf al-Fahdawi who was the acting head of Anbar Operations Command as the commander had been injured said he could not comment because he did not have permission to speak about the issue. On June 27 in a televised address, the Iraqi Prime Minister criticised his troops saying they made an unauthorised withdrawal from the city and had they resisted instead of withdrawing, the city would not have been lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/25/iraq-iran-push-back-on-us_n_7435130.html|title=Iraq, Iran Hit Back At U.S. After Criticism Over Fall Of Ramadi|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/territory-near-ramadi-seized-isis-pentagon-criticizes-iraqs-will-fight-n363911|title=Territory Near Ramadi Seized From ISIS \u2014 as Pentagon Criticizes Iraq's 'Will to Fight'|work=NBC News|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/iraqi-military-vows-recapture-ramadi-after-ash-carter-criticism-n364106|title=Iraqi Military Vows to Recapture Ramadi After Carter Criticism|work=NBC News|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/25/politics/ash-carter-isis-joe-biden/|title=Joe Biden praises Iraqi military - CNNPolitics.com|author=Kevin Liptak|author2=Barbara Starr|author3=Jim Acosta, CNN|last-author-amp=yes|date=25 May 2015|work=CNN|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/iraqi-commander-who-ordered-troops-to-withdraw-blamed-for-ramadis-fall|title=Iraqi commander who ordered troops to withdraw blamed for Ramadi's fall|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iraq-forces-made-unauthorised-withdrawal-from-ramadi-pm-haider-al-abadi-775920|title=Iraqi Forces Made 'Unauthorised' Withdrawal From Ramadi: PM Haider al-Abadi|date=27 June 2015|work=NDTV.com|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref> On August 16, 2015, he ordered all of the commanders who abandoned their positions to face a court martial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0QL05M20150816|title=Iraq's Abadi orders commanders to face trial over Ramadi withdrawal|author=Ahmed Rasheed|date=16 August 2015|work=Reuters|accessdate=20 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{main|Anbar campaign (2015\u201316)|Battle of Ramadi (2015\u201316)}}\nOn 26 May 2015, pro-government forces in Iraq formally launched an operation to drive Islamic State out of Anbar province. The announcement was made by a spokesman for the Popular Mobilisation. He said the operation would see government troops and militiamen move southwards from Salahuddin province and seek to cut off ISIL militants in Ramadi. Fighting was reported to the south and west of Ramadi as Iraqi government forces tried to cut off supply routes to Ramadi and retook the Al-Taesh area. French Foreign Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] criticised that the Shiite militias were leading the fight and said that Iraq needed to do more to hold up its deal of creating a more inclusive government, which was France's precondition for joining the airstrike campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32882540|title=Iraq starts operation to drive Islamic State from Anbar|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2015/5/26/operation-begins-to-retake-iraqs-anbar-from-is|title=Operation begins to retake Iraq's Anbar from IS|author=AAAJ|author2=agencies|last-author-amp=yes|work=alaraby|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref> On 27 May 2015, pro-government forces took position on the outskirts of the city.

The battle forced ISIL to withdraw from the building, which they had used as a base and pull back into the city. The security forces tightened their stranglehold on Ramadi, from the traffic police building to the west, from the university to the south and from the other sides too.
