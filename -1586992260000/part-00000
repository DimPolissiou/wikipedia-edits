The ballpark serves as the home ballpark for [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB)'s [[Chicago White Sox]]. The facility is owned by the state of Illinois through the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, and is operated by the White Sox. The park opened for the 1991 season, after the White Sox had spent 81 years at the original [[Comiskey Park]]. It also opened with the name '''Comiskey Park''' but was renamed '''U.S. Cellular Field''' in [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003]] after [[U.S. Cellular]] purchased the [[naming rights]] at $68 million over 20 years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Padilla|first=Doug|title=The Cell not in line for name change|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/white-sox/post/_/id/14560/the-cell-not-in-line-for-name-change|publisher=ESPN|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref> The current name was announced on October 31, 2016, after [[Guaranteed Rate]], a private residential mortgage company located in Chicago, purchased the naming rights to the ballpark in a 13-year deal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Merkin|first=Scott|title=U.S. Cellular to become Guaranteed Rate Field|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/197437870/white-sox-ballpark-to-be-guaranteed-rate-field/|publisher=Chicago White Sox|date=August 24, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ecker|first=Danny|title=White Sox home gets a new name: Guaranteed Rate Field|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160824/BLOGS04/160829927/white-sox-home-gets-a-new-name-guaranteed-rate-field|publisher=Crain's Chicago Business|date=August 24, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium is situated just to the west of the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] in Chicago's [[Armour Square, Chicago|Armour Square]] neighborhood, adjacent to the more famous neighborhood of [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]]. It was built directly across 35th Street from old Comiskey Park, which was demolished to make room for a parking lot that serves the venue. Old Comiskey's home plate location is represented by a marble plaque on the sidewalk next to Guaranteed Rate Field and the foul lines are painted in the parking lot. Also, the spectator ramp across 35th Street is designed in such a way (partly curved, partly straight but angling east-northeast) that it echoes the contour of the old first-base grandstand.\n\nThe park was completed at a cost of US$137 million. The current public address announcer is [[Gene Honda]], who also serves as the PA announcer for the Chicago Blackhawks, NCAA Final Four, and University of Illinois Football.\n\n==History==\nThe stadium was the first new major sporting facility built in Chicago since [[Chicago Stadium]] in 1929.  It was also the last one built before the wave of new \"[[baseball park#Retro-classic ballparks|retro-classic]]\" ballparks in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a few design features from old Comiskey Park were retained.  The front facade of the park features arched windows.  Most notable is the \"exploding scoreboard\" which pays homage to the original installed by [[Bill Veeck]] at the old park in 1960. The original field dimensions and seating configuration were very similar to those of Royals Stadium (now [[Kauffman Stadium]]) in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]\u2014which had been the last baseball-only park built in the majors, in 1973.\n\n[[File:New Comiskey Park 1990.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View from the upper deck during construction, September 1990]]\nAs originally built, the park was criticized by many fans because of the height of the upper deck.  The original architect, HOK Sport (now [[Populous (company)|Populous]]), wanted to eliminate the overhang problems present in many stadiums built since the 1970s.  With this in mind, the upper deck was set back over the lower deck, and the stands rose fairly gradually.  While it gave nearly every seat in the upper level an unobstructed view of the field, it also created one of the highest upper decks in baseball. The first row of seats in the upper deck at the new stadium is as far from the field as the highest row of seats in the upper deck at the old stadium. Due to the field being practically at street level, the original upper deck made the park look like a [[cookie-cutter stadium]] from the outside. Fans sitting in this area didn't get much chance for relief, as it is one of the few parks in Major League Baseball that do not allow fans sitting in the upper deck to venture anywhere else in the park, e.g. lower deck concourse.\n\nIn response to fan complaints, the stadium has undergone numerous renovations since the 2001 season in order to retrofit the facility to current architectural trends. These changes have included building a multi-tiered concourse beyond center field, adjusting the fences to make the outfield less symmetrical and, most significantly, the removal of 6,600 seats at the top of the upper deck.\n\nThe uppermost story of the park now has a white and black screen behind the top row of seats and is topped by a flat canopy roof supported by black steel truss supports that obstruct the view of a few seats.  The original blue seats were also replaced by forest green seats. The new green and black color scheme, upper level screen set back from the outer wall and canopy roof are reminiscent of the old Comiskey Park, as well as other classic baseball stadiums. The White Sox have also added murals to the interior concourses, a prominent feature of the old stadium.\n\nThe stadium houses 103 [[luxury suites]] located on two levels, as well as 1,822 \"[[club seating|club seats]]\" on 300-level mezzanine between the lower deck and upper deck. The club seats receive in-seat wait-staff and benefit from an enclosed concourse with multiple television viewing areas and bar-style concessions. The stadium has 400 wheelchair-accessible seats, 38 public [[restrooms]], 12 [[escalators]] and 15 [[elevator]]s.  The new suites were one example of why the old Comiskey Park was demolished, as suites generate more revenue.\n\n==Attractions and features==\n*'''Fan Deck''': A panoramic view of the playing field on the two-tiered Fan Deck atop the center field concession stands. Fan Deck includes catered food and beverage service consisting of chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, hamburgers, potato chips, popcorn, beer, soda, and water. Fan deck can accommodate around 150 people.\n*'''The Goose Island''': A 326-seat section in right field that features running water fixtures on all four sides, individual seating, spaces for group parties and a standing room area where fans can interact near the outfield concourse.

Chicago White Sox, U.S. Cellular Field (Comiskey Park), Chicago, Illinois (9179587177).jpg|right|thumb|Out-of-Town Video board]]\n* About $15 million in renovations were done to Gate 5 (north of 35th Street) to improve access to the park. The demolition (beginning of November 2008) of the easternmost portion of the pedestrian ramp and removal of the top two levels of the eastern-most foot bridge across 35th Street, reducing it to one level with continuing access to the park on the main concourse level. The second foot bridge at Gate 5, about {{convert|75|yd|m}} west of the east bridge, continues to offer access to the park on three levels. The project also included installation of escalators in a new, weather-protected enclosure and installation of elevators which will provide additional access for fans with disabilities. The project was completed by Opening Day on April 7 as the White Sox defeated the [[2009 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 4\u20132.\n* Inside the park, a new scoreboard (23&nbsp;ft x 68&nbsp;ft) with 913,000 LED lights (similar to [[Tropicana Field]]) replaced the older out-of-town scoreboard in right field. In addition to displaying both lineups (that of the Sox and their opponents) the board showed season stats for the current batter and pitcher. It also served as an upgrade to the old \"around-the-league\" scoreboard that it replaced. While the old scoreboard showed only the current innings, scores, and pitchers' jersey numbers, the new board was capable of showing balls, strikes, outs, locations of any baserunners, and the current batter and pitcher by last name instead of by number. A slight disadvantage is that the new board only showed four games at a time in this manner, whereas the old board showed every game in progress simultaneously.\n* A small plaque honoring [[Jim Thome]] located on the center field fan deck for his {{convert|464|foot|adj=on}} home run shot that landed there, becoming the first player ever to do so on June 4, 2008. The White Sox defeated the [[2008 Kansas City Royals season|Royals]] in that game. Thome duplicated this feat again on September 30, 2008 in a one-game playoff against AL Central rival [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. His home run proved to be the game winner in a 1\u20130 shutout to win the AL Central.\n* For White Sox players a new hydrotherapy room with three combinational hot-and-cold whirlpool tubs. An underwater treadmill, that can curb problems relating to the abdominals, back and knee, as well as strengthens the muscles and hip, is installed in one of the tubs.\n* \"The Catch\" was written on the left-center field wall above [[Billy Pierce]]'s image (now above a blank wall), at the location where [[DeWayne Wise]] made a spectacular catch to rob [[Gabe Kapler]] of a 9th-inning home run and preserve [[Mark Buehrle]]'s perfect game on July 23, 2009.\n\n[[File:U.S. Cellular Field Gate 5.jpg|thumb|right|Gate 5 entrance, restaurant & bar]]\n\n====2010\u2013present seasons====\n'''2010 season'''\n* A new outdoor Beer Garden named \"TBD's\" was installed by July 26 (when the White Sox hosted the [[2010 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]]) at Gate 5.

The ballpark serves as the home ballpark for [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB)'s [[Chicago White Sox]]. The facility is owned by the state of Illinois through the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, and is operated by the White Sox. The park opened for the 1991 season, after the White Sox had spent 81 years at the original [[Comiskey Park]]. It also opened with the name '''Comiskey Park''' but was renamed '''U.S. Cellular Field''' in [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003]] after [[U.S. Cellular]] purchased the [[naming rights]] at $68 million over 20 years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Padilla|first=Doug|title=The Cell not in line for name change|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/white-sox/post/_/id/14560/the-cell-not-in-line-for-name-change|publisher=ESPN|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref> The current name was announced on October 31, 2016, after [[Guaranteed Rate]], a private residential mortgage company located in Chicago, purchased the naming rights to the ballpark in a 13-year deal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Merkin|first=Scott|title=U.S. Cellular to become Guaranteed Rate Field|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/197437870/white-sox-ballpark-to-be-guaranteed-rate-field/|publisher=Chicago White Sox|date=August 24, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ecker|first=Danny|title=White Sox home gets a new name: Guaranteed Rate Field|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160824/BLOGS04/160829927/white-sox-home-gets-a-new-name-guaranteed-rate-field|publisher=Crain's Chicago Business|date=August 24, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium is situated just to the west of the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] in Chicago's [[Armour Square, Chicago|Armour Square]] neighborhood, adjacent to the more famous neighborhood of [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]]. It was built directly across 35th Street from old Comiskey Park, which was demolished to make room for a parking lot that serves the venue. Old Comiskey's home plate location is represented by a marble plaque on the sidewalk next to Guaranteed Rate Field and the foul lines are painted in the parking lot. Also, the spectator ramp across 35th Street is designed in such a way (partly curved, partly straight but angling east-northeast) that it echoes the contour of the old first-base grandstand.\n\nThe park was completed at a cost of US$137 million. The current public address announcer is [[Gene Honda]], who also serves as the PA announcer for the Chicago Blackhawks, NCAA Final Four, and University of Illinois Football.\n\n==History==\nThe stadium was the first new major sporting facility built in Chicago since [[Chicago Stadium]] in 1929.  It was also the last one built before the wave of new \"[[baseball park#Retro-classic ballparks|retro-classic]]\" ballparks in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a few design features from old Comiskey Park were retained.  The front facade of the park features arched windows.  Most notable is the \"exploding scoreboard\" which pays homage to the original installed by [[Bill Veeck]] at the old park in 1960. The original field dimensions and seating configuration were very similar to those of Royals Stadium (now [[Kauffman Stadium]]) in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]\u2014which had been the last baseball-only park built in the majors, in 1973.\n\n[[File:New Comiskey Park 1990.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View from the upper deck during construction, September 1990]]\nAs originally built, the park was criticized by many fans because of the height of the upper deck.  The original architect, HOK Sport (now [[Populous (company)|Populous]]), wanted to eliminate the overhang problems present in many stadiums built since the 1970s.  With this in mind, the upper deck was set back over the lower deck, and the stands rose fairly gradually.  While it gave nearly every seat in the upper level an unobstructed view of the field, it also created one of the highest upper decks in baseball. The first row of seats in the upper deck at the new stadium is as far from the field as the highest row of seats in the upper deck at the old stadium. Due to the field being practically at street level, the original upper deck made the park look like a [[cookie-cutter stadium]] from the outside. Fans sitting in this area didn't get much chance for relief, as it is one of the few parks in Major League Baseball that do not allow fans sitting in the upper deck to venture anywhere else in the park, e.g. lower deck concourse.\n\nIn response to fan complaints, the stadium has undergone numerous renovations since the 2001 season in order to retrofit the facility to current architectural trends. These changes have included building a multi-tiered concourse beyond center field, adjusting the fences to make the outfield less symmetrical and, most significantly, the removal of 6,600 seats at the top of the upper deck.\n\nThe uppermost story of the park now has a white and black screen behind the top row of seats and is topped by a flat canopy roof supported by black steel truss supports that obstruct the view of a few seats.  The original blue seats were also replaced by forest green seats. The new green and black color scheme, upper level screen set back from the outer wall and canopy roof are reminiscent of the old Comiskey Park, as well as other classic baseball stadiums. The White Sox have also added murals to the interior concourses, a prominent feature of the old stadium.\n\nThe stadium houses 103 [[luxury suites]] located on two levels, as well as 1,822 \"[[club seating|club seats]]\" on 300-level mezzanine between the lower deck and upper deck. The club seats receive in-seat wait-staff and benefit from an enclosed concourse with multiple television viewing areas and bar-style concessions. The stadium has 400 wheelchair-accessible seats, 38 public [[restrooms]], 12 [[escalators]] and 15 [[elevator]]s.

Chicago White Sox, U.S. Cellular Field (Comiskey Park), Chicago, Illinois (9179587177).jpg|right|thumb|Out-of-Town Video board]]\n* About $15 million in renovations were done to Gate 5 (north of 35th Street) to improve access to the park. The demolition (beginning of November 2008) of the easternmost portion of the pedestrian ramp and removal of the top two levels of the eastern-most foot bridge across 35th Street, reducing it to one level with continuing access to the park on the main concourse level. The second foot bridge at Gate 5, about {{convert|75|yd|m}} west of the east bridge, continues to offer access to the park on three levels. The project also included installation of escalators in a new, weather-protected enclosure and installation of elevators which will provide additional access for fans with disabilities. The project was completed by Opening Day on April 7 as the White Sox defeated the [[2009 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 4\u20132.\n* Inside the park, a new scoreboard (23&nbsp;ft x 68&nbsp;ft) with 913,000 LED lights (similar to [[Tropicana Field]]) replaced the older out-of-town scoreboard in right field. In addition to displaying both lineups (that of the Sox and their opponents) the board showed season stats for the current batter and pitcher. It also served as an upgrade to the old \"around-the-league\" scoreboard that it replaced. While the old scoreboard showed only the current innings, scores, and pitchers' jersey numbers, the new board was capable of showing balls, strikes, outs, locations of any baserunners, and the current batter and pitcher by last name instead of by number. A slight disadvantage is that the new board only showed four games at a time in this manner, whereas the old board showed every game in progress simultaneously.\n* A small plaque honoring [[Jim Thome]] located on the center field fan deck for his {{convert|464|foot|adj=on}} home run shot that landed there, becoming the first player ever to do so on June 4, 2008.

Thome duplicated this feat again on September 30, 2008 in a one-game playoff against AL Central rival [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. His home run proved to be the game winner in a 1\u20130 shutout to win the AL Central.\n* For White Sox players a new hydrotherapy room with three combinational hot-and-cold whirlpool tubs.

Capital punishment has only been imposed twice in the history of the state and is only to be handed out for crimes committed during war time, such as [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], crimes against the Jewish people, [[treason]], and certain crimes under [[military law]].\n\nIsrael inherited the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] code of law, which included the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for several offenses, but in 1954 Israel abolished the penalty for murder. Although a legal option under law, Israel does not use the death penalty. The last execution was carried out in 1962, when [[Holocaust]] architect [[Adolf Eichmann]] was hanged for genocide and crimes against humanity. The last death sentence in Israel was handed down in 1988, when [[John Demjanjuk]] was sentenced to death for war crimes and crimes against humanity; his sentence (and conviction) was subsequently overturned. No death sentences have been sought by Israeli prosecutors since the 1990s.\n\n==History==\nIsrael's rare use of the death penalty may in part be due to [[Religion and capital punishment#Judaism|Jewish religious law]].<ref>Mishnah Makot 1:10</ref> [[Biblical law]] explicitly mandates the death penalty for 36 offenses, from [[murder]] and [[adultery]] to [[idolatry]] and desecration of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].

[[Moses Maimonides]] argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely \"according to the judge's caprice\".

The first death sentences imposed by an Israeli civil court, against two Arabs who had been found guilty of murder, were confirmed by an appeals court in November 1949, but the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment by President [[Chaim Weizmann]], due to his opposition to the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=WV643k%2FWpfocKmYPSyqWXo0VDhgU8zo7EYDqG1GSYrhW8E8UvLSAWiyCdmubomgEYw%3D%3D&mode=image&href=MAR%2f1961%2f02%2f17&page=23&rtl=true|title = \u05de\u05d9\u05ea\u05ea\u05be\u05ea\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\" \u2013 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e3 \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d8\u05dc\"|last = Shaul|first = Hon|date = 1961-02-17|work = |access-date = 2015-07-16|via = |trans-title = \"Bed of hanging\" \u2013 the clause which was cancelled was renewed|page = 23|newspaper = [[Maariv]]|language = Hebrew}}</ref> The Israeli cabinet first considered abolishing the death penalty in July 1949.\n\nIn 1950, seven convicted murderers were on death row in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3339783,00.html|title=\u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea|first=\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05df|last=\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05de\u05df|date=14 December 2006|publisher=|via=Ynet}}</ref> In 1951 the Israeli cabinet again proposed that the death penalty be abolished.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.jta.org/1951/10/30/archive/abolition-of-death-penalty-in-israel-proposed-by-cabinet|title = Abolition of Death Penalty in Israel Proposed by Cabinet|last = |first = |date = 1951-10-30|work = |access-date = |via = |newspaper = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|quote = The Israel Cabinet last night decided to submit to the Parliament a law proposing abolition of the death penalty.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.jta.org/1953/12/17/archive/israel-will-not-carry-out-death-sentences-immediately|title = Israel Will Not Carry out Death Sentences Immediately|last = |first = |date = 1953-12-17|work = |access-date = 2015-07-16|via = |newspaper = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|quote = The Israel Government has no intention of proceeding at this time with execution of death penalties, Minister of Justice Pinhas Rosen told Parliament\u2019s legal committee tonight in a statement [...]}}</ref> In 1952, the first death sentence for Nazi war crimes under the Nazi Collaborators' Law was imposed on Yechezkel Ingster, who was convicted of torturing and beating other Jews as a [[kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]], but the court also recommended that the death sentence be commuted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1952/01/07/archive/first-israeli-sentenced-to-death-for-torturing-nazi-victims|title=First Israeli Sentenced to Death for Torturing Nazi Victims|publisher=}}</ref> The sentence was commuted to two years' imprisonment.

Sprang started river running in 1951, the year he and Lora divorced.

In 1956, he and Duddy moved to [[Wayne County, Utah]], where they ran cattle on a {{convert|150|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} ranch.
