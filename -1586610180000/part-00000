The club currently play in [[Midlands Premier]]; at the fifth tier of the [[English rugby union system]], following their relegation from [[National League 2 South]] at the end of the 2017-18 season. The 2014\u201315 season was the third time the club had played in the fourth tier of English rugby (having progressed through the [[Rugby Football Union Midland Division]]), but the first time it had maintained at that level. Furthermore, the club have also recently enjoyed plenty of success, by winning the Warwickshire Cup (for a record thirteen times).\n\nTheir home ground is The [[Ivor Preece Field]], named in honour of former President [[Ivor Preece]] which was opened in Coventry in 2002. Their previous ground from 1973 to 2002 was located on Brandon Road, Coventry. Before that the club played at the Henley Road ground where the club still have an active social club with over three-hundred members.\n\n==History==\nThe Broad Street Old Boys' Rugby Club was founded in 1929 by former and current pupils of the Broad Street School in Broad Street, [[Foleshill]], Coventry. The club's history goes back even further to when Broad Street School was opened in 1911. It was many years later that the club decided drop the ''\"old boys'\"'' title and merge the two words to become one and known as Broadstreet Rugby Club.\n\nIt was after winning the Coventry FC Shield in 1929 the old boys' club was formed with the help of the school sports master 'Pop' H T Suddens. With seven former schoolboy internationals, it was a formidable team. In fact, the school went on to have twenty-two schoolboy England players and three senior England players, [[Ivor Preece]], Ernie Robinson and [[Phil Judd (rugby union)|Phil Judd]] who went on to captain England in 1967.\n\nWhen the \u2018Old Boys\u2019 was formed, a farmer\u2019s field at Bedlam Lane was the home ground and this was used until after the [[Second World War]]. After the war, the club rented grounds in various parts of [[Coventry]], eventually using the [[War Memorial Park, Coventry]] as its base until the 1950s. A site for a new ground was purchased in Henley Road from a Colonel Bushill in the early 1950s. Raising the money to purchase the ground and to build the clubhouse was an enormous task, but it was a very proud day for all involved at the time, when Cliff Harrison, President of the [[Warwickshire]] RFU, opened the club in 1955.\n\nOver the next few years the club extended, but it became obvious that the facilities at Henley Road were no longer large enough to cope with the number of teams that we regularly playing, and in 1970 the club entered into an agreement with Alf Youell of Youell Investments, to sell only the pitches at Henley Road, and to move to a new ground and clubhouse at Brandon Road.\n\nThe new ground was opened in 1973 by Bob Weighhill, Secretary of the [[Rugby Football Union]], and it was named the [[Ivor Preece Field]], in honour of [[Ivor Preece]], [[England Rugby|England]] and [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]], who was also the club's President at the time. The club retained the Henley Road clubhouse still run it as a social club with over three hundred members.\n\nOnce again, the club outgrew the facilities at the Brandon Road ground, and have now moved to the other side of the Coventry Eastern Bypass, to the new [[Ivor Preece Field]]. Alf Youell was also heavily involved in this move, along with [[Persimmon Homes]], the purchasers of our previous ground. The new ground was opened by the great  [[Rugby World Cup]] winning captain [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)]], captain of [[England national rugby union team]], The [[British and Irish Lions]], and [[Leicester Tigers]]. The new clubhouse has facilities, a 250-seater stand, car parking, five senior pitches, (two floodlit), mini and junior pitches, and forty-six acres of ground. The Ivor Preece field is used for representative rugby with the semi finals of the [[Daily Mail schools rugby competition]] played at both age groups here. England Deaf Rugby use the rugby facilities for training sessions and international matches and [[Wasps RFC|Wasps]] currently train there. \n\nBroadstreet Rugby Football club regard themselves as one of the top fifty clubs in [[England]]. The club regularly field five senior sides and one colts team during the season. At under-age level, the club run one of the most successful Mini and Junior sections in the country, with over two-hundred boys and girls of all ages being coached by a band of qualified{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} coaches.\n\n==Summary of league positions==\nAfter the use of Merit tables for the prior three seasons, in 1987 the RFU implemented a National League system.

Leukodystrophies affect the growth and/or development of [[myelin]], the fatty covering which acts as an insulator around [[nerve]] fibers throughout the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[nervous system]]s. MLD involves [[cerebroside|cerebroside sulfate]] accumulation.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000954238|metachromatic leukodystrophy}}</ref><ref name=FA>{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Tao|last2=Bhushan|first2=Vikas|last3=Hofmann |first3=Jeffrey|title=First Aid for the USMLE Step 1|year=2012|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|page=117}}</ref> Metachromatic leukodystrophy, like most enzyme deficiencies, has an [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance pattern.<ref name=\"FA\"/>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nLike many other genetic disorders that affect lipid metabolism, there are several forms of MLD, which are late [[infantile]], [[Child|juvenile]], and adult.\n\n* In the ''late infantile form'', which is the most common form of MLD (50\u201360%), affected children begin having difficulty walking after the first year of life, usually at 15\u201324 months. Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, [[muscle rigidity]], developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, [[convulsions]], impaired swallowing, [[paralysis]], and [[dementia]]. Children may become [[coma]]tose. Untreated, most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner.\n* Children with the ''juvenile form'' of MLD (onset between 3 and 10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression. Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset although some patients can live for several decades  after onset.\n* The ''adult form'' commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents  as a [[psychiatric]] disorder or progressive dementia. Adult-onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms, with a protracted course of a decade or more.\n\nPalliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves quality of life and longevity.\n\nCarriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population (\"normal\" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide.\n\n== Causes ==\n[[File:Inborn errors of metabolism.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the disrupted pathway]]\nMLD is directly caused by a deficiency of the enzyme [[arylsulfatase A]]<ref name=\"pmid15720392\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Poeppel P, Habetha M, Marc\u00e3o A, B\u00fcssow H, Berna L, Gieselmann V |title=Missense mutations as a cause of metachromatic leukodystrophy, Degradation of arylsulfatase A in the endoplasmic reticulum |journal=FEBS J. |volume=272 |issue=5 |pages=1179\u201388 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15720392 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04553.x}}</ref> (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls.<ref name=\"Fluharty2006\">Fluharty, Arvan. \"Arylsulfatase A Deficiency: Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, ARSA Deficiency\".

The myelin sheath is a fatty covering that protects nerve fibers.

Also, consult the MLD genetics page at  MLD Foundation. [revise or delete]''\n\n==Diagnosis==\nClinical examination and MRI are often the first steps in a MLD diagnosis.  MRI can be indicative of MLD, but is not adequate as a confirming test.\n\nAn ARSA-A enzyme level blood test with a confirming urinary sulfatide test is the best biochemical test for MLD.  The confirming urinary sulfatide is important to distinguish between MLD and pseudo-MLD blood results.\n\nGenomic sequencing may also confirm MLD, however, there are likely more mutations than the over 200 already known to cause MLD that are not yet ascribed to MLD that cause MLD so in those cases a biochemical test is still warranted.\n\n''For further information, see the [http://mldfoundation.org/mld-101-testing.php MLD Testing]  page at  MLD Foundation.''\n\n== Treatment ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}} \nThere is currently no therapy or cure for MLD in late infantile patients displaying symptoms, or for juvenile and adult onset with advanced symptoms. These patients typically receive clinical treatment focused on pain and symptom management.\n\nPre-symptomatic late infantile MLD patients, as well as those with juvenile or adult MLD that are either presymptomatic or displaying mild symptoms, can consider  [[bone marrow transplantation]] (including [[stem cell transplantation]]), which may slow down progression of the disease in the central nervous system. However, results in the peripheral nervous system have been less dramatic, and the long-term results of these therapies have been mixed. Recent success has involved stem cells being taken from the bone marrow of children with the disorder and infecting the cells with a [[retrovirus|retro-virus]], replacing the stem cells' mutated gene with the repaired gene before re-injecting it back into the patient where they multiplied. The children by the age of five were all in good condition and going to kindergarten when normally by this age, children with the disease can not even speak.<ref name=\"pmid23845948\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Biffi A, Montini E, Lorioli L, et al. |title=Lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy benefits metachromatic leukodystrophy |journal=Science |volume=341 |issue=6148 |pages=1233158 |year=2013 |pmid=23845948 |doi=10.1126/science.1233158 |url=https://www.openaccessrepository.it/record/23020}}</ref>\n\nSeveral therapy options are currently being investigated using clinical trials primarily in late infantile patients.

Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, [[muscle rigidity]], developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, [[convulsions]], impaired swallowing, [[paralysis]], and [[dementia]]. Children may become [[coma]]tose. Untreated, most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner.\n* Children with the ''juvenile form'' of MLD (onset between 3 and 10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression. Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset although some patients can live for several decades  after onset.\n* The ''adult form'' commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents  as a [[psychiatric]] disorder or progressive dementia. Adult-onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms, with a protracted course of a decade or more.\n\nPalliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves quality of life and longevity.\n\nCarriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population (\"normal\" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide.\n\n== Causes ==\n[[File:Inborn errors of metabolism.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the disrupted pathway]]\nMLD is directly caused by a deficiency of the enzyme [[arylsulfatase A]]<ref name=\"pmid15720392\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Poeppel P, Habetha M, Marc\u00e3o A, B\u00fcssow H, Berna L, Gieselmann V |title=Missense mutations as a cause of metachromatic leukodystrophy, Degradation of arylsulfatase A in the endoplasmic reticulum |journal=FEBS J. |volume=272 |issue=5 |pages=1179\u201388 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15720392 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04553.x}}</ref> (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls.<ref name=\"Fluharty2006\">Fluharty, Arvan. \"Arylsulfatase A Deficiency: Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, ARSA Deficiency\".

MRI can be indicative of MLD, but is not adequate as a confirming test.\n\nAn ARSA-A enzyme level blood test with a confirming urinary sulfatide test is the best biochemical test for MLD.  The confirming urinary sulfatide is important to distinguish between MLD and pseudo-MLD blood results.\n\nGenomic sequencing may also confirm MLD, however, there are likely more mutations than the over 200 already known to cause MLD that are not yet ascribed to MLD that cause MLD so in those cases a biochemical test is still warranted.\n\n''For further information, see the [http://mldfoundation.org/mld-101-testing.php MLD Testing]  page at  MLD Foundation.''\n\n== Treatment ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}} \nThere is currently no therapy or cure for MLD in late infantile patients displaying symptoms, or for juvenile and adult onset with advanced symptoms.

However, results in the peripheral nervous system have been less dramatic, and the long-term results of these therapies have been mixed. Recent success has involved stem cells being taken from the bone marrow of children with the disorder and infecting the cells with a [[retrovirus|retro-virus]], replacing the stem cells' mutated gene with the repaired gene before re-injecting it back into the patient where they multiplied.

Reigning from 1657 to 1687, he left Tidore's old alliance with the [[Spanish Empire]] and made treaties with the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), which now became hegemonic in Maluku for the next century. Tidore was forced to extirpate the [[cloves|clove trees]] in its territory and thus ceased to be a spice Sultanate. In spite of this, Saifuddin and his successors were able to preserve a degree of independence due to the trade in products from the [[Raja Ampat|Papuan Islands]] and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 170-5.</ref>\n\n==Early years, exile and comeback==\n\nKaicili (prince) Golofino was a son of Sultan [[Gorontalo of Tidore]]. Although he had a brother Kaicili Gorian (Goranja) who was his senior, he stands out as the active representative of this branch of the royal family.<ref>Muridan Widjojo (2009) ''The revolt of Prince Nuku: Cross-cultural alliance-making in Maluku, c. 1780-1810''. Leiden: Brill, p. 40.</ref> When his father was murdered by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] authorities in 1639 for treasonous conduct, Golofino tried to be acknowledged, opposing the Spanish candidate [[Saidi of Tidore|Saidi]].<ref>W.P. Coolhaas, ed. (1964) ''Generale missiven van Gouverneurs-Generaal en Raden aan Heren XVII der Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', Deel II. 's-Gravenhage: M. Nijhoff, p. 105.</ref> However, he had to give up the attempt in 1640 and sought refuge in the [[Sultanate of Ternate]], which was closely allied with the VOC. The Dutch tried to impose a monopoly on the spice trade after 1652 by forcing dependent territories to extirpate clove trees outside the [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] Quarter. Since Tidore produced large amounts of cloves and was formally a vassal under the [[King of Spain]] the monopoly was still imperfect, and a VOC-Tidore war in 1653-1654 was inconclusive. In January 1657, however, Sultan Saidi passed away and his son Kaicili Weda prepared to succeed him. Now the Governor of Ternate, Simon Cos, and the Ternatan Sultan [[Mandar Syah]] brought forward Golofino as candidate, assisting his party with munitions and soldiers. Golofino soon gained the upper hand and was enthroned as the new Sultan of Tidore under the name Saifuddin.<ref>W.P. Coolhaas, ed.

However, their position was too precarious to undertake anything against Saifuddin or the VOC.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1981) \"The 'Discurso politico del gobierno Maluco' of Fr. Francisco Comb\u00e9s and its historical impact\", ''Philippine Studies'' 29, p. 333.</ref> At his accession, Saifuddin made a treaty with the Company where he promised to eradicate the spice trees in his realm, something that he actually took care to carry out. The new Sultan also took care to eliminate potential opponents. This included the ''jojau'' (first minister) who supposedly colluded with the Spanish to get rid of Saifuddin, and the ''kapita laut'' (sea lord) who was accused of witchcraft.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 170-1.</ref>\n\nIn the meantime the Spanish authorities in the [[Philippines]] found that they had limited use of the possessions in Maluku. The economic advantages were small and there was no opportunity to disseminate the Catholic creed in the lands of the staunchly Islamic Sultan of Tidore.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1981).</ref> This was coupled with administrative mismanagement where the captains wielded arbitrary power that caused many desertions of Spanish soldiers to the Dutch. In 1662, finally, the Governor in [[Manila]] decided to withdraw the garrisons from Ternate and Tidore. The soldiers were needed closer at home in case the Chinese-Japanese pirate lord [[Koxinga]] invaded the [[Spanish Philippines]]. The withdrawal took place in 1663, but the fortifications were dismantled in 1666. Ten fortresses were razed together with churches and other buildings. The Spanish captain-general left a note to the VOC governor where he asserted that King [[Charles II of Spain]] still kept  \"dominion and overlordship\" over Maluku, though this turned out to be a vain gesture.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 155-6.</ref>\n\n==Formal rights to Papua==\n\nWith the coming of a VOC-friendly Sultan, the Dutch found the time ripe to arrange a treaty between the three [[North Maluku|North Malukan]] Sultanates, Tidore, [[Ternate]] and [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] in 1660. In theory, this ended the centuries-long rivalry between Tidore and Ternate, though it would soon reappear. In the treaty the vassals of the Sultans were laid down. Under Tidore were places at or adjacent to [[Halmahera]], namely Toniu, Kayassa, Yodi, Sasi, Maidi, Waunua, Goroa, Toia, [[Weda]], [[Maba]], Saffora, and [[Morotai]], as well as the lands of the [[Papuan people|Papuans]], \"or all their islands\".<ref>A.

[https://archive.org/details/nederlandschnie01wetegoog/page/n132/mode/2up]</ref> The Dutch thus legally acknowledged Tidorese rule in the [[New Guinea]] quarters, though they had little concrete knowledge of conditions there. Not even Saifuddin himself seems to have had a very clear idea how far his territory in New Guinea extended. This was complemented by another treaty in 1667 that reaffirmed the close alliance with the VOC and granted the Tidorese the exclusive rights to sail to the waters of Papua.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 172.</ref>\n\nThe Halmaheran and Papuan areas became economically important for Tidore, which had lost the [[sago]]-producing Payahe area in Halmahera in the war in 1649. This and other losses made Tidore look for supplies further to the east. There were sago-rich areas in Gamrange in south-eastern Halmahera,<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 170.</ref> while the Papuan areas provided sea and forest products and slaves. Among the valuable items brought from the far east of Saifuddin's realm were decorous sea-shells, large pearls, [[ambergris]] and [[Bird of paradise (bird)|birds of paradise]], all of which had a European market.<ref>Willard A.

Unlike the Ternatan counterpart, however, he did not try to disrupt traditional institutions in order to concentrate his personal powers. Rather, he shored up popular support by displays of liberality and generosity, distributing wealth among the chiefs (Bobatos). He also made repeated suggestions to the Dutch authorities to reinstall the long-vanished [[Jailolo]] Sultanate in order to revert to the traditional quadripartition of Maluku. This was also a way to weaken Ternate's power.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 171-3.</ref> However, the last Jailolo heir Kaicili Alam died in 1684 without being installed.<ref>W.P.

's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. 794.[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/retroboeken/generalemissiven/#page=808&accessor=toc&source=4]</ref> Moreover, Saifuddin sided with the VOC when Sultan [[Sibori Amsterdam]] launched an anti-Dutch rebellion in 1679\u20131681, and assisted the Europeans with soldiers and ships to crush the uprising.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 184-5.</ref> While the defeated Ternate had to sign a treaty that transformed it into a formal vassal (''leen''), Tidore preserved its independence under Dutch protection for another century, strengthened by the economic redistribution system with Halmahera and Papua. However, the VOC denied him the rights to eastern [[Ceram Island|Ceram]] and Ceram Laut, commercially vibrant areas which had been held or claimed by previous Tidore Sultans.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 190.</ref>\n\nPersonally, Saifuddin was regarded an expert in Malukan tradition who had a great respect for the ways of the ancestors and tried to order his kingdom according to this. In this he was relatively successful and was seen as a highly efficacious ruler. In spite of keeping a partly Spanish demeanor, he was a strongly Islamic figure known for his poetical and mystical speeches in the mosque.<ref>Willad A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 180.</ref> He contracted [[leprocy]] after some years, but continued to govern his kingdom, communicating with official through the wall of an incense-filled room. He is one of the first Indonesian rulers of whom a painted portrait is preserved (at the [[Czartoryski Museum]], [[Krakow]]), where signs of the sickness can be seen. He was pushed to install his son Kaicili Seram (Hamza Faharuddin) as formal ruler though he continued to handle the important issues.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 173.</ref> Seram married a daughter of [[Mandar Syah]] of Ternate who had previously been the wife of the Jailolo heir Kaicili Alam, thus seemingly binding the two kingdoms; however the princess soon returned to Ternate.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 22.</ref>\n\n==Death and family==\n\nSultan Saifuddin passed away on 2 October 1687, after permitting his co-wives who had not borne children to return to their respective families.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 173; the date of his death is often erroneously given as 1689.</ref> Two years later he was succeeded by Hamza Faharuddin, formally Sultan since 1674, in a regular way.

The company headquarters are situated in [[Greenock]], [[Inverclyde]].<ref name=companySC027238>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/SC027238 Companies House extract company no SC027238] McGill's Bus Service Limited</ref> The present company was founded in July 2001, restoring the name of a previous operator which had existed between 1933 and 1997. However, there is no connection between the two companies other than their names. The company has grown from an initial fleet of 33 vehicles to operate a network of routes covering much of Inverclyde, [[East Renfrewshire]], [[Renfrewshire]], [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Glasgow|Glasgow City]], and [[North Ayrshire]]. A second depot in Barrhead was opened in 2008 but has now closed. Four independent operators were taken over by McGill's in the following three years. McGill's has several depots in [[Greenock]], [[Coatbridge]], [[Inchinnan]], and [[Johnstone]].\n\nMcGill's took over the surviving operations of [[Arriva Scotland West]] in a \u00a310 million deal; this was completed on 26 March 2012, and the company now operates over 450 buses and around 100 routes and employs over 1000 members of staff. Further expansion followed in 2012 and in 2013. McGill's Coaches also bought Henderson Travel after it suddenly ceased business in October 2014, and subsequently took over the company's fleet and service routes which has resulted in the company expanding in North Lanarkshire and becoming the dominant operator in the [[Monklands (district)|Monklands]] area by early 2016.\n\nMcGills is the largest independent bus operator in Scotland,<ref name=\"Mcgillsbuses.co.uk\"/> as well as being named a Scottish Insider top 500 company in January 2016, coming in at 350th place.<ref name=\"Mcgillsbuses.co.uk\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory and early years (1933-2004)===\nThe name \"McGill's Bus Services\" first came into use in 1933. This company was based in [[Barrhead]] and was owned by the McGill family. It expanded significantly during the years leading up to bus deregulation, but in July 1997, sold out to the major operator in the area, [[Arriva Scotland West|Clydeside 2000]], in the face of significant competition from independent minibus operators. McGill's initially retained its identity, but was later rebranded as [[Arriva Scotland West]]. Another company, [[Greenock]] based Ashton Coaches (trading as GMS), was also acquired by Clydeside in the same month.<ref name=BusesMay11>{{cite journal|last=Millar|first=Alan|title=McGill's: Growing fast by quality|journal=[[Buses Magazine|Buses]]|issue=624|date=May 2011|pages=36\u201339}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2001, Arriva decided to withdraw from its [[Inverclyde]] operations, which were loss-making and was facing significant competition from independent operators. Its Greenock depot was sold to former GMS owner Alex Kean and the Easdale family with each owning 50%. Arriva had retained a separate operating licence for McGill's, and this was used as the basis for the sale.<ref name=companySC027238/> The McGill's Bus Services name was revived by the new company and a new livery of blue, white, and gold was introduced. The fleet initially consisted of 33 [[Mercedes-Benz buses|Mercedes-Benz]] minibuses hired from Arriva; services were operated from a large depot on the Easdale Industrial Estate.<ref name=BusesMay11/>\n\nEarly in its existence the new company began operating services in competition with Harte Buses, and in September 2004 Harte withdrew from two routes leaving McGill's as the sole operator. In October 2004, Kean sold his shares in the company to the Easdale family, who quickly replaced the hired minibuses with new low-floor vehicles, leading to increases in passenger numbers.<ref name=BusesMay11/>\n\n===Consolidation & expansion (2005-2015)===\nBetween 2005 and 2008, McGill's introduced a number of new longer-distance routes connecting Inverclyde and [[Glasgow]] to [[Largs]], and in May 2005, began operating a series of day excursions branded as Smoothiecruisers.<ref name=BusesMay11/> In July 2008, McGill's purchased the stage carriage routes and goodwill of four routes centred on Greenock which had previously been run by Slaemuir Coaches.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://inverclydenow.com/index.php/news/local/866-mcgills-acquire-port-glasgow-routes |title=McGill's Acquire Port Glasgow Routes |publisher=inverclydenow.com |date=16 July 2008}}</ref> In the same month, the firm established a second depot in Barrhead on the site of the garage used by the original McGill's Bus Services, which had been vacated by Arriva in 2002.\n\nThe new operation traded as United Buses using Greenock and District Omnibuses'<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/SC211163 Companies House extract company no SC0211163] Greenock and District Omnibus Limited</ref> 'o' licence with vehicles on hire from ABC Taxis,<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/SC215370 Companies House extract company no SC215370] ABC Taxis (Inverclyde) Limited</ref> which also had an 'o' licence, and capitalised on the revocation of the operating licences held by local operator John Walker to move onto four routes previously served by his group of companies.\n\nTwenty step-entrance buses were initially used, but these were largely replaced by low-floor vehicles after four months. The United name was replaced by that of McGill's in September 2009; the same month saw the company introducing the express service X23 between Glasgow and [[Erskine]]. By the beginning of 2010, McGill's had become the largest independent bus operator in Scotland, and the fourth largest operator of any type.<ref name=BusesMay11/>\n\nA new service linking Greenock and [[Larkfield, Greenock|Larkfield]] was introduced in early 2010 to replace a route withdrawn by Wilson's Coaches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://inverclydenow.com/index.php/news/local/1751-bus-operators-network-expands-again |title=Bus Operator's Network Expands Again|publisher=inverclydenow.com|date=16 October 2009}}</ref> May 2010 saw McGill's expand its services from [[Dunoon]] and Greenock to Braehead to cover for the withdrawal of Harte Buses' Braehead Express.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://inverclydenow.com/index.php/news/local/2126-braehead-bus-changes|title=Braehead Bus Changes|publisher=inverclydenow.com|date=23 May 2010}}</ref> In July 2010, the company was fined \u00a360,000 by the [[Traffic commissioner|Traffic Commissioner]] for failing to operate some services as timetabled, although it was permitted to expand its fleet from 110 to 150 vehicles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.buteman.co.uk/news/local-headlines/bus_firm_is_fined_for_timetable_breaches_1_369511|title=Bus firm is fined for timetable breaches|work=[[The Buteman]]|date=7 July 2010}}</ref> The Smoothiecrusisers network was withdrawn in August 2010.<ref name=BusesMay11/>\n\nThe company acquired the operations and vehicles of large independent operator Gibson's Direct in September 2010, expanding the size of its fleet by around 70%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://inverclydenow.com/index.php/news/local/3201-bus-company-gets-bigger|title=Bus Company Gets Bigger|publisher=inverclydenow.com|date=4 September 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=4450&categoryid=0 McGill's expands in Renfreshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004234911/http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=4450&categoryid=0 |date=4 October 2013 }} busandcoach.com 6 September 2010</ref> In February 2011, two small operators based in the Paisley area, Fairway Coaches and Travel Direct, were purchased by McGill's, although no vehicles were acquired.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/mcgills_snaps_up_rivals_on_the_buses_1_826606 |title=McGills snaps up rivals on the buses |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=26 October 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=4696&categoryid=0 McGill's announces further expansion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223143/http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=4696&categoryid=0 |date=4 October 2013 }} ''busandcoach'' 1 November 2010</ref> Two further acquisitions, of Renfrewshire-based Ferenze Travel and Phoenix Travel, were announced in March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/mcgill_s_snaps_up_two_bus_companies_1_1503840 |title=McGill's snaps up two bus companies|work=The Scotsman|date=3 March 2011}}</ref> In the same month, Dickson's of Erskine sold its key route 38, a Glasgow to Paisley service operated in competition with both Arriva Scotland West and [[First Glasgow]], to McGill's, who converted the route to low-floor operation and increased its frequency at a cost of \u00a31.5 million.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Millar |first=Alan|title=\u00a31.5m upgrade as McGill's announces latest takeovers|journal=Buses|issue=673|date=April 2011|page=6}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2012, McGill's purchased the remaining Arriva Scotland West operation.

We are looking at expanding in Lanarkshire in the near future and we are in discussions with some smaller companies to be buying them out in the area and that will join into McGill's. But the good thing about it is that every time McGill's grows outside the area it actually employs people in the Greenock Head Office. It's all about employment.

Many of these vehicles were previously used by Ashton Coaches and were quickly repainted from their previous green and gold or aquamarine colour schemes into the McGill's blue, white, and gold livery. The minibuses began to be replaced following the Easdale family's acquisition of McGill's in 2004, and a large number of new low-floor buses were bought over the following years as the company expanded, initially [[Dennis Dart SLF]]s and [[DAF SB120]]s. A rare [[Tata Hispano|Hispano]] bodied [[Volvo B7L]] was acquired from [[Arriva Midlands]]; later deliveries of new vehicles included [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart]]s, [[Alexander Dennis Enviro300]]s [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]]s, [[Volvo B7RLE]]s and [[Scania L94UB]]s.\n\nThe United operation in Renfrewshire began in 2008 with second-hand step-entrance Darts; these were quickly replaced by low-floor vehicles, with the depot becoming 100% low-floor by September 2009.

In July 2012, six articulated [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]]s were acquired for service 38. A further eight Tridents arrived from [[London United Busways|London United]], along with a batch of at least ten from [[Stagecoach London]]. The number of low floor double deck vehicles introduced to the fleet since the purchase of Arriva stands at around 40. Along with an unknown number of further Mercedes-Benz Citaros articulated buses for the Dumbarton area - Glasgow services, these continue to displace elderly vehicles from the former Arriva fleet.\n\nIn 2014 McGill's purchased one of the [[Alexander Dennis Enviro 400]]s that they had trialled back in 2009, which had been operated by [[MyBus|Connex of Jersey]] before the purchase.

The company headquarters are situated in [[Greenock]], [[Inverclyde]].<ref name=companySC027238>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/SC027238 Companies House extract company no SC027238] McGill's Bus Service Limited</ref> The present company was founded in July 2001, restoring the name of a previous operator which had existed between 1933 and 1997 however the only connection with the old company was the name. The company has grown from an initial fleet of 33 vehicles to operate a network of routes covering much of Inverclyde, [[East Renfrewshire]], [[Renfrewshire]], [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Glasgow|Glasgow City]] and  [[North Ayrshire]]. A second depot in Barrhead was opened in 2008 but has now closed. Four independent operators were taken over by McGill's in the following three years. McGill's has several depots in Greenock, Coatbridge, Inchinnan and Johnstone.\n\nMcGill's took over the surviving operations of [[Arriva Scotland West]] in a \u00a310 million deal; this was completed on 26 March 2012, and the company now operates over 450 buses and around 100 routes and employs over 1000 members of staff. Further expansion followed in 2012 and in 2013, McGills coaches also bought Henderson Travel after it suddenly ceased business in October 2014, and subsequently took over the company's fleet and service routes which has resulted in the company expanding in the North Lanarkshire area becoming the dominant operator in [[Monklands (district)|Monklands]] area by early 2016.\n\nMcGills is the largest independent bus operator in Scotland,<ref name=\"Mcgillsbuses.co.uk\"/> as well as being named a Scottish Insider top 500 company in January 2016, coming in at place 350.<ref name=\"Mcgillsbuses.co.uk\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory and early years (1933-2004)===\nThe McGill's Bus Services name first came into use in 1933. This company was based in [[Barrhead]] and owned by the McGill family. It expanded significantly during the years leading up to bus deregulation, but in July 1997 sold out to the major operator in the area, [[Arriva Scotland West|Clydeside 2000]], in the face of significant competition from independent minibus operators. McGill's initially retained its identity, but was later rebranded as [[Arriva Scotland West]]. Another company, [[Greenock]] based Ashton Coaches (trading as GMS), was also acquired by Clydeside in the same month.<ref name=BusesMay11>{{cite journal|last=Millar|first=Alan|title=McGill's: Growing fast by quality|journal=[[Buses Magazine|Buses]]|issue=624|date=May 2011|pages=36\u201339}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2001, Arriva decided to withdraw from its [[Inverclyde]] operations, which were loss-making and faced significant competition from independent operators. Its Greenock depot was sold to former GMS owner Alex Kean and the Easdale family with each owning 50%. Arriva had retained a separate operating licence for McGill's, and this was used as the basis for the sale.<ref name=companySC027238/> The McGill's Bus Services name was revived by the new company and a new livery of blue, white and gold introduced. The fleet initially consisted of 33 [[Mercedes-Benz buses|Mercedes-Benz]] minibuses hired from Arriva; services were operated from a large depot on the Easdale Industrial Estate.<ref name=BusesMay11/>\n\nEarly in its existence the new company began operating services in competition with Harte Buses, and in September 2004 Harte withdrew from two routes leaving McGill's as the sole operator. In October 2004, Kean sold his shares in the company to the Easdale family, who quickly replaced the hired minibuses with new low-floor vehicles, leading to increases in passenger numbers.<ref name=BusesMay11/>\n\n===Consolidation & expansion (2005-2015)===\nBetween 2005 and 2008 McGill's introduced a number of new longer-distance routes connecting Inverclyde and [[Glasgow]] to [[Largs]], and in May 2005 began operating a series of day excursions branded as Smoothiecruisers.<ref name=BusesMay11/> In July 2008 McGill's purchased the stage carriage routes and goodwill of four routes centred on Greenock which had previously been run by Slaemuir Coaches.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://inverclydenow.com/index.php/news/local/866-mcgills-acquire-port-glasgow-routes |title=McGill's Acquire Port Glasgow Routes |publisher=inverclydenow.com |date=16 July 2008}}</ref> In the same month the firm established a second depot in Barrhead on the site of the garage used by the original McGill's Bus Services, which had been vacated by Arriva in 2002.\n\nThe new operation traded as United Buses using Greenock and District Omnibuses'<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/SC211163 Companies House extract company no SC0211163] Greenock and District Omnibus Limited</ref> 'o' licence with vehicles on hire from ABC Taxis<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/SC215370 Companies House extract company no SC215370] ABC Taxis (Inverclyde) Limited</ref> which also has an 'o' licence and capitalised on the revocation of the operating licences held by local operator John Walker to move onto four routes previously served by his group of companies.\n\nTwenty step-entrance buses were initially used, but these were largely replaced by low-floor vehicles after four months. The United name was replaced by that of McGill's in September 2009; the same month saw the company introduced express service X23 between Glasgow and [[Erskine]]. By the beginning of 2010 McGill's had become the largest independent bus operator in Scotland, and the fourth largest operator of any type.<ref name=BusesMay11/>\n\nA new service linking Greenock and Larkfield was introduced in early 2010 to replace a route withdrawn by Wilson's Coaches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://inverclydenow.com/index.php/news/local/1751-bus-operators-network-expands-again |title=Bus Operator's Network Expands Again|publisher=inverclydenow.com|date=16 October 2009}}</ref> May 2010 saw McGill's expand its services from [[Dunoon]] and Greenock to Braehead to cover for the withdrawal of Harte Buses' Braehead Express.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://inverclydenow.com/index.php/news/local/2126-braehead-bus-changes|title=Braehead Bus Changes|publisher=inverclydenow.com|date=23 May 2010}}</ref> In July 2010 the company was fined \u00a360,000 by the Traffic Commissioner for failing to operate some services as timetabled, although it was permitted to expand its fleet from 110 to 150 vehicles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.buteman.co.uk/news/local-headlines/bus_firm_is_fined_for_timetable_breaches_1_369511|title=Bus firm is fined for timetable breaches|work=[[The Buteman]]|date=7 July 2010}}</ref> The Smoothiecrusisers network was withdrawn in August 2010.<ref name=BusesMay11/>\n\nThe company acquired the operations and vehicles of large independent operator Gibson's Direct in September 2010, expanding the size of its fleet by around 70%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://inverclydenow.com/index.php/news/local/3201-bus-company-gets-bigger|title=Bus Company Gets Bigger|publisher=inverclydenow.com|date=4 September 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=4450&categoryid=0 McGill's expands in Renfreshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004234911/http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=4450&categoryid=0 |date=4 October 2013 }} busandcoach.com 6 September 2010</ref> In February 2011 two small operators based in the Paisley area, Fairway Coaches and Travel Direct, were purchased by McGill's, although no vehicles were acquired.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/mcgills_snaps_up_rivals_on_the_buses_1_826606 |title=McGills snaps up rivals on the buses |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=26 October 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=4696&categoryid=0 McGill's announces further expansion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223143/http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=4696&categoryid=0 |date=4 October 2013 }} ''busandcoach'' 1 November 2010</ref> Two further acquisitions, of Renfrewshire-based Ferenze Travel and Phoenix Travel, were announced in March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/mcgill_s_snaps_up_two_bus_companies_1_1503840 |title=McGill's snaps up two bus companies|work=The Scotsman|date=3 March 2011}}</ref> In the same month Dickson's of Erskine sold its key route 38, a Glasgow to Paisley service operated in competition with both Arriva Scotland West and [[First Glasgow]], to McGill's, who converted the route to low-floor operation and increased its frequency at a cost of \u00a31.5 million.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Millar |first=Alan|title=\u00a31.5m upgrade as McGill's announces latest takeovers|journal=Buses|issue=673|date=April 2011|page=6}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2012, McGill's purchased the remaining Arriva Scotland West operation.

Many of these vehicles were previously used by Ashton Coaches and were quickly repainted from their previous green and gold or aquamarine colour schemes into the McGill's blue, white and gold livery. The minibuses began to be replaced following the Easdale family's acquisition of McGill's in 2004, and a large number of new low-floor buses were bought over the following years as the company expanded, initially [[Dennis Dart SLF]]s and [[DAF SB120]]s. A rare [[Tata Hispano|Hispano]] bodied [[Volvo B7L]] was acquired from [[Arriva Midlands]]; later deliveries of new vehicles included [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart]]s, [[Alexander Dennis Enviro300]]s [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]]s, [[Volvo B7RLE]]s and [[Scania L94UB]]s.

They come in stony colors, with the most common being grey. They have 22 teeth, including two fangs on the lower canines. As in the book, their blood is black, and is so hot that when spilt, it sizzles on the floor. They are mainly carnivorous, but can digest plant matter if need be. The eyes are either grey or blue. They wear [[loincloth]]s of leather that they find in the Mines or are given by the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblins]]. They sometimes roar when in a battle rage, but are incapable of forming words or language. They often wield either a great club or a hammer. Cave-trolls are usually found with small groups of Orcs. They are too unintelligent to hunt food for themselves, often consuming whatever hapless creature they come across, so food is an advantage they get from working with the Orcs. Their fingernails extend to most of their fingers, and were allegedly used to dig holes into the rock itself.\n\nThe Olog-hai differ from the other trolls depicted in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|New Line movies]] in that they have more forward-facing eyes, as well as hair on their bodies, suggesting that they are a more advanced form of troll. They are usually grey to black in colour. Mountain trolls and Olog-hai have much in common: they are both much larger and more intelligent than most trolls and more resistant to light. However Olog-hai are certainly far superior to mountain trolls in all these aspects.\n\nForest trolls were invented for the EA game version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Cheats |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers/cheats/ |publisher=GamesRadar |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor the game version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', trolls are featured as enemy units. They also appear as enemies in \"[[Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]\". In this game, they are also slow but powerful, and can take a lot of damage before dying. Some of the later \"attack trolls\" in the game wield a pair of large swords, while a stronger kind carries massive [[war hammer]]s, as well as at least one troll encountered in Moria who carries a pair of drums, which are used to heal and increase the damage of an accompanying troll. Trolls also appear as controllable units in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' and its expansion ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', it is necessary for a regular mountain troll to gain a rank (after destroying enemy units, etc.), to become an attack troll where it gains an armor bonus and can heal by itself as the only non-hero unit who is able to do so. In ''The Battle for Middle-earth II'', attack trolls can be made from a Rank 3 Troll Cage. In ''The Rise of the Witch-king'', the [[Angmar]] faction has a troll hero named [[Rogash]], as well as hill and snow trolls. In all the ''Battle for Middle-earth'' games, trolls are depicted as \"tank\" units (slow, very strong, can take massive damage before being killed).\n\n[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game|Lord of the Rings tabletop wargame]], produced by [[Games Workshop]], includes a troll.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game (Review) |url=http://www.boardgame.de/reviews/lotrtato.htm |website=Kulkmann's Gamebox |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist|group=T|28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction}}\n\n\n{{Middle-earth}}\n{{lotr}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Troll (Middle-earth)}}\n[[Category:Fictional humanoids]]\n[[Category:Fictional trolls]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth races]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Please do not remove or change this AfD message until the discussion has been closed. -->\n{{Article for deletion/dated|page=Troll (Middle-earth)|timestamp=20200410055337|year=2020|month=April|day=10|substed=yes|help=off}}\n<!-- Once discussion is closed, please place on talk page: {{Old AfD multi|page=Troll (Middle-earth)|date=10 April 2020|result='''keep'''}} -->\n<!-- End of AfD message, feel free to edit beyond this point -->\n{{short description|Evil race from J.

They come in stony colors, with the most common being grey. They have 22 teeth, including two fangs on the lower canines. As in the book, their blood is black, and is so hot that when spilt, it sizzles on the floor. They are mainly carnivorous, but can digest plant matter if need be. The eyes are either grey or blue. They wear [[loincloth]]s of leather that they find in the Mines or are given by the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblins]]. They sometimes roar when in a battle rage, but are incapable of forming words or language. They often wield either a great club or a hammer. Cave-trolls are usually found with small groups of Orcs. They are too unintelligent to hunt food for themselves, often consuming whatever hapless creature they come across, so food is an advantage they get from working with the Orcs. Their fingernails extend to most of their fingers, and were allegedly used to dig holes into the rock itself.\n\nThe Olog-hai differ from the other trolls depicted in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|New Line movies]] in that they have more forward-facing eyes, as well as hair on their bodies, suggesting that they are a more advanced form of troll. They are usually grey to black in colour. Mountain trolls and Olog-hai have much in common: they are both much larger and more intelligent than most trolls and more resistant to light. However Olog-hai are certainly far superior to mountain trolls in all these aspects.\n\nForest trolls were invented for the EA game version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Cheats |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers/cheats/ |publisher=GamesRadar |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor the game version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', trolls are featured as enemy units. They also appear as enemies in \"[[Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]\". In this game, they are also slow but powerful, and can take a lot of damage before dying. Some of the later \"attack trolls\" in the game wield a pair of large swords, while a stronger kind carries massive [[war hammer]]s, as well as at least one troll encountered in Moria who carries a pair of drums, which are used to heal and increase the damage of an accompanying troll. Trolls also appear as controllable units in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' and its expansion ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', it is necessary for a regular mountain troll to gain a rank (after destroying enemy units, etc.), to become an attack troll where it gains an armor bonus and can heal by itself as the only non-hero unit who is able to do so. In ''The Battle for Middle-earth II'', attack trolls can be made from a Rank 3 Troll Cage. In ''The Rise of the Witch-king'', the [[Angmar]] faction has a troll hero named [[Rogash]], as well as hill and snow trolls. In all the ''Battle for Middle-earth'' games, trolls are depicted as \"tank\" units (slow, very strong, can take massive damage before being killed).\n\n[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game|Lord of the Rings tabletop wargame]], produced by [[Games Workshop]], includes a troll.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game (Review) |url=http://www.boardgame.de/reviews/lotrtato.htm |website=Kulkmann's Gamebox |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist|group=T|28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction}}\n\n\n{{Middle-earth}}\n{{lotr}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Troll (Middle-earth)}}\n[[Category:Fictional humanoids]]\n[[Category:Fictional trolls]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth races]]\n", "name_user": "Chiswick Chap", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn folklore and early fantasy:punct", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Middle-earth)"}

The inquiry was not only into professionalism but also the transfers of Jackson & Jackett as well as [[Alf Kewney]] and [[Thomas Hogarth (rugby union)|Tom Hogarth]].  On 30 January 1909, the day Leicester hosted an [[England national rugby union team|England]] v [[France national rugby union team|France]] test match, the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] announced the outcome of the inquiry clearing the club on all charges in what has been described as a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=60}}</ref>\n\nAs if to refute the notion that the Tigers were made up purely of imported players there were 12 locals selected for the 1909 Midland Counties Cup Final against [[Coventry R.F.C.|Coventry]].

The fixture became a vital feature in the club's calendar delivering large attendances until open professionalism and league rugby in the 1990s forced it to gradually be abandoned due to fixture congestion.\n\nTigers won the Midlands Counties Cup 3 more times in 4 years to cement their place as the midland's premier side before the outbreak of [[First World War|war]] in 1914.\n\n===War and reconstruction of Welford Road (1914-21)===\n\nWith [[World War I|war]] declared the Leicester committee suspended matches on 3 September 1914.

The roof of the Crumbie Stand had been damaged in air raids, there was a collapsed wall at the Welford Road end and significant repairs to the clubhouse were required where the Army had bored holes into the floor.  The club ran two teams that year; the First XV and Leicestershire Harlequins, named for the war-time side that provided rugby for locals on leave or passing servicemen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=117}}</ref>\n\nThe Harlequins were quickly changed to be an \"A XV\", the first time the club had run more than one side for 40 years.

The \"A XV\" was to be re-introduced under the name \"Extra First XV\" with a third \"Colts XV\" also formed.  With only one side, the club had been suffering losing players because of a lack of regular rugby for those on the fringes of the starting side.

Tigers scored 122 tries and 657 points that season. Moves towards a return to competitive rugby were made with discussion held on leagues or a knock out cup. Tigers president Nick Hughes favoured regional pools before a national knock out tournament.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=168}}</ref>\n\nDespite usually returning more wins than losses Leicester's standing at the time was not what it is now.

The [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] introduced for the first time a national [[1971-72 John Player Cup|Knockout Cup]] competition for clubs and on 16 November 1971 Tigers played their first competitive cup match since 1914, a 10\u20133 defeat to [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham]] at their Beeston ground.\n\nAlso introduced that season was Tigers' first \"Youth\" XV, based on the Leicester Ravens a collection of the best 14 and 15 year olds in the county.  Their first game was on 15 April 1972 and they made an immediate impact, captain of that side was Steve Kenney who would score the winning try in the [[1978-79 John Player Cup|1979 Cup Final]].

There was still no joy in the Cup with a first round defeat to [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] also meaning Tigers failed to qualify the next season.  Tigers fly half [[Alan Old]] started for England as they beat [[1973 England rugby union tour of Fiji and New Zealand|New Zealand in New Zealand]] for the first time<ref>http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/match/20714.html</ref> and then beat Australia at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]].<ref>http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/match/20739.html</ref>\n\n===Cup success (1974-80)===\n\nTigers were not involved in the 1974-75 Cup and lost in the 1st round of the [[1975-76 John Player Cup|1975-76 Cup]] to Liverpool.  This forced the club into the Midlands qualifiers for the only time.  They beat [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham]], local junior club [[Leicester Lions RFC|Westleigh]] and [[Kettering Rugby Football Club|Kettering]] to qualify for the [[1976-77 John Player Cup|1976-77 Cup]] where a win against [[Wakefield RFC|Wakefield]] lead to a second round defeat against [[Moseley Rugby Football Club|Moseley]].\n\nThis era saw a huge increase in the popularity of the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] annual fixture which crowds of 15,000 in 1973 & 1975, 17,000 in 1974 and 21,000 in 1976.

The game ended in a 6\u20133 loss to the Cherry and Whites; the attendance was 25,282 more than double the previous season.  Cup success also coincided with Tigers membership more than doubling from 750 in 1978 to 2,000 by the end of 1979.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=190}}</ref>\n\nHome cup draws continued the next season as Northampton (29-3) and [[Broughton Park RUFC|Broughton Park]] (30-7) were beaten at Welford Road.  Bedford were beaten at Goldington Road in the quarter finals before [[Wasps RFC|Wasps]] were defeated 43\u20137 in the semi finals.  [[1978-79 John Player Cup|The final]] was against perennial rivals Moseley and Steve Kenney scored with three minutes remaining to win it 15-12 for Leicester.\n\nTigers retained the cup in [[1979-80 John Player Cup|1979-80]] beating [[Orrell R.U.F.C.|Orrell]] (16-7), Moseley (17-7), [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]] and [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] in the early rounds before beating [[London Irish]] 21\u20139 in the final at Twickenham in front of a record crowd of 27,000.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=199}}</ref>  1979-80 also saw Tigers win the Midlands Merit Table for the first time with a record played 7 games and won 6 and provide four players in [[1980 Five Nations Championship|England's grandslam of 1980]].  [[Clive Woodward]] and [[Peter Wheeler (rugby union)|Peter Wheeler]] were selected for the [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa]], [[Paul Dodge]] joined them as an injury replacement and all three were selected for the third test defeat against the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]].\n\n===Centenary===\n\nTo celebrate the club's centenary a 6 match tour to [[Australia]] and [[Fiji]] was arranged in August 1980, the first undertaken by an English club in the southern hemisphere.  Tigers lost 22\u201312 to [[Queensland Reds|Queensland]] in their first match but recorded victories over [[Eastern Suburbs RUFC|Eastern Suburbs]] and [[Randwick DRUFC|Randwick]] before traveling to Fiji and winning 3 games.\n\nPrestige fixtures staged at Welford Road to mark the centenary were the visit of the [[Ireland Wolfhounds|Irish Wolfhounds]] who were beaten 10\u20136; [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] who won 39\u20137, with [[Floric\u0103 Murariu]] scoring 4 tries for the visitors and a return visit from [[Queensland Reds|Queensland]] who were beaten 21\u20139.\n\nTigers retained the Midlands Merit Table title in November with an undefeated record of played 7, won 6, drawn 1. On 25 April 1981 Tigers traveled to Moseley where [[Dusty Hare]] broke the world record for points scored in first class fixtures.  His total of 3,658 over took the previous record held by Moseley's own [[Sam Doble]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=201}}</ref>\n\nThe cup was won again in [[1980-81 John Player Cup|1980-81]].  Roundhay, [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol]] and [[Sale Sharks|Sale]] were beaten in the early rounds; [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]] in the semi finals became the first cup game to go to extra time before [[Les Cusworth]] kicked two drop goals to seal a fourth successive trip to Twickenham.

The main difference from the merit table was all sides would now have to play all other sides in a round robin, though a fixtures dispute meant the Tigers v Gloucester match was not played.  Tigers hit the top of the league on 28 November following a 21\u20133 win away at [[Moseley R.F.C.|Moseley]] and stayed there losing only one match all season.

Leicester's [[Heineken Cup]] debut was against [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] at [[Donnybrook Stadium|Donnybrook]]. Leicester beat [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Border Reivers (rugby)|Scottish Borders]], [[Section Paloise|Pau]] and [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] in the group stage before beating Harlequins (quarter finals) and [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] (semi finals) to set up [[1997 Heineken Cup Final|the final]] against [[CA Brive|Brive]]. The match was close at half time, Leicester were behind 8-6 but the French side ran riot in the second half to win 28\u20139.  Tigers faltered in the league but did secure silverware beating [[Sale Sharks|Sale]] 9\u20133 in the [[1996-97 Pilkington Cup|1997 Pilkington Cup Final]].

Tigers beat the Italian side twice but lost away to Leinster and at home to Toulouse. In the quarter final play off Leicester beat [[Glasgow Warriors|Glasgow]] 90-19 but lost in the quarter final proper away to [[Section Paloise|Pau]]. Domestically Tigers were a mixed bag, winning 12, losing 8 and drawing 2 games to finish 4th in the [[1997-98 English Premiership (rugby union)|Allied Dunbar Premiership]].

Tigers started the new season well with a 49\u201315 win against [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] and wins against [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]], [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] and [[Bedford Blues|Bedford]] to see Tigers top the table at the end of September. Losses against [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] and [[London Irish]] in rounds 5 & 7 saw Tigers slip to 3rd in October; Leicester regained the lead in the table after victories against [[Richmond F.C.|Richmond]] and [[West Hartlepool RFC|West Hartlepool]] and were never to lose it despite a loss to Wasps two weeks later. Dreams of the double were dashed by Richmond in the quarter finals of the cup, Johnson received a white card (at the time signifying 10 minutes in the sin bin) and during his absence the Londoners scored their two tries in a 15\u201313 win. The next week Johnson was sin binned again, this time in a league match against closest challengers Northampton, but even with [[Pat Howard]] also sin binned and Leicester down to 13 men for a period so outstanding was Johnson's play they won 22\u201315.

Tigers started the season poorly, losing two of the first three games.  Even with three other wins Leicester finished the World Cup period in 8th position in the league. English clubs returned to European competition but in the [[1999-2000 Heineken Cup pool stage|1999-2000 Heineken Cup]] Leicester lost four pool games to exit at the first stage.\n\nHowever they were to only lose one further Premiership game, away to [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] in December. Tigers retained their title on 14 May 2000 with a 30\u201323 win against [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol]] at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Ground]].  The trophy was presented the next week at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] following their 13th consecutive league win, a 43\u201325 win against Premiership runners-up Bath.\n\nHaving dominated domestic rugby for the previous two years Leicester were desperate to avenge their [[1997 Heineken Cup Final]] defeat and claim their first European title. Local rivals [[Northampton Saints]] had claimed the [[1999-2000 Heineken Cup|previous season's title]] with perennial rivals Bath claiming the title in 1998. Tigers were drawn with [[Section Paloise|Pau]], [[Glasgow Warriors|Glasgow]] and [[Pontypridd RFC|Pontypridd]] in their [[2000-01 Heineken Cup pool stage|Heineken Cup pool]].  Wins at home to Pau and away to Glasgow preceded a loss in Wales to Pontypridd that was quickly avenged a week later at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]].  Two wins in the final two pool games led to a January quarter final against [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]] which Leicester won 41\u201310.\n\nDomestically Leicester were again top of the table and at this stage 11 points clear of [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] in second place. The gap was pushed to 18 points on 10 March 2001 when Tigers beat Northampton at [[Franklin's Gardens]] and Tigers' third successive [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English league title]] was formally sealed on 17 March 2001 against [[Newcastle Falcons|Newcastle]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=268}}</ref>\n\nWith the domestic title sealed, Leicester went into the [[2000-01 Heineken Cup|Heineken Cup]] semi finals against [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]].

Back to back wins against [[USA Perpignan]] in October and November saw Leicester through as group winners but a loss to Llanelli in the final round allowed the Welsh side through to the knock out stages as a best runner up.

Tigers''' details the history of the [[rugby union]] club based in [[Leicester]], [[England]].  Nicknamed the Tigers from 1885, Leicester have been a prominent club from the earliest days of organised English rugby dominating midlands rugby before the [[First World War]]; providing [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] captains in 1930, 1936, 1997 and 2001; and winning 20 major titles since 1979 including a record 10 [[Premiership Rugby]] titles.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[File:E.Redman 1895.jpg|thumb|right|180px|E.

Tigers first ever cup game was an away loss to Edgbaston Crusaders.\n\n===Early Years (1888-92)===\nThis inauspicious start to the cup continued with losses to Moseley in each of the next three seasons.  In 1888 Tigers fixture list started to expand outside the midlands, on 10 March they traveled to [[Valley Parade]] in Bradford to play [[Manningham F.C.]], the forerunners of soccer side [[Bradford City]].  The 1888\u201389 season saw Tigers welcome back Manningham as well as [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] and [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], [[Cardiff Harlequins RFC|Cardiff Harlequins]] became the club's first [[Wales|Welsh]] opponents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=20}}</ref>  Leicester also reached their first Midland Counties Cup Final that year losing, again, to Moseley in front of 4,000 fans in Coventry.\n\n1889-90 saw Tigers travel to [[Wales]] for the first time playing [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff]] and [[Newport RFC|Newport]] on consecutive days, the Monday and Tuesday of Easter week.  [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]] were added to the fixture list in 1891\u201392, whilst on 13 February Tigers played in [[London]] for the first time, a 37\u20130 loss to [[Blackheath F.C.|Blackheath]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=21}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 1892 Leicester played their first game at their present ground, [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]], against a Leicestershire XV.

In the final [[Nuneaton R.F.C.|Nuneaton]] were beaten 20\u20133.  For the next three seasons Leicester had the better of Moseley beating them in the final each year, before seeing off Rugby in the final of 1903.  Moseley were defeated again in 1904, [[Nottingham Rugby|Nottingham]] beaten 31\u20130 in 1905.

The inquiry was not only into professionalism but also the transfers of Jackson & Jackett as well as [[Alf Kewney]] and [[Thomas Hogarth (rugby union)|Tom Hogarth]].  On 30 January 1909, the day Leicester hosted an [[England national rugby union team|England]] v [[France national rugby union team|France]] test match, the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] announced the outcome of the inquiry clearing the club on all charges in what has been described as a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=60}}</ref>\n\nAs if to refute the notion that the Tigers were made up purely of imported players there were 12 locals selected for the 1909 Midland Counties Cup Final against [[Coventry R.F.C.|Coventry]].  Tigers won the cup, the first time they had entered after a four-year absence, 8\u20133 with two tries from [[Percy Lawrie (rugby union)|Percy Lawrie]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=61}}</ref>\n\nDecember 1909 saw the beginning of a cherished tradition as Tigers played the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] for the first time, holding them to a 9\u20139 draw.  The fixture became a vital feature in the club's calendar delivering large attendances until open professionalism and league rugby in the 1990s forced it to gradually be abandoned due to fixture congestion.\n\nTigers won the Midlands Counties Cup 3 more times in 4 years to cement their place as the midland's premier side before the outbreak of [[First World War|war]] in 1914.\n\n===War and reconstruction of Welford Road (1914-21)===\n\nWith [[World War I|war]] declared the Leicester committee suspended matches on 3 September 1914. Two charity matches were played against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] in 1915 but otherwise Tigers played no rugby for the duration of the war.  17 players from the club lost their lives during the war.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01ws4sj</ref><ref>http://www.leicestertigers.com/news/18192.php#.V0q42-RZuW0</ref>\n\nWithin 6 weeks of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]] being signed Tigers were playing their first game, facing the 4th battalion of the [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|Leicestershire Regiment]] in what was also the official opening of the Members Stand on the north side of the ground.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\nTigers enjoyed their first full season back; winger [[Teddy Haselmere]] scored a club record 59 tries, no man before or since has even reached 40.  At this time formations were not set in the way they are now and Tigers regularly played with 7 forwards and 8 backs, meaning overlaps for the wingers were plentiful.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=72}}</ref>\n\nThe ''New Stand'' (later renamed the ''Crumbie Stand'' in honour of Tom Crumbie) costing \u00a321,000 (approx \u00a3850,000 in 2016) was officially opened on 2 October 1920 before a match against [[Yorkshire Carnegie|Headingley]] by the President of the RFU Ernest Prescott, Tigers celebrated with a 33\u20133 victory.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=73}}</ref>\n\nTerracing was added in front of the new stand the next season and the Members Stand extended to give Welford Road a seated capacity of 10,250.

Tigers returned the visit in February 1923 but lost 19-9 despite scoring three tries.\n\nThe visit of the [[1924-25 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France|Invincible All Blacks]] on 4 October 1924 saw a record attendance at Welford Road of 35,000 that stands to this day.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=83}}</ref>  Tigers were beaten 27-0 by the tourists but good things were still to come that season as [[Leicestershire Rugby Union|Leicestershire]] won their only [[County Championship (rugby union)|County Championship]] against [[Gloucestershire Rugby Union|Gloucestershire]] with the entire starting XV coming from the Tigers.\n\nThe next season saw a visit by the [[1926-27 New Zealand Maori rugby union tour|New Zealand Maori]] and a closer result, Tigers leading at half time 8-3 thanks to a try from Ewert Farndon and 5 points from the boot of [[Doug Prentice]] but eventually succumbing 15\u201313 to the Maori tourists.\n\nTom Crumbie died on 13 March 1928, he was described as the cog around which the club functioned and contemporary reports say he epitomised the club.  Tigers wore black armbands for their next fixture against [[Penarth RFC|Penarth]].  On 4 April the club appointed his successor Eric Thorneloe and six months later renamed ''The New Stand'' as ''The Crumbie Stand'' in honour of Crumbie.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=86}}</ref>\n\n===Personal honours as club's fortunes wane (1930-39)===\n\nClub captain [[Doug Prentice]] was given the honour of captaining the [[1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia]], alongside two Leicester teammates [[Douglas Kendrew|Joe Kendrew]] and [[George Beamish]].<ref name=\"The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation\">{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=95}}</ref>  Irish forward [[George Beamish|Beamish]] played 21 games on the tour, the most of any player, and is credited with introducing the green of [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] into the [[British and Irish Lions|Lions]] playing kit.<ref name=\"Misc2\">Richard Bath, ''The British & Irish Lions Miscellany'', page 77, 2008, (Vision Sports Publishing:London)</ref>\n\nNo doubt the presence of such star players lead the next season to the first [[BBC]] radio broadcast of a Tigers game.  The match against [[Waterloo FC|Waterloo]] on 29 November 1930 was the first radio broadcast of a Leicester game; Tigers won 21\u20135.<ref name=\"The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] hit the club's gates hard.  With no cup or league competitions attendances for friendly fixtures tumbled to a low of 346 against [[Bridgwater & Albion|Bridgwater Albion]] in 1934.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=105}}</ref>  It took the introduction of leagues in the 1980s before crowd numbers returned to their pre-depression level.

The roof of the Crumbie Stand had been damaged in air raids, there was a collapsed wall at the Welford Road end and significant repairs to the clubhouse were required where the Army had bored holes into the floor.  The club ran two teams that year; the First XV and Leicestershire Harlequins, named for the war-time side that provided rugby for locals on leave or passing servicemen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=117}}</ref>\n\nThe Harlequins were quickly changed to be an \"A XV\", the first time the club had run more than one side for 40 years.

The \"A XV\" was to be re-introduced under the name \"Extra First XV\" with a third \"Colts XV\" also formed.  With only one side, the club had been suffering losing players because of a lack of regular rugby for those on the fringes of the starting side.

Tigers scored 122 tries and 657 points that season. Moves towards a return to competitive rugby were made with discussion held on leagues or a knock out cup. Tigers president Nick Hughes favoured regional pools before a national knock out tournament.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=168}}</ref>\n\nDespite usually returning more wins than losses Leicester's standing at the time was not what it is now.

The [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] introduced for the first time a national [[1971-72 John Player Cup|Knockout Cup]] competition for clubs and on 16 November 1971 Tigers played their first competitive cup match since 1914, a 10\u20133 defeat to [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham]] at their Beeston ground.\n\nAlso introduced that season was Tigers' first \"Youth\" XV, based on the Leicester Ravens a collection of the best 14 and 15 year olds in the county.  Their first game was on 15 April 1972 and they made an immediate impact, captain of that side was Steve Kenney who would score the winning try in the [[1978-79 John Player Cup|1979 Cup Final]].

There was still no joy in the Cup with a first round defeat to [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] also meaning Tigers failed to qualify the next season.  Tigers fly half [[Alan Old]] started for England as they beat [[1973 England rugby union tour of Fiji and New Zealand|New Zealand in New Zealand]] for the first time<ref>http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/match/20714.html</ref> and then beat Australia at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]].<ref>http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/match/20739.html</ref>\n\n===Cup success (1974-80)===\n\nTigers were not involved in the 1974-75 Cup and lost in the 1st round of the [[1975-76 John Player Cup|1975-76 Cup]] to Liverpool.  This forced the club into the Midlands qualifiers for the only time.  They beat [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham]], local junior club [[Leicester Lions RFC|Westleigh]] and [[Kettering Rugby Football Club|Kettering]] to qualify for the [[1976-77 John Player Cup|1976-77 Cup]] where a win against [[Wakefield RFC|Wakefield]] lead to a second round defeat against [[Moseley Rugby Football Club|Moseley]].\n\nThis era saw a huge increase in the popularity of the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] annual fixture which crowds of 15,000 in 1973 & 1975, 17,000 in 1974 and 21,000 in 1976.

The game ended in a 6\u20133 loss to the Cherry and Whites; the attendance was 25,282 more than double the previous season.  Cup success also coincided with Tigers membership more than doubling from 750 in 1978 to 2,000 by the end of 1979.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=190}}</ref>\n\nHome cup draws continued the next season as Northampton (29-3) and [[Broughton Park RUFC|Broughton Park]] (30-7) were beaten at Welford Road.  Bedford were beaten at Goldington Road in the quarter finals before [[Wasps RFC|Wasps]] were defeated 43\u20137 in the semi finals.  [[1978-79 John Player Cup|The final]] was against perennial rivals Moseley and Steve Kenney scored with three minutes remaining to win it 15-12 for Leicester.\n\nTigers retained the cup in [[1979-80 John Player Cup|1979-80]] beating [[Orrell R.U.F.C.|Orrell]] (16-7), Moseley (17-7), [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]] and [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] in the early rounds before beating [[London Irish]] 21\u20139 in the final at Twickenham in front of a record crowd of 27,000.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=199}}</ref>  1979-80 also saw Tigers win the Midlands Merit Table for the first time with a record played 7 games and won 6 and provide four players in [[1980 Five Nations Championship|England's grandslam of 1980]].  [[Clive Woodward]] and [[Peter Wheeler (rugby union)|Peter Wheeler]] were selected for the [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa]], [[Paul Dodge]] joined them as an injury replacement and all three were selected for the third test defeat against the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]].\n\n===Centenary===\n\nTo celebrate the club's centenary a 6 match tour to [[Australia]] and [[Fiji]] was arranged in August 1980, the first undertaken by an English club in the southern hemisphere.  Tigers lost 22\u201312 to [[Queensland Reds|Queensland]] in their first match but recorded victories over [[Eastern Suburbs RUFC|Eastern Suburbs]] and [[Randwick DRUFC|Randwick]] before traveling to Fiji and winning 3 games.\n\nPrestige fixtures staged at Welford Road to mark the centenary were the visit of the [[Ireland Wolfhounds|Irish Wolfhounds]] who were beaten 10\u20136; [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] who won 39\u20137, with [[Floric\u0103 Murariu]] scoring 4 tries for the visitors and a return visit from [[Queensland Reds|Queensland]] who were beaten 21\u20139.\n\nTigers retained the Midlands Merit Table title in November with an undefeated record of played 7, won 6, drawn 1. On 25 April 1981 Tigers traveled to Moseley where [[Dusty Hare]] broke the world record for points scored in first class fixtures.  His total of 3,658 over took the previous record held by Moseley's own [[Sam Doble]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=201}}</ref>\n\nThe cup was won again in [[1980-81 John Player Cup|1980-81]].  Roundhay, [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol]] and [[Sale Sharks|Sale]] were beaten in the early rounds; [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]] in the semi finals became the first cup game to go to extra time before [[Les Cusworth]] kicked two drop goals to seal a fourth successive trip to Twickenham.

The main difference from the merit table was all sides would now have to play all other sides in a round robin, though a fixtures dispute meant the Tigers v Gloucester match was not played.  Tigers hit the top of the league on 28 November following a 21\u20133 win away at [[Moseley R.F.C.|Moseley]] and stayed there losing only one match all season.

Leicester's [[Heineken Cup]] debut was against [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] at [[Donnybrook Stadium|Donnybrook]]. Leicester beat [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Border Reivers (rugby)|Scottish Borders]], [[Section Paloise|Pau]] and [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] in the group stage before beating Harlequins (quarter finals) and [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] (semi finals) to set up [[1997 Heineken Cup Final|the final]] against [[CA Brive|Brive]]. The match was close at half time, Leicester were behind 8-6 but the French side ran riot in the second half to win 28\u20139.  Tigers faltered in the league but did secure silverware beating [[Sale Sharks|Sale]] 9\u20133 in the [[1996-97 Pilkington Cup|1997 Pilkington Cup Final]].

Tigers beat the Italian side twice but lost away to Leinster and at home to Toulouse. In the quarter final play off Leicester beat [[Glasgow Warriors|Glasgow]] 90-19 but lost in the quarter final proper away to [[Section Paloise|Pau]]. Domestically Tigers were a mixed bag, winning 12, losing 8 and drawing 2 games to finish 4th in the [[1997-98 English Premiership (rugby union)|Allied Dunbar Premiership]].

Tigers started the new season well with a 49\u201315 win against [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] and wins against [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]], [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] and [[Bedford Blues|Bedford]] to see Tigers top the table at the end of September. Losses against [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] and [[London Irish]] in rounds 5 & 7 saw Tigers slip to 3rd in October; Leicester regained the lead in the table after victories against [[Richmond F.C.|Richmond]] and [[West Hartlepool RFC|West Hartlepool]] and were never to lose it despite a loss to Wasps two weeks later. Dreams of the double were dashed by Richmond in the quarter finals of the cup, Johnson received a white card (at the time signifying 10 minutes in the sin bin) and during his absence the Londoners scored their two tries in a 15\u201313 win. The next week Johnson was sin binned again, this time in a league match against closest challengers Northampton, but even with [[Pat Howard]] also sin binned and Leicester down to 13 men for a period so outstanding was Johnson's play they won 22\u201315.

Tigers started the season poorly, losing two of the first three games.  Even with three other wins Leicester finished the World Cup period in 8th position in the league. English clubs returned to European competition but in the [[1999-2000 Heineken Cup pool stage|1999-2000 Heineken Cup]] Leicester lost four pool games to exit at the first stage.\n\nHowever they were to only lose one further Premiership game, away to [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] in December. Tigers retained their title on 14 May 2000 with a 30\u201323 win against [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol]] at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Ground]].  The trophy was presented the next week at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] following their 13th consecutive league win, a 43\u201325 win against Premiership runners-up Bath.\n\nHaving dominated domestic rugby for the previous two years Leicester were desperate to avenge their [[1997 Heineken Cup Final]] defeat and claim their first European title. Local rivals [[Northampton Saints]] had claimed the [[1999-2000 Heineken Cup|previous season's title]] with perennial rivals Bath claiming the title in 1998. Tigers were drawn with [[Section Paloise|Pau]], [[Glasgow Warriors|Glasgow]] and [[Pontypridd RFC|Pontypridd]] in their [[2000-01 Heineken Cup pool stage|Heineken Cup pool]].  Wins at home to Pau and away to Glasgow preceded a loss in Wales to Pontypridd that was quickly avenged a week later at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]].  Two wins in the final two pool games led to a January quarter final against [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]] which Leicester won 41\u201310.\n\nDomestically Leicester were again top of the table and at this stage 11 points clear of [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] in second place. The gap was pushed to 18 points on 10 March 2001 when Tigers beat Northampton at [[Franklin's Gardens]] and Tigers' third successive [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English league title]] was formally sealed on 17 March 2001 against [[Newcastle Falcons|Newcastle]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=268}}</ref>\n\nWith the domestic title sealed, Leicester went into the [[2000-01 Heineken Cup|Heineken Cup]] semi finals against [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]].

Back to back wins against [[USA Perpignan]] in October and November saw Leicester through as group winners but a loss to Llanelli in the final round allowed the Welsh side through to the knock out stages as a best runner up.

For Aristotle, achieving virtue involves asking the question \u201chow should I ''be''\u201d rather than \u201cwhat should I ''do''.\u201d A fully virtuous person is described as achieving eudaimonia, and therefore would be undeniably happy.

Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>Sridharan, Vishnu. \u201cUtility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman.\u201d ''Philosophy East and West'', vol. 66, no. 2, 2016, pp. 650\u2013652., www.jstor.org/stable/43830917.

For Aristotle, achieving virtue involves asking the question \u201chow should I ''be''\u201d rather than \u201cwhat should I ''do''.\u201d A fully virtuous person is described as achieving eudaimonia, and therefore would be undeniably happy.

He is best known for his political philosophy, but he proposed two thought experiments directly tied to issues on Philosophy of Happiness. \n\nIn his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a [[thought experiment]] where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life. The machine described in his thought experiment is often described as the \"[[Experience machine|Experience Machine]].\" The machine works by giving the participant connected to it the sensation of any experience they desired and is said to produce sensations that are indistinguishable from real life experiences.<ref>Crisp, Roger. \u201cHedonism Reconsidered.\u201d ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', vol. 73, no. 3, 2006, pp. 619\u2013645. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/40041013. Accessed 18 Feb. 2020.</ref>\n\nNozick outlined the \u201c[[utility monster]]\u201d thought experiment as an attempted criticism to utilitarianism. Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>Sridharan, Vishnu. \u201cUtility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman.\u201d ''Philosophy East and West'', vol. 66, no. 2, 2016, pp. 650\u2013652., www.jstor.org/stable/43830917.
