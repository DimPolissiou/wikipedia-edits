It was administered by the [[District School Board of Niagara]] from 1969 to 2013.\n\n==History==\nThe opening of the school in September 1969 marked the close of several chapters in the history of education in the City of [[St. Catharines]]. For many years, the students from this area had to attend various secondary schools in other parts of the city. They now had their own school in which to build local traditions of excellence in educational achievements.\n\nThe site on which this school is built was originally part of a 100-acre land grant that was conveyed to John Gould by Letters Patent from the Crown in 1806. He sold off parcels of this land during the succeeding years, and by the time of Confederation, it had been fragmented into the hands of fifty-four different owners. Among the names of early settlers of this area are found, as recorded by the Registrar of Deeds, those of: Merritt, Woodruff, Rykert, Macdonald, Mettleberger, Bullivant, Adams and Brown.\n\nIn 1963, the Board of Education for the City of St. Catharines took steps towards the building of West Park bypassing the motion that the Board approve in principle that a secondary school site of approximately fifteen acres would be purchased in an area bound by Louth Street, Rykert Street and Powerview Avenue. By arrangement with the City of St. Catharines, through the Parks and Recreation Commission, it was agreed that this area should be developed as a school-recreation-park complex. The Board of Education purchased approximately seven acres, from a private owner. The city made available to the Board about seven acres of the unopened Homeland Plan subdivision, and jointly the Board and the city acquired another acre from the rear of the lots on Louth Street, For the building project the firm of Macbeth, Williams, Woodruff and Hadaway was chosen as architects and the general contract was awarded to Newman Brothers Company Limited. Construction began on October 14, 1967. The total cost of the school was $3,250,943.00 of which $1,985,943.00 was received as federal-provincial grants. The community swimming pool was constructed by the city and designed so that it would be completely integrated with the school properly. At a later date, the swimming pool was enclosed for year-round use.\n\nWest Park S.S. was more than a school; it was an integral part of the community serving the educational and recreational needs of all families west of Twelve Mile Creek. The school site adjoins the Powerview Park, which, like the swimming pool, is under the Parks and Recreation Commission. West Park students made use of the swimming pool, football and soccer fields, tennis courts and baseball diamond. In 1999, the track and its in-field were brought up to national standards. The combined park-and-school complex occupies a site of 14.5 acres. Athletics using these facilities complemented other athletic programs in rowing, basketball, volleyball, golf, badminton and more.\n\nThe program of the school led to both university and college post-secondary pursuits. The Communication Technology lab and television arts studio provided students with the opportunity to bring together their artistic creativity and academic strengths.\n\nIn June 2012, Trustees voted to close West Park despite arguments that it is one of the newer schools in The [[District School Board of Niagara]].  Trustee Dalton Clark voted against the proposal to close the school stating that \"he could not support a recommendation to close West Park, because of the facilities the board would lose.<ref>[http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2012/06/12/trustees-vote-to-close-kernahan-park-west-park Trustees Vote to Close Kernahan Park, West Park] ''St. Catharines Standard'', retrieved July 17, 2013</ref>\n\n==Rowing==\nWest Park had a strong rowing tradition throughout the school's history. In 1970, Principal Ron Baum asked Rudy Weiler to head up coaching the rowing program.  The program grew rapidly and in 1971, West Park won the points championship at the 26th Canadian Scholastic Rowing Championships (now [[Canadian Secondary School Rowing Association]] or SCCRA Championships)  In 1972, West Park won a school-record seven CSSRA titles. In 1976, the rowing program expanded again when girls rowing was introduced.  The girls rowing program was successful from the start and \"from 1977 to 1981, West Park's girls eight won five straight high school Triple Crown titles, with victories at the Stotesbury Cup and the Canadian and U.S. high school championships.\"<ref name=\"Final Farewell\">[http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2013/05/31/west-park-rowings-final-farewell West Park Rowing's Final Farewell] ''St. Catharines Standard'', retrieved July 17, 2013</ref> From its beginnings in 1970 well into the 80's, \"West Park's rowing program was a powerhouse, winning 12-13 CSSRA combined team titles and producing 43 athletes who represented Canada internationally at the junior and senior level.

West Park has won numerous medals, including 77 plaques from The Canadian Secondary School Championship and 15 plaques from The Stotesbury Cup, Philadelphia.

Walking plows could loosen up earth, then two horse scrapers called [[Fresno scraper|fresnos]] could grade the low places. These projects could be undertaken by pioneer settlers who wished to work to help pay homestead taxes. Two horse teams were replaced by fours horse teams and larger scrapers. Crawler tractors eventually replaced horse teams to pull larger scrapers and graders. <blockquote>No. 9 was surveyed in 1929 and graded in 1930-31. These roads were first gravelled in 1930-31 and 1933. This made for safer driving in rainy weather, but very dusty in dry weather. Sometimes these clouds of dust were the cause of accidents on the highways. Next these roads were re-built for oiled surfaces - No. 9 to the lakes in 1956, and south of town in 1964-65....The oiled surface reduced the dust hazard, but kept breaking up under heavy loads...When potash was discovered...better surfacing was requited. So the highway were once again built up to make them wider, and No. 9 got heavy-duty paving to withstand the heavy loads.

At age 26, he granted 's-Hertogenbosch [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is, however, the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original [[charter]] has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from [[Gelre]] and [[Holland]]; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls may still be seen. \n\n[[File:Braun s-Hertogenbosch UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'s-Hertogenbosch in the 16th century]]\nIn the late 14th century, a much larger wall was erected to protect the greatly expanded settled area. Artificial waterways were dug to serve as a city moat, through which the rivers [[Dommel]] and [[Aa River (Meuse)|Aa]] were diverted. 's-Hertogenbosch became the birthplace and home of one of the greatest painters of the [[northern Renaissance]] period, [[Hieronymus Bosch]], The town suffered a catastrophic fire in 1463, which the then (approximately) 13-year-old Bosch probably witnessed; presumably, this fire provided inspiration for the fiery hell-scapes that would later make Bosch famous.\n\nUntil 1520, the city flourished, becoming the second largest population centre in the territory of the present Netherlands, after [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The city was also a center of music, and composers, such as [[Jheronimus Clibano]], received their training at its churches. Others held positions there: [[Matthaeus Pipelare]] was musical director at the Confraternity of Our Lady; and renowned Habsburg copyist and composer [[Pierre Alamire]] did much of his work at 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\n===Eighty Years' War===\nThe wars of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed the course of the city's history. It became an independent [[bishopric]]. During the [[Eighty Years' War]], the city took the side of the [[Habsburg]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) authorities and thwarted a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] coup. It was besieged several times by Prince [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice]] of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]], [[stadtholder]] of most of the [[Dutch Republic]], who wanted to bring 's-Hertogenbosch under the rule of the rebel United Provinces. The city was successfully defended by [[Claude de Berlaymont]], also known as [[Haultpenne]].\n\n===Thirty Years' War===\n\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical population\n|align       = left\n|cols        = \n|pop_name    = \n|percentages = pagr\n|footnote    = \n|source      = {{Harvnb|Lourens|Lucassen|1997|pp=45\u201346}}\n|1374|14526\n|1438|12973\n|1464|10507\n|1473|10579\n|1480|13185\n|1496|15552\n|1526|18571\n|1560|17500\n|1600|18000\n|1665|9000\n|1747|12574\n|1795|12841\n}}\n\nIn the years of Truce, before the renewed fighting after 1618, the fortifications were greatly expanded. The surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, and the fortress, deemed impregnable, was nicknamed the Marsh Dragon. The town was nevertheless finally conquered by [[Frederik Hendrik of Orange]] in 1629 in a typically Dutch stratagem: he diverted the rivers Dommel and Aa, created a [[polder]] by constructing a forty-kilometre [[dike (construction)|dyke]] and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender\u2014an enormous blow to Habsburg geo-political strategy during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. This surrender cut the town off from the rest of the duchy and the area was treated by the Republic as an [[occupation zone]] without political liberties (see also [[Generality Lands]]).\n\n===Louis XIV to Bonaparte===\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], the fortifications were again expanded. In 1672, the Dutch ''[[rampjaar]]'', the city held against the army of [[Louis XIV of France]]. In 1794, French revolutionary troops under command of [[Charles Pichegru]] took the city with hardly a fight: in the [[Batavian Republic]], both Catholics and ''Brabanders'' at last gained equal rights.\n\nFrom 1806, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and from 1810, it was incorporated into the [[First French Empire]]. It was captured by the [[Prussia]]ns in 1814.\n\n===Kingdom of the Netherlands===\nThe next year, 1815, when the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, it became the capital of [[North Brabant]]. Many newer and more modern fortresses were created in the vicinity of the city. A new canal was built, the 'Zuid-Willemsvaart', which gave the city an economic impulse. Trade, manufacturing and industry grew. Until 1878, it was forbidden to build outside the ramparts. That led to overcrowding and the highest [[infant mortality]] in the kingdom.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the very conservative city government prevented industrial investment to avoid an increase in the number of workers and the establishment of educational institutions: students were regarded as disorderly. As a result, the relative importance of the city diminished.\n\n===World War II and after===\n[[File:Voorgevel - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20110416 - RCE.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Interlanguage link multi|De Moriaan|nl}}]]\nOne of the few official [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] complexes in [[Western Europe]] outside Germany and [[Austria]] was named after 's-Hertogenbosch. It operated from January 1943, to September 1944 and was known to the Germans as [[Herzogenbusch]] (see [[List of subcamps of Herzogenbusch]]). About 30,000 inmates were interned in the complex during this time, of whom about 12,000&nbsp;were [[Jew]]s. In the Netherlands, this camp is known as 'Kamp [[Vught]]', because the concentration camp was actually located at a heath near Vught, a village a few kilometres south of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nIt was conquered by the Germans in [[World War II]] in 1940 and occupied by them for over four years. The allies struck back - the railway station was bombed by planes of the [[Royal Air Force]] on 16 September 1944. The city was liberated between 24\u201327&nbsp;October 1944&nbsp;during [[Operation Pheasant]] by [[British Army|British soldiers]] of [[major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Robert Knox Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Knox Ross]]'s [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]] after [[major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Donald Bremner (British Army officer)|Donald Bremner]] of the 1st Battalion, [[East Lancashire Regiment]], of [[158th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|158th Infantry Brigade]], had already routed the enemy on 23-24 October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rory Bremner salutes his East Lancashire war hero dad |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |website=Lancashire Telegraph |accessdate=2015-04-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404172449/http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |archivedate=2015-04-04 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, 's-Hertogenbosch was modernized, like many other cities in the Netherlands. It was probably only geography that shielded the old town from rigorous reconstruction in those early years. Just in time, the pendulum swung over to protecting the history of the city. In 1956, the council wanted to demolish the Moriaan, the oldest brick building in the Netherlands, to give traffic better access to the market square. The permit was refused by the government and instead the building was restored, starting in 1963. Later, city councils became much more aware of the value of historic buildings and from about the turn of the millennium, the historic fortifications are also given much attention by the authorities.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:sHertogenbosch-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Dutch Topographic map of 's-Hertogenbosch, as of March 2014]]\n\n=== Population centres ===\nThe population centres in the municipality are: [[Bokhoven]], [[Crevecoeur('s-Hertogenbosch)|Crevecoeur]], [[Deuteren]] (former village), [[Dieskant]], [[Empel]], [[Engelen ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Engelen]], [[Gewande]], 's-Hertogenbosch, [[Hintham]], [[Kruisstraat ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Kruisstraat]], [[Maliskamp]], [[Meerwijk]], [[Orthen]] (former village), [[Oud-Empel]], and [[Rosmalen]].\n\n===Climate===\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

It is currently the fourth city of [[Noord Brabant]]. It is home to many national and international businesses such as [[Heineken]], [[Epic Systems|Epic]], [[Tyco International]], [[SAP SE|SAP]] and many others.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Overzicht - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20110195 - RCE.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Typical street in 's-Hertogenbosch]]\n's-Hertogenbosch is home to a variety of events such as the theatre festival ''Boulevard'', ''[[Jazz in Duketown]]'', and hip hop in duketown, the start of the [[Tour de France]] (1996), [[Tour Feminin]] (1997), the [['s-Hertogenbosch International Vocal Competition|International Vocal Competition]], [[November Music]] (a contemporary music festival) and the UNICEF Open (formerly the [[Ordina Open]]) grass court tennis tournament (in the nearby town of [[Rosmalen]]). There are also over 350 restaurants, pubs and caf\u00e9s to be found in the city.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch is also home to the European Ceramic Work Centre. This is a juried international ceramic residency where they invite artists, designers and architects from around to the world to explore the medium of Ceramics. This program was initially started in 1991 and continues to this day.\n\nThe city has its own food speciality, the [[Bossche Bol]]\u2014effectively a giant [[profiterole]], somewhat larger than a tennis ball, which is filled with whipped cream and coated with chocolate.\n\nThe spoken language is [[Maasland]]s (The variant spoken in 's-Hertogenbosch is called ''Bosch'' which is placed among the Central North [[Brabantian]] dialects, although other classification systems also describe it as [[East Brabantian]]), which is very similar to colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oost-Brabants|last=Swanenberg|first=Jos|last2=Swanenberg|first2=Cor|publisher=Sdu Uitgevers|year=2002|isbn=9789012090100|series=Taal in stad en land, 7.|location=Den Haag|pages=|language=Dutch|oclc=783055844|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[De Toonzaal]] is a [[music venue]] for [[chamber music]], [[improvised music]], and [[experimental music]]. For popular music there is the venue [[W2 Concertzaal|W2]] (or Willem II).\n\n===Carnival celebrations===\n[[File:PeervaandenMuggenheuvel.jpg|thumb|right|Mayor Ton Rombouts, the Mayor of Oeteldonk, and the prince at City Hall in 2007]]\n's-Hertogenbosch has a strong carnival tradition. In its current form the story and symbolism dates from 1881-1883. In these years some citizens created the legend of \"Oeteldonk\", whereby the city was renamed to Oeteldonk for the three day carnival. \"Donk\" is a reference to a dry place in the [[marsh]]. The frog is widely used as a symbol during the 's-Hertogenbosch Carnival. It's also a symbol of the Oeteldonk [[Marsh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oetelpedia.nl/wiki/index.php/Oeteldonk |title=Oeteldonk \u2013 Oetelpedia |language=Dutch |publisher=Oetelpedia.nl |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> It was also a remark aimed at Bishop Godschalk from Den Dungen, where 'Van den Oetelaar' was a common family name. He had wanted to forbid the traditional festivities of [[Shrove Tuesday]] that often led to excesses. \n\nOeteldonk is a village and therefore every inhabitant is a farmer or a girl. The village is headed by the Mayor of Oeteldonk \"Peer vaan den Muggenheuvel tot den Bobberd\". Each year the mayor of 's-Hertogenbosch hands over his authority to the Mayor of Oeteldonk. On Sunday at 11:11 AM the Mayor of Oeteldonk then receives Prince Carnaval \"Prince Amadeiro XXV\" at Oeteldonk central station. From there a parade of all carnival clubs escorts the company to the town hall.\n\nThe citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch wear traditional outfits throughout these days. A so-called ''boerenkiel'' is worn and every year patches are designed according to that years theme which can then be stitched onto the outfit. The ''boerenkiel'' is often combined with a traditional farmers bandana and a long scarf in the colors of Oeteldonk. The tradition of the Boerenkiel and / or Bandana is very different from the carnival traditions in the rest of the Netherlands. Other aspects like the parade, the temporary name and the temporary flag (for Oeteldonk red - white - and - yellow) are very similar.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Sint-Jans-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]]]]\n's-Hertogenbosch was founded as a fortified city and that heritage can still be seen today. After World War II, plans were made to modernise the old city, by filling in the canals, removing or modifying some ramparts and redeveloping historic neighbourhoods. Before these plans could come to effect however, the central government declared the city a protected townscape. Most historic elements have been preserved. In contrast to cities like [[Rotterdam]], 's-Hertogenbosch also survived the [[World War II|Second World War]] relatively unscathed. Much of its historic heritage remains intact, and today there are always renovations going on in the city to preserve the many old buildings, fortifications, churches and statues for later generations.\n\n=== The city center ===\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Rijksmonument 21719 Stadhuis, Markt 1.JPG|left|thumb|City Hall of 's-Hertogenbosch]]\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Marktplein - Den Bosch Markt.jpg|thumb|Market square]]\nThe city center has a cozy atmosphere because of the almost continuous ramparts that still surround it. It has been molded by the multiple rivers that convene on 's-Hertogenbosch, giving the center its strange street plan so different from the usual [[grid plan]], where streets meet at right angles.  The center is dominated by [[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]] (''Sint Jans kathedraal'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), which dates from c. 1220 and is best known for its [[Brabantine Gothic]] design and the many sculptures of craftsmen that are sitting on almost every arc and rim along the outside of the cathedral. In 2010 an extensive restoration was completed, undoing the damage of many years of wear-and-tear and [[acid rain]].\n\nOn the central square is the oldest remaining brick house of the Netherlands, 'de Moriaan',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/moriaan/ Teletijd.nl: 'De Moriaan' before and after renovation]</ref> which was built at the beginning of the 13th century. In the 1960s, de Moriaan was renovated to its former glory based on a famous 16th-century Dutch painting called 'De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch' ('The fabric market of 's-Hertogenbosch').<ref>[https://archive.org/details/DeLakenmarktTeu2019sHertogenboschCirca1530 Painting: De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch]</ref> The town hall is an originally 14th-century Gothic building. After the town was conquered by the Dutch Republic in 1629, it got a new facade in the style of the [[Dutch Baroque architecture]]. It showcased the authority of the new masters, just like the new town hall in Maastricht would. \n\nHidden below the old city is a [[canal]] network called the [[Binnendieze]], which once spanned {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}}. It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times. Due to lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. Later, the Binnendieze functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth part of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.  \n\n=== The fortifications === \n[[File:Stadsmuurdenboschnl.jpg|thumb|left|City rampart]]\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch - Citadellaan - Vestingwerken.jpg|thumb|[[:nl:Citadel van 's-Hertogenbosch|Citadel of 's-Hertogenbosch]]]]\n[[File:Boze Griet.JPG|thumb|''Boze Griet'', a forged cannon from 1510 in the ''Bastionder'']]\n's-Hertogenbosch has an extensive and almost complete fifteenth to seventeenth century city fortification. It was made to profit from the city's strong defensive position' laying on a sandy hill in the center of a large swamp fed by many rivers. This also caused that the main ramparts were preserved, because they were crucial in keeping out the water. In 2004 the city was awarded the title ''European Fortress City of the year''. In the years that followed it restored many of the city defenses to much of their old glory. \n\nApart from small sections of medieval walls, the main structure of the fortification is a late medieval (fifteenth century) wall. The upper sections were removed when cannon became more powerful, and polygonal [[Bastion fort|bastions]] were added, some after the conquest by the republic. Most of these have not been restored to their original height, but do maintain their brick walls. The citadel in the north west of the city does retain its original height. Around the city itself many other fortresses can still be seen.\n\nIn the north east of the old city, the hexagonal powder arsenal, or ''Kruithuis'',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/kruithuis/ Teletijd.nl: Kruithuis inner court]</ref> still exists, one of only two of its kind in the country. It is planned to become the museum of fortress 's-Hertogenbosch. One of the bastions of the fortress now houses the mini museum [[Bastion Oranje ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Bastionder]]. It has been dug out in a bastion of the south side. On the inside it shows a unique cannon, and an older bastion that was walled in by the current one.\n\n=== Museums === \nMuseums are the [[Stedelijk Museum 's-Hertogenbosch]], [[Noordbrabants Museum]], [[Jheronimus Bosch Art Center]] and [[Museum Slager]]. The painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (c. 1450\u20131516) remains probably the best known citizen of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\n=== Nature === \n[[File:Sint-Janskathedraal, Het Bossche Broek, 's-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|View on the St. Jan from Bossche Broek]]\nOn the south side of the city, the city center and walls still border the Bossche Broek, an old [[polder]] that could never be made dry. In 1995 the dyke of the Dommel broke and an enormous amount of water entered the polder. It also flooded and blocked the main Dutch highway A2. In order to prevent this in the future, the area was rearranged to store access water in case of emergencies. In 2006 the area had been furnished with higher dikes and locks that allowed a controlled flooding of the polder and some adjacent areas.\n\nThe Bossche Broek is now a 202 ha [[nature reserve]], that stretches all the way to [[Vught]]. It is connected to the Moerputten and Vlijmens Ven, with which it forms a [[Natura 2000]] area. Rare species in the area are the [[Scarce large blue]] and the [[Misgurnus fossilis| European weather loach]], but what is really unique about the area is its proximity to a city center.   \n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nThe city is also the location of the ''Bolwoningen'' complex, an array of fifty experimental spherical houses designed by Dries Kreijkamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realestate.aol.com/blog/gallery/the-worlds-ugliest-buildings/#photo-3 |title=The Worlds Ugliest Buildings \u2013 AOL Real Estate |publisher=Realestate.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nThe city has one professional football club, [[FC Den Bosch]] It is the 1967 successor of the professional branches of BVV (Bossche Voetbal Vereniging) and Wilhelmina. Both of them still exist as amateur football clubs. As a successor of BVV FC Den Bosch can claim the national championship of 1948. This championship led to the construction of stadium [[De Vliert]], which at one time had a capacity of 30,000. Due to the less successful years that followed, the capacity is now only 8,500 visitors. FC Den Bosch was the first club of Dutch international player [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]]). \n\n's-Hertogenbosch is more successful in field hockey. It is home to top club [[HC 's-Hertogenbosch|HC Den Bosch]]. The women's team in particular kind of dominates the Dutch field hockey competition. The professional basketball club [[EiffelTowers Den Bosch|New Heroes Den Bosch]] is also very successful. The city's rugby team is called [http://www.dukesrugby.nl The Dukes]. It became the national rugby champion in 2008. \n\nAs regards events the city is host to the [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships]], a combined [[ATP Tour]] and [[WTA Tour]] grass court tennis event played two weeks before the [[Wimbledon Championships]]. The [[World Archery Championships]] and [[World Para Archery Championship]] were held here in June 2019. During these combined World Championships two separate venues were used: the Parade and the rugby fields of The Dukes. All finals took place in the arena at the Parade. The Parade is a historic square surrounded by high trees, situated at the foot of the nearly seven hundred-year-old Saint John's Cathedral in the attractive center of \u2019s-Hertogenbosch.\n\n==Transport==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:\u00b4s-Hertogenbosch, station \u00b4s-Hertogenbosch foto6 2016-01-23 09.53.jpg|thumb|right|[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]]]]\nThe [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]] runs from the Meuse just north of the city towards Maastricht via Helmond and Weert. In 's-Hertogenbosch it runs through the city proper, south east from where a bastion has been cut off from the citadel. Because of this route it was impossible to widen it further than for ships of [[Classification of European Inland Waterways|CEMT]] class II. Therefore the M\u00e1ximakanaal of 8 km was dug just east of the city, creating a shortcut from the canal to the Meuse suitable for ships of CEMT class IV. On the remaining part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart west of the city is the industrial harbor of 's-Hertogenbosch. A marina is located in the center.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch is situated on the busy [[A2_motorway_(Netherlands)|A2 motorway]], the most important north-south connection of the Netherlands. From 1961 the Utrecht-'s-Hertogenbosch section was 2 times 2 lanes. In 1989 it finally became a [[controlled-access highway]]. In 1996 the section between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Eindhoven]] became a controlled-access highway. The situation in [[Maastricht]] was only solved in 2016, when the [[Koning Willem-Alexandertunnel]] was opened. On the east-west axis 's-Hertogenbosch is on the [[A59 motorway (Netherlands)]]. The [[A65 motorway (Netherlands)|A65 motorway]] between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Tilburg]] is a regional highway, but is not completely access-controlled.\n\n[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]] is on the [[Utrecht\u2013Boxtel railway| Utrecht\u2013Boxtel part]] of the railway stretch between Amsterdam and the Dutch industrial/tech center near Eindhoven. As a consequence north-south trains depart every ten minutes. On the [[Tilburg\u2013Nijmegen railway]] trains run on a more modest schedule. 's-Hertogenbosch railway station is also a major station for [[Arriva]] buslines that serve the city and most of its suburbs. Other stations within the limits of the municipality are [['s-Hertogenbosch Oost railway station]] and [[Rosmalen railway station]]. [[Vught railway station]] is actually closer to the city center than that in Rosmalen.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch has attempted to adapt to the growing popularity of the bicycle in Dutch cities. A reasonable amount of bike paths has so far been constructed in the town. In 2011, the city was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands#The Netherlands.27 top cycling city|Fietsstad 2011]]'' \u2014 the top bike city of the Netherlands for 2011. The details of the report were less jubilant and showed that it was really a prize meant to stimulate 's-Hertogenbosch to take further action: ''In the past years Den Bosch has spent much energy, ambition, creativity and money to give cycling an enormous boost. This is a big achievement for a city where bicycle use is '''lower''' than in the rest of the Netherlands''(cyclist union).<ref>{{cite news |url= https://nos.nl/artikel/314111-den-bosch-fietsstad-van-2011.html |title= Den Bosch fietsstad van 2011 |trans-title = 's-Hertogenbosch bicycle city 2011 | lang=nl |date= 2011-11-17 |publisher= NOS }}</ref> :Hugo van der Steenhoven of the Fietsersbond.\n\n==Education==\n's-Hertogenbosch has multiple [[vocational university|Vocational universities]] called 'Hogeschool' in Dutch. The [[HAS University of Applied Sciences|HAS Hogeschool]] of about 3,500 students is focused on agricultural and food technology.

It is the capital of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of 's-Hertogenbosch}}\n\nThe city's official name is a contraction of the (archaic) [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''des Hertogen bosch''\u2014\"the Duke's forest\". The duke in question was [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry I]] of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], whose family had owned a large estate at nearby Orthen for at least four centuries. He founded a new town located on some forested dunes in the middle of a marsh. At age 26, he granted 's-Hertogenbosch [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is, however, the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original [[charter]] has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from [[Gelre]] and [[Holland]]; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls may still be seen. \n\n[[File:Braun s-Hertogenbosch UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'s-Hertogenbosch in the 16th century]]\nIn the late 14th century, a much larger wall was erected to protect the greatly expanded settled area. Artificial waterways were dug to serve as a city moat, through which the rivers [[Dommel]] and [[Aa River (Meuse)|Aa]] were diverted. 's-Hertogenbosch became the birthplace and home of one of the greatest painters of the [[northern Renaissance]] period, [[Hieronymus Bosch]], The town suffered a catastrophic fire in 1463, which the then (approximately) 13-year-old Bosch probably witnessed; presumably, this fire provided inspiration for the fiery hell-scapes that would later make Bosch famous.\n\nUntil 1520, the city flourished, becoming the second largest population centre in the territory of the present Netherlands, after [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The city was also a center of music, and composers, such as [[Jheronimus Clibano]], received their training at its churches. Others held positions there: [[Matthaeus Pipelare]] was musical director at the Confraternity of Our Lady; and renowned Habsburg copyist and composer [[Pierre Alamire]] did much of his work at 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\n===Eighty Years' War===\nThe wars of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed the course of the city's history. It became an independent [[bishopric]]. During the [[Eighty Years' War]], the city took the side of the [[Habsburg]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) authorities and thwarted a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] coup. It was besieged several times by Prince [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice]] of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]], [[stadtholder]] of most of the [[Dutch Republic]], who wanted to bring 's-Hertogenbosch under the rule of the rebel United Provinces. The city was successfully defended by [[Claude de Berlaymont]], also known as [[Haultpenne]].\n\n===Thirty Years' War===\n\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical population\n|align       = left\n|cols        = \n|pop_name    = \n|percentages = pagr\n|footnote    = \n|source      = {{Harvnb|Lourens|Lucassen|1997|pp=45\u201346}}\n|1374|14526\n|1438|12973\n|1464|10507\n|1473|10579\n|1480|13185\n|1496|15552\n|1526|18571\n|1560|17500\n|1600|18000\n|1665|9000\n|1747|12574\n|1795|12841\n}}\n\nIn the years of Truce, before the renewed fighting after 1618, the fortifications were greatly expanded. The surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, and the fortress, deemed impregnable, was nicknamed the Marsh Dragon. The town was nevertheless finally conquered by [[Frederik Hendrik of Orange]] in 1629 in a typically Dutch stratagem: he diverted the rivers Dommel and Aa, created a [[polder]] by constructing a forty-kilometre [[dike (construction)|dyke]] and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender\u2014an enormous blow to Habsburg geo-political strategy during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. This surrender cut the town off from the rest of the duchy and the area was treated by the Republic as an [[occupation zone]] without political liberties (see also [[Generality Lands]]).\n\n===Louis XIV to Bonaparte===\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], the fortifications were again expanded. In 1672, the Dutch ''[[rampjaar]]'', the city held against the army of [[Louis XIV of France]]. In 1794, French revolutionary troops under command of [[Charles Pichegru]] took the city with hardly a fight: in the [[Batavian Republic]], both Catholics and ''Brabanders'' at last gained equal rights.\n\nFrom 1806, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and from 1810, it was incorporated into the [[First French Empire]]. It was captured by the [[Prussia]]ns in 1814.\n\n===Kingdom of the Netherlands===\nThe next year, 1815, when the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, it became the capital of [[North Brabant]]. Many newer and more modern fortresses were created in the vicinity of the city. A new canal was built, the 'Zuid-Willemsvaart', which gave the city an economic impulse. Trade, manufacturing and industry grew. Until 1878, it was forbidden to build outside the ramparts. That led to overcrowding and the highest [[infant mortality]] in the kingdom.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the very conservative city government prevented industrial investment to avoid an increase in the number of workers and the establishment of educational institutions: students were regarded as disorderly. As a result, the relative importance of the city diminished.\n\n===World War II and after===\n[[File:Voorgevel - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20110416 - RCE.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Interlanguage link multi|De Moriaan|nl}}]]\nOne of the few official [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] complexes in [[Western Europe]] outside Germany and [[Austria]] was named after 's-Hertogenbosch. It operated from January 1943, to September 1944 and was known to the Germans as [[Herzogenbusch]] (see [[List of subcamps of Herzogenbusch]]). About 30,000 inmates were interned in the complex during this time, of whom about 12,000&nbsp;were [[Jew]]s. In the Netherlands, this camp is known as 'Kamp [[Vught]]', because the concentration camp was actually located at a heath near Vught, a village a few kilometres south of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nIt was conquered by the Germans in [[World War II]] in 1940 and occupied by them for over four years. The allies struck back - the railway station was bombed by planes of the [[Royal Air Force]] on 16 September 1944. The city was liberated between 24\u201327&nbsp;October 1944&nbsp;during [[Operation Pheasant]] by [[British Army|British soldiers]] of [[major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Robert Knox Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Knox Ross]]'s [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]] after [[major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Donald Bremner (British Army officer)|Donald Bremner]] of the 1st Battalion, [[East Lancashire Regiment]], of [[158th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|158th Infantry Brigade]], had already routed the enemy on 23-24 October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rory Bremner salutes his East Lancashire war hero dad |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |website=Lancashire Telegraph |accessdate=2015-04-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404172449/http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |archivedate=2015-04-04 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter the war 's-Hertogenbosch was modernized just like many other cities in the Netherlands. It was probably only geography that shielded the old town from rigorous reconstruction in the first years. Just in time the pendulum switched to protecting the history of the city. In 1956 the council wanted to demolish the Moriaan, the oldest brick building of the Netherlands, just to give traffic better access to the market square. The permit was refused by the government and instead the building was restored from 1963. Later city councils were much more aware of the value of historic buildings and from about the turn of the millennium the historic fortifications also get much attention from the city. \n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:sHertogenbosch-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Dutch Topographic map of 's-Hertogenbosch, as of March 2014]]\n\n=== Population centres ===\nThe population centres in the municipality are: [[Bokhoven]], [[Crevecoeur('s-Hertogenbosch)|Crevecoeur]], [[Deuteren]] (former village), [[Dieskant]], [[Empel]], [[Engelen ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Engelen]], [[Gewande]], 's-Hertogenbosch, [[Hintham]], [[Kruisstraat ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Kruisstraat]], [[Maliskamp]], [[Meerwijk]], [[Orthen]] (former village), [[Oud-Empel]], and [[Rosmalen]].\n\n===Climate===\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

It is currently the fourth city of [[Noord Brabant]]. It is home to many national and international businesses such as [[Heineken]], [[Epic Systems|Epic]], [[Tyco International]], [[SAP SE|SAP]] and many others.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Overzicht - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20110195 - RCE.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Typical street in 's-Hertogenbosch]]\n's-Hertogenbosch is home to a variety of events such as the theatre festival ''Boulevard'', ''[[Jazz in Duketown]]'', and hip hop in duketown, the start of the [[Tour de France]] (1996), [[Tour Feminin]] (1997), the [['s-Hertogenbosch International Vocal Competition|International Vocal Competition]], [[November Music]] (a contemporary music festival) and the UNICEF Open (formerly the [[Ordina Open]]) grass court tennis tournament (in the nearby town of [[Rosmalen]]). There are also over 350 restaurants, pubs and caf\u00e9s to be found in the city.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch is also home to the European Ceramic Work Centre. This is a juried international ceramic residency where they invite artists, designers and architects from around to the world to explore the medium of Ceramics. This program was initially started in 1991 and continues to this day.\n\nThe city has its own food speciality, the [[Bossche Bol]]\u2014effectively a giant [[profiterole]], somewhat larger than a tennis ball, which is filled with whipped cream and coated with chocolate.\n\nThe spoken language is [[Maasland]]s (The variant spoken in 's-Hertogenbosch is called ''Bosch'' which is placed among the Central North [[Brabantian]] dialects, although other classification systems also describe it as [[East Brabantian]]), which is very similar to colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oost-Brabants|last=Swanenberg|first=Jos|last2=Swanenberg|first2=Cor|publisher=Sdu Uitgevers|year=2002|isbn=9789012090100|series=Taal in stad en land, 7.|location=Den Haag|pages=|language=Dutch|oclc=783055844|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[De Toonzaal]] is a [[music venue]] for [[chamber music]], [[improvised music]], and [[experimental music]]. For popular music there is the venue [[W2 Concertzaal|W2]] (or Willem II).\n\n===Carnival celebrations===\n[[File:PeervaandenMuggenheuvel.jpg|thumb|right|Mayor Ton Rombouts, the Mayor of Oeteldonk, and the prince at City Hall in 2007]]\n's-Hertogenbosch has a strong carnival tradition. In its current form the story and symbolism dates from 1881-1883. In these years some citizens created the legend of \"Oeteldonk\", whereby the city was renamed to Oeteldonk for the three day carnival. \"Donk\" is a reference to a dry place in the [[marsh]]. The frog is widely used as a symbol during the 's-Hertogenbosch Carnival. It's also a symbol of the Oeteldonk [[Marsh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oetelpedia.nl/wiki/index.php/Oeteldonk |title=Oeteldonk \u2013 Oetelpedia |language=Dutch |publisher=Oetelpedia.nl |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> It was also a remark aimed at Bishop Godschalk from Den Dungen, where 'Van den Oetelaar' was a common family name. He had wanted to forbid the traditional festivities of [[Shrove Tuesday]] that often led to excesses. \n\nOeteldonk is a village and therefore every inhabitant is a farmer or a girl. The village is headed by the Mayor of Oeteldonk \"Peer vaan den Muggenheuvel tot den Bobberd\". Each year the mayor of 's-Hertogenbosch hands over his authority to the Mayor of Oeteldonk. On Sunday at 11:11 AM the Mayor of Oeteldonk then receives Prince Carnaval \"Prince Amadeiro XXV\" at Oeteldonk central station. From there a parade of all carnival clubs escorts the company to the town hall.\n\nThe citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch wear traditional outfits throughout these days. A so-called ''boerenkiel'' is worn and every year patches are designed according to that years theme which can then be stitched onto the outfit. The ''boerenkiel'' is often combined with a traditional farmers bandana and a long scarf in the colors of Oeteldonk. The tradition of the Boerenkiel and / or Bandana is very different from the carnival traditions in the rest of the Netherlands. Other aspects like the parade, the temporary name and the temporary flag (for Oeteldonk red - white - and - yellow) are very similar.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Sint-Jans-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]]]]\n's-Hertogenbosch was founded as a fortified city and that heritage can still be seen today. After World War II, plans were made to modernise the old city, by filling in the canals, removing or modifying some ramparts and redeveloping historic neighbourhoods. Before these plans could come to effect however, the central government declared the city a protected townscape. Most historic elements have been preserved. In contrast to cities like [[Rotterdam]], 's-Hertogenbosch also survived the [[World War II|Second World War]] relatively unscathed. Much of its historic heritage remains intact, and today there are always renovations going on in the city to preserve the many old buildings, fortifications, churches and statues for later generations.\n\n=== The city center ===\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Rijksmonument 21719 Stadhuis, Markt 1.JPG|left|thumb|City Hall of 's-Hertogenbosch]]\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Marktplein - Den Bosch Markt.jpg|thumb|Market square]]\nThe city center has a cozy atmosphere because of the almost continuous ramparts that still surround it. It has been molded by the multiple rivers that convene on 's-Hertogenbosch, giving the center its strange street plan so different from the usual [[grid plan]], where streets meet at right angles.  The center is dominated by [[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]] (''Sint Jans kathedraal'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), which dates from c. 1220 and is best known for its [[Brabantine Gothic]] design and the many sculptures of craftsmen that are sitting on almost every arc and rim along the outside of the cathedral. In 2010 an extensive restoration was completed, undoing the damage of many years of wear-and-tear and [[acid rain]].\n\nOn the central square is the oldest remaining brick house of the Netherlands, 'de Moriaan',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/moriaan/ Teletijd.nl: 'De Moriaan' before and after renovation]</ref> which was built at the beginning of the 13th century. In the 1960s, de Moriaan was renovated to its former glory based on a famous 16th-century Dutch painting called 'De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch' ('The fabric market of 's-Hertogenbosch').<ref>[https://archive.org/details/DeLakenmarktTeu2019sHertogenboschCirca1530 Painting: De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch]</ref> The town hall is an originally 14th-century Gothic building. After the town was conquered by the Dutch Republic in 1629, it got a new facade in the style of the [[Dutch Baroque architecture]]. It showcased the authority of the new masters, just like the new town hall in Maastricht would. \n\nHidden below the old city is a [[canal]] network called the [[Binnendieze]], which once spanned {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}}. It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times. Due to lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. Later, the Binnendieze functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth part of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.  \n\n=== The fortifications === \n[[File:Stadsmuurdenboschnl.jpg|thumb|left|City rampart]]\n[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch - Citadellaan - Vestingwerken.jpg|thumb|[[:nl:Citadel van 's-Hertogenbosch|Citadel of 's-Hertogenbosch]]]]\n[[File:Boze Griet.JPG|thumb|''Boze Griet'', a forged cannon from 1510 in the ''Bastionder'']]\n's-Hertogenbosch has an extensive and almost complete fifteenth to seventeenth century city fortification. It was made to profit from the city's strong defensive position' laying on a sandy hill in the center of a large swamp fed by many rivers. This also caused that the main ramparts were preserved, because they were crucial in keeping out the water. In 2004 the city was awarded the title ''European Fortress City of the year''. In the years that followed it restored many of the city defenses to much of their old glory. \n\nApart from small sections of medieval walls, the main structure of the fortification is a late medieval (fifteenth century) wall. The upper sections were removed when cannon became more powerful, and polygonal [[Bastion fort|bastions]] were added, some after the conquest by the republic. Most of these have not been restored to their original height, but do maintain their brick walls. The citadel in the north west of the city does retain its original height. Around the city itself many other fortresses can still be seen.\n\nIn the north east of the old city, the hexagonal powder arsenal, or ''Kruithuis'',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/kruithuis/ Teletijd.nl: Kruithuis inner court]</ref> still exists, one of only two of its kind in the country. It is planned to become the museum of fortress 's-Hertogenbosch. One of the bastions of the fortress now houses the mini museum [[Bastion Oranje ('s-Hertogenbosch)|Bastionder]]. It has been dug out in a bastion of the south side. On the inside it shows a unique cannon, and an older bastion that was walled in by the current one.\n\n=== Museums === \nMuseums are the [[Stedelijk Museum 's-Hertogenbosch]], [[Noordbrabants Museum]], [[Jheronimus Bosch Art Center]] and [[Museum Slager]]. The painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (c. 1450\u20131516) remains probably the best known citizen of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\n=== Nature === \n[[File:Sint-Janskathedraal, Het Bossche Broek, 's-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|View on the St. Jan from Bossche Broek]]\nOn the south side of the city, the city center and walls still border the Bossche Broek, an old [[polder]] that could never be made dry. In 1995 the dyke of the Dommel broke and an enormous amount of water entered the polder. It also flooded and blocked the main Dutch highway A2. In order to prevent this in the future, the area was rearranged to store access water in case of emergencies. In 2006 the area had been furnished with higher dikes and locks that allowed a controlled flooding of the polder and some adjacent areas.\n\nThe Bossche Broek is now a 202 ha [[nature reserve]], that stretches all the way to [[Vught]]. It is connected to the Moerputten and Vlijmens Ven, with which it forms a [[Natura 2000]] area. Rare species in the area are the [[Scarce large blue]] and the [[Misgurnus fossilis| European weather loach]], but what is really unique about the area is its proximity to a city center.   \n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nThe city is also the location of the ''Bolwoningen'' complex, an array of fifty experimental spherical houses designed by Dries Kreijkamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realestate.aol.com/blog/gallery/the-worlds-ugliest-buildings/#photo-3 |title=The Worlds Ugliest Buildings \u2013 AOL Real Estate |publisher=Realestate.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nThe city has one professional football club, [[FC Den Bosch]] It is the 1967 successor of the professional branches of BVV (Bossche Voetbal Vereniging) and Wilhelmina. Both of them still exist as amateur football clubs. As a successor of BVV FC Den Bosch can claim the national championship of 1948. This championship led to the construction of stadium [[De Vliert]], which at one time had a capacity of 30,000. Due to the less successful years that followed, the capacity is now only 8,500 visitors. FC Den Bosch was the first club of Dutch international player [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]]). \n\n's-Hertogenbosch is more successful in field hockey. It is home to top club [[HC 's-Hertogenbosch|HC Den Bosch]]. The women's team in particular kind of dominates the Dutch field hockey competition. The professional basketball club [[EiffelTowers Den Bosch|New Heroes Den Bosch]] is also very successful. The city's rugby team is called [http://www.dukesrugby.nl The Dukes]. It became the national rugby champion in 2008. \n\nAs regards events the city is host to the [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships]], a combined [[ATP Tour]] and [[WTA Tour]] grass court tennis event played two weeks before the [[Wimbledon Championships]]. The [[World Archery Championships]] and [[World Para Archery Championship]] were held here in June 2019. During these combined World Championships two separate venues were used: the Parade and the rugby fields of The Dukes. All finals took place in the arena at the Parade. The Parade is a historic square surrounded by high trees, situated at the foot of the nearly seven hundred-year-old Saint John's Cathedral in the attractive center of \u2019s-Hertogenbosch.\n\n==Transport==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:\u00b4s-Hertogenbosch, station \u00b4s-Hertogenbosch foto6 2016-01-23 09.53.jpg|thumb|right|[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]]]]\nThe [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]] runs from the Meuse just north of the city towards Maastricht via Helmond and Weert. In 's-Hertogenbosch it runs through the city proper, south east from where a bastion has been cut off from the citadel. Because of this route it was impossible to widen it further than for ships of [[Classification of European Inland Waterways|CEMT]] class II. Therefore the M\u00e1ximakanaal of 8 km was dug just east of the city, creating a shortcut from the canal to the Meuse suitable for ships of CEMT class IV. On the remaining part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart west of the city is the industrial harbor of 's-Hertogenbosch. A marina is located in the center.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch is situated on the busy [[A2_motorway_(Netherlands)|A2 motorway]], the most important north-south connection of the Netherlands. From 1961 the Utrecht-'s-Hertogenbosch section was 2 times 2 lanes. In 1989 it finally became a [[controlled-access highway]]. In 1996 the section between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Eindhoven]] became a controlled-access highway. The situation in [[Maastricht]] was only solved in 2016, when the [[Koning Willem-Alexandertunnel]] was opened. On the east-west axis 's-Hertogenbosch is on the [[A59 motorway (Netherlands)]]. The [[A65 motorway (Netherlands)|A65 motorway]] between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Tilburg]] is a regional highway, but is not completely access-controlled.\n\n[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]] is on the [[Utrecht\u2013Boxtel railway| Utrecht\u2013Boxtel part]] of the railway stretch between Amsterdam and the Dutch industrial/tech center near Eindhoven. As a consequence north-south trains depart every ten minutes. On the [[Tilburg\u2013Nijmegen railway]] trains run on a more modest schedule. 's-Hertogenbosch railway station is also a major station for [[Arriva]] buslines that serve the city and most of its suburbs. Other stations within the limits of the municipality are [['s-Hertogenbosch Oost railway station]] and [[Rosmalen railway station]]. [[Vught railway station]] is actually closer to the city center than that in Rosmalen.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch has attempted to adapt to the growing popularity of the bicycle in Dutch cities. A reasonable amount of bike paths has so far been constructed in the town. In 2011, the city was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands#The Netherlands.27 top cycling city|Fietsstad 2011]]'' \u2014 the top bike city of the Netherlands for 2011. The details of the report were less jubilant and showed that it was really a prize meant to stimulate 's-Hertogenbosch to take further action: ''In the past years Den Bosch has spent much energy, ambition, creativity and money to give cycling an enormous boost. This is a big achievement for a city where bicycle use is '''lower''' than in the rest of the Netherlands''(cyclist union).<ref>{{cite news |url= https://nos.nl/artikel/314111-den-bosch-fietsstad-van-2011.html |title= Den Bosch fietsstad van 2011 |trans-title = 's-Hertogenbosch bicycle city 2011 | lang=nl |date= 2011-11-17 |publisher= NOS }}</ref> :Hugo van der Steenhoven of the Fietsersbond.\n\n==Education==\n's-Hertogenbosch has multiple [[vocational university|Vocational universities]] called 'Hogeschool' in Dutch. The [[HAS University of Applied Sciences|HAS Hogeschool]] of about 3,500 students is focused on agricultural and food technology.

Thus, no matter who is elected, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is always part of the government.<ref name=\"2006-09-24\" /> Speaking with broadcaster [[Deutschlandfunk]] in 2007, the former [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician and publicist Albrecht M\u00fcller called the foundation an \"[[anti-democratic]] institution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=2231|title=Deutschlandfunk Zwischent\u00f6ne als Audio \u2013 Ein Experiment bei den Nachdenkseiten (Mitschnitt der Sendung)|date={{date|2007-04-03|mdy}}|website=Nachdenkseiten|language=de|access-date={{date|2016-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the journalist and politician Julika Sandt criticized the growing influence of the Bertelsmann Stiftung on [[German health care]], saying that initiatives developed by the foundation lead to preferential treatment for [[privatized clinic]]s and medical care centers to the detriment of self-employed physicians.

Moreover, he asserts, the annual dividend payment to the foundation is tax-free and, with its annual budget of around \u20ac60 million, the foundation does not spend nearly as much as it costs the state in terms of lost revenue.<ref name=\"2006-09-24\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/macht-ohne-mandat/755580.html|title=Macht ohne Mandat|date={{date|2006-09-24|mdy}}|website=Der Tagesspiegel|language=de|access-date={{date|2016-10-01|mdy}}|author=Harald Schumann}}</ref> Arno Kl\u00f6nne, a sociologist and political scientist, has argued that the Bertelsmann Stiftung's non-profit nature was questionable because, he maintains, it actively promotes the business of the Bertelsmann Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.handelsblatt.com/mediawatcher/2007/06/11/ist-die-bertelsmann-stiftung-noch-gemeinnutzig/|title=Ist die Bertelsmann Stiftung noch gemeinn\u00fctzig?|date={{date|2007-06-11|mdy}}|website=Medienwatcher|publisher=Handelsblatt|language=de|access-date={{date|2016-10-01|mdy}}|author=Hans-Peter Siebenhaar}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=G\u00fctersloher Gemeinn\u00fctzigkeiten|date={{date|2007-10-31|mdy}}|page=10|language=de|author=Hans-Peter Siebenhaar|newspaper=Handelsblatt}}</ref> Ultimately, he suggests, its goal is to manage society using corporate methods and to [[Privatization|privatize]] the tasks that should be handled by the state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Im Sitzen durchs Netzwerk|date={{date|2007-06-09|mdy}}|language=de|author=Stefan Brams|newspaper=Neue Westf\u00e4lische}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, a group of independent legal experts found that the Bertelsmann Stiftung no longer met the requirements for a non-profit organization. On the contrary, they argued, the [[tax exemption]] was unjustly being used for the purpose of carrying out a transformation of society according to the beliefs of the Bertelsmann Stiftung's founder, Reinhard Mohn, by means of private, tax-financed private policy consulting and by bypassing democratic decision making processes through public discourse in Germany's constitutional bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrhz.de/flyer/beitrag.php?id=13431|title=Ist die Bertelsmann Stiftung \"gemeinn\u00fctzig\" im Sinne von \u00a7\u00a7 52 ff.

He debuted in the [[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]], where he won the first two championships of his career. In August 2010, he joined the [[World Wrestling Council]], entering an angle with [[Ray Gonz\u00e1lez]], which evolved in a general feud against all those that are considered cornerstone wrestlers in Puerto Rico. This advanced to a highly publicized contest against [[Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Jos\u00e9 Huertas Gonz\u00e1lez]] at Aniversario 2011. Gilbert later led Team WWC in an invasion against the IWA in July 2011. On October 10, 2014, he defeated [[Carlito Caribbean Cool|Carlito]] to win his fourth [[WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===International Wrestling Association (2009\u20132010)===\nCruz was born in [[Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico]], where he completed his high school education at Rexville Superior in 1994. After wrestling in the independent circuit as part of a team known as The Rutgers, he was first brought to the [[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]] as a face. His first feud was against \"Ravishing\" Richard Rond\u00f3n who assaulted Gilbert, who was planted in the crowd. The angle was elaborated when Rond\u00f3n insulted his wife, prompting several run-ins which saw him being expelled from the events due to being \"an unlicensed fan\". Eventually, a match was set between both, marking his official in-ring debut. He remained active in the midcard during the following months, until he joined \"La Compa\u00f1ia\" the predominant heel faction initially led by [[Savio Vega]] and subsequently by [[Joe Bravo (wrestler)|Joe Bravo]], adopting the \"Future Hall of Fame (Inductee)\" gimmick, which saw him win the [[IWA World Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.com/iwa-cartelera-juicio-final-ricky-cruzz-vs-shane-por-el-campeonato-peso-completo-gilbert-stanley-defienden-ante-faces-of-fear/ |title=IWA: Cartelera \"Juicio Final\" Ricky Cruzz vs Shane por el Campeonato Peso Completo- Gilbert & Stanley defienden ante \"Faces of Fear |publisher=[[S\u00faper Luchas]]|date=April 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref> As this character he began feuding with multiple champions, including the IWRG \"Rey de Reyes\" holder, Ricky Cruz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superluchas.com/cartelera-coliseo-de-aguas-buenas-savio-vega-vs-shane-the-future-hall-of-famer-gilbert-vs-ricky-cruzz/|title=Cartelera Coliseo de Aguas Buenas (16 enero 2010): Savio Vega vs Shane - \u201cThe Future Hall of Famer\u201d Gilbert vs Ricky Cruzz|first=Anthony|last=Pi\u00f1eiro|language=es}}</ref> At Juicio Final 2010, he was pinned to lose the tag team championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.com/iwa-resultados-juicio-final-ricky-cruzz-se-corona-campeon-peso-completo-la-compania-elite-pierde-todos-los-titulos-savio-vega-regresa/ |title=IWA: Resultados Juicio Final Ricky Cruzz se corona Campe\u00f3n Peso Completo- La Compa\u00f1\u00eda Elite pierde todos los t\u00edtulos- Savio Vega regresa! |publisher=Superluchas.com|date=April 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref> Outside of performing, he created a public campaign promoting education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superluchas.com/gilbert-el-futuro-de-la-lucha-libre-presenta-sin-estudios-no-hay-futuro/|title=Gilbert \"El Futuro de la Lucha Libre\" Presenta: \"Sin Estudios No Hay Futuro\"|first=Anthony|last=Pi\u00f1eiro|language=es}}</ref> During the final months of his participation in the IWA, Gilbert won the [[IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]], dropping the belt before leaving the promotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superluchas.com/the-hall-of-fame-gilbert-queda-fuera-de-la-iwa/|title=\"The Future Hall of Fame\" Gilbert queda fuera de la IWA|first=Anthony|last=Pi\u00f1eiro|language=es}}</ref>\n\n===World Wrestling Council (2010\u20132014)===\n[[File:Gilbert vs. Invader Aniversario 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Gilbert vs. Huertas Gonz\u00e1lez at Aniversario 2011]]\nOn July 31, 2010, Gilbert debuted in the [[World Wrestling Council]], interfering in a match and costing [[Ray Gonz\u00e1lez]] the [[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superluchas.com/resultados-la-revolucion-shelton-benjamin-nuevo-campeon-universal-gilbert-aparece-y-le-causa-la-derrota-a-ray-gonzalez-carlito-supera-la-prueba-del-vampiro-canad/|title=Resultados \"La Revoluci\u00f3n\": Shelton Benjamin nuevo Campe\u00f3n Universal \u2013 Gilbert aparece y le causa la derrota a Ray Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 Carlito supera la prueba del Vampiro Canadiense|first=Anthony|last=Pi\u00f1eiro|language=es}}</ref> He continued performing under his real name, but his character evolved into one based on [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Terry Benedict|Terry Benedict]] from the [[Ocean's Trilogy|''Ocean's Eleven'' trilogy]] franchise due to his physical similarity to [[Andy Garc\u00eda]]. During the following weeks, an angle was run where he would pursue Gonz\u00e1lez while prompting the public to \"burn the past\". For his in-ring debut, Gilbert issued an open challenge, defeating jobbers in consecutive contests. However, his first storyline was left inconclusive when Gonz\u00e1lez left the company. Due to this outcome, Joe Bravo was brought in to the promotion, beginning a feud between both due to Gilbert's \"inability to follow orders\".

After wrestling in the independent circuit as part of a team known as The Rutgers, he was first brought to the [[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]] as a face. His first feud was against \"Ravishing\" Richard Rond\u00f3n who assaulted Gilbert, who was planted in the crowd. The angle was elaborated when Rond\u00f3n insulted his wife, prompting several run-ins which saw him being expelled from the events due to being \"an unlicensed fan\". Eventually, a match was set between both, marking his official in-ring debut. He remained active in the midcard during the following months, until he joined \"La Compa\u00f1ia\" the predominant heel faction initially led by [[Savio Vega]] and subsequently by [[Joe Bravo (wrestler)|Joe Bravo]], adopting the \"Future Hall of Fame (Inductee)\" gimmick, which saw him win the [[IWA World Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.com/iwa-cartelera-juicio-final-ricky-cruzz-vs-shane-por-el-campeonato-peso-completo-gilbert-stanley-defienden-ante-faces-of-fear/ |title=IWA: Cartelera \"Juicio Final\" Ricky Cruzz vs Shane por el Campeonato Peso Completo- Gilbert & Stanley defienden ante \"Faces of Fear |publisher=[[S\u00faper Luchas]]|date=April 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref> As this character he began feuding with multiple champions, including the IWRG \"Rey de Reyes\" holder, Ricky Cruz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superluchas.com/cartelera-coliseo-de-aguas-buenas-savio-vega-vs-shane-the-future-hall-of-famer-gilbert-vs-ricky-cruzz/|title=Cartelera Coliseo de Aguas Buenas (16 enero 2010): Savio Vega vs Shane - \u201cThe Future Hall of Famer\u201d Gilbert vs Ricky Cruzz|first=Anthony|last=Pi\u00f1eiro|language=es}}</ref> At Juicio Final 2010, he was pinned to lose the tag team championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.com/iwa-resultados-juicio-final-ricky-cruzz-se-corona-campeon-peso-completo-la-compania-elite-pierde-todos-los-titulos-savio-vega-regresa/ |title=IWA: Resultados Juicio Final Ricky Cruzz se corona Campe\u00f3n Peso Completo- La Compa\u00f1\u00eda Elite pierde todos los t\u00edtulos- Savio Vega regresa! |publisher=Superluchas.com|date=April 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref> Outside of performing, he created a public campaign promoting education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superluchas.com/gilbert-el-futuro-de-la-lucha-libre-presenta-sin-estudios-no-hay-futuro/|title=Gilbert \u201cEl Futuro de la Lucha Libre\u201d Presenta: \u201cSin Estudios No Hay Futuro\u201d|first=Anthony|last=Pi\u00f1eiro|language=es}}</ref> During the final months of his participation in the IWA, Gilbert won the [[IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]], dropping the belt before leaving the promotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superluchas.com/the-hall-of-fame-gilbert-queda-fuera-de-la-iwa/|title=\u201cThe Future Hall of Fame\u201d Gilbert queda fuera de la IWA|first=Anthony|last=Pi\u00f1eiro|language=es}}</ref>\n\n===World Wrestling Council (2010\u20132014)===\n[[File:Gilbert vs. Invader Aniversario 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Gilbert vs. Huertas Gonz\u00e1lez at Aniversario 2011]]\nOn July 31, 2010, Gilbert debuted in the [[World Wrestling Council]], interfering in a match and costing [[Ray Gonz\u00e1lez]] the [[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superluchas.com/resultados-la-revolucion-shelton-benjamin-nuevo-campeon-universal-gilbert-aparece-y-le-causa-la-derrota-a-ray-gonzalez-carlito-supera-la-prueba-del-vampiro-canad/|title=Resultados \u201cLa Revoluci\u00f3n\u201d: Shelton Benjamin nuevo Campe\u00f3n Universal \u2013 Gilbert aparece y le causa la derrota a Ray Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 Carlito supera la prueba del Vampiro Canadiense|first=Anthony|last=Pi\u00f1eiro|language=es}}</ref> He continued performing under his real name, but his character evolved into one based on [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Terry Benedict|Terry Benedict]] from the [[Ocean's Trilogy|''Ocean's Eleven'' trilogy]] franchise due to his physical similarity to [[Andy Garc\u00eda]].

Gilbert lost the FSW World Title after he was stripped off the title by FSW for no-showing a Fighting Spirit Wrestling event which made the title vacant which was later won by the \"Funky Monkey\" Angel Ortiz.\n\n===World Wrestling League (2014\u2013present)===\n[[File:El Sindicato WWC.jpg|thumb|Gilbert mentoring [[Ray Gonz\u00e1lez Jr.]] in 2018.]]\nOn December 13, 2014, Gilbert left WWC and made his debut in the [[World Wrestling League]], where he served as a surprise challenger to WWL World Heavyweight Champion [[Shane Sewell]]. After winning the title with underhanded tactics, the decision was reversed and the match concluded in a disqualification. Originally brought in by Savio Vega, he turned on the former and joined the heel faction known as The Gentlemen's Club. Gilbert was then relegated in the rankings and lost a bid to become the first contender to Germ\u00e1n Figueroa. Afterwards, he participated in an arm wrestling contest against the debuting Chris Angel, assaulting him along several of his allies. Shortly afterwards, Gilbert announced his intention of pursuing the new World Champion, [[Alberto del Rio|Alberto \"El Patr\u00f3n\" del Rio]]. After weeks of backstage confrontation, he defeated Angel in a street fight at Sin Piedad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.primerahora.com/deportes/otros/nota/wwldasuprimerpasopararegresarengrande-1102637/|title=WWL da su primer paso para regresar en grande|date=August 17, 2015|website=Primera Hora}}</ref> Later that evening, Gilbert joined the rest of The Gentlemen's Club and turned on Negr\u00edn, with the group adopting Jos\u00e9 Chaparro as its new leader.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prwrestling.com/nw/resultados-wwl-sin-piedad-en-toa-baja-815/|title=RESULTADOS WWL SIN PIEDAD EN TOA BAJA 8/15 \u2013 PRWrestling \u2013 Noticias WWE, AEW, Lucha Libre de Puerto Rico y M\u00e1s!|website=www.prwrestling.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter a title match between Banderas and Del Rio was announced for Wrestlefest, Gilbert made an announcement where he noted that the envelope granting him a match against the champion at any time was still in his possession. In the weeks leading to the event and after a backstage segment placed him at odds with Banderas, he was officially announced as the special referee for the encounter. While officiating at Wretlefest, Gilbert tried to cash in his opportunity after suddenly using knuckle brasses to steal the pin, but Del Rio interrupted this attempt, which led to the title being held up. Later in the same event, he lost a dog collar match to Chris Angel after Banderas distracted him.\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n*'''Fighting Spirit Wrestling'''\n**FSW World Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\n*'''[[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]]'''\n**[[IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship|IWA Intercontinental Championship]] ([[IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship#Title history|1 time]])   \n**[[IWA World Tag Team Championship]] ([[IWA World Tag Team Championship#Title history|2 times]]) - with Rick Stanley<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/pr/iwa-pr/iwapr-t.html|title=IWA World Tag Team Title (Puerto Rico)|website=Wrestling-Titles.com}}</ref>\n*'''[[World Wrestling Council]]'''\n**[[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship]] ([[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship#Title history|3 times]])   \n**[[WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship]] ([[WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship#Title history|7 times]])\n**[[WWC World Tag Team Championship]] ([[WWC World Tag Team Championship#Title history|1 time]]) - with Pedro Portillo III (1)\n*'''Wrestling Superstar'''\n**1st MysterioMan\u00eda Monster's Cup (2018)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prwrestling.com/nw/resultados-mysteriomania-tributo-al-mesias-en-guaynabo/|title=Resultados MysterioMania \u201cTributo al Mesias\u201d en Guaynabo \u2013 PRWrestling \u2013 Noticias WWE, AEW, Lucha Libre de Puerto Rico y M\u00e1s!|website=www.prwrestling.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gilbert}}\n[[Category:People from Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican male professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1976 births]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: stripped off \u2192 stripped of", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_(wrestler)"}
