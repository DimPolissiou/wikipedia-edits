It was released to both iTunes and mainstream radio on June 16, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=16691 |title=Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more! |publisher=FMQB |accessdate=2010-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028220406/http://fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=16691 |archivedate=2010-10-28 }}</ref> It peaked at #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making it his second top 10 hit following \"[[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)]]\".\n\nThe song references \"[[Whatever You Like (T.I. song)|Whatever You Like]]\" by [[T.I.]] when it says \"And like T.I.'s 'Whatever You Like'\"; \"Gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff\" is a line from [[Jay-Z]]'s \"[[I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)]]\"; \"Put them fingers in your mouth / Open up your blouse / Pull that g-string down south\" is taken from the [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Notorious B.I.G.]]'s \"Nasty Boy\"; and the line \"We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\" is a line in the song \"Rapper's Delight\" by the [[Sugarhill Gang]], with the latter part also being a reference to a track by [[Chingy]] of the same name. On September 16, the official remix to \"Hotel Room Service\" was released, which features [[The Pussycat Dolls]] lead singer [[Nicole Scherzinger]].\n\n==Music video==\nThe song's official music video was released on August 10, 2009 by Pitbull's [[YouTube]] channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/PitbullMusic Pitbull Music].\n\n[[Jim Jonsin]], Sophia Del Carmen and Feisty from [[For the Love of Ray J]] make cameo appearances in the video as does [[Nayer]] and Sagia Casta\u00f1eda, who appeared in the \"[[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)]]\" video as well. The video features Pitbull with models Elizabeth Mendez, Cassie Codi, Lisa Morales, Anya Gonzalez and Kimbella Vanderhee.\n\nA version of the song titled \"Super Clean Edit\" (3:58) was released to radio stations and features alternate lyrics in place of the 'egg whites' line.\n'''Amended:'''\n''Yo' man just left, I'm the doctor tonight. Check up right! Oh, you the healthy type, well I'mma give you just what you like...''\nThis version also replaces the outro in which Pitbull exclaims 'Mujeres!' to an English translation 'All my ladies!'<ref>{{cite web|author=ralphie.aversa. |url=http://ralphieaversa.blogspot.com/2009/09/exclusive-pitbull-likes-ellen-defends.html |title=ralphie.aversa.: EXCLUSIVE: Pitbull Likes Ellen, Defends \"Egg Whites\" |publisher=Ralphieaversa.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>\n\nThe video was also released onto Pitbull's official [[VEVO]] channel on November 14, that year.

It was released to both iTunes and mainstream radio on June 16, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=16691 |title=Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more! |publisher=FMQB |accessdate=2010-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028220406/http://fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=16691 |archivedate=2010-10-28 }}</ref> It peaked at #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making it his second top 10 hit following \"[[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)]]\".\n\nThe song references \"[[Whatever You Like (T.I. song)|Whatever You Like]]\" by [[T.I.]] when it says \"And like T.I.'s 'Whatever You Like'\"; \"Gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff\" is a line from [[Jay-Z]]'s \"[[I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)]]\"; \"Put them fingers in your mouth / Open up your blouse / Pull that g-string down south\" is taken from the [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Notorious B.I.G.]]'s \"Nasty Boy\"; and the line \"We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\" is a line in the song \"Rapper's Delight\" by the [[Sugarhill Gang]], with the latter part also being a reference to a track by [[Chingy]] of the same name. On September 16, the official remix to \"Hotel Room Service\" was released, which features [[The Pussycat Dolls]] lead singer [[Nicole Scherzinger]].\n\n==Music video==\nThe song's official music video was released on August 10, 2009 by Pitbull's [[YouTube]] channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/PitbullMusic Pitbull Music].\n\n[[Jim Jonsin]], Sophia Del Carmen and Feisty from [[For the Love of Ray J]] make cameo appearances in the video as does [[Nayer]] and Sagia Casta\u00f1eda, who appeared in the \"[[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)]]\" video as well. The video features Pitbull with models Elizabeth Mendez, Cassie Codi, Lisa Morales, Anya Gonzalez and Kimbella Vanderhee.\n\nA version of the song titled \"Super Clean Edit\" (3:58) was released to radio stations and features alternate lyrics in place of the 'egg whites' line.\n'''Amended:'''\n''Yo' man just left, I'm the doctor tonight.

The royalties typically consist of some percentage of the revenues created by the drug in question. That royalty stream can go to scientists, universities or drug development companies. The business of DRI Capital and other firms like it is based on buying the right to be paid that royalty stream from the original rights holder in exchange for an up-front lump-sum payment. The transaction is beneficial to both sides of the deal. For example, the biochemist who originally developed the drug in question may want to diversify the inherent risk of his investment portfolio. If the rights holder is a university, there may be a need for liquid capital to fund the construction of a library or other building. In turn, the transaction benefits a firm like DRI Capital because its able to provide its investors with a reliable and steady revenue stream.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gentleman Pharmer: His father made a fortune on the Future Shop chain.

The company also is attracted to assets with strong patent or exclusivity protections against competition. Beginning with its third fund in 2013, DRI Capital CEO Behzad Khosrowshahi said that the firm also plans to consider investments in drugs that are in Phase III trials.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.elsevierbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2013/9/9/DRI-Capital-To-Pursue-Phase-III-Assets-With-Some-Of-Its-Third-Royalty-Fund?result=6&total=49&searchquery=%253fq%253dDRI%252520Capital| title=DRI Capital To Pursue Phase III Assets With Some Of Its Third Royalty Fund | author=Joseph Haas | publisher=The Pink Sheet Daily | date=Sep 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded in 1992 as Drug Royalty Corporation by Alan Grieve, the company's first [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[CEO]]. In its first fiscal year of operation it went public on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] and purchased a royalty interest in the pioneering British biotech firm, [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] Limited.<ref>http://www.twst.com/interview/2405</ref>\n\nIn 2002 Drug Royalty Corporation became the object of a takeover battle between [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] and Inwest Investments Inc., a Canadian holding company owned by [[Hassan Khosrowshahi]] and family. Inwest had recently sold its controlling interest in the [[Future Shop]] to [[Best Buy]]. On March 11, 2002, Drug Royalty Corporation announced that it had accepted an all-cash bid of $133 million to take private the publicly traded company from a wholly owned subsidiary of Inwest Investments Ltd.

The royalties typically consist of some percentage of the revenues created by the drug in question. That royalty stream can go to scientists, universities or drug development companies. The business of DRI Capital and other firms like it is based on buying the right to be paid that royalty stream from the original rights holder in exchange for an up-front lump-sum payment. The transaction is beneficial to both sides of the deal. For example, the biochemist who originally developed the drug in question may want to diversify the inherent risk of his investment portfolio. If the rights holder is a university, there may be a need for liquid capital to fund the construction of a library or other building. In turn, the transaction benefits a firm like DRI Capital because its able to provide its investors with a reliable and steady revenue stream.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gentleman Pharmer: His father made a fortune on the Future Shop chain.
