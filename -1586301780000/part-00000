The airport on the Balearic Islands is Spain's [[List of the busiest airports in Spain|third largest airport]]<ref name=aenapax/> after [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid\u2013Barajas]] and [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona-El Prat]]. Palma de Mallorca was used by 29.7 million passengers in 2019.<ref name=\"aena.es\">http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Palma-Mallorca/es/Page/1046276292901//Presentacion.html AENA Aeropuerto de Palma de Mallorca</ref> The airport is the main base for the Spanish carrier [[Air Europa]] and also a focus airport for [[Ryanair]], [[EasyJet]], [[Vueling]] and [[Jet2.com]]. The airport shares runways with the nearby Son Sant Joan Air Force Base, operated by the [[Spanish Air Force]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe interest of the [[Government of Spain|Spanish Government]] in developing [[airmail]] during the first decades of the 20th century, led to a study of the possibility of establishing an air mail line to the [[Balearic Islands]]. Finally, in 1921, the company Aeromar\u00edtima Mallorquina established the postal line Barcelona - Palma, which used seaplanes in the port of Palma de Mallorca. Before the creation of this airline, trials were complete in two flat fields: '''Son Sant Joan''' and [[Son Bonet Aerodrome|Son Bonet]], both of which were later chosen for the construction of aerodromes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/es/aeropuerto-palma-mallorca/historia.html|title=Aeropuerto de Palma de Mallorca - Historia|website=aena.es|language=Spanish|access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mallorca-pmi.airports-guides.com/|title=Palma de Mallorca airport history in the early 90s|date=18 May 2014|publisher=Mallorca-pmi.airports-guides.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the company Aero-Taxi de Mallorca was created with the intention of starting tourist flights to the island, establishing a [[Flight training|flight school]] in Son Sant Joan. A year later, another one was founded in Son Bonet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn May 1935 the company [[LAPE]], L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas (Spanish Postal Airlines), a predecessor of [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]]; was founded. A month later, in [[August 1935|August]], the first regular air route between [[Madrid]] and Palma, stopping at [[Valencia]], was created using the Son Sant Joan aerodrome. A year later, this line was replaced by a new one connecting Palma and Barcelona. [[1938|Three years later]], [[Lufthansa]] and [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] established new lines in Son Bonet,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm|title=Lufthansa and Iberia establish routes|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216|date=|publisher=Airports-worldwide.com}}</ref> while Son Sant Joan was beginning to be used by the military. Through the years, Son Bonet became the main civilian airport in the island, while the creation of Son Sant Joan Air Force Base limited further civilian enterprises at the aerodrome.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1954,  the runway was enlarged and paved to enable the operation of [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] fighters, which also meant the diversion of the Palma - [[Llucmajor]] road. During those years, the first paved taxiways and aprons were built, while Son Bonet received the first big groups of European tourists through the airlines [[British European Airways|BEA]], [[Air France]] and [[Aviaco]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== The creation of the international airport ===\nThe increase in traffic, and the inability to enlarge Son Bonet, led the authors of the 1958 National Airport Plan to propose building a large civilian airport near the Son Sant Joan airbase. The National Airport Council approved this plan the following year and commercial traffic was transferred from Son Bonet to Son Sant Joan. This was the birth of what today is known as the Palma de Mallorca Airport. During that year, a terminal and a civilian apron were built south of the military facilities, along with a VHF communication center. Also, a [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] was installed in the island.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinally, the 7 of July 1960, the airport was opened to both domestic and international traffic.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJust two weeks later, expansion of the airport was declared urgent by the government, and on summer 1961 the works of extension of the runway and taxiway were started. At the end of the year, more plans were made, including a power plant, a communications centre and fire and rescue facilities.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm|title=Palma de Mallorca Airport expansion|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216|date=|publisher=Airports-worldwide.com}}</ref>\n\n===Growth since the 1960s===\nAfter reaching 1 million passengers for the first time in 1962, in 1965, a new terminal was constructed, and air navigation services were completed at the end of the following year. Also in 1965 [[Air Spain]] (1965 - 1975) began operating from the airport<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Airline/Air-Spain|title=Air Spain Fleet Details and History|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> and a smaller terminal (today's Terminal B) was planned. Passenger numbers increased rapidly, reaching 2 million in 1965. Construction of a second runway, parallel to the existing one, was begun in 1970. Two years later, terminal B went into service, and the second runway (06L/24R) opened in 1974.\n\nIn 1980, the airport carried 7 million passengers. However, this increased to nearly 10 million in 1986. This led to the construction of yet another new terminal building, the current central terminal building. This building is now the airport's primary entrance and exit and houses the airport's checkin and baggage claim areas. Construction started in mid-1993 and it was designed by the Majorcan architect [[Pere Nicolau Bover]]. During the construction in 1995, passenger numbers exceeded 15 million. The new terminal finally opened in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216 |url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm |title=Terminal A opening |publisher=Airports-worldwide.com |date=}}</ref>\n\n===Today===\nFollowing a decline in passenger numbers at the airport following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, passenger numbers rose steadily between 2002 and 2007 when traffic peaked at 23.2 million passengers. From 2007 onward there was a decline in passenger numbers, with 21.1 million using the airport in 2010.<ref name=aenapax/> Today, Palma de Mallorca airport carries over 29.7 million passengers<ref name=\"aena.es\"/> per year to their destinations, with 178,253 aircraft movements, mostly to mainland [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn November 2015, [[Air Berlin]] (1978 - 2017) announced that it would shut down its hub operations at the airport which it had maintained for over ten years. All seven domestic connection routes to the mainland, such as flights to [[Valencia]], [[Bilbao]] and [[Sevilla]], as well as the route to [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] in Portugal ceased during spring 2016.<ref name=\"ABPMI\">[http://www.airliners.de/air-berlin-drehkreuz-mallorca/37209 airliners.de - \"Air Berlin shuts down Mallorca hub\"] (German) 18 November 2015</ref>\n\nDuring the Summer months the dual-runway airport handles as many movements as [[Gatwick Airport|London\u2013Gatwick]]. On the busiest day of the week it handles as many as 1,100 movements, almost as many as [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]], the busiest airport in Europe. According to the operational data provided by AENA, the airport can handle 66 movements per hour, or almost 1,600 movements over a 24-hour operational period.\n\n==Terminals==\n[[File:Palma de Mallorca Airport 1.jpg|thumb|Apron view]]\n[[File:Palma de Mallorca Airport Terminal C Outside.JPG|thumb|Outside view of the main terminal]]\n[[File:X100 Flughafen Palma de Mallorca Schalter zum Einchecken.jpg|thumb|Interior of the terminal]]\nPalma de Mallorca Airport occupies an area of {{convert|6.3|km2|abbr=on}}. Due to rapid growth of passenger numbers, additional infrastructure was added to the two [[Airport terminal|terminals]] A (1965) and B (1972). This main terminal was designed by local architect Pere Nicolau Bover and was officially opened on 12 April 1997. The airport now consists of four modules: Module A (the former Terminal A Building), Module B (the former Terminal B Building), Module C and Module D (the last two were completely new sets of buildings and gates that opened along with the new central terminal and check in area in 1997). The airport can handle 25 million passengers per year, with a capacity to dispatch 12,000 passengers per hour.\n\n===Module A===\nThe former ''Terminal A'' Building is located in the north of the airport. It has 28 gates of which 8 have airbridges. This is the only Module that has double airbridges attached to gates. The Pier is mainly used by flights to non-Schengen destinations including the UK and Ireland. This part of the terminal building used to be closed during winter months and is only used in the summer. For winter 2018/2019 it will remain open.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimahora.es/noticias/local/2018/10/30/1034917/aena-invertira-cerca-120-millones-son-sant-joan-hasta-finales-2019.html|title=AENA invertir\u00e1 cerca de 120 millones en Son Sant Joan hasta finales de 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Module B===\nThe former ''Terminal B'' Building is the smallest module, located in the north east. It has 8 gates located on the ground floor, of which none have airbridges. It is used by regional aircraft of [[Air Nostrum]], mainly operating flights to [[Ibiza Airport]], [[Menorca Airport]], [[Valencia Airport]], [[Lleida Airport]], [[Asturias Airport]] and [[Santiago de Compostela Airport]].\n\n===Module C===\nThe largest of the Modules located in the east. It has 33 gates of which 9 have airbridges. It is used by [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] along with [[EasyJet]] and [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] flights to Schengen destinations. The majority of airbridges have airberlin.com written on them. The southern area of the Module was worked on and reopened in May 2010. The refurbishment and expansion is so that the Module can handle more flights, and to improve ways to get into the pier as it is the longest walk from security control. There will also be a further 8 gates with airbridges, but there will still be 33 in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorca.info/news/international-flight-connections-in-palma-to-become-a-mediterranean-%E2%80%9Chub%E2%80%9D/ |title=Module C Refurbishment |publisher=Majorca.info |date=24 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Module D===\nLocated in the south. It has 19 gates of which 10 have airbridges. All odd numbered gates are gates with a bus transfer. The majority of airbridges have airberlin.com written on them. During the closure of the southern area of Module C, it was used mainly for flights to Europe.\n\n==Other facilities==\nPreviously [[Spanair]] (1986 - 2012) had its head office in the Spanair Building on the airport property.<ref name=\"TheMallorcaRetain\">\"[http://themallorca.net/2008/12/23/spanair-to-retain-hq-in-palma/ Spanair to retain HQ in Palma].\" ''The Mallorca''. 23 December 2008.

The airport shares runways with the nearby Son Sant Joan Air Force Base, operated by the [[Spanish Air Force]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe interest of the [[Government of Spain|Spanish Government]] in developing [[airmail]] during the first decades of the 20th century, led to a study of the possibility of establishing an air mail line to the [[Balearic Islands]]. Finally, in 1921, the company Aeromar\u00edtima Mallorquina established the postal line Barcelona - Palma, which used seaplanes in the port of Palma de Mallorca. Before the creation of this airline, trials were complete in two flat fields: '''Son Sant Joan''' and [[Son Bonet Aerodrome|Son Bonet]], both of which were later chosen for the construction of aerodromes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/es/aeropuerto-palma-mallorca/historia.html|title=Aeropuerto de Palma de Mallorca - Historia|website=aena.es|language=Spanish|access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mallorca-pmi.airports-guides.com/|title=Palma de Mallorca airport history in the early 90's|date=18 May 2014|publisher=Mallorca-pmi.airports-guides.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the company Aero-Taxi de Mallorca was created with the intention of starting tourist flights to the island, establishing a [[Flight training|flight school]] in Son Sant Joan. A year later, another one was founded in Son Bonet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn May 1935 the company [[LAPE]], L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas (Spanish Postal Airlines), a predecessor of [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]]; was founded. A month later, in [[August 1935|August]], the first regular air route between [[Madrid]] and Palma, stopping at [[Valencia]], was created using the Son Sant Joan aerodrome. A year later, this line was replaced by a new one connecting Palma and Barcelona. [[1938|Three years later]], [[Lufthansa]] and [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] established new lines in Son Bonet,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm|title=Lufthansa and Iberia establish routes|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216|date=|publisher=Airports-worldwide.com}}</ref> while Son Sant Joan was beginning to be used by the military. Through the years, Son Bonet became the main civilian airport in the island, while the creation of Son Sant Joan Air Force Base limited further civilian enterprises at the aerodrome.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1954,  the runway was enlarged and paved to enable the operation of [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] fighters, which also meant the diversion of the Palma - [[Llucmajor]] road. During those years, the first paved taxiways and aprons were built, while Son Bonet received the first big groups of European tourists through the airlines [[British European Airways|BEA]], [[Air France]] and [[Aviaco]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== The creation of the international airport ===\nThe increase in traffic, and the inability to enlarge Son Bonet, led the authors of the 1958 National Airport Plan to propose building a large civilian airport near the Son Sant Joan airbase. The National Airport Council approved this plan the following year and commercial traffic was transferred from Son Bonet to Son Sant Joan. This was the birth of what today is known as the Palma de Mallorca Airport. During that year, a terminal and a civilian apron were built south of the military facilities, along with a VHF communication center. Also, a [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] was installed in the island.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinally, the 7 of July 1960, the airport was opened to both domestic and international traffic.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJust two weeks later, expansion of the airport was declared urgent by the government, and on summer 1961 the works of extension of the runway and taxiway were started. At the end of the year, more plans were made, including a power plant, a communications centre and fire and rescue facilities.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm|title=Palma de Mallorca Airport expansion|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216|date=|publisher=Airports-worldwide.com}}</ref>\n\n===Growth since the 1960s===\nAfter reaching 1 million passengers for the first time in 1962, in 1965, a new terminal was constructed, and air navigation services were completed at the end of the following year. Also in 1965 [[Air Spain]] (1965 - 1975) began operating from the airport<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Airline/Air-Spain|title=Air Spain Fleet Details and History|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> and a smaller terminal (today's Terminal B) was planned. Passenger numbers increased rapidly, reaching 2 million in 1965. Construction of a second runway, parallel to the existing one, was begun in 1970. Two years later, terminal B went into service, and the second runway (06L/24R) opened in 1974.\n\nIn 1980, the airport carried 7 million passengers. However, this increased to nearly 10 million in 1986. This led to the construction of yet another new terminal building, the current central terminal building. This building is now the airport's primary entrance and exit and houses the airport's checkin and baggage claim areas. Construction started in mid-1993 and it was designed by the Majorcan architect [[Pere Nicolau Bover]]. During the construction in 1995, passenger numbers exceeded 15 million. The new terminal finally opened in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216 |url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm |title=Terminal A opening |publisher=Airports-worldwide.com |date=}}</ref>\n\n===Today===\nFollowing a decline in passenger numbers at the airport following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, passenger numbers rose steadily between 2002 and 2007 when traffic peaked at 23.2 million passengers. From 2007 onward there was a decline in passenger numbers, with 21.1 million using the airport in 2010.<ref name=aenapax/> Today, Palma de Mallorca airport carries over 29.7 million passengers<ref name=\"aena.es\"/> per year to their destinations, with 178,253 aircraft movements, mostly to mainland [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn November 2015, [[Air Berlin]] (1978 - 2017) announced that it would shut down its hub operations at the airport which it had maintained for over ten years. All seven domestic connection routes to the mainland, such as flights to [[Valencia]], [[Bilbao]] and [[Sevilla]], as well as the route to [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] in Portugal ceased during spring 2016.<ref name=\"ABPMI\">[http://www.airliners.de/air-berlin-drehkreuz-mallorca/37209 airliners.de - \"Air Berlin shuts down Mallorca hub\"] (German) 18 November 2015</ref>\n\nDuring the Summer months the dual-runway airport handles as many movements as [[Gatwick Airport|London\u2013Gatwick]]. On the busiest day of the week it handles as many as 1,100 movements, almost as many as [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]], the busiest airport in Europe. According to the operational data provided by AENA, the airport can handle 66 movements per hour, or almost 1,600 movements over a 24-hour operational period.\n\n==Terminals==\n[[File:Palma de Mallorca Airport 1.jpg|thumb|Apron view]]\n[[File:Palma de Mallorca Airport Terminal C Outside.JPG|thumb|Outside view of the main terminal]]\n[[File:X100 Flughafen Palma de Mallorca Schalter zum Einchecken.jpg|thumb|Interior of the terminal]]\nPalma de Mallorca Airport occupies an area of {{convert|6.3|km2|abbr=on}}. Due to rapid growth of passenger numbers, additional infrastructure was added to the two [[Airport terminal|terminals]] A (1965) and B (1972). This main terminal was designed by local architect Pere Nicolau Bover and was officially opened on 12 April 1997. The airport now consists of four modules: Module A (the former Terminal A Building), Module B (the former Terminal B Building), Module C and Module D (the last two were completely new sets of buildings and gates that opened along with the new central terminal and check in area in 1997). The airport can handle 25 million passengers per year, with a capacity to dispatch 12,000 passengers per hour.\n\n===Module A===\nThe former ''Terminal A'' Building is located in the north of the airport. It has 28 gates of which 8 have airbridges. This is the only Module that has double airbridges attached to gates. The Pier is mainly used by flights to non-Schengen destinations including the UK and Ireland. This part of the terminal building used to be closed during winter months and is only used in the summer. For winter 2018/2019 it will remain open.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimahora.es/noticias/local/2018/10/30/1034917/aena-invertira-cerca-120-millones-son-sant-joan-hasta-finales-2019.html|title=AENA invertir\u00e1 cerca de 120 millones en Son Sant Joan hasta finales de 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Module B===\nThe former ''Terminal B'' Building is the smallest module, located in the north east. It has 8 gates located on the ground floor, of which none have airbridges. It is used by regional aircraft of [[Air Nostrum]], mainly operating flights to [[Ibiza Airport]], [[Menorca Airport]], [[Valencia Airport]], [[Lleida Airport]], [[Asturias Airport]] and [[Santiago de Compostela Airport]].\n\n===Module C===\nThe largest of the Modules located in the east. It has 33 gates of which 9 have airbridges. It is used by [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] along with [[EasyJet]] and [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] flights to Schengen destinations. The majority of airbridges have airberlin.com written on them. The southern area of the Module was worked on and reopened in May 2010. The refurbishment and expansion is so that the Module can handle more flights, and to improve ways to get into the pier as it is the longest walk from security control. There will also be a further 8 gates with airbridges, but there will still be 33 in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorca.info/news/international-flight-connections-in-palma-to-become-a-mediterranean-%E2%80%9Chub%E2%80%9D/ |title=Module C Refurbishment |publisher=Majorca.info |date=24 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Module D===\nLocated in the south. It has 19 gates of which 10 have airbridges. All odd numbered gates are gates with a bus transfer. The majority of airbridges have airberlin.com written on them. During the closure of the southern area of Module C, it was used mainly for flights to Europe.\n\n==Other facilities==\nPreviously [[Spanair]] (1986 - 2012) had its head office in the Spanair Building on the airport property.<ref name=\"TheMallorcaRetain\">\"[http://themallorca.net/2008/12/23/spanair-to-retain-hq-in-palma/ Spanair to retain HQ in Palma].\" ''The Mallorca''. 23 December 2008.

The series follows the adventures of title characters [[Ren H\u00f6ek (character)|Ren]], an emotionally unstable [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], and [[Stimpy]], a good-natured yet dimwitted [[cat]]. The show premiered on August 11, 1991, as one of the original three [[Nicktoons]] alongside ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]''. Throughout its run, it was a notoriously [[controversial]] show for its [[dark humor]], [[sexual innuendos]], adult jokes, and [[shock value]]. The production's failure to deliver episodes on time and its deteriorating relationship with Nickelodeon executives and [[Standards and Practices]] department led to Kricfalusi's departure from the show in 1992. The show ended on December 16, 1995.<span class=\"plainlinks\"></span><ref name=\"Komorowski\">{{cite book|title=Sick Little Monkeys: The Unauthorized Ren & Stimpy Story|isbn=9781593932343|publisher=BearManor Media|year=2013|author=Thad Komorowski}}</ref> The episodes \"Sammy and Me\" and \"The Last Temptation\" never aired in the original run on Nickelodeon, but did air on MTV in 1996.\n\n''Ren & Stimpy'' received positive reviews during its original run and quickly developed a [[cult following]]. It received widespread critical acclaim after its run and had a long-lasting influence on television animation. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] for adult audiences, ''[[Ren & Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"]]'', aired in 2003 on [[Paramount Network|Spike]] (later renamed Paramount Network). Only three episodes aired due to delays in episode delivery, before Spike removed its entire animation programming block.\n\n== Premise ==\n{{See also|List of The Ren & Stimpy Show characters}}\nThe series centers on [[Ren H\u00f6ek]] (voiced by [[John Kricfalusi]] in seasons 1\u20132; [[Billy West]] in seasons 3\u20135), a short-tempered, psychotic, \"[[asthma]]-[[hound]]\" [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]],<ref name=\"Goodman\">{{cite web | first=Martin | last=Goodman | title=Cartoons Aren't Real!

The initial plan was to have an anthology comic featuring several Nicktoons properties. Marvel produced 44 issues of the ongoing series, along with several specials under the ''[[Marvel Absurd]]'' imprint. Most of these were written by comic scribe [[Dan Slott]]. One ''Ren & Stimpy'' special #3, ''Masters of Time and Space'', was set up as a '[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]' and with a time travel plot, took Slott six months to plot out in his spare time. It was designed so that it was possible to choose a path that would eventually be 20 pages longer than the comic itself. Issue #6 of the series starred [[Spider-Man]] battling [[Powdered Toast Man]]. The editors named the \"Letters to the Editor\" section \"Ask Dr. Stupid\", and at least one letter in every column would be a direct question for Dr. Stupid to answer.<ref>\"That's Life\", ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. [[Marvel Comics]]. Volume 1, Issue 5.</ref> This comic series lasted from December 1992-July 1996.\n\n'''Issues'''\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! Issue # !! Caption !!

''Nintendo Power'' commended the game's graphics, humor, audio, and inclusion of a password feature, but criticized the lack of variety, limited time allotted for collecting items and repetition of the two levels.<ref name=\"NPFireDogs\">{{Cite magazine|date=March 1994 | title=''Ren & Stimpy Show: Fire Dogs'' |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] | volume=58 | page=103}}</ref>\n* '''''The Ren & Stimpy Show: Time Warp''''' was developed by [[List of Acclaim Entertainment subsidiaries#Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City|Sculptured Software]], published by THQ and released for the SNES on October 1994.

The initial plan was to have an anthology comic featuring several Nicktoons properties. Marvel produced 44 issues of the ongoing series, along with several specials under the ''[[Marvel Absurd]]'' imprint. Most of these were written by comic scribe [[Dan Slott]]. One ''Ren & Stimpy'' special #3, ''Masters of Time and Space'', was set up as a '[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]' and with a time travel plot, took Slott six months to plot out in his spare time. It was designed so that it was possible to choose a path that would eventually be 20 pages longer than the comic itself. Issue #6 of the series starred [[Spider-Man]] battling [[Powdered Toast Man]]. The editors named the \"Letters to the Editor\" section \"Ask Dr. Stupid\", and at least one letter in every column would be a direct question for Dr. Stupid to answer.<ref>\"That's Life\", ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. [[Marvel Comics]]. Volume 1, Issue 5.</ref> This comic series lasted from December 1992-July 1996.\n\n'''Issues'''\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! Issue # !! Caption !!

''Ren & Stimpy'' was mentioned as a possible property for development, along with ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]''; however, the show's \"cynical and gross humor\" was a poor fit for a conventional, \"warm and fuzzy\" family film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-05-19/business/9305190485_1_beece-production-facilities-nick|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=May 19, 1993|author=Catherine Hinman|title=Nickelodeon Adds Movies To Its Credits|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citation|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 1993|author=Thomas R King|title=Nickelodeon, Fox Film, chase family viewers}}</ref> The deal expired with no movies produced.

She named it Nos Pilifs from an [[anagram]] of her name. This centre still receives some fifty disabled children up to the age of 13. Other organizations have been created to meet the needs of disabled persons who attended the centre. That is how the leisure club was established in 1980, \"La Ferme Nos Pilifs\" as a company that hires people with disabilities in 1984, the Maison Nos Pilifs providing accommodation and support service in 1985, \"le Potelier des Pilifs\" day centre in 1989, the \"Ados Pilifs\" secondary school for autistic children in 2011, the \"Villa Pilifs\" hostel in 2015, and soon \"Les Piloux\" inclusive children's nursery. All these private nonprofit organizations share the same philosophy: acceptance of difference and inclusion of people with disabilities. \n\n== The centre == \nNos Pilifs centre is a pre-primary and primary school with specialized education for children with [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (specialized in type 3 \u2013 [[autism]]) or with mental retardation or deficiency. The school is part of the non-confessional network. Nos Pilifs centre provides multidisciplinary care in [[Speech Therapy|speech therapy]], [[psychomotor education]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physiotherapy]] and [[behavioural psychology]].\n\n== Ferme Nos Pilifs ASBL == \nThe farm was created in 1984, on the initiative of Mrs Filipson and Benoit Ceysens in response to a lack of employment for disabled people in the north of Brussels. The farm is now a recognized company with disabled employees certified by the [[French Community Commission|Cocof]]. With social and ecological purposes, 140 out of its 180 employees are disabled. It works a 12-acre long field in [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]] in the north of Brussels, with an animal park, a garden centre, different plots, a grocery shop, a brewery and a conditioning workshop for organic dry food. Eight teams of gardeners also offer various gardening services. Children can spend their school breaks at the farm, and school groups can visit it on field trips at any time of the year. Through those various activities, Nos Pilifs Farm showcases disabled people's skills and gives them a real role in their neighbourhood.\n\n== Accessibility ==\nBus line {{Ligne STIB|53}}, stop ''Nos Pilifs''.<br/>\nBus line {{Ligne STIB|56}}, (new route since 2 March 2020), stop ''Ferme Nos Pilifs''.\n\n== Bibliography == \n* G.

The final season was aired on [[Fox Kids]]. The series ended production in 1992 in favor of ''[[Animaniacs]]''; however, two specials were produced in 1994.<ref name=springbreak>{{cite news|last=Mendoza|first=N.F.|title=SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO : Spielberg's 'Tiny Toons' break for prime time and the rites of spring|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-27/news/tv-38816_1_tiny-toons-spring-break/|accessdate=10 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 27, 1994|location=USA}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Premise===\n''Tiny Toon Adventures'' is a cartoon set in the fictional town of '''Acme Acres''', where most of the ''Tiny Toons'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters live. The characters attend '''Acme Looniversity''', a school whose faculty primarily consists of the mainstays of the classic [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons, such as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Wile E. Coyote]] and [[Elmer Fudd]]. In the series, the university is founded to teach cartoon characters how to become funny. The school is not featured in every episode, as not all of its storylines revolve around the school.\n\nLike the [[Looney Tunes]], the series makes use of [[cartoon physics|cartoon violence]] (e.g. [[Anvil#Television and film|anvils]] falling on someone, liberal use of explosives) and [[slapstick]]. The series parodies and references the current events of the early 1990s and [[Hollywood]] culture. Occasionally, episodes delve into veiled ethical and morality stories of [[ecology]], [[self-esteem]], and [[crime]].\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures characters}}\n[[Image:Promo tiny toon .jpg|left|thumb|210px|Artwork displaying a majority of the [[List of characters in Tiny Toon Adventures|''Tiny Toon'' cast]].]]\n<!--please don't re-add the list to this section; see talk page-->\nThe series centers on a group of young cartoon characters who attend a school called [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] [[Acme Looniversity|Looniversity]] to be the next generation of ''Looney Tunes'' characters. Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes animal characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The two main characters are both rabbits: [[Buster Bunny]], a blue male rabbit, and [[Babs Bunny]], a pink female rabbit not related to Buster, Plucky Duck, a green male duck, Hamton J. Pig, a pink male pig. Other major characters in the cast are generally nonhuman as well. These include [[Fifi La Fume]], a purple-and-white female skunk; [[Shirley The Loon]], a white female [[loon]]; [[Dizzy Devil]], a purple tasmanian devil; [[Furrball]], a blue cat; [[Sweetie Pie (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Sweetie Pie]], a pink canary; [[Calamity Coyote]], a bluish-gray coyote; [[Little Beeper]], a red-orange roadrunner; and [[Gogo Dodo]], a zany green dodo. Two human characters, [[Montana Max]] and [[Elmyra Duff]], are regarded as the main villains of the series and also are students of Acme Looniversity. As villains, Elmyra is seen as an extreme pet lover while Montana Max is a spoiled rich brat who either owns lots of toys or polluting factories. Supporting characters included [[Li'l Sneezer]], a gray mouse with powerful sneezes; [[Concord Condor]], a purple condor; [[Byron Basset]], a usually sleeping basset hound; [[Bookworm (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Bookworm]], a green worm with glasses; [[Arnold the Pit Bull]], a muscular white pit bull; [[Fowlmouth]], a white rooster with horrid language; [[Barky Marky]], a brown dog, and [[Mary Melody]], a young African American human girl.\n\nFeeding off the characters are the more traditional Looney Tunes such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig among others. Most of the adults teach classes at Acme Looniversity and serve as mentors to the Tiny Toons while others fill secondary positions as needed.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writers===\nThe series and the show's characters were developed by series producer, head writer and cartoonist [[Tom Ruegger]], division leader [[Jean MacCurdy]], associate producer and artist Alfred Gimeno and story editor/writer [[Wayne Kaatz]]. Among the first writers on the series were [[Jim Reardon]], [[Tom Minton]], and Eddie Fitzgerald. The character and scenery designers included Alfred Gimeno, Ken Boyer, [[Dan Haskett]], Karen Haskett, and many other artists and directors. The series was actually planned to be a feature film. Once Steven Spielberg was attached, numerous things changed, including the idea of turning the movie into a television series.\n\n\"Buster and Babs Go To Hawaii\" was co-written by three then-teenage girls who were fans of the show.<ref name=writers>{{cite news|last=Berkman|first=Meredith|title=Adventures among the 'Toons'|url=http://ew.com/ew/article/0,,313220,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] issue #51|date=February 1, 1991|location=USA}}</ref>\n\n===Casting info===\nVoice director [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] auditioned over 1,200 voices for the series and chose more than a dozen main voice actors.<ref name=\"collab\">{{cite web|title=Tiny Toon Adventures - Long-Awaited 'Volume 3' DVD Brings Toons from 2nd, 3rd Season|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543|publisher=TV Shows on DVD|last=Lambert|first=David|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929234612/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543|archivedate=September 29, 2012}}</ref> The role of Buster Bunny was given to [[Charlie Adler]], who gave the role, as producer [[Tom Ruegger]] said, \"a great deal of energy\".<ref name=\"creation\"/> The role of Babs Bunny was given to [[Tress MacNeille]]. Writer [[Paul Dini]] said that MacNeille was good for the role because she could do both Babs' voice and the voices of her impressions.<ref name=\"creation\"/> Voice actors [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[Don Messick]] were given the roles of Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig, respectively. [[Danny Cooksey]] played Montana Max and, according to [[Paul Dini]], was good for the role because he could do a \"tremendous mean voice.\" Cooksey was also the only voice actor in the cast who was not an adult.<ref name=\"creation\"/> [[Cree Summer]] played the roles of Elmyra Duff and Mary Melody; former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Gail Matthius]] played Shirley the Loon, and [[Kath Soucie]] had the roles of Fifi La Fume and Li'l Sneezer. Other actors for the series included [[Maurice LaMarche]] as the voice of Dizzy Devil; [[Candi Milo]] as the voice of Sweetie, [[Frank Welker]] as the voice of Gogo Dodo, Furrball, Byron Basset, Calamity Coyote, Little Beeper, Barky Marky, and other voices; and [[Rob Paulsen]] as the voice of Fowlmouth, Arnold the Pit Bull, Concord Condor, and other characters. The legendary voice behind the Looney Tunes, [[Mel Blanc]], was set to reprise his roles as the classic characters, but died in July 1989. His characters were recast by the likes of [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Greg Burson]], and Mel's son, [[Noel Blanc]].\n\nDuring production of the series' third season, Charlie Adler left the show due to a conflict with the producers. Adler was upset that he had not landed a role in ''[[Animaniacs]]'' while voice actors with smaller roles in ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' like [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], and [[Frank Welker]] were given starring roles in the new series.<ref name=\"kennedy\"/> [[John Kassir]] replaced Adler for the remainder of the show's run (although Adler would eventually return to voice Buster in the cancelled video game, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe]]''). Joe Alaskey, the voice of Plucky Duck, also left ''Tiny Toons'' for financial reasons, but returned when an agreement was reached with the studio.<ref name=\"kennedy\"/>\n\n===Animation===\nIn order to complete 65 episodes for the first season, [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]] contracted several different [[North American]] and international animation houses. These animation studios included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]), [[Wang Film Productions]], [[AKOM]], [[Freelance Animators New Zealand]], Encore Cartoons, [[StarToons]],<ref name=startoons>{{cite news|last=Owens|first=John|title=Drawing On Experience|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/features/9203010023_1_animation-studios-hanna-barbera-studios-hollywood-cartoon|accessdate=1 October 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 5, 1992}}</ref> and [[Kennedy Cartoons]].<ref>Credits from various ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' episodes.{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}</ref> Tokyo Movie Shinsha also animated the series' opening sequence. Some of the Warner Bros. staff disliked working with Kennedy Cartoons due to the animation studio's inconsistent quality, and episodes that they animated were often subject to multiple re-takes. In other cases, such as the debut episode \"The Looney Beginning\", portions of Kennedy Cartoons-animated episodes were re-animated by another animation studio.<ref name=\"kennedy\">{{cite web|url=http://platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html|title=Platypus Comix interviews......Tom Ruegger!

It had a [[cel]] count that was more than double that of most animated television shows then.<ref name=\"creation\"/> The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more fluidly.<ref name=\"creation\"/> [[Pierre DeCelles]], an animation producer, described storyboarding for the series as \"fun but a big challenge because I always had a short schedule, and it's not always easy to work full blast nonstop\".\n\n===Music===\nDuring the development of the show [[Steven Spielberg]] said that [[Warner Bros.]] would use a full orchestra, which some thought too expensive and impossible, but they ended up agreeing. [[Warner Bros.]] selected [[Bruce Broughton]] to write the theme tune (for which he would win a [[Daytime Emmy]] along with [[Tom Ruegger]] and [[Wayne Kaatz]], who both worked with Broughton on the lyrics) and serve as [[music supervisor]]. Screen credits for the composers were given based on the amount of music composed for, or composed and reused in, the episode.\n\nTwenty-six other composers were contracted to create original dramatic underscore for each different episode during the series run: Julie and [[Steven Bernstein (musician)|Steve Bernstein]], [[Steven Bramson]], [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], [[John Debney]], Ron Grant, [[Les Hooper]], Carl Johnson, Elliot Kaplan, Arthur Kempel, Ralph Kessler, Albert Lloyd Olson, [[Hummie Mann]], [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], [[Joel McNeely]], Peter Myers, [[Laurence Rosenthal]], [[William Ross (composer)|William Ross]], [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]], J. Eric Schmidt, David Slonaker, [[Fred Steiner]], [[Morton Stevens]], [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]], [[Stephen James Taylor]] and [[Mark Watters]]. The composers conducted their own music. Of these composers, Broughton, Bramson, Davis, Olson, Stone, Taylor and Watters wrote the score to ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation]]''.\n\nThese composers would later write the musical scores for shows including ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]].''\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}\n{{:List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Charlie Adler]] \u2013 Buster Bunny (1990-1992)\n** [[John Kassir]] \u2013 Buster Bunny (1992-1995)\n* [[Joe Alaskey]] \u2013 Plucky Duck\n* [[Danny Cooksey]] \u2013 Montana Max\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] \u2013 Dizzy Devil \n* [[Tress MacNeille]] \u2013 Babs Bunny\n* [[Gail Matthius]] \u2013 Shirley the Loon\n* [[Don Messick]] \u2013 Hamton J.

Animation]] department,\" and at the same time create a series with junior versions of [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters|Looney Tunes characters]]. Semel proposed that the new series would be a show based on ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' where the characters were either young versions of the original ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' characters or new characters as the offspring of the original characters.<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Bob|title=NEW TOONS ON THE BLOCK: They're attending Acme Looniversity & hoping to graduate as classic cartoon characters|periodical=Comic Scene|issue=15|pages=33\u201339, 68|year=1990}}</ref> The idea of a series with the basis of younger and junior versions of cartoon characters was common at the time; the era in which ''Tiny Toons'' was produced for had such cartoons as ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Tom & Jerry Kids]]'' and ''[[The Flintstones Kids]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] chose to do the same because Spielberg wanted to make a series similar to ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', as series producer/show-runner Tom Ruegger explained: \"Well, I think in [[Warner Bros.]] case, they had the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg] on a project [...] But he didn't want to just work on characters that [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]], [[Robert McKimson|Bob McKimson]] and [[Bob Clampett]] made famous and created.

The characters attend '''Acme Looniversity''', a school whose faculty primarily consists of the mainstays of the classic [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons, such as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Wile E. Coyote]] and [[Elmer Fudd]]. In the series, the university is founded to teach cartoon characters how to become funny. The school is not featured in every episode, as not all of its storylines revolve around the school.\n\nLike the [[Looney Tunes]], the series makes use of [[cartoon physics|cartoon violence]] (e.g. [[Anvil#Television and film|anvils]] falling on someone, liberal use of explosives) and [[slapstick]]. The series parodies and references the current events of the early 1990s and [[Hollywood]] culture. Occasionally, episodes delve into veiled ethical and morality stories of [[ecology]], [[self-esteem]], and [[crime]].\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures characters}}\n[[Image:Promo tiny toon .jpg|left|thumb|210px|Artwork displaying a majority of the [[List of characters in Tiny Toon Adventures|''Tiny Toon'' cast]].]]\n<!--please don't re-add the list to this section; see talk page-->\nThe series centers on a group of young cartoon characters who attend a school called [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] [[Acme Looniversity|Looniversity]] to be the next generation of ''Looney Tunes'' characters. Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes animal characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The two main characters are both rabbits: [[Buster Bunny]], a blue male rabbit, and [[Babs Bunny]], a pink female rabbit not related to Buster, Plucky Duck, a green male duck, Hamton J. Pig, a pink male pig. Other major characters in the cast are generally nonhuman as well. These include [[Fifi La Fume]], a purple-and-white female skunk; [[Shirley The Loon]], a white female [[loon]]; [[Dizzy Devil]], a purple tasmanian devil; [[Furrball]], a blue cat; [[Sweetie Pie (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Sweetie Pie]], a pink canary; [[Calamity Coyote]], a bluish-gray coyote; [[Little Beeper]], a red-orange roadrunner; and [[Gogo Dodo]], a zany green dodo. Two human characters, [[Montana Max]] and [[Elmyra Duff]], are regarded as the main villains of the series and also are students of Acme Looniversity. As villains, Elmyra is seen as an extreme pet lover while Montana Max is a spoiled rich brat who either owns lots of toys or polluting factories. Supporting characters included [[Li'l Sneezer]], a gray mouse with powerful sneezes; [[Concord Condor]], a purple condor; [[Byron Basset]], a usually sleeping basset hound; [[Bookworm (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Bookworm]], a green worm with glasses; [[Arnold the Pit Bull]], a muscular white pit bull; [[Fowlmouth]], a white rooster with horrid language; [[Barky Marky]], a brown dog, and [[Mary Melody]], a young African American human girl.\n\nFeeding off the characters are the more traditional Looney Tunes such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig among others. Most of the adults teach classes at Acme Looniversity and serve as mentors to the Tiny Toons while others fill secondary positions as needed.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writers===\nThe series and the show's characters were developed by series producer, head writer and cartoonist [[Tom Ruegger]], division leader [[Jean MacCurdy]], associate producer and artist Alfred Gimeno and story editor/writer [[Wayne Kaatz]]. Among the first writers on the series were [[Jim Reardon]], [[Tom Minton]], and Eddie Fitzgerald. The character and scenery designers included Alfred Gimeno, Ken Boyer, [[Dan Haskett]], Karen Haskett, and many other artists and directors. The series was actually planned to be a feature film. Once Steven Spielberg was attached, numerous things changed, including the idea of turning the movie into a television series.\n\n\"Buster and Babs Go To Hawaii\" was co-written by three then-teenage girls who were fans of the show.<ref name=writers>{{cite news|last=Berkman|first=Meredith|title=Adventures among the 'Toons'|url=http://ew.com/ew/article/0,,313220,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] issue #51|date=February 1, 1991|location=USA}}</ref>\n\n===Casting info===\nVoice director [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] auditioned over 1,200 voices for the series and chose more than a dozen main voice actors.<ref name=\"collab\">{{cite web|title=Tiny Toon Adventures - Long-Awaited 'Volume 3' DVD Brings Toons from 2nd, 3rd Season|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543|publisher=TV Shows on DVD|last=Lambert|first=David|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929234612/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543|archivedate=September 29, 2012}}</ref> The role of Buster Bunny was given to [[Charlie Adler]], who gave the role, as producer [[Tom Ruegger]] said, \"a great deal of energy\".<ref name=\"creation\"/> The role of Babs Bunny was given to [[Tress MacNeille]].

The legendary voice behind the Looney Tunes, [[Mel Blanc]], was set to reprise his roles as the classic characters, but died in July 1989. His characters were recast by the likes of [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Greg Burson]], and Mel's son, [[Noel Blanc]].\n\nDuring production of the series' third season, Charlie Adler left the show due to a conflict with the producers. Adler was upset that he had not landed a role in ''[[Animaniacs]]'' while voice actors with smaller roles in ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' like [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], and [[Frank Welker]] were given starring roles in the new series.<ref name=\"kennedy\"/> [[John Kassir]] replaced Adler for the remainder of the show's run (although Adler would eventually return to voice Buster in the cancelled video game, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe]]''). Joe Alaskey, the voice of Plucky Duck, also left ''Tiny Toons'' for financial reasons, but returned when an agreement was reached with the studio.<ref name=\"kennedy\"/>\n\n===Animation===\nIn order to complete 65 episodes for the first season, [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]] contracted several different [[North American]] and international animation houses. These animation studios included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]), [[Wang Film Productions]], [[AKOM]], [[Freelance Animators New Zealand]], Encore Cartoons, [[StarToons]],<ref name=startoons>{{cite news|last=Owens|first=John|title=Drawing On Experience|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/features/9203010023_1_animation-studios-hanna-barbera-studios-hollywood-cartoon|accessdate=1 October 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 5, 1992}}</ref> and [[Kennedy Cartoons]].<ref>Credits from various ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' episodes.{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}</ref> Tokyo Movie Shinsha also animated the series' opening sequence. Some of the Warner Bros. staff disliked working with Kennedy Cartoons due to the animation studio's inconsistent quality, and episodes that they animated were often subject to multiple re-takes. In other cases, such as the debut episode \"The Looney Beginning\", portions of Kennedy Cartoons-animated episodes were re-animated by another animation studio.<ref name=\"kennedy\">{{cite web|url=http://platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html|title=Platypus Comix interviews......Tom Ruegger!

It had a [[cel]] count that was more than double that of most animated television shows then.<ref name=\"creation\"/> The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more fluidly.<ref name=\"creation\"/> [[Pierre DeCelles]], an animation producer, described storyboarding for the series as \"fun but a big challenge because I always had a short schedule, and it's not always easy to work full blast nonstop\".\n\n===Music===\nDuring the development of the show [[Steven Spielberg]] said that [[Warner Bros.]] would use a full orchestra, which some thought too expensive and impossible, but they ended up agreeing. [[Warner Bros.]] selected [[Bruce Broughton]] to write the theme tune (for which he would win a [[Daytime Emmy]] along with [[Tom Ruegger]] and [[Wayne Kaatz]], who both worked with Broughton on the lyrics) and serve as [[music supervisor]]. Screen credits for the composers were given based on the amount of music composed for, or composed and reused in, the episode.\n\nTwenty-six other composers were contracted to create original dramatic underscore for each different episode during the series run: Julie and [[Steven Bernstein (musician)|Steve Bernstein]], [[Steven Bramson]], [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], [[John Debney]], Ron Grant, [[Les Hooper]], Carl Johnson, Elliot Kaplan, Arthur Kempel, Ralph Kessler, Albert Lloyd Olson, [[Hummie Mann]], [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], [[Joel McNeely]], Peter Myers, [[Laurence Rosenthal]], [[William Ross (composer)|William Ross]], [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]], J. Eric Schmidt, David Slonaker, [[Fred Steiner]], [[Morton Stevens]], [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]], [[Stephen James Taylor]] and [[Mark Watters]]. The composers conducted their own music. Of these composers, Broughton, Bramson, Davis, Olson, Stone, Taylor and Watters wrote the score to ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation]]''.\n\nThese composers would later write the musical scores for shows including ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]].''\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}\n{{:List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Charlie Adler]] \u2013 Buster Bunny (1990-1992)\n** [[John Kassir]] \u2013 Buster Bunny (1992-1995)\n* [[Joe Alaskey]] \u2013 Plucky Duck\n* [[Danny Cooksey]] \u2013 Montana Max\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] \u2013 Dizzy Devil \n* [[Tress MacNeille]] \u2013 Babs Bunny\n* [[Gail Matthius]] \u2013 Shirley the Loon\n* [[Don Messick]] \u2013 Hamton J.

Animation]] department,\" and at the same time create a series with junior versions of [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters|Looney Tunes characters]]. Semel proposed that the new series would be a show based on ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' where the characters were either young versions of the original ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' characters or new characters as the offspring of the original characters.<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Bob|title=NEW TOONS ON THE BLOCK: They're attending Acme Looniversity & hoping to graduate as classic cartoon characters|periodical=Comic Scene|issue=15|pages=33\u201339, 68|year=1990}}</ref> The idea of a series with the basis of younger and junior versions of cartoon characters was common at the time; the era in which ''Tiny Toons'' was produced for had such cartoons as ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Tom & Jerry Kids]]'' and ''[[The Flintstones Kids]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] chose to do the same because Spielberg wanted to make a series similar to ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', as series producer/show-runner Tom Ruegger explained: \"Well, I think in [[Warner Bros.]] case, they had the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg] on a project [...] But he didn't want to just work on characters that [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]], [[Robert McKimson|Bob McKimson]] and [[Bob Clampett]] made famous and created. He wanted to be involved with the creation of some ''new'' characters.\" The result was a series similar to ''Looney Tunes'' without the use of the same characters.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn January 20, 1987,<ref name=\"collab2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318258,00.html|title=SUFFERIN' SUCCOTASH!

Animation studio approached [[Steven Spielberg]] to collaborate with Semel and [[Warner Bros.]] head of licensing Dan Romanelli on Semel's ideas.<ref name=\"creation\"/> They eventually decided that the new characters would be similar to the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters with no direct relation. However, ''Tiny Toons'' did not go into production then, nor was it even planned to be made for television; the series initially was to be a [[theatrical]] [[feature-length film]].<ref name=\"collab\"/><ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn December 27, 1988, ''Tiny Toons'' was changed from a film to a television series, with [[Jean MacCurdy]] overseeing production of the first 65 episodes.<ref name=\"creation\"/> MacCurdy said that ''Tiny Toons'' was changed to a television series to \"reach a broader audience\".<ref name=\"collab\"/> For the series, MacCurdy hired [[Tom Ruegger]], who previously wrote cartoons for [[Filmation]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], to be a producer.<ref name=\"creation\"/> In January 1989, Ruegger and writer [[Wayne Kaatz]] began developing the characters and the setting of \"Acme Acres\" with Spielberg.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn January 9, 1989, [[Warner Bros.

The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy [[superhero]] who battles with an array of supervillains.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=220-221}}</ref> The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by [[Amblin Television]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] during the [[Modern animation in the United States|animation renaissance]] of the 1990s.\n\n[[Bruce Timm]], best known as a major principal of the [[DC animated universe]], originally intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but [[executive producer]] [[Steven Spielberg]] asked series producer and writer [[Tom Ruegger]] and the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' team to turn ''Freakazoid!'' into a flat-out comedy.<ref name=\"comedy\">Lenburg, p. 638</ref> The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and the humor is unique in its inclusions of [[slapstick]], [[fourth wall]] firings, [[parody]], [[surreal humor]] and pop cultural references.\n\nThe series was one of the first to debut on the new [[Kids' WB]] Saturday morning block of [[The WB]], on September 9, 1995. The series lasted for two seasons, finishing with 24 episodes, the final one broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in the ratings, reruns on [[Cartoon Network]] and a fan following have elevated the series to become a [[Cult following|cult hit]].<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Warner Brothers even flirted with the idea of renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it to be too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Animated Series list.<ref>{{cite web|title=53. Freakazoid|url=http://www.ign.com/top/animated-tv-series/53.html|work=Top 100 Animated Series|publisher=IGN|accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe show's title character is the superhero alter ego of [[geek]]y 16-year-old (later changed to 17-year-old) Dexter Douglas who attends [[Harry Connick, Jr.|Harry Connick]] High School. His name is a parody of various superheroes' alliterative names (e.g. [[Bruce Banner]], [[Peter Parker]]). Dexter gained his abilities from a [[computer bug]] activated by a \"secret key sequence\" that must be typed (a reference to the [[Pentium FDIV bug]]). The sequence of keys is ''\"@[=g3,8d]\\&fbb=-q]/hk%fg\"'' (the quotes are included), as seen when Roddy MacStew types the combination in \"[[Integrated circuit|The Chip]] (Act 2)\". The bug manifests when the user presses Delete after entering the string, and was first activated when Dexter's [[cat]] crawled onto the keyboard. Becoming absorbed into his computer and instantly gaining all the information on the [[Internet]], Freakazoid has enhanced [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[endurance]], extraordinary speed and [[agility]] and negligible amounts of [[sanity]]. These changes make him a powerful and fearsome force for upholding [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and righteousness, unless he gets distracted by something like a bear riding a motorcycle. He has a base called the Freakalair, a parody of [[the Batcave]], built by his mute butler, Ingmar. The Freakalair contains a \"Hall of Nifty Things to Know\" and even a [[mad scientist]] lab. His greatest weakness, as he once explained to Armando Guitierrez, is that he can be imprisoned in a cage with [[graphite]] bars charged with [[negative ions]]. He also expresses a great aversion to \"[[Sewer gas|poo gas]]\".\n\nPeripheral powers come and go: Freakazoid once developed [[telekinesis]] triggered by anger that was never mentioned again after the episode, and once crossed the globe to yell at a Tibetan monk for raking too loudly, but apologizes to him later in the same plot. He also has the ability to assume the form of [[electricity]] and cover long distances instantaneously, although he just as often simply sticks his arms forward and runs while making swooshing sounds with his mouth, pretending to fly.\n\nDexter can change into and out of Freakazoid at will with the words \"Freak out!\" and \"Freak in!\". When not in Freakazoid mode, Dexter looks and acts completely normal, and his family is unaware that anything has happened to him. Freakazoid spends this time in an area of Dexter's brain called the Freakazone, where he reflects, has profound thoughts, and watches reruns of ''[[The Rat Patrol]]''.\n\nWhile the show's setting is set around [[Washington, D.C.]], the locale often varies with the show's humor, taking Freakazoid to locations around the world as needed.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Freakazoid''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]])&nbsp;\u2013 The protagonist of the series. He was once [[geek]]y 16-year-old computer ace named '''Dexter Douglas''' (voiced by [[David Kaufman (actor)|David Kaufman]]) who became Freakazoid from an overloaded Pinnacle chip inside his computer. He attends [[Harry Connick, Jr.|Harry Connick]] High School. To transform into Freakazoid, Dexter says \"Freak out!\". To change back into Dexter, Freakazoid says \"Freak in!\". Dexter and Freakazoid sometimes identify as separate identities, and other times consider themselves to be the same person. Catchphrase:  \"Aw, nut bunnies!\" His image and \"Freak Out!\" superpower are parodies of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]].\n\n===The Douglas family===\n* '''Duncan Douglas''' (voiced by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340359/ Googy Gress])&nbsp;\u2013 Dexter's older brother. He is a bully towards Dexter, and is portrayed as a caricature of a high school jock.\n* '''Debbie Douglas''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&nbsp;\u2013 Dexter's mother. She has no clue that her son is Freakazoid, and is in general blithe and clueless. Her lines often involve morose subjects delivered in a cheery tone, a parody of a stereotypical domestic mother.\n* '''Douglas Douglas''' (voiced by [[John P. McCann]])&nbsp;\u2013 Dexter's father. An automobile dealer who thinks a goblin lives in the gas tank of his car. Occasionally used for laughs as a stereotypical technologically inept father figure.\n* '''Mr. Chubbikins''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&nbsp;\u2013 The Douglas' [[morbid obesity|morbidly obese]] cat that was formerly named Mr. Chubbskins. He jumped on Dexter's keyboard while chasing a butterfly, accidentally typing in the key sequence which activated the Pinnacle chip's flaw, turning Dexter into Freakazoid.\n\n===Allies===\n* '''Sgt. Mike Cosgrove''' (voiced by [[Edward Asner]])&nbsp;\u2013 A heavyset, gruff [[Police|cop]] with a heart of gold, who is friends with Freakazoid and several other characters. He speaks in a gruff [[Monotone (disambiguation)|monotone]] and shows very little enthusiasm for anything. By pointing at something and saying \"Cut it out\", he has the almost supernatural ability to get people to stop whatever they are doing on command, no matter what they may be doing at the time, be it panicking at the sight of a villain, stealing a television, or attempting to capture Cosgrove and Freakazoid (in the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' comic series, he even once managed to get [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]] to \"Cut it out\", something that many others had tried, and failed, to do). Cosgrove also possesses the odd power of finding Freakazoid no matter where he is by driving his police car to that particular location. He often interrupts Freakazoid's heroic endeavors to ask him to visit various entertainments, such as the \"Honey Harvest Festival\" or \"a bear riding a motorcycle\" which Freakazoid always enthusiastically agrees to, no matter what else he is doing at the time. During this visit, Cosgrove inevitably reveals important information about the plot of the episode, including the villain's location or evil deeds. Freakazoid then rushes off to foil the villain's scheme, leaving Cosgrove to enjoy the attraction for himself. Sgt. Cosgrove also resembles his voice actor.\n* '''Roddy MacStew''' (voiced by [[Craig Ferguson]])&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's mentor, and expositionist; an ill-tempered Scotsman who once worked for Guitierrez. He first found that the Pinnacle chip was flawed. In the continuation of \"The Chip\" (detailing how Freakazoid gained his powers) he was trapped in the Internet. He was later kicked out of the Internet by Guitierrez and resumed his mentor role. Favorite word: \"Crud!\"\n* '''Steff''' (voiced by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746617/ Tracy Rowe])&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's perky blonde girlfriend; her real name is Stephanie. She discovers Freakazoid's secret identity when Cosgrove accidentally points it out aloud in \"Mission: Freakazoid\".\n* '''Hans''' (voiced by [[Larry Cedar]])&nbsp;\u2013 A mysterious agent with a Western European accent, who takes Freakazoid to Professor Heiney's lab.\n* '''Professor Heiney''' (voiced by [[Ed Gilbert (actor)|Ed Gilbert]])&nbsp;\u2013 A scientist, with a lab in the mountains, who Freakazoid often goes to for help. He does research on monsters, zaps them and is often attacked by them at his lab.\n* '''Ingmar'''&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's mute butler, in charge of the maintenance of the Freakalair (according to Freakazoid, he constructed it himself from scratch). He quit in \"Mission: Freakazoid\" to become a [[rodeo clown]] and was replaced by Professor Jones. A [[Parody|take-off]] on Bernardo, the mute manservant of [[Zorro]] and [[Batman]]'s butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]].\n* '''Professor Jones''' (voiced by [[Jonathan Harris]])&nbsp;\u2013 A snooty, cowardly manservant, essentially recreating his role as Doctor Zachary Smith from ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (every time Jones appears in a scene, someone asks him if he was \"on a TV show with a robot\"). He is the replacement to the Freakalair's previous butler, and old friends with him. Does not get along with Cosgrove well and gets little respect from Freakazoid, or anyone else.\n* '''Joe Leahy''' (voiced by himself)&nbsp;\u2013 The show's very vocal announcer, who sometimes gets more involved than the job usually requires.\n* '''Freakazette'''&nbsp;\u2013 Only mentioned in the first episode for a brief verse during the \"Freakazoid and Friends\" theme song (which plays to the same theme as ''[[Animaniacs]]'').\n* '''Foamy the Freakadog''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&nbsp;\u2013 A vicious, rabid dog which Freakazoid had freed from the pound. Foamy is painted blue, has a Freakazoid costume (complete with hair), and is prone to maul and/or beat Freakazoid to a pulp, even on their missions.\n* '''Handman''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]])&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's brief \"right hand man\". He is quite literally just a painted face on Freakazoid's right hand who has great difficulty pronouncing Freakazoid's name correctly. Fell in love with and married '''Handgirl''', a painted face on Freakazoid's left hand.\n* '''Expendable Lad'''&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's brief sidekick from the start of \"And Fanboy Is His Name\". He was taken to the hospital due to injuries sustained from Milk Man's attack that gave him a bruised [[clavicle]]. Expendable Lad was subsequently released from the service of Freakazoid.\n* '''[[Norm Abram]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 He was kidnapped by the Lobe to make a wooden instrument to destroy Freakazoid, but got free and helped turn the tables against the Lobe and his villain allies. Abram supplied his own voice and trademark line for the episode.\n* '''[[Leonard Maltin]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 He was kidnapped by Dr. Mystico during the episode \"Island of Dr. Mystico\", while Maltin was giving his opinion of the same episode. Freakazoid points out that Mystico's prisoners all have superpowers, and Mr. Maltin's is that he knows every movie ever made. Maltin provided his own voice for the episode.\n* '''[[Henry Kissinger]]''' (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]])&nbsp;\u2013 A politician who was kidnapped by Dr. Mystico's \"orangu-men\". In the show, he speaks in a low, groggy, incomprehensible mumble. He is briefly mentioned in one episode after his only appearance.\n\n===Enemies===\n''Freakazoid!'' features a number of campy villains and enemies, including:\n\n* '''The Lobe''' (voiced by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]])&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's archenemy. He is a supergenius whose entire head appears to be a giant brain. Despite his high intellect, he has very low self-esteem, once even having a scheme foiled by Freakazoid simply insulting the plan, despite actually being impressed by it. No background information of any kind is given for the Lobe; not even his real name is revealed.\n* '''Cobra Queen''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&nbsp;\u2013 Audrey Manatee is a former [[Shoplifting|shoplifter]] whose encounter with an experimental cosmetic left in the sun too long transformed her into a cobra woman, with command over [[snake]]s and other [[reptile]]s. In later episodes, Cave Guy and Cobra Queen are a couple. She has a lair in the sewers, and often complained about the lack of light until Freakazoid suggested getting [[Japanese lantern]]s. He defeated her when she faints while trying to say \"Silly Sally Sells Sappy Seashells in Seattle\" (he later wonders how that worked). Cobra Queen also shows up as part of the team in \"Mission: Freakazoid!\". She seems to be offended when compared to [[Sylvester the Cat]].\n* '''Cave Guy''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] impersonating [[Jim Backus]])&nbsp;\u2013 A thuggish blue [[caveman]] with upper-class diction, education, and taste who speaks in a stereotypical [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] tone (see [[Locust Valley lockjaw]]). His real name is Royce Mumphry and he subscribes to ''[[The New Yorker]]''. He also seems to have an odd fear of [[Klingons]] (possibly because of the made-up language they use).\n* '''Longhorn''' (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]])&nbsp;\u2013 Formerly Jubal \"Bull\" Nixon, he was once an employee of the ''Johnny Cat'' cat litter company until he turned to a life of crime. Because he was searched for by law enforcement so frequently, he had [[plastic surgery]] to turn himself into a humanoid [[Texas Longhorn]] (Freakazoid pointed out that this did not prevent him from showing up on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' every week). He loves [[country music]] and, despite being a lousy songwriter, is determined to get a recording contract in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He also owns a massive truck, nicknamed \"Bessie Mae\", which is outfitted with all kinds of devices.\n** '''Turk''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]])&nbsp;\u2013 Longhorn's sidekick.\n* '''Armando Guitierrez''' (voiced by [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]])&nbsp;\u2013 The eyepatch-wearing man whose company Apex Microchips (not to be confused with [[Apex Digital]]) designed the faulty Pinnacle chip responsible for Freakazoid's creation as well as Freakazoid's first enemy. Physically, Guitierrez resembles [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], who provides the character's voice as well. At times, he shows similarities to [[Khan Noonien Singh]] from ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''; also played by Montalban. One of his recurring jokes is demanding others to laugh with him. When he fell to his supposed doom, he asked Freakazoid to scream with him. Originally a normal human being, he briefly gains powers similar to Freakazoid's by exploiting the Pinnacle chip's flaw. By \"Hero Boy\", he appears as a cyborg in a hooded robe to cover his cybernetic side caused by Freakazoid knocking him into a cyber-pit. He hates being called a weenie, to which he will angrily respond \"I am not a weenie! It is YOU who are the weenie!\". In \"Normadeus\", Guitierrez is among the villains invited by the Lobe to witness the destruction of Freakazoid. The Lobe commented that he never got an opportunity to be in the same room as Guitierrez before.\n** '''Jocko''' \u2013 Armando Guitierrez' henchman.\n* '''Candle Jack''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 A supernatural villain with a burlap sack over his head, called \"the Boogeyman, the for-real one\" in the series. He [[Kidnapping|abducts]] anyone who says his name and ties them up with rope, apparently because \"he's a nut.\" Although he prides himself on being scary, he has a weakness for pie and also seems to enjoy watching ''[[F Troop]]''. During \"Island of Dr. Mystico\", Freakazoid and Cosgrove have him chase around and scare Professor Jones.\n* '''Waylon Jeepers''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 A creepy little man originally from Venice Beach, CA who created the [[Medusa]] Watch, which has the power to turn people (and pigeons) into stone. He has also created a similar device that turned [[beaver]]s into gold, and once summoned the demon Vorn the Unspeakable, with the help of a book entitled ''How to Summon Monsters the E-Z Way''. His schemes seem to deeply infuriate Freakazoid and Jeepers is the shown to be the only villain that Freakazoid genuinely does not like (whereas the rest of the villains appear to have a friendly relationship with Freakazoid off-battle), once going on a long (and unscripted) rant. His name is a play on the name of famous country guitarist [[Waylon Jennings]].\n* '''Invisibo''' (voiced by [[Corey Burton]] impersonating [[Vincent Price]])&nbsp;\u2013 Real name: Ahmon Kor-Unch. An invisible, smart-mouthed [[pharaoh]] who is only visible via the [[Anubis]] staff he carries. While he was sealed away inside a sarcophagus, Duncan pushing Dexter into his sarcophagus resulted in the sarcophagus' seal being broken, enabling Invisibo to be free to resume his crime spree. Freakazoid gave Invisibo his name because \"you're invisible and it's my show and we already had a [[title card]] made up and it makes me happy!\" Invisibo accepts the name, saying it has a \"somewhat sinister ring to it.\" Freakazoid defeated Invisibo by destroying his staff and locking him back into his sarcophagus which is taken away by the authorities. In \"Normadeus\", Invisibo regained his invisibility powers and is among the villains invited by the Lobe to witness the destruction of Freakazoid where the Lobe gave him a party hat to be visible.\n* '''The Nerdator''' (voiced by [[Aron Kincaid]])&nbsp;\u2013 A man who planned to kidnap all of the [[nerd]]s in the world (which also included [[Steven Spielberg]]) and absorb their knowledge to become a \"Super-Nerd\". His plan succeeded until Freakazoid convinced him of the downsides of being a nerd. The Nerdator discontinued his plot. He was last seen kidnapping \"good-looking, but vapid airheads\". His character design is a parody of the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]].\n* '''Vorn the Unspeakable''' (voiced by [[Richard Moll]])&nbsp;\u2013 A demon summoned by Waylon Jeepers, who bears a resemblance to [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu]].\n* '''Arms Akimbo''' (voiced by [[John Schuck]] impersonating [[Edward G. Robinson]])&nbsp;\u2013 A spoiled [[Model (person)|model]] turned [[extortion]]ist who, after years of posing, was left with his arms frozen in a jaunty pose, hands on hips. When fighting, he strikes with his oversized elbows. His first appearance is in a local shop selling \"oops insurance\", a form of [[protection racket]]eering which mainly consists of him breaking something of value (or causing a building to detonate spectacularly), before comically following it up with a small \"oops\".\n* '''Milk Man'''&nbsp;\u2013 Only shown/mentioned in the episode \"And Fanboy Is His Name\". Shown on a news report in a pitched battle with Freakazoid and his then-[[sidekick]], Expendable Lad. As the name implies, he uses milk as his theme.\n* '''Deadpan''' (voiced by [[Bebe Neuwirth]])&nbsp;\u2013 A plain-looking (almost blank-faced) female supervillain with a monotonous voice. She is a [[shapeshifter]] who once tried to conquer Washington by transforming into Freakazoid, but this plan was quickly foiled when the real Freakazoid appeared immediately after and nonchalantly pointed her out. She had only one appearance in the cold opening for \"The Wrath of Guitierrez\".\n* '''Mary Beth''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&nbsp;\u2013 Cosgrove's former girlfriend, a cosmetics executive, and a monster. She is short-tempered and when angered, turns green, develops a deep raspy voice, and often lights candles by shooting flame from her nose. Her plan to steal Freakazoid's hero essence to remain immortal is foiled and, as a result, she shrivels, dies, and becomes a pile of dust. Her name is a play off of the cosmetics giant [[Mary Kay]].\n* '''Janos Ivnovels''' (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]])&nbsp;\u2013 The ruthless dictator of Vuka Nova and Minister of State Security. He is responsible for capturing Freakazoid's family (and a mime) and imprisoning them in the High-Security Wing of Chesky Beresch Prison, the toughest prison in Europe. He and his subordinate Colonel Anton Mohans were defeated after Freakazoid and his friends rescued the Douglas family (and the mime). Janos and Anton were last seen being tortured by the mime and his pals. He is a one-time villain, having appeared in \"Mission: Freakazoid\".\n** '''Colonel Anton Mohans''' (voiced by [[Larry Cedar]])&nbsp;\u2013 A vicious thug who finds it relaxing when Janos tortures his prisoners.\n* '''Dr. Mystico''' (voiced by [[Tim Curry]])&nbsp;\u2013 A mad scientist who turns orangutans into human-like beings (and vice versa) in \"Island of Dr. Mystico\", a parody of H. G. Wells's ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau]]''. He seeks to take over the world, though he always seems to say Cleveland instead. He has a white cat, similar to [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]. His first name may actually be Wendell, since he once says, ''\"They called me mad, insane, Wendell!\"''. He also bears a striking resemblance to his voice actor Tim Curry.\n* '''Kid Carrion''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 A zombie cowboy who was never named, and only appeared in \"Relax-o-Vision\" and \"The Lobe\". He can be seen in the opening credits standing next to Candle Jack. He bears a passing resemblance to the revamped version of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] from [[Bruce Timm]]'s ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', yet seems to be a parody of the villain Tex Hex from the 1987 [[Filmation]] cartoon series ''[[Bravestarr]]''.\n* '''Eye-of-Newt'''&nbsp;\u2013 A strange one-eyed creature with a hairstyle resembling [[Newt Gingrich]]'s; his name is a reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' (\"Eye of newt and toe of frog...\"). He has no dialogue and is a background villain, although it seems that he is frequently recaptured by heroes like Freakazoid or the Huntsman.\n\n===Other characters===<!-- This section is linked from [[Fanboy]] -->\nA few characters fall somewhere in the space between \"enemies\" and \"allies\" to land squarely in the category of \"nuisances\".\n\n* '''Mo-Ron/Bo-Ron''' (voiced by [[Stan Freberg]]) \u2013 An obese and dimwitted [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from the [[planet]] Barone's. His name was later changed to ''Bo-Ron'', to appease network censors' concerns that use of the word [[Moron (psychology)|moron]] might be offensive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In one episode Lord Bravery refers to him as \"Mo-Ron or... Bo-Ron, whatever.\" He is a parody of Ro-Man, the ridiculous-looking monster from the notoriously bad science fiction film ''[[Robot Monster]]''. His first appearance was when he tried to deliver Earth an \u201dimportant message\u201d, only to forget what it was. This message turned out to be a comet heading towards Earth which caused everybody to flee the area. He also appeared in an episode that was a parody of ''[[E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]''.\n* '''Fanboy''' (voiced by [[Stephen Furst]])&nbsp;\u2013 An obese, acne-stricken, socially awkward [[Fan (aficionado)#Fanboy|fanboy]] (hence his name) and would-be sidekick to Freakazoid who obsesses about numerous comic books, TV shows, and movies from ''[[The Black Hole]]'' to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]''. Fanboy's age is never specified. He could be anywhere between his late teens to early 30s. He bumped into [[George Takei]] at a comic book shop and gave chase, causing Takei to run into traffic and nearly getting hit by three cars.\n* '''[[Bill Clinton]]''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) and '''[[Hillary Clinton]]''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) make frequent cameos in the show, partly because Dexter Douglas lives in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n* '''[[Barbra Streisand]]''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) also makes a number of appearances, most notably in the episode \"Dexter's Date\", which features a parody of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]''.\n* '''Hero Boy''' (voiced by [[John P. McCann]]) \u2013 The title character from Freakazoid's favorite TV show that is first shown in the episode of the same name. Hero Boy has no powers (save for flying) and his black and white show is a parody of the [[animated series]] ''[[Astro Boy (1960s)|Astro Boy]]''. Hero Boy has the catchphrase \"I must succeed!\", though he is invariably shrugged off by the monsters he fights, including the giant ones, when his pathetic fighting techniques (consisting of weakly pounding on his enemies) fail miserably.\n* '''[[Steven Spielberg]]''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 The show's executive producer. His most notable appearance was in part of an episode where Freakazoid, the Brain from ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', and Wakko Warner from ''[[Animaniacs]]'' get into a disagreement over which of their shows he likes best (only for Spielberg to ask, \"Who are you people?\"). In \"The Nerdator\", Steven Spielberg is among the nerds that are captured by the Nerdator. During this time, he was directing a sequel to ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' called ''E.T. Returns''.\n* '''[[Paul Harvey]]''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]) \u2013 A loud, obnoxious man who often interrupts the story to give background information on a villain (as seen in episodes featuring Cobra Queen and Longhorn), or to describe, rather than show, the ending of an episode (demonstrated in \"Candle Jack\"). He is a parody of the radio personality of the same name, and even borrows the catchphrase \"the rest of the story\" from the real Harvey.\n* '''Lonnie Tallbutt''' (voiced by [[Mitch Schauer]] in human form, [[Jim Cummings]] in werewolf form) \u2013 A [[werewolf]] that begs Dexter for help. His name is a combination of that of [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] and Lawrence Talbot, the character Chaney played in the 1941 movie ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''. He is prone to grabbing people's shirt collars and yelling \"You don't understand!\"\n\n[[File:Emmitt-Nervend.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The elusive Emmitt Nervend, who is often only seen briefly between frames of animation on the show]]\n* '''Emmitt Nervend''' \u2013 A short, hunchbacked man with straw-like hair and a frozen grimace who usually shows up at least once an episode, always in the opening credits, but usually in the background. He stands looking at the camera (as pictured), never saying a word. Sometimes things happen to him directly, like him standing outside a restaurant collecting donations while dressed as Santa Claus and ringing a bell, birds pecking his head, or laser beams shooting just above his head. The [[end credits]] will often contain a credit revealing how many times Emmitt can be found in a particular episode. His appearance was drawn by [[Mitch Schauer]].\n* '''Weena Mercator as The Hopping Woman''' \u2013 A person acknowledged whenever credits are used in an episode. However, no episode or sketch has ever featured a hopping woman. Her name also appears with multiple spellings: \"Mercator\" in \"Dance of Doom\" and \"Mercatur\" in \"The Cloud\".\n* ''[[Yakko Warner]]'' \u2013 The oldest brother of the [[Animaniacs]]. Yakko is played by [[Rob Paulsen]].\n* ''[[Wakko Warner]] \u2013 The younger brother of the Animaniacs. Wakko is played by [[Jess Harnell]].\n* ''[[Dot Warner]] \u2013 The youngest sister of the Animaniacs. Dot is played by Tress MacNeille.\n* ''[[Pinky and the Brain|The Brain]] \u2013 A genius from Pinky and the Brain. The Brain is played by Maurice LaMarche.\n\n===Mini-segments===\n''Freakazoid!'' also features several mini-segments, primarily during the first season. Each of these have their own theme songs, title cards and cast, and only rarely \"cross over\" into the continuity of the main show. These segments include:\n\n* '''Lord Bravery'''&nbsp;\u2013 Nigel Skunkthorpe (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] impersonating [[John Cleese]]) is a superhero from the United Kingdom in an outfit slightly resembling that of a [[Rome|Roman]] soldier. He does not do much in the way of superheroism; in fact, he is very snooty, cynical and unwilling to do unpleasant tasks in the course of his duties such as entering a sewer to perform a rescue. Likewise, he gets little respect and recognition as a superhero from the general public and even from his wife and mother-in-law, with whom he lives, and is generally the laughing stock of the superheroes. At one point, he loses his name due to a trademark dispute with a bakery of the same name, after which he changes his name to ''Lord Smoked Meats and Fishes''. He has been mistaken for a party clown. His theme song is delivered in the style of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s song \"A British Tar\".\n* '''The Huntsman'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Huntsman (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a good guess at what [[Robin Hood]] would be like if portrayed by [[Charlton Heston]]. He can never find enough crime to fight and secretly suspects that the police are hiding crimes from him because they do not trust him (it is also possible that he was so good at being a superhero that his villains simply gave up). He was once a hunter called Marty Feeb who saved a chunky [[elf]] from being eaten by a [[crow]]. The elf rewarded Marty Feeb with a magic sack of corn. Upon eating it, he was granted strength, speed, and shining teeth, and became the Huntsman. He also has a brother called Hector Feeb, who he claims lives in a [[townhouse]]. Huntsman can be summoned by a policeman blowing into the Horn of Urgency on top of the local police station, and his battle cry is \"Into action!\". When he appears before Lt. Artie King (voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]), the Huntsman is told in those two episodes that either a rookie mistakenly blew the horn or the blowing of the horn was a false alarm. Possibly a parody of the comic book character the [[Green Arrow]]. His trademark phrase is \"Darn, the luck, darn!\" His sketches are often themed around beginning with a lengthy, overly heroic opener, with a title that would indicate an action-oriented episode, that ends up being a short anticlimactic skit of the Huntsman not being needed. In one of his episodes, it was mentioned that he had fought the Lobe and Cave Guy, and he is shown fighting Cave Guy and Candle Jack in his opening. Huntsman was once seen as the umpire during the ''Superheroes/Villain All-Star Benefit Softball Game''. When Freakazoid, Arms Akimbo, and Cave Guy both asked his opinion on a play, he responded that he had looked away to have some berry water and did not see if the play was an out or a safe.\n* '''The Lawn Gnomes'''&nbsp;\u2013 Baffeardin (voiced by [[Clive Revill]]), Huska (voiced by [[Carl Ballantine]]), Honna (voiced by [[Rose Marie]]), and Quist (voiced by [[Larry Gelman]]) are a group of gnomes-turned-lawn gnomes that come to life at night in a parody of the ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' animated series. Infamous for their mischief back in AD 995, they were advised by the Great Mystic Gnome (voiced by [[Roscoe Lee Browne]]) to change their ways before it gets worse for them. After planning to do so in a week, the four gnomes were cursed to become stone by day by the powerful wizard Rathgar (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) after they played a prank on him and previously attacked his younger Viking brother Erik the Large (also voiced by Maurice LaMarche). They would revert at night during which time they were given the opportunity to mend their ways to fight evil alongside mankind, after which the curse would be lifted. During this one-time sketch, Freakazoid did his commentary on it.\n* '''Toby Danger'''&nbsp;\u2013 A (somewhat) loving parody of ''[[Jonny Quest]]'', featuring the voices of [[Scott Menville]], [[Don Messick]] (in his last role before he died), and [[Granville Van Dusen]] (all of whom provided voices for ''JQ''), that was originally written by [[Tom Minton]] as a 12-minute stand-alone short for ''[[Animaniacs]]'', but slotted into ''Freakazoid!'' after that series was greenlighted and had an eight-minute opening. The completed 12-minute ''Toby Danger'' storyboard was trimmed by director Eric Radomski to fit into the available ''Freakazoid!'' time slot.\n* '''Fatman and Boy Blubber'''&nbsp;\u2013 The misadventures of two morbidly obese superheroes (voiced by Marc Drotman and [[Paul Rugg]], respectively), in a parody of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series. Their only segment involves them coming to the aid of Louis, an overweight boy who loves sweet buns and is being tormented by bullies. After attempting to capture the bullies, and failing due to their extreme lack of physical fitness, Fatman and Boy Blubber deliver a pseudo-inspirational speech to Louis about their own struggles with being overweight, and how they often end up eating fast food and snacks instead of having sensible meals. When Louis asks what the point of the speech is, Fatman changes the subject to ask if Louis has any more sweet buns in his lunchbox; the hero then tries to confiscate the food (it is unclear whether he is attempting to prevent Louis from gaining more weight, or simply wants the sweet bun for himself), and begins beating Louis up with Boy Blubber when the boy refuses to give it to them. Fatman also makes an appearance during \"Hero Boy\" where it is revealed the episode is also a storybook being read by Fatman to some children.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Voicing===\nThe voice actors of the show ''Freakazoid!'' included various actors from other television series and films. [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], [[Jeff Bennett]], and [[Frank Welker]], who all provided voices in the series ''[[Animaniacs]]'', were on ''Freakazoid!''.  Actors [[Ed Asner]], [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], [[Larry Cedar]], [[Jonathan Harris]], and [[Stephen Furst]] also provided voices for the series. Also, writers [[John P. McCann]] and [[Paul Rugg]] (who played Freakazoid) added voices themselves.\n\nCasting for the show had been difficult for the ''Freakazoid!'' staff, as no lead character had been found even after extensive auditions.<ref name=\"Rugg\">{{Cite news| last =Rogers| first =Brett| year =1996| title =Freaking Out With Paul Rugg| periodical =Animato!| issue =36| url =http://members.aol.com/baltohoya/rugg.htm| accessdate =2007-06-29| url-status =bot: unknown| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071104024703/http://members.aol.com/baltohoya/rugg.htm| archivedate =2007-11-04}}</ref> Eventually, when writer [[Paul Rugg]] was brought to demonstrate the voice in a recording session, he ended up filling the role, as he said: \"I went in there and did it.

Fine, sure, great,' and then I panicked ... and I had to do it.\"<ref name = \"Rugg\"/>  Rugg played the role of Freakazoid through the entire series run.\n\n===Music===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\n<!--Adding a music section to this page would make the article more informative.  Music was an integral part of this series.  I suggest the following:-->\n\nThe music for ''Freakazoid!'' was written by [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077148/?ref_=nv_sr_2 Steve Bernstein], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077081/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Julie Bernstein], [[Gordon Goodwin]] and Tim Kelly.  Stone won a Daytime Emmy with lyricist (and senior producer) [[Tom Ruegger]] for the main title song in 1996.  Julie Bernstein was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Original Song in 1998 for the song \"Invisibo\" from the episode ''Freak-a-Panel''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Controversy with Mike Allred's ''Madman''==\nCartoonist [[Mike Allred]] has criticized the show and its lead character as [[plagiarism]] of his [[comic book]] ''[[Madman (Image Comics)|Madman]]'',<ref name=\"madman\"/> asserting that the title characters share several personality traits, and wear similar costumes featuring a chest emblem including an exclamation mark. During the short run of the show, Allred remained relatively silent on the subject, but in 2003, he responded to a question about the show on the message board of his official website:\n\n{{quote|text=[Show creator] [[Bruce Timm]] was kind enough to tell me that ''Madman'' was a direct inspiration for the show, with comics open and referred to when developing the show.\n\nStupidly, I was flattered; happy to inspire anything. But when the show came out, with no acknowledgement or credit or any kind of compensation, I slowly became annoyed as everyone and their uncle confronted me with \"there's this cartoon that's ripping off ''Madman''\" and \"you oughta sue\".\n\nI simply wrote a friendly letter to [show producer] [[Steven Spielberg]] telling him his production was a direct lift of my creation, I had no intention of creating ripples, I just wanted him to know that I knew. No one replied, which is fine. And to be honest, ''Madman'' is an amalgam of a half a dozen other influences. So who am I to complain (the exclamation mark on the chest still kinda urks ''[sic]'' me a little though. A little too close for comfort).<ref name=\"madman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicscommunity.com/boards/allred/?noframes;read=9834 |title=Re: Freakazoid |first=Mike |last=Allred |work=Mike Allred Message Board |date=2003-11-07 |accessdate=2007-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728122015/http://www.comicscommunity.com/boards/allred/?noframes%3Bread=9834 |archivedate=July 28, 2006 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Humor==\nThe humor in ''Freakazoid!'' relied heavily on [[slapstick]], [[parody]] and pop cultural references. Due to the series being [[metafiction]], much of the series was self-aware humor (i.e. [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]]); for instance, after the first appearance of the Freakmobile, the show goes immediately into an impromptu commercial for a toy version, and later in the episode, Freakazoid addresses an audience, congratulating the staff on how hard they have worked to make the show [[toyetic]]. A typically strange running gag involves a repeated credit for \"Weena Mercator as the Hopping Woman\", though no such character appears in any episode. Her credit is usually preceded by a number of other fictional names and followed by a fictional director. The show also incorporated humor aimed at the then-newly founded [[The WB|WB Network]], such as questioning the meaning of the initials \"WB\", e.g., \"Weird Butt\" or \"Wet Bananas\" instead of Warner Bros.\n\n''Freakazoid!'' made frequent use of [[stock footage]], including the peaceful scene of a field of flowers (\"Relax-O-Vision\"), numerous people screaming (\"Scream-O-Vision\"), traditionally dressed [[Bavaria]]ns dancing and slapping each other, a [[Frank \"Cannonball\" Richards|man being shot in the belly with a cannonball]] and a man wrestling a bear.\n\n[[Cameo appearance]]s were also a major element of the show's humor. At various times, ''Freakazoid!'' hosted appearances by characters from other [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] such as ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and even an insinuation appearance of the ''[[Batman]]'' from Bruce Timm's [[Batman: The Animated Series|animated version]], which has a similar drawing style (its concept of old movie-style title cards at the beginning of each episode was also replicated in ''Freakazoid!''). Portrayals of many celebrities (including producer [[Steven Spielberg]]) and guest appearances by such figures as [[Jack Valenti]], [[Leonard Maltin]] and [[Mark Hamill]] as themselves were also commonplace. [[Norm Abram]] had an entire episode, \"Normadeus\", built around him. One original character, a bizarre-looking man named Emmitt Nervend, plays no role whatsoever other than enabling a ''[[Where's Waldo? (video game)|Where's Waldo]]''-esque hunt for his constant cameos (complete with the number of his appearances announced in the closing credits).\n\nOne of the show's longest cameo appearances was when [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot#Wakko Warner|Wakko]] (from ''[[Animaniacs]]'') and the [[List of Animaniacs characters#Pinky and the Brain|Brain]] (from ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'') appeared in a scene in which they argue with Freakazoid over which of their shows is [[Steven Spielberg]]'s favorite, with Freakazoid arguing that his show was the favorite because \"we got a memo\" (''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' was not represented in the discussion as it was on [[Nickelodeon]] at the time, while the others were on [[Kids' WB]]). However, when the trio confronts Steven over the issue, he simply replies: \"Who are you people?\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation===\n{{quote box|quote=I mean, it probably would not have worked as a straight super-hero show.

Timm came up with the name for the character naturally, as he recalled, \"The name 'Freakazoid' just kind of jumped out of me, I don't even know where from. I said 'Oh, yeah, 'Freakazoid', that might be an interesting name.'\"<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\nTimm originally created ''Freakazoid!'' to be a serious \"adventure show\" with some comedic undertones.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>  However, his initial idea for the series did not come to be, as he stated:\n\n{{quote|text=I don't mind that it's not on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. [Laughs] I bailed on it really early. It started out as an adventure show, but it ended up turning into more and more of a comedy show; every time we'd have a meeting with Steven, the concept would kinda [sic] change, and it kept leaning more and more towards zany comedy. It really started out almost like [[Spider-Man]], on that level of, like, a teenage superhero. And it reached a point where it became a comedy with the ''Tiny Toon Adventures''/''[[Animaniacs]]'' kind of humor. (...)

Spielberg liked what Ruegger had written, but wanted longer stories for the series as well.  Ruegger then asked writers [[John P. McCann|John McCann]] and [[Paul Rugg]] to come onto the series to write longer, more elaborate stories for the series and, according to Rugg, \"(...) figure out what this [''Freakazoid!''] was going to be, and the answer was like, 'We didn't know', and still don't\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\n===Premiere, cancellation, and syndication===\n{{Main|List of Freakazoid! episodes}}\n''Freakazoid!'' premiered on [[Kids' WB]]'s Saturday lineup on September 9, 1995.<ref name=\"comedy\"/>  During its run, ''Freakazoid'' came across problems of appealing to its target demographic, young children.  [[Tom Ruegger]] said that ''Freakazoid!'' had done poorly in ratings because the audience that the series gathered was older than the target audience.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>  Also, ''Freakazoid'' ran into timeslot problems. Writer [[John P. McCann|John McCann]] said that the time slot of the series changed frequently: \"They put it at eight o' clock in the morning, 3:30 in the afternoon, they shifted it all around; we couldn't even find it, and we wrote the thing\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>  The series ran on [[Kids' WB]] until February 14, 1997, when it was canceled due to poor ratings, airing only one complete season and part of a second season.<ref name=\"comedy\"/>  Rugg said the series' demise was the result of a combination of people not understanding the series, time slot changes, appealing to the wrong demographics, and that \"(...) there aren't a lot of [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen boxes]] in federal prisons. Had there been, I'm telling you, we'd still be on the air today\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>  \nHowever, the show was later picked up by [[Cartoon Network]] and was rebroadcast from April 5, 1997 until March 29, 2003.<ref name=\"comedy\"/> The series had a total number of 24 episodes.

The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy [[superhero]] who battles with an array of supervillains.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=220-221}}</ref> The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by [[Amblin Television]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] during the [[Modern animation in the United States|animation renaissance]] of the 1990s.\n\n[[Bruce Timm]], best known as a major principal of the [[DC animated universe]], originally intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but [[executive producer]] [[Steven Spielberg]] asked series producer and writer [[Tom Ruegger]] and the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' team to turn ''Freakazoid!'' into a flat-out comedy.<ref name=\"comedy\">Lenburg, p. 638</ref> The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and the humor is unique in its inclusions of [[slapstick]], [[fourth wall]] firings, [[parody]], [[surreal humor]] and pop cultural references.\n\nThe series was one of the first to debut on the new [[Kids' WB]] Saturday morning block of [[The WB]], on September 9, 1995. The series lasted for two seasons, finishing with 24 episodes, the final one broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in the ratings, reruns on [[Cartoon Network]] and a fan following have elevated the series to become a [[Cult following|cult hit]].<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Warner Brothers even flirted with the idea of renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it to be too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Animated Series list.<ref>{{cite web|title=53. Freakazoid|url=http://www.ign.com/top/animated-tv-series/53.html|work=Top 100 Animated Series|publisher=IGN|accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe show's title character is the superhero alter ego of [[geek]]y 16-year-old (later changed to 17-year-old) Dexter Douglas who attends [[Harry Connick, Jr.|Harry Connick]] High School. His name is a parody of various superheroes' alliterative names (e.g. [[Bruce Banner]], [[Peter Parker]]). Dexter gained his abilities from a [[computer bug]] activated by a \"secret key sequence\" that must be typed (a reference to the [[Pentium FDIV bug]]). The sequence of keys is ''\"@[=g3,8d]\\&fbb=-q]/hk%fg\"'' (the quotes are included), as seen when Roddy MacStew types the combination in \"[[Integrated circuit|The Chip]] (Act 2)\". The bug manifests when the user presses Delete after entering the string, and was first activated when Dexter's [[cat]] crawled onto the keyboard. Becoming absorbed into his computer and instantly gaining all the information on the [[Internet]], Freakazoid has enhanced [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[endurance]], extraordinary speed and [[agility]] and negligible amounts of [[sanity]]. These changes make him a powerful and fearsome force for upholding [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and righteousness, unless he gets distracted by something like a bear riding a motorcycle. He has a base called the Freakalair, a parody of [[the Batcave]], built by his mute butler, Ingmar. The Freakalair contains a \"Hall of Nifty Things to Know\" and even a [[mad scientist]] lab. His greatest weakness, as he once explained to Armando Guitierrez, is that he can be imprisoned in a cage with [[graphite]] bars charged with [[negative ions]]. He also expresses a great aversion to \"[[Sewer gas|poo gas]]\".\n\nPeripheral powers come and go: Freakazoid once developed [[telekinesis]] triggered by anger that was never mentioned again after the episode, and once crossed the globe to yell at a Tibetan monk for raking too loudly, but apologizes to him later in the same plot. He also has the ability to assume the form of [[electricity]] and cover long distances instantaneously, although he just as often simply sticks his arms forward and runs while making swooshing sounds with his mouth, pretending to fly.\n\nDexter can change into and out of Freakazoid at will with the words \"Freak out!\" and \"Freak in!\". When not in Freakazoid mode, Dexter looks and acts completely normal, and his family is unaware that anything has happened to him. Freakazoid spends this time in an area of Dexter's brain called the Freakazone, where he reflects, has profound thoughts, and watches reruns of ''[[The Rat Patrol]]''.\n\nWhile the show's setting is set around [[Washington, D.C.]], the locale often varies with the show's humor, taking Freakazoid to locations around the world as needed.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Freakazoid''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]])&nbsp;\u2013 The protagonist of the series. He was once [[geek]]y 16-year-old computer ace named '''Dexter Douglas''' (voiced by [[David Kaufman (actor)|David Kaufman]]) who became Freakazoid from an overloaded Pinnacle chip inside his computer. He attends [[Harry Connick, Jr.|Harry Connick]] High School. To transform into Freakazoid, Dexter says \"Freak out!\". To change back into Dexter, Freakazoid says \"Freak in!\". Dexter and Freakazoid sometimes identify as separate identities, and other times consider themselves to be the same person. Catchphrase:  \"Aw, nut bunnies!\" His image and \"Freak Out!\" superpower are parodies of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]].\n\n===The Douglas family===\n* '''Duncan Douglas''' (voiced by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340359/ Googy Gress])&nbsp;\u2013 Dexter's older brother. He is a bully towards Dexter, and is portrayed as a caricature of a high school jock.\n* '''Debbie Douglas''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&nbsp;\u2013 Dexter's mother. She has no clue that her son is Freakazoid, and is in general blithe and clueless. Her lines often involve morose subjects delivered in a cheery tone, a parody of a stereotypical domestic mother.\n* '''Douglas Douglas''' (voiced by [[John P. McCann]])&nbsp;\u2013 Dexter's father. An automobile dealer who thinks a goblin lives in the gas tank of his car. Occasionally used for laughs as a stereotypical technologically inept father figure.\n* '''Mr. Chubbikins''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&nbsp;\u2013 The Douglas' [[morbid obesity|morbidly obese]] cat that was formerly named Mr. Chubbskins. He jumped on Dexter's keyboard while chasing a butterfly, accidentally typing in the key sequence which activated the Pinnacle chip's flaw, turning Dexter into Freakazoid.\n\n===Allies===\n* '''Sgt. Mike Cosgrove''' (voiced by [[Edward Asner]])&nbsp;\u2013 A heavyset, gruff [[Police|cop]] with a heart of gold, who is friends with Freakazoid and several other characters. He speaks in a gruff [[Monotone (disambiguation)|monotone]] and shows very little enthusiasm for anything. By pointing at something and saying \"Cut it out\", he has the almost supernatural ability to get people to stop whatever they are doing on command, no matter what they may be doing at the time, be it panicking at the sight of a villain, stealing a television, or attempting to capture Cosgrove and Freakazoid (in the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' comic series, he even once managed to get [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]] to \"Cut it out\", something that many others had tried, and failed, to do). Cosgrove also possesses the odd power of finding Freakazoid no matter where he is by driving his police car to that particular location. He often interrupts Freakazoid's heroic endeavors to ask him to visit various entertainments, such as the \"Honey Harvest Festival\" or \"a bear riding a motorcycle\" which Freakazoid always enthusiastically agrees to, no matter what else he is doing at the time. During this visit, Cosgrove inevitably reveals important information about the plot of the episode, including the villain's location or evil deeds. Freakazoid then rushes off to foil the villain's scheme, leaving Cosgrove to enjoy the attraction for himself. Sgt. Cosgrove also resembles his voice actor.\n* '''Roddy MacStew''' (voiced by [[Craig Ferguson]])&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's mentor, and expositionist; an ill-tempered Scotsman who once worked for Guitierrez. He first found that the Pinnacle chip was flawed. In the continuation of \"The Chip\" (detailing how Freakazoid gained his powers) he was trapped in the Internet. He was later kicked out of the Internet by Guitierrez and resumed his mentor role. Favorite word: \"Crud!\"\n* '''Steff''' (voiced by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746617/ Tracy Rowe])&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's perky blonde girlfriend; her real name is Stephanie. She discovers Freakazoid's secret identity when Cosgrove accidentally points it out aloud in \"Mission: Freakazoid\".\n* '''Hans''' (voiced by [[Larry Cedar]])&nbsp;\u2013 A mysterious agent with a Western European accent, who takes Freakazoid to Professor Heiney's lab.\n* '''Professor Heiney''' (voiced by [[Ed Gilbert (actor)|Ed Gilbert]])&nbsp;\u2013 A scientist, with a lab in the mountains, who Freakazoid often goes to for help. He does research on monsters, zaps them and is often attacked by them at his lab.\n* '''Ingmar'''&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's mute butler, in charge of the maintenance of the Freakalair (according to Freakazoid, he constructed it himself from scratch). He quit in \"Mission: Freakazoid\" to become a [[rodeo clown]] and was replaced by Professor Jones. A [[Parody|take-off]] on Bernardo, the mute manservant of [[Zorro]] and [[Batman]]'s butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]].\n* '''Professor Jones''' (voiced by [[Jonathan Harris]])&nbsp;\u2013 A snooty, cowardly manservant, essentially recreating his role as Doctor Zachary Smith from ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (every time Jones appears in a scene, someone asks him if he was \"on a TV show with a robot\"). He is the replacement to the Freakalair's previous butler, and old friends with him. Does not get along with Cosgrove well and gets little respect from Freakazoid, or anyone else.\n* '''Joe Leahy''' (voiced by himself)&nbsp;\u2013 The show's very vocal announcer, who sometimes gets more involved than the job usually requires.\n* '''Freakazette'''&nbsp;\u2013 Only mentioned in the first episode for a brief verse during the \"Freakazoid and Friends\" theme song (which plays to the same theme as ''[[Animaniacs]]'').\n* '''Foamy the Freakadog''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&nbsp;\u2013 A vicious, rabid dog which Freakazoid had freed from the pound. Foamy is painted blue, has a Freakazoid costume (complete with hair), and is prone to maul and/or beat Freakazoid to a pulp, even on their missions.\n* '''Handman''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]])&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's brief \"right hand man\". He is quite literally just a painted face on Freakazoid's right hand who has great difficulty pronouncing Freakazoid's name correctly. Fell in love with and married '''Handgirl''', a painted face on Freakazoid's left hand.\n* '''Expendable Lad'''&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's brief sidekick from the start of \"And Fanboy Is His Name\". He was taken to the hospital due to injuries sustained from Milk Man's attack that gave him a bruised [[clavicle]]. Expendable Lad was subsequently released from the service of Freakazoid.\n* '''[[Norm Abram]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 He was kidnapped by the Lobe to make a wooden instrument to destroy Freakazoid, but got free and helped turn the tables against the Lobe and his villain allies. Abram supplied his own voice and trademark line for the episode.\n* '''[[Leonard Maltin]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 He was kidnapped by Dr. Mystico during the episode \"Island of Dr. Mystico\", while Maltin was giving his opinion of the same episode. Freakazoid points out that Mystico's prisoners all have superpowers, and Mr. Maltin's is that he knows every movie ever made. Maltin provided his own voice for the episode.\n* '''[[Henry Kissinger]]''' (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]])&nbsp;\u2013 A politician who was kidnapped by Dr. Mystico's \"orangu-men\". In the show, he speaks in a low, groggy, incomprehensible mumble. He is briefly mentioned in one episode after his only appearance.\n\n===Enemies===\n''Freakazoid!'' features a number of campy villains and enemies, including:\n\n* '''The Lobe''' (voiced by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]])&nbsp;\u2013 Freakazoid's archenemy. He is a supergenius whose entire head appears to be a giant brain. Despite his high intellect, he has very low self-esteem, once even having a scheme foiled by Freakazoid simply insulting the plan, despite actually being impressed by it. No background information of any kind is given for the Lobe; not even his real name is revealed.\n* '''Cobra Queen''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&nbsp;\u2013 Audrey Manatee is a former [[Shoplifting|shoplifter]] whose encounter with an experimental cosmetic left in the sun too long transformed her into a cobra woman, with command over [[snake]]s and other [[reptile]]s. In later episodes, Cave Guy and Cobra Queen are a couple. She has a lair in the sewers, and often complained about the lack of light until Freakazoid suggested getting [[Japanese lantern]]s. He defeated her when she faints while trying to say \"Silly Sally Sells Sappy Seashells in Seattle\" (he later wonders how that worked). Cobra Queen also shows up as part of the team in \"Mission: Freakazoid!\". She seems to be offended when compared to [[Sylvester the Cat]].\n* '''Cave Guy''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] impersonating [[Jim Backus]])&nbsp;\u2013 A thuggish blue [[caveman]] with upper-class diction, education, and taste who speaks in a stereotypical [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] tone (see [[Locust Valley lockjaw]]). His real name is Royce Mumphry and he subscribes to ''[[The New Yorker]]''. He also seems to have an odd fear of [[Klingons]] (possibly because of the made-up language they use).\n* '''Longhorn''' (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]])&nbsp;\u2013 Formerly Jubal \"Bull\" Nixon, he was once an employee of the ''Johnny Cat'' cat litter company until he turned to a life of crime. Because he was searched for by law enforcement so frequently, he had [[plastic surgery]] to turn himself into a humanoid [[Texas Longhorn]] (Freakazoid pointed out that this did not prevent him from showing up on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' every week). He loves [[country music]] and, despite being a lousy songwriter, is determined to get a recording contract in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He also owns a massive truck, nicknamed \"Bessie Mae\", which is outfitted with all kinds of devices.\n** '''Turk''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]])&nbsp;\u2013 Longhorn's sidekick.\n* '''Armando Guitierrez''' (voiced by [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]])&nbsp;\u2013 The eyepatch-wearing man whose company Apex Microchips (not to be confused with [[Apex Digital]]) designed the faulty Pinnacle chip responsible for Freakazoid's creation as well as Freakazoid's first enemy. Physically, Guitierrez resembles [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], who provides the character's voice as well. At times, he shows similarities to [[Khan Noonien Singh]] from ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''; also played by Montalban. One of his recurring jokes is demanding others to laugh with him. When he fell to his supposed doom, he asked Freakazoid to scream with him. Originally a normal human being, he briefly gains powers similar to Freakazoid's by exploiting the Pinnacle chip's flaw. By \"Hero Boy\", he appears as a cyborg in a hooded robe to cover his cybernetic side caused by Freakazoid knocking him into a cyber-pit. He hates being called a weenie, to which he will angrily respond \"I am not a weenie! It is YOU who are the weenie!\". In \"Normadeus\", Guitierrez is among the villains invited by the Lobe to witness the destruction of Freakazoid. The Lobe commented that he never got an opportunity to be in the same room as Guitierrez before.\n** '''Jocko''' \u2013 Armando Guitierrez' henchman.\n* '''Candle Jack''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 A supernatural villain with a burlap sack over his head, called \"the Boogeyman, the for-real one\" in the series. He [[Kidnapping|abducts]] anyone who says his name and ties them up with rope, apparently because \"he's a nut.\" Although he prides himself on being scary, he has a weakness for pie and also seems to enjoy watching ''[[F Troop]]''. During \"Island of Dr. Mystico\", Freakazoid and Cosgrove have him chase around and scare Professor Jones.\n* '''Waylon Jeepers''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 A creepy little man originally from Venice Beach, CA who created the [[Medusa]] Watch, which has the power to turn people (and pigeons) into stone. He has also created a similar device that turned [[beaver]]s into gold, and once summoned the demon Vorn the Unspeakable, with the help of a book entitled ''How to Summon Monsters the E-Z Way''. His schemes seem to deeply infuriate Freakazoid and Jeepers is the shown to be the only villain that Freakazoid genuinely does not like (whereas the rest of the villains appear to have a friendly relationship with Freakazoid off-battle), once going on a long (and unscripted) rant. His name is a play on the name of famous country guitarist [[Waylon Jennings]].\n* '''Invisibo''' (voiced by [[Corey Burton]] impersonating [[Vincent Price]])&nbsp;\u2013 Real name: Ahmon Kor-Unch. An invisible, smart-mouthed [[pharaoh]] who is only visible via the [[Anubis]] staff he carries. While he was sealed away inside a sarcophagus, Duncan pushing Dexter into his sarcophagus resulted in the sarcophagus' seal being broken, enabling Invisibo to be free to resume his crime spree. Freakazoid gave Invisibo his name because \"you're invisible and it's my show and we already had a [[title card]] made up and it makes me happy!\" Invisibo accepts the name, saying it has a \"somewhat sinister ring to it.\" Freakazoid defeated Invisibo by destroying his staff and locking him back into his sarcophagus which is taken away by the authorities. In \"Normadeus\", Invisibo regained his invisibility powers and is among the villains invited by the Lobe to witness the destruction of Freakazoid where the Lobe gave him a party hat to be visible.\n* '''The Nerdator''' (voiced by [[Aron Kincaid]])&nbsp;\u2013 A man who planned to kidnap all of the [[nerd]]s in the world (which also included [[Steven Spielberg]]) and absorb their knowledge to become a \"Super-Nerd\". His plan succeeded until Freakazoid convinced him of the downsides of being a nerd. The Nerdator discontinued his plot. He was last seen kidnapping \"good-looking, but vapid airheads\". His character design is a parody of the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]].\n* '''Vorn the Unspeakable''' (voiced by [[Richard Moll]])&nbsp;\u2013 A demon summoned by Waylon Jeepers, who bears a resemblance to [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu]].\n* '''Arms Akimbo''' (voiced by [[John Schuck]] impersonating [[Edward G. Robinson]])&nbsp;\u2013 A spoiled [[Model (person)|model]] turned [[extortion]]ist who, after years of posing, was left with his arms frozen in a jaunty pose, hands on hips. When fighting, he strikes with his oversized elbows. His first appearance is in a local shop selling \"oops insurance\", a form of [[protection racket]]eering which mainly consists of him breaking something of value (or causing a building to detonate spectacularly), before comically following it up with a small \"oops\".\n* '''Milk Man'''&nbsp;\u2013 Only shown/mentioned in the episode \"And Fanboy Is His Name\". Shown on a news report in a pitched battle with Freakazoid and his then-[[sidekick]], Expendable Lad. As the name implies, he uses milk as his theme.\n* '''Deadpan''' (voiced by [[Bebe Neuwirth]])&nbsp;\u2013 A plain-looking (almost blank-faced) female supervillain with a monotonous voice. She is a [[shapeshifter]] who once tried to conquer Washington by transforming into Freakazoid, but this plan was quickly foiled when the real Freakazoid appeared immediately after and nonchalantly pointed her out. She had only one appearance in the cold opening for \"The Wrath of Guitierrez\".\n* '''Mary Beth''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&nbsp;\u2013 Cosgrove's former girlfriend, a cosmetics executive, and a monster. She is short-tempered and when angered, turns green, develops a deep raspy voice, and often lights candles by shooting flame from her nose. Her plan to steal Freakazoid's hero essence to remain immortal is foiled and, as a result, she shrivels, dies, and becomes a pile of dust. Her name is a play off of the cosmetics giant [[Mary Kay]].\n* '''Janos Ivnovels''' (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]])&nbsp;\u2013 The ruthless dictator of Vuka Nova and Minister of State Security. He is responsible for capturing Freakazoid's family (and a mime) and imprisoning them in the High-Security Wing of Chesky Beresch Prison, the toughest prison in Europe. He and his subordinate Colonel Anton Mohans were defeated after Freakazoid and his friends rescued the Douglas family (and the mime). Janos and Anton were last seen being tortured by the mime and his pals. He is a one-time villain, having appeared in \"Mission: Freakazoid\".\n** '''Colonel Anton Mohans''' (voiced by [[Larry Cedar]])&nbsp;\u2013 A vicious thug who finds it relaxing when Janos tortures his prisoners.\n* '''Dr. Mystico''' (voiced by [[Tim Curry]])&nbsp;\u2013 A mad scientist who turns orangutans into human-like beings (and vice versa) in \"Island of Dr. Mystico\", a parody of H. G. Wells's ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau]]''. He seeks to take over the world, though he always seems to say Cleveland instead. He has a white cat, similar to [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]. His first name may actually be Wendell, since he once says, ''\"They called me mad, insane, Wendell!\"''. He also bears a striking resemblance to his voice actor Tim Curry.\n* '''Kid Carrion''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 A zombie cowboy who was never named, and only appeared in \"Relax-o-Vision\" and \"The Lobe\". He can be seen in the opening credits standing next to Candle Jack. He bears a passing resemblance to the revamped version of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] from [[Bruce Timm]]'s ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', yet seems to be a parody of the villain Tex Hex from the 1987 [[Filmation]] cartoon series ''[[Bravestarr]]''.\n* '''Eye-of-Newt'''&nbsp;\u2013 A strange one-eyed creature with a hairstyle resembling [[Newt Gingrich]]'s; his name is a reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' (\"Eye of newt and toe of frog...\"). He has no dialogue and is a background villain, although it seems that he is frequently recaptured by heroes like Freakazoid or the Huntsman.\n\n===Other characters===<!-- This section is linked from [[Fanboy]] -->\nA few characters fall somewhere in the space between \"enemies\" and \"allies\" to land squarely in the category of \"nuisances\".\n\n* '''Mo-Ron/Bo-Ron''' (voiced by [[Stan Freberg]]) \u2013 An obese and dimwitted [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from the [[planet]] Barone's. His name was later changed to ''Bo-Ron'', to appease network censors' concerns that use of the word [[Moron (psychology)|moron]] might be offensive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In one episode Lord Bravery refers to him as \"Mo-Ron or... Bo-Ron, whatever.\" He is a parody of Ro-Man, the ridiculous-looking monster from the notoriously bad science fiction film ''[[Robot Monster]]''. His first appearance was when he tried to deliver Earth an \u201dimportant message\u201d, only to forget what it was. This message turned out to be a comet heading towards Earth which caused everybody to flee the area. He also appeared in an episode that was a parody of ''[[E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]''.\n* '''Fanboy''' (voiced by [[Stephen Furst]])&nbsp;\u2013 An obese, acne-stricken, socially awkward [[Fan (aficionado)#Fanboy|fanboy]] (hence his name) and would-be sidekick to Freakazoid who obsesses about numerous comic books, TV shows, and movies from ''[[The Black Hole]]'' to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]''. Fanboy's age is never specified. He could be anywhere between his late teens to early 30s. He bumped into [[George Takei]] at a comic book shop and gave chase, causing Takei to run into traffic and nearly getting hit by three cars.\n* '''[[Bill Clinton]]''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) and '''[[Hillary Clinton]]''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) make frequent cameos in the show, partly because Dexter Douglas lives in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n* '''[[Barbra Streisand]]''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) also makes a number of appearances, most notably in the episode \"Dexter's Date\", which features a parody of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]''.\n* '''Hero Boy''' (voiced by [[John P. McCann]]) \u2013 The title character from Freakazoid's favorite TV show that is first shown in the episode of the same name. Hero Boy has no powers (save for flying) and his black and white show is a parody of the [[animated series]] ''[[Astro Boy (1960s)|Astro Boy]]''. Hero Boy has the catchphrase \"I must succeed!\", though he is invariably shrugged off by the monsters he fights, including the giant ones, when his pathetic fighting techniques (consisting of weakly pounding on his enemies) fail miserably.\n* '''[[Steven Spielberg]]''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 The show's executive producer. His most notable appearance was in part of an episode where Freakazoid, the Brain from ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', and Wakko Warner from ''[[Animaniacs]]'' get into a disagreement over which of their shows he likes best (only for Spielberg to ask, \"Who are you people?\"). In \"The Nerdator\", Steven Spielberg is among the nerds that are captured by the Nerdator. During this time, he was directing a sequel to ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' called ''E.T. Returns''.\n* '''[[Paul Harvey]]''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]) \u2013 A loud, obnoxious man who often interrupts the story to give background information on a villain (as seen in episodes featuring Cobra Queen and Longhorn), or to describe, rather than show, the ending of an episode (demonstrated in \"Candle Jack\"). He is a parody of the radio personality of the same name, and even borrows the catchphrase \"the rest of the story\" from the real Harvey.\n* '''Lonnie Tallbutt''' (voiced by [[Mitch Schauer]] in human form, [[Jim Cummings]] in werewolf form) \u2013 A [[werewolf]] that begs Dexter for help. His name is a combination of that of [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] and Lawrence Talbot, the character Chaney played in the 1941 movie ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''. He is prone to grabbing people's shirt collars and yelling \"You don't understand!\"\n\n[[File:Emmitt-Nervend.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The elusive Emmitt Nervend, who is often only seen briefly between frames of animation on the show]]\n* '''Emmitt Nervend''' \u2013 A short, hunchbacked man with straw-like hair and a frozen grimace who usually shows up at least once an episode, always in the opening credits, but usually in the background. He stands looking at the camera (as pictured), never saying a word. Sometimes things happen to him directly, like him standing outside a restaurant collecting donations while dressed as Santa Claus and ringing a bell, birds pecking his head, or laser beams shooting just above his head. The [[end credits]] will often contain a credit revealing how many times Emmitt can be found in a particular episode. His appearance was drawn by [[Mitch Schauer]].\n* '''Weena Mercator as The Hopping Woman''' \u2013 A person acknowledged whenever credits are used in an episode. However, no episode or sketch has ever featured a hopping woman. Her name also appears with multiple spellings: \"Mercator\" in \"Dance of Doom\" and \"Mercatur\" in \"The Cloud\".\n* ''[[Yakko Warner]]'' \u2013 The oldest brother of the [[Animaniacs]]. Yakko is played by [[Rob Paulsen]].\n* ''[[Wakko Warner]] \u2013 The younger brother of the Animaniacs. Wakko is played by [[Jess Harnell]].\n* ''[[Dot Warner]] \u2013 The youngest sister of the Animaniacs. Dot is played by Tress MacNeille.\n* ''[[Pinky and the Brain|The Brain]] \u2013 A genius from Pinky and the Brain. The Brain is played by Maurice LaMarche.\n\n===Mini-segments===\n''Freakazoid!'' also features several mini-segments, primarily during the first season. Each of these have their own theme songs, title cards and cast, and only rarely \"cross over\" into the continuity of the main show. These segments include:\n\n* '''Lord Bravery'''&nbsp;\u2013 Nigel Skunkthorpe (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] impersonating [[John Cleese]]) is a superhero from the United Kingdom in an outfit slightly resembling that of a [[Rome|Roman]] soldier. He does not do much in the way of superheroism; in fact, he is very snooty, cynical and unwilling to do unpleasant tasks in the course of his duties such as entering a sewer to perform a rescue. Likewise, he gets little respect and recognition as a superhero from the general public and even from his wife and mother-in-law, with whom he lives, and is generally the laughing stock of the superheroes. At one point, he loses his name due to a trademark dispute with a bakery of the same name, after which he changes his name to ''Lord Smoked Meats and Fishes''. He has been mistaken for a party clown. His theme song is delivered in the style of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s song \"A British Tar\".\n* '''The Huntsman'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Huntsman (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a good guess at what [[Robin Hood]] would be like if portrayed by [[Charlton Heston]]. He can never find enough crime to fight and secretly suspects that the police are hiding crimes from him because they do not trust him (it is also possible that he was so good at being a superhero that his villains simply gave up). He was once a hunter called Marty Feeb who saved a chunky [[elf]] from being eaten by a [[crow]]. The elf rewarded Marty Feeb with a magic sack of corn. Upon eating it, he was granted strength, speed, and shining teeth, and became the Huntsman. He also has a brother called Hector Feeb, who he claims lives in a [[townhouse]]. Huntsman can be summoned by a policeman blowing into the Horn of Urgency on top of the local police station, and his battle cry is \"Into action!\". When he appears before Lt. Artie King (voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]), the Huntsman is told in those two episodes that either a rookie mistakenly blew the horn or the blowing of the horn was a false alarm. Possibly a parody of the comic book character the [[Green Arrow]]. His trademark phrase is \"Darn, the luck, darn!\" His sketches are often themed around beginning with a lengthy, overly heroic opener, with a title that would indicate an action-oriented episode, that ends up being a short anticlimactic skit of the Huntsman not being needed. In one of his episodes, it was mentioned that he had fought the Lobe and Cave Guy, and he is shown fighting Cave Guy and Candle Jack in his opening. Huntsman was once seen as the umpire during the ''Superheroes/Villain All-Star Benefit Softball Game''. When Freakazoid, Arms Akimbo, and Cave Guy both asked his opinion on a play, he responded that he had looked away to have some berry water and did not see if the play was an out or a safe.\n* '''The Lawn Gnomes'''&nbsp;\u2013 Baffeardin (voiced by [[Clive Revill]]), Huska (voiced by [[Carl Ballantine]]), Honna (voiced by [[Rose Marie]]), and Quist (voiced by [[Larry Gelman]]) are a group of gnomes-turned-lawn gnomes that come to life at night in a parody of the ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' animated series. Infamous for their mischief back in AD 995, they were advised by the Great Mystic Gnome (voiced by [[Roscoe Lee Browne]]) to change their ways before it gets worse for them. After planning to do so in a week, the four gnomes were cursed to become stone by day by the powerful wizard Rathgar (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) after they played a prank on him and previously attacked his younger Viking brother Erik the Large (also voiced by Maurice LaMarche). They would revert at night during which time they were given the opportunity to mend their ways to fight evil alongside mankind, after which the curse would be lifted. During this one-time sketch, Freakazoid did his commentary on it.\n* '''Toby Danger'''&nbsp;\u2013 A (somewhat) loving parody of ''[[Jonny Quest]]'', featuring the voices of [[Scott Menville]], [[Don Messick]] (in his last role before he died), and [[Granville Van Dusen]] (all of whom provided voices for ''JQ''), that was originally written by [[Tom Minton]] as a 12-minute stand-alone short for ''[[Animaniacs]]'', but slotted into ''Freakazoid!'' after that series was greenlighted and had an eight-minute opening. The completed 12-minute ''Toby Danger'' storyboard was trimmed by director Eric Radomski to fit into the available ''Freakazoid!'' time slot.\n* '''Fatman and Boy Blubber'''&nbsp;\u2013 The misadventures of two morbidly obese superheroes (voiced by Marc Drotman and [[Paul Rugg]], respectively), in a parody of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series. Their only segment involves them coming to the aid of Louis, an overweight boy who loves sweet buns and is being tormented by bullies. After attempting to capture the bullies, and failing due to their extreme lack of physical fitness, Fatman and Boy Blubber deliver a pseudo-inspirational speech to Louis about their own struggles with being overweight, and how they often end up eating fast food and snacks instead of having sensible meals. When Louis asks what the point of the speech is, Fatman changes the subject to ask if Louis has any more sweet buns in his lunchbox; the hero then tries to confiscate the food (it is unclear whether he is attempting to prevent Louis from gaining more weight, or simply wants the sweet bun for himself), and begins beating Louis up with Boy Blubber when the boy refuses to give it to them. Fatman also makes an appearance during \"Hero Boy\" where it is revealed the episode is also a storybook being read by Fatman to some children.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Voicing===\nThe voice actors of the show ''Freakazoid!'' included various actors from other television series and films. [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], [[Jeff Bennett]], and [[Frank Welker]], who all provided voices in the series ''[[Animaniacs]]'', were on ''Freakazoid!''.  Actors [[Ed Asner]], [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], [[Larry Cedar]], [[Jonathan Harris]], and [[Stephen Furst]] also provided voices for the series. Also, writers [[John P. McCann]] and [[Paul Rugg]] (who played Freakazoid) added voices themselves.\n\nCasting for the show had been difficult for the ''Freakazoid!'' staff, as no lead character had been found even after extensive auditions.<ref name=\"Rugg\">{{Cite news| last =Rogers| first =Brett| year =1996| title =Freaking Out With Paul Rugg| periodical =Animato!| issue =36| url =http://members.aol.com/baltohoya/rugg.htm| accessdate =2007-06-29| url-status =bot: unknown| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071104024703/http://members.aol.com/baltohoya/rugg.htm| archivedate =2007-11-04}}</ref> Eventually, when writer [[Paul Rugg]] was brought to demonstrate the voice in a recording session, he ended up filling the role, as he said: \"I went in there and did it. Then they played it for [[Steven Spielberg]] and he said 'Yep! Fine, sure, great,' and then I panicked ... and I had to do it.\"<ref name = \"Rugg\"/>  Rugg played the role of Freakazoid through the entire series run.\n\n===Music===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\n<!--Adding a music section to this page would make the article more informative.  Music was an integral part of this series.  I suggest the following:-->\n\nThe music for ''Freakazoid!'' was written by [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077148/?ref_=nv_sr_2 Steve Bernstein], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077081/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Julie Bernstein], [[Gordon Goodwin]] and Tim Kelly.  Stone won a Daytime Emmy with lyricist (and senior producer) [[Tom Ruegger]] for the main title song in 1996.  Julie Bernstein was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Original Song in 1998 for the song \"Invisibo\" from the episode ''Freak-a-Panel''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Controversy with Mike Allred's ''Madman''==\nCartoonist [[Mike Allred]] has criticized the show and its lead character as [[plagiarism]] of his [[comic book]] ''[[Madman (Image Comics)|Madman]]'',<ref name=\"madman\"/> asserting that the title characters share several personality traits, and wear similar costumes featuring a chest emblem including an exclamation mark. During the short run of the show, Allred remained relatively silent on the subject, but in 2003, he responded to a question about the show on the message board of his official website:\n\n{{quote|text=[Show creator] [[Bruce Timm]] was kind enough to tell me that ''Madman'' was a direct inspiration for the show, with comics open and referred to when developing the show.\n\nStupidly, I was flattered; happy to inspire anything. But when the show came out, with no acknowledgement or credit or any kind of compensation, I slowly became annoyed as everyone and their uncle confronted me with \"there's this cartoon that's ripping off ''Madman''\" and \"you oughta sue\".\n\nI simply wrote a friendly letter to [show producer] [[Steven Spielberg]] telling him his production was a direct lift of my creation, I had no intention of creating ripples, I just wanted him to know that I knew. No one replied, which is fine. And to be honest, ''Madman'' is an amalgam of a half a dozen other influences. So who am I to complain (the exclamation mark on the chest still kinda urks ''[sic]'' me a little though. A little too close for comfort).<ref name=\"madman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicscommunity.com/boards/allred/?noframes;read=9834 |title=Re: Freakazoid |first=Mike |last=Allred |work=Mike Allred Message Board |date=2003-11-07 |accessdate=2007-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728122015/http://www.comicscommunity.com/boards/allred/?noframes%3Bread=9834 |archivedate=July 28, 2006 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Humor==\nThe humor in ''Freakazoid!'' relied heavily on [[slapstick]], [[parody]] and pop cultural references. Due to the series being [[metafiction]], much of the series was self-aware humor (i.e. [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]]); for instance, after the first appearance of the Freakmobile, the show goes immediately into an impromptu commercial for a toy version, and later in the episode, Freakazoid addresses an audience, congratulating the staff on how hard they have worked to make the show [[toyetic]]. A typically strange running gag involves a repeated credit for \"Weena Mercator as the Hopping Woman\", though no such character appears in any episode. Her credit is usually preceded by a number of other fictional names and followed by a fictional director. The show also incorporated humor aimed at the then-newly founded [[The WB|WB Network]], such as questioning the meaning of the initials \"WB\", e.g., \"Weird Butt\" or \"Wet Bananas\" instead of Warner Bros.\n\n''Freakazoid!'' made frequent use of [[stock footage]], including the peaceful scene of a field of flowers (\"Relax-O-Vision\"), numerous people screaming (\"Scream-O-Vision\"), traditionally dressed [[Bavaria]]ns dancing and slapping each other, a [[Frank \"Cannonball\" Richards|man being shot in the belly with a cannonball]] and a man wrestling a bear.\n\n[[Cameo appearance]]s were also a major element of the show's humor. At various times, ''Freakazoid!'' hosted appearances by characters from other [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] such as ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and even an insinuation appearance of the ''[[Batman]]'' from Bruce Timm's [[Batman: The Animated Series|animated version]], which has a similar drawing style (its concept of old movie-style title cards at the beginning of each episode was also replicated in ''Freakazoid!''). Portrayals of many celebrities (including producer [[Steven Spielberg]]) and guest appearances by such figures as [[Jack Valenti]], [[Leonard Maltin]] and [[Mark Hamill]] as themselves were also commonplace. [[Norm Abram]] had an entire episode, \"Normadeus\", built around him. One original character, a bizarre-looking man named Emmitt Nervend, plays no role whatsoever other than enabling a ''[[Where's Waldo? (video game)|Where's Waldo]]''-esque hunt for his constant cameos (complete with the number of his appearances announced in the closing credits).\n\nOne of the show's longest cameo appearances was when [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot#Wakko Warner|Wakko]] (from ''[[Animaniacs]]'') and the [[List of Animaniacs characters#Pinky and the Brain|Brain]] (from ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'') appeared in a scene in which they argue with Freakazoid over which of their shows is [[Steven Spielberg]]'s favorite, with Freakazoid arguing that his show was the favorite because \"we got a memo\" (''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' was not represented in the discussion as it was on [[Nickelodeon]] at the time, while the others were on [[Kids' WB]]). However, when the trio confronts Steven over the issue, he simply replies: \"Who are you people?\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation===\n{{quote box|quote=I mean, it probably would not have worked as a straight super-hero show.

Timm came up with the name for the character naturally, as he recalled, \"The name 'Freakazoid' just kind of jumped out of me, I don't even know where from. I said 'Oh, yeah, 'Freakazoid', that might be an interesting name.'\"<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\nTimm originally created ''Freakazoid!'' to be a serious \"adventure show\" with some comedic undertones.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>  However, his initial idea for the series did not come to be, as he stated:\n\n{{quote|text=I don't mind that it's not on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. [Laughs] I bailed on it really early. It started out as an adventure show, but it ended up turning into more and more of a comedy show; every time we'd have a meeting with Steven, the concept would kinda [sic] change, and it kept leaning more and more towards zany comedy. It really started out almost like [[Spider-Man]], on that level of, like, a teenage superhero. And it reached a point where it became a comedy with the ''Tiny Toon Adventures''/''[[Animaniacs]]'' kind of humor. (...) I don't have anything against that; I just don't have a flair for it, so I bailed\u2014I just hung out here while my staff had to do the show. [Laughs]<ref name=Timm/>}}\n\nAfter Timm left the series, [[Tom Ruegger]], who developed the other Spielberg series ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' and ''Animaniacs'', was brought in to re-develop the series Timm had created \"from the ground up\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Ruegger's version of the series used some of Timm's designs and concepts, but Timm said that the series was \"radically altered\" to become the comedy series that was more to Spielberg's liking.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\nRuegger then began writing stories for the series, and came up with a pile of very short segments. Spielberg liked what Ruegger had written, but wanted longer stories for the series as well.  Ruegger then asked writers [[John P. McCann|John McCann]] and [[Paul Rugg]] to come onto the series to write longer, more elaborate stories for the series and, according to Rugg, \"(...) figure out what this [''Freakazoid!''] was going to be, and the answer was like, 'We didn't know', and still don't\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\n===Premiere, cancellation, and syndication===\n{{Main|List of Freakazoid! episodes}}\n''Freakazoid!'' premiered on [[Kids' WB]]'s Saturday lineup on September 9, 1995.<ref name=\"comedy\"/>  During its run, ''Freakazoid'' came across problems of appealing to its target demographic, young children.  [[Tom Ruegger]] said that ''Freakazoid!'' had done poorly in ratings because the audience that the series gathered was older than the target audience.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>  Also, ''Freakazoid'' ran into timeslot problems. Writer [[John P. McCann|John McCann]] said that the time slot of the series changed frequently: \"They put it at eight o' clock in the morning, 3:30 in the afternoon, they shifted it all around; we couldn't even find it, and we wrote the thing\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>  The series ran on [[Kids' WB]] until February 14, 1997, when it was canceled due to poor ratings, airing only one complete season and part of a second season.<ref name=\"comedy\"/>  Rugg said the series' demise was the result of a combination of people not understanding the series, time slot changes, appealing to the wrong demographics, and that \"(...) there aren't a lot of [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen boxes]] in federal prisons. Had there been, I'm telling you, we'd still be on the air today\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>  \nHowever, the show was later picked up by [[Cartoon Network]] and was rebroadcast from April 5, 1997 until March 29, 2003.<ref name=\"comedy\"/> The series had a total number of 24 episodes.  In 2006, ''Freakazoid!'' was one of the shows scheduled to be broadcast on the AOL broadband channel, [[In2TV]].<ref name=\"in2tv\">{{cite web |url= http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1220659,00.html |title= AOL to Launch New Video Portal |work= Time Warner Newsroom |publisher= Time Warner |date= 2006-07-31 |accessdate= 2007-06-29 |url-status= bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070802060125/http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1220659,00.html |archivedate= 2007-08-02 }}</ref>In Italy, ''Freakazoid!'' along with ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', ''Animaniacs'' and ''Pinky and the Brain'', was shown on [[RAI]] and later [[Mediaset]].

CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. \"They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'\" he said. \"In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.

When adjustment was made for transient events the data showed a slight warming, and research suggested that the discrepancy between surface and satellite data was largely accounted for by problems such as instrument differences between satellites.<ref>Parson, Edward A., and Dessler, Andrew E.

The Kyoto Protocol was the result of an international convention held in Kyoto, Japan, during which several industrialized nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Singer's declaration read: \"Energy is essential for economic growth ... We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the Kyoto Protocol\u2014to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only a part of the world community\u2014is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.\"<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" />\n\nScheuering writes that Singer circulated this in the United States and Europe and gathered 100 signatories, though she says some of the signatories' credentials were questioned. At least 20 were television weather reporters, some did not have science degrees, and 14 were listed as professors without specifying a field.

''Intelligent Life in the Universe'', San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1966.</ref> that the orbit of the [[Mars|Martian]] moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] suggests that it is hollow, which implies it is of artificial origin. Singer wrote: \"My conclusion there is, and here I back Shklovsky, that if the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them.\"<ref>S. F. Singer, \"More on the Moons of Mars\", ''Astronautics'', February 1960, American Astronautical Society, page 16.</ref> Later measurements confirmed Singer's ''big \"if\"'' caveat: Shklovsky overestimated Phobos' rate of altitude loss due to bad early data.<ref>E.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.
