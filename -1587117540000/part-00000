On 1 November they proclaimed the short-lived [[Banat Republic]]. In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and Timi\u0219oara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918\u20131919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] awarded Timi\u0219oara the status of a University Centre, and the [[interwar]] years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-revisionist]] demonstrations also took place during this time.\n\nDuring World War II, Timi\u0219oara suffered damage from both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success.\n\nAfter the war, the [[People's Republic of Romania]] was proclaimed, and Timi\u0219oara underwent Sovietization and later, [[Systematization]]. The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timi\u0219oara became highly industrialised both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture.<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/industria-timisoarei-inflorirea-imperiul-austro-ungar-intreprinderile-comuniste-smecheriile-democratia-originala-1_535f5d910d133766a830736b/index.html Industria Timi\u015foarei] {{in lang|ro}}</ref><ref>[https://www.banatulazi.ro/fabricile-celebre-ale-timisoarei-din-comunism-facute-una-cu-pamantul-in-capitalism/ Fabricile celebre ale Timi\u0219oarei din comunism] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, Timi\u0219oara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the [[Romanian Revolution|Romanian Anti-Communist Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KP7BQ3oXXgC|title=Uncivil Society: 1989 and the Implosion of the Communist Establishment|last=Kotkin|first=Stephen|publisher=Modern Library|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8129-6679-4|location=|pages=84\u201387}}</ref> On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timi\u0219oara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 20 decembrie 1989: Timi\u0219oara, primul ora\u015f liber de comunism|url = http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Regional/Digi24+Timisoara/Stiri/20+decembrie+1989+Timisoara+primul+oras+liber|website = www.digi24.ro|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Bega Canal 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bega Canal]]]]\nTimi\u0219oara lies at an altitude of {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} on the southeast edge of the [[Banat]] plain, part of the [[Pannonian Plain]] near the divergence of the [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]] and [[Bega (Tisza)|Bega]] rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timi\u0219oara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city. With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the river [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]], but on the [[Bega Canal]]. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only {{convert|0.5|to(-)|5|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings. The rich black soil and relatively high water table make this a fertile agricultural region.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Romania}}\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

The dominating temperate air masses during spring and summer are of oceanic origin and come with great precipitations. Frequently, even during winter period, the Atlantic humid air masses bring rainy and snowy weather, rarely cold weather.\n\nFrom September until February, frequent continental polar air masses coming from the East invade the area. In spite of all that, the Banat climate is also influenced by the presence of cyclones and warm air masses which come from the Mediterranean. Their characteristic feature is that of complete snow thaw during the winter period and stifling heat during the summer period.\n\nFreak measurable snowfalls have occurred as early as late October and as late as early April, but snow in those months is rare, and significant falls do not usually occur until first of November.

On 1 November they proclaimed the short-lived [[Banat Republic]]. In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and Timi\u0219oara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918\u20131919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] awarded Timi\u0219oara the status of a University Centre, and the [[interwar]] years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-revisionist]] demonstrations also took place during this time.\n\nDuring World War II, Timi\u0219oara suffered damage from both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success.\n\nAfter the war, the [[People's Republic of Romania]] was proclaimed, and Timi\u0219oara underwent Sovietization and later, [[Systematization]]. The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timi\u0219oara became highly industrialised both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture.<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/industria-timisoarei-inflorirea-imperiul-austro-ungar-intreprinderile-comuniste-smecheriile-democratia-originala-1_535f5d910d133766a830736b/index.html Industria Timi\u015foarei] {{in lang|ro}}</ref><ref>[https://www.banatulazi.ro/fabricile-celebre-ale-timisoarei-din-comunism-facute-una-cu-pamantul-in-capitalism/ Fabricile celebre ale Timi\u0219oarei din comunism] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, Timi\u0219oara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the [[Romanian Revolution|Romanian Anti-Communist Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KP7BQ3oXXgC|title=Uncivil Society: 1989 and the Implosion of the Communist Establishment|last=Kotkin|first=Stephen|publisher=Modern Library|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8129-6679-4|location=|pages=84\u201387}}</ref> On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timi\u0219oara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 20 decembrie 1989: Timi\u0219oara, primul ora\u015f liber de comunism|url = http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Regional/Digi24+Timisoara/Stiri/20+decembrie+1989+Timisoara+primul+oras+liber|website = www.digi24.ro|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Bega Canal 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bega Canal]]]]\nTimi\u0219oara lies at an altitude of {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} on the southeast edge of the [[Banat]] plain, part of the [[Pannonian Plain]] near the divergence of the [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]] and [[Bega (Tisza)|Bega]] rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timi\u0219oara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city. With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the river [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]], but on the [[Bega Canal]]. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only {{convert|0.5|to(-)|5|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings.

The dominating temperate air masses during spring and summer are of oceanic origin and come with great precipitations. Frequently, even during winter period, the Atlantic humid air masses bring rainy and snowy weather, rarely cold weather.\n\nFrom September until February, frequent continental polar air masses coming from the East invade the area. In spite of all that, the Banat climate is also influenced by the presence of cyclones and warm air masses which come from the Mediterranean. Their characteristic feature is that of complete snow thaw during the winter period and stifling heat during the summer period.\n\nFreak measurable snowfalls have occurred as early as late October and as late as early April, but snow in those months is rare, and significant falls do not usually occur until first of November. The median date for the first freeze is 22 October, while that of the last freeze is 15 April. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data, [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]\n|1787 | 9479\n|1847 | 18103\n|1869 | 32725\n|1880 | 33694\n|1890 | 39884\n|1900 | 53033\n|1910 | 72555\n|1920 | 82689\n|1930 | 91580\n|1941 | 110840\n|1948 | 111987\n|1956 | 142257\n|1966 | 174243\n|1977 | 269353\n|1992 | 334115\n|2002 | 317660\n|2011 | 319279\n|2016 | 332983\n}}\n\n[[File:Festivalul Florilor TimFloralis.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The historic centre of Timi\u0219oara, with the [[Timi\u0219oara Orthodox Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]]]]\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Timi\u0219oara has a population of 319,279.<ref name=\"INSSER\"/> As defined by INS, the Timi\u0219oara [[functional urban area]] has a population of 468,162.<ref name=\"world_bank\">{{cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448771499322731333/pdf/116400-ROMANIAN-REVISED-PUBLIC-Magnet-Cities-Migration-and-Commuting-in-Romania-RO.|title=Error}}</ref>\n\nOf this population, 86.79% were ethnic [[Romanians]], while 5.12% were [[Hungarians]], 1.37% [[Ethnic German|Germans]], 1.3% [[Serbs]], 0.69% [[Romani people|Romani]], 0.18% [[Ukrainians]], 0.17% [[Slovaks]], 0.11% [[Jews]] and 0.76% others.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1832&judet_id=2057&localitate_id=2058 | title = Ethno-demographic Structure of Romania | accessdate = 15 April 2011 | publisher = The Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center }}</ref> 14.2% of the population are under 15 years of age, 4.0% are over 75.\n\nSince 1990, Timi\u0219oara saw a slight population decline owing to [[Human migration|migration]] and a drop in birthrates.

The trip had been organized by [[Ahmed Chalabi]], whom Hedges considered to be unreliable.

The Hebrew words Almuggim or Algummim are translated Almug or Algum trees in our version of the Bible (see 1 Kings x. 11, 12; 2 Chron. ii. 8, and ix. 10, 11). The wood of the tree was very precious, and was brought from Ophir (probably some part of India), along with gold and precious stones, by Hiram, and was used in the formation of pillars for the temple at Jerusalem, and for the king's house; also for the inlaying of stairs, as well as for harps and psalteries. It is probably the red sandal-wood of India (Pterocarpus santalinus). This tree belongs to the natural order Leguminos\u00e6, sub-order Papilionace\u00e6. The wood is hard, heavy, close-grained, and of a fine red colour. It is different from the white fragrant sandal-wood, which is the produce of Santalum album, a tree belonging to a distinct natural order.Also see notes by George Menachery in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Vol. 2 (1973) One must also note the National Tree of the Philippines is the Narra which is a red sandalwood as well.

[[Vasco da Gama]]'s companion [[Thom\u00e9 Lopes|Tom\u00e9 Lopes]] reasoned that Ophir would have been the ancient name for [[Great Zimbabwe]] in [[Zimbabwe]], the main center of sub-African trade in gold in the Renaissance period \u2014 though the ruins at Great Zimbabwe are now dated to the medieval era, long after Solomon is said to have lived. The identification of Ophir with [[Sofala]] in Mozambique was mentioned by [[John Milton|Milton]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (11:399-401), among many other works of literature and science.\n\nAnother, more serious, possibility is the African shore of the [[Red Sea]], with the name perhaps being derived from the [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]] people living in the [[Danakil desert]] ([[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]]) between [[Adulis]] and [[Djibouti]].\n\n[[Afri]] was a Latin name used to refer to the [[Punics|Carthaginians]], who dwelt in [[North Africa]], in modern-day [[Tunisia]]. This name, that later gave the rich [[Roman province of Africa]] and the subsequent medieval [[Ifriqiya]], are from which the name of the continent [[Africa]] is ultimately derived, seems to have referred to a native [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribe originally, however, see [[Terence#Biography|Terence]] for discussion.

The Hebrew words Almuggim or Algummim are translated Almug or Algum trees in our version of the Bible (see 1 Kings x. 11, 12; 2 Chron. ii. 8, and ix. 10, 11). The wood of the tree was very precious, and was brought from Ophir (probably some part of India), along with gold and precious stones, by Hiram, and was used in the formation of pillars for the temple at Jerusalem, and for the king's house; also for the inlaying of stairs, as well as for harps and psalteries. It is probably the red sandal-wood of India (Pterocarpus santalinus). This tree belongs to the natural order Leguminos\u00e6, sub-order Papilionace\u00e6. The wood is hard, heavy, close-grained, and of a fine red colour. It is different from the white fragrant sandal-wood, which is the produce of Santalum album, a tree belonging to a distinct natural order.Also see notes by George Menachery in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Vol. 2 (1973) One must also note the National Tree of the Philippines is the Narra which is a red sandalwood as well.

The identification of Ophir with [[Sofala]] in Mozambique was mentioned by [[John Milton|Milton]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (11:399-401), among many other works of literature and science.\n\nAnother, more serious, possibility is the African shore of the [[Red Sea]], with the name perhaps being derived from the [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]] people living in the [[Danakil desert]] ([[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]]) between [[Adulis]] and [[Djibouti]].\n\n[[Afri]] was a Latin name used to refer to the [[Punics|Carthaginians]], who dwelt in [[North Africa]], in modern-day [[Tunisia]]. This name, that later gave the rich [[Roman province of Africa]] and the subsequent medieval [[Ifriqiya]], are from which the name of the continent [[Africa]] is ultimately derived, seems to have referred to a native [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribe originally, however, see [[Terence#Biography|Terence]] for discussion.
