Folding the rear seats down gives a large floor area for the carriage of luggage or goods. Stronger suspension springs are fitted at the rear to support the extra load. Hatchback: The hatchback is generally based on a saloon body but with the boot or trunk area blended into the centre section of the body. The hatchback is therefore halfway between a saloon and estate car. This type of body is very popular due to its versatility and style. Although some hatchbacks are in fact saloon bodies with the boot or trunk effectively removed (usually the smaller cars), many hatchbacks retain the full length of the saloon but the roofline extends down to the rear of the vehicle. As with the saloon bodies, a hatchback can have two or four passenger doors, however there is a tendency to refer to hatchbacks as three or five doors because the rear compartment lid (or tailgate) is also referred to as a door on the hatchback bodies. As with the estate, the rear seats fold down to give a flat floor for the transportation of luggage or other objects. When the tailgate is closed, the luggage compartment is usually covered with a parcel shelf. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DoYaRsNFlEYC&pg=PA11&dq=%22station+wagon%22+vs.+%22hatchback%22 |accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>\n* the tailgate is more likely to be a multi-part design or extend all the way down to the [[Bumper (car)|bumper]]\n\n===Liftback===\n[[File:1986 Toyota Celica (ST162) SX liftback (2016-01-04) 02.jpg|thumb|1986 [[Toyota Celica]] with liftback]]\n\nLiftback is a term for hatchback models in which the rear cargo door or hatch is more horizontally angled than on an average hatchback, and as a result, the hatch is lifted more upwards than backwards, to open.<ref name=\"Vehicle Dynamics\">{{cite book |first=Reza N. |last=Jaza |title=Vehicle dynamics: theory and applications |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2008 |pages=30\u201331|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Pvsv78xj7UIC&pg=PA31&dq=%22station+wagon%22+vs.+%22hatchback%22 |isbn=978-0-387-74243-4 |accessdate=3 March 2014|quote=A hatchback car is called a liftback when the opening area is very sloped and is lifted up to open.}}</ref>\n\nThe term was used officially, among others, by Toyota, for example to distinguish between two 5-door versions of the [[Toyota Corolla (E90)|Corolla E90]] sold in Europe, one of which was a conventional 5-door hatchback with a nearly vertical rear hatch while the other one was a 5-door liftback.\n{{multiple image\n | width=220\n | direction = vertical\n | image1=Opel Vectra C 2.2 Direkt rear.JPG\n | image2=Opel Vectra C GTS rear 20081127.jpg\n | footer = [[Opel Vectra#Vectra C (2002\u20132008)|Opel Vectra C]] as a 4-door sedan (top) and a 5-door liftback (bottom).

It may be nonexistent ([[Nissan Primera#P12 (2001\u20132007)|Nissan Primera P12]]), very short or vestigial (1985 [[Toyota Celica]] liftback) or long enough for the vehicle to be confused with a conventional sedan body style which may be offered alongside it ([[Mazda6#First generation (GG1; 2002\u20132008)|Mazda 6 GG1]], [[Opel Vectra#Vectra C (2002\u20132008)|Opel Vectra C]], many others). While today many such cars feature smooth, curved lines making it difficult to tell where one \"box\" ends and another one starts, the same applies to sedans, which makes the two body styles even more difficult to tell apart at first glance.\n\nLiftbacks were the mainstay of manufacturers' [[D-segment]] offerings in Europe in the 1990s (they were already popular in the 1980s) and until the late 2000s. It was common for manufacturers to offer the same D-segment model in three different body styles: a 4-door sedan, a 5-door liftback and a 5-door station wagon. Such models included the [[Ford Mondeo]], the [[Mazda 626]]/[[Mazda6]], the [[Nissan Primera]], the [[Opel Vectra]]/[[Opel Insignia|Insignia]] and the [[Toyota Carina]]/[[Toyota Avensis|Avensis]]. There were also models in this market segment available only as a 5-door liftback or a 4-door sedan, and models available only as a 5-door liftback or a 5-door station wagon. Often the liftback and the sedan shared the same wheelbase and the same overall length, and the full rear overhang length of a conventional sedan trunk was retained on the five-door liftback version of the car.\n\n[[Audi]], [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] were not part of this trend in the 1990s; they did not offer their [[D-segment]] and [[Executive car|executive]] cars as 5-door liftbacks back then. However, starting around the year 2009, Audi and BMW started to roll out such liftbacks, referring to them as \"Sportback\" (Audi) or \"Gran Turismo\"/\"Gran Coupe\" (BMW). Interestingly, this occurred not long after some other manufacturers, although certainly not all of them, started to drop D-segment liftbacks from their European lineup.\n\nThe second-generation [[Skoda Superb#Second generation (B6, Typ 3T; 2008\u20132015)|Skoda Superb]] (2008-2015) is a car that blurs the line between liftbacks and sedans. It features an innovative \"Twindoor\" trunk lid. It can be opened like in a sedan, using the hinges located below the rear glass; or together with the rear glass, like in a liftback, using the hinges at the roof.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2Ek25kwTqY</ref>\n\nIn the USA, 5-door liftbacks are much less popular. Although the [[Tesla Model S]] is a liftback, the manufacturer prefers to refer to it as a sedan.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | width = 220 | direction = vertical \n| image1 = 1938 Citroen hatchback.JPG\n| caption1 = 1938 [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]] 1952 shape is shown\n| image2 = 1951 Kaiser-Frazer Vagabond hatchback 2013 FL AACA-2.jpg\n| caption2 = 1951 [[Kaiser Motors|Kaiser-Frazer Vagabond]]\n}}\n\n=== Prior art and small volume models ===\nThe first production hatchback was released by [[Citro\u00ebn]] in 1938: the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Citro\u00ebn 11CV]] Commerciale.<ref>{{cite web |author=Citroen Car Club |url=http://www.citroencarclub.org.uk/drupal/node/31 |title=Traction Avant |publisher=Citroen Car Club |date= |accessdate=20 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312095447/http://citroencarclub.org.uk/drupal/node/31 |archive-date=12 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The tailgate has two pieces, a top section hinged from roof level and a bottom section hinged from below.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2017/02/citroen-traction-avant-11cv-commerciale-forward-thinking-french-hatchback/ |first=Carter |last=Johnson |title=Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant 11CV Commerciale \u2013 The World\u2019s First Hatchback |date=9 February 2017 |publisher=The Truth about Cars |accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> When production of the Commerciale resumed after [[World War II]], the tailgate became a one-piece design which was hinged from roof level, as per the design used on most hatchbacks since.<ref>{{cite web |title=History Of Hatchbacks & The Best Hatchback Cars 2014 |url= https://www.globalcarsbrands.com/history-of-hatchbacks-and-the-best-hatchback-cars/ |website=www.globalcarsbrands.com |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, [[Kaiser-Frazer]] introduced the Vagabond and Traveler hatchbacks.

Folding the rear seats down gives a large floor area for the carriage of luggage or goods. Stronger suspension springs are fitted at the rear to support the extra load. Hatchback: The hatchback is generally based on a saloon body but with the boot or trunk area blended into the centre section of the body. The hatchback is therefore halfway between a saloon and estate car. This type of body is very popular due to its versatility and style. Although some hatchbacks are in fact saloon bodies with the boot or trunk effectively removed (usually the smaller cars), many hatchbacks retain the full length of the saloon but the roofline extends down to the rear of the vehicle. As with the saloon bodies, a hatchback can have two or four passenger doors, however there is a tendency to refer to hatchbacks as three or five doors because the rear compartment lid (or tailgate) is also referred to as a door on the hatchback bodies. As with the estate, the rear seats fold down to give a flat floor for the transportation of luggage or other objects. When the tailgate is closed, the luggage compartment is usually covered with a parcel shelf. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DoYaRsNFlEYC&pg=PA11&dq=%22station+wagon%22+vs.+%22hatchback%22 |accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>\n* the tailgate is more likely to be a multi-part design or extend all the way down to the [[Bumper (car)|bumper]]\n\n===Liftback===\n[[File:1986 Toyota Celica (ST162) SX liftback (2016-01-04) 02.jpg|thumb|1986 [[Toyota Celica]] with liftback]]\n\nLiftback is a term for hatchback models in which the rear cargo door or hatch is more horizontally angled than on an average hatchback, and as a result, the hatch is lifted more upwards than backwards, to open.<ref name=\"Vehicle Dynamics\">{{cite book |first=Reza N. |last=Jaza |title=Vehicle dynamics: theory and applications |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2008 |pages=30\u201331|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Pvsv78xj7UIC&pg=PA31&dq=%22station+wagon%22+vs.+%22hatchback%22 |isbn=978-0-387-74243-4 |accessdate=3 March 2014|quote=A hatchback car is called a liftback when the opening area is very sloped and is lifted up to open.}}</ref>\n\nThe term was used officially, among others, by Toyota, for example to distinguish between two 5-door versions of the [[Toyota Corolla (E90)|Corolla E90]] sold in Europe, one of which was a conventional 5-door hatchback with a nearly vertical rear hatch while the other one was a 5-door liftback.\n{{multiple image\n | width=220\n | direction = vertical\n | image1=Opel Vectra C 2.2 Direkt rear.JPG\n | image2=Opel Vectra C GTS rear 20081127.jpg\n | footer = [[Opel Vectra#Vectra C (2002\u20132008)|Opel Vectra C]] as a 4-door sedan (top) and a 5-door liftback (bottom).

It may be nonexistent ([[Nissan Primera#P12 (2001\u20132007)|Nissan Primera P12]]), very short or vestigial (1985 [[Toyota Celica]] liftback) or long enough for the vehicle to be confused with a conventional sedan body style which may be offered alongside it ([[Mazda6#First generation (GG1; 2002\u20132008)|Mazda 6 GG1]], [[Opel Vectra#Vectra C (2002\u20132008)|Opel Vectra C]], many others). While today many such cars feature smooth, curved lines making it difficult to tell where one \"box\" ends and another one starts, the same applies to sedans, which makes the two body styles even more difficult to tell apart at first glance.\n\nLiftbacks were the mainstay of manufacturers' [[D-segment]] offerings in Europe in the 1990s (they were already popular in the 1980s) and until the late 2000s. It was common for manufacturers to offer the same D-segment model in three different body styles: a 4-door sedan, a 5-door liftback and a 5-door station wagon. Such models included the [[Ford Mondeo]], the [[Mazda 626]]/[[Mazda6]], the [[Nissan Primera]], the [[Opel Vectra]]/[[Opel Insignia|Insignia]] and the [[Toyota Carina]]/[[Toyota Avensis|Avensis]]. There were also models in this market segment available only as a 5-door liftback or a 4-door sedan, and models available only as a 5-door liftback or a 5-door station wagon. Often the liftback and the sedan shared the same wheelbase and the same overall length, and the full rear overhang length of a conventional sedan trunk was retained on the five-door liftback version of the car.\n\n[[Audi]], [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] were not part of this trend in the 1990s; they did not offer their [[D-segment]] and [[Executive car|executive]] cars as 5-door liftbacks back then. However, starting around the year 2009, Audi and BMW started to roll out such liftbacks, referring to them as \"Sportback\" (Audi) or \"Gran Turismo\"/\"Gran Coupe\" (BMW). Interestingly, this occurred not long after some other manufacturers, although certainly not all of them, started to drop D-segment liftbacks from their European lineup.\n\nThe second-generation [[Skoda Superb#Second generation (B6, Typ 3T; 2008\u20132015)|Skoda Superb]] (2008-2015) is a car that blurs the line between liftbacks and sedans.

Ever since MetsubouJinrai.net's cyber-terrorism became known, Hiden Intelligence began to use anti-viruses when they manufacture new HumaGears. After defeating MetsubouJinrai.net, Hiden Intelligence faced their corporate rival, ZAIA Enterprise, in a Workplace Competition; only to get bought out in the end.\n*{{nihongo|Hiden Manufacturing Co., Ltd.|\u98db\u96fb\u88fd\u4f5c\u6240|Hiden Seisakujo}}: After Hiden Intelligence was bought out by ZAIA Enterprise, Hiden Manufacturing was created to maintain the Hiden legacy, continue creating HumaGears, and fight back against ZAIA Enterprise.

As the group are funded by ZAIA Enterprise, they ended up becoming Gai's enforcers following his company's hostile takeover of Hiden Intelligence.\n\nThe designated Kamen Riders of A.I.M.S. are outfitted with AI chips, allowing them to be influenced by Gai and Naki, to utilize the {{nihongo|A.I.M.S.

Isamu initially hated Humagears due to being the sole survivor of a Magia attack that claimed the lives of his classmates during the Daybreak Incident. He also blamed Hiden Intelligence for the incident until Aruto exposed MetsubouJinrai.net's existence during a press conference, gradually accepting Aruto as an ally and discarding his hated for HumaGears.

Gai's animosity towards the Hiden family worsened when Korenosuke named Aruto his heir, supplying his tech to A.I.M.S. while masterminding MetsubouJinrai.net's attacks to tarnish Hiden Intelligence's reputation. \n\nOnce MetsubouJinrai.net was defeated, having finalized his own Rider system, Gai challenged Aruto to a five-part {{nihongo|Workplace Competition|\u304a\u4ed5\u4e8b\u52dd\u8ca0|Oshigoto sh\u014dbu}} to acquire ownership of Hiden Intelligence if he proves humans are more effective than HumaGears. Despite pretending to be objective view most of the time unless his representatives' conduct effects ZAIA Enterprise's image, Gai used the competition to promote the Raid Risers as an effective countermeasure to HumaGears with the resulting attacks serving as an excuse to make himself look like a hero while overpowering Zero-One. Once winning the Workplace Competition and absorbing Hiden Intelligence, he issues an order calling for the immediate decommission of all HumaGears.
