Mackiernan fled south toward [[India]] after most escape routes were cut off, along with [[Frank Bessac]], an American [[Fulbright Scholar]] who was in Tihwa, and three [[White Movement|White Russians]]. Although Mackiernan and his party survived the [[Taklamakan Desert]] and [[Himalayas]], Mackiernan was shot by [[Tibet]]an border guards, probably because they mistook them as [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] infiltrators, on April 29, 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol52no3/amnesia-to-anamnesis.html|title=Amnesia to Anamnesis |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref>\n|--\n! colspan=3 | 1951\n|--\n| January 11, 1951\n| Jerome P.

When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but that school's sports program is now called simply \"Charleston\").\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=7|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but that school's sports program is now called simply \"Charleston\").\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=7|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

This is distinguished from '[[heavy rail]]' systems, also known as [[rapid transit]] or 'metro' (e.g. subway and/or elevated), which are fully grade-separated from other traffic, and which are characterized by higher passenger capacities than [[light rail]]. Arguably, traditional streetcars (also known as trolleys in North America, or as [[tram]]s outside of North America especially in Europe), which is rail-based transit that takes place in shared roadways with automobile traffic (i.e. with [[street running]]) and thus does not operate in exclusive rights-of-way, can be considered to be a sub-set of light rail, though the two modes of transit are often treated as distinct in the United States.\n\n==Light rail transit in the United States==\n[[File:Gold_Line_train_on_East_1st_Street,_July_2017.JPG|thumb|left|[[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]] [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Light Rail]], the most heavily utilized light rail system in the United States, serving [[Los Angeles]] ]]\n{{See also|List of United States light rail systems by ridership}}\nAccording to the [[American Public Transportation Association]], of the roughly 30 cities with light rail systems in the United States, the light rail systems in six of them ([[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland (Oregon)]], [[San Diego]], and [[San Francisco]]) achieve [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|more than 30 million unlinked passenger transits per year]].<ref name=\"APTA-2018-Q4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/Ridership/2018-Q4-Ridership-APTA.pdf|title=Transit Ridership Report Fourth Quarter  2018|date=April 12, 2019|publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] (APTA)|format=pdf|via=https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018-Q4-Ridership-APTA.pdf|accessdate=May 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe United States has a number of light rail systems in its mid-sized to large cities.

Some rail lines experimented with multiple unit configurations, where streetcars were joined together to make short trains, but this did not become common until later. When lines were built over longer distances (typically with a single track) before good roads were common, they were generally called [[interurban|interurban streetcars]] or radial railways in North America.\n\n===Legacy systems===\nAfter World War II, six major cities in the United States (Boston, Newark, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco) continued to operate large first-generation streetcar systems, although most of them were later converted to modern light rail standards.<ref name=\"LRT\" /> Toronto in Canada marks the other city in North America with a continuing first-generation streetcar system.

While most of San Francisco's original streetcar lines had been converted to buses in the post-World War II years, five lines that had dedicated rights-of-way or used narrow tunnels (e.g. the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]] and the [[Sunset Tunnel]]) could not be converted to buses. By the 1950s and 1960s, planning for the '''[[Market Street Subway]]''' was undertaken that would serve both the planned [[rapid transit]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system, and operate as a new subway tunnel for the five remaining streetcar lines. The partial conversion to the [[Muni Metro]] light rail/subway began service in 1980, with full service commencing in 1982 \u2013 while operation in the Market Street Subway portion of Muni Metro can be considered true \"light rail\" service, the remaining surface portions of the five original Muni Metro lines still largely operate as streetcars. The surface Market Street streetcar operations ceased in 1982; however, full revenue surface streetcar service was restored to Market Street in 1995 as the [[heritage streetcar]] [[F Market & Wharves]] line. A sixth Muni Metro line, the [[T Third Street]], was added to the system in 2007 and has more features of true ''light rail'' than older lines; a new subway extension for this line, the [[Central Subway]], is under construction.<br>Many of these lines were formerly cable propelled, but converted to electric traction; only the steepest grades retained [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]]s. While serving primarily as a tourist attraction, sections of the current cable car system have been in place prior to consolidation under the Municipal Railway.\n|}\n\nWhen several of these cities upgraded to new technology (e.g. San Francisco, Newark, and Pittsburgh), they called it \"light rail\" to differentiate it from their existing streetcar systems since some continued to operate portions of both the old and new systems.\n\n[[File:San Diego Trolley (4799226755).jpg|thumb|left|[[San Diego Trolley]]]]\n\n===Second-generation systems===\nIn the United States, most of the original first-generation streetcar systems [[Great American Streetcar Scandal|were decommissioned]] from the 1950s onward through approximately 1970 as the popularity of the automobile increased. Although a few traditional streetcar or trolley systems still exist to this day (e.g. New Orleans), the term \"light rail\" has come to mean a different type of rail system. Modern light rail technology has primarily German origins, since an attempt by Boeing Vertol to introduce a new American light rail vehicle was a technical failure. After World War II, the Germans retained their streetcar (Stra\u00dfenbahn) networks and evolved them into model light rail systems ([[Stadtbahn]]). Except for Hamburg, all large and most medium-sized German cities maintain light rail (Stadtbahn) networks.<ref name=\"Bottoms\">{{cite conference  | url = http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/circulars/ec058/15_01_Bottoms.pdf | first = Glen | last = Bottoms | title = Continuing Developments in Light Rail Transit in Western Europe | publisher = Light Rail Transit Association | booktitle= | pages= | year=  2000 | location = 9th Annual Light Rail Transit Conference, Portland, Oregon | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe renaissance of light rail in the United States began in 1981, when the first truly second-generation light rail system was inaugurated in the United States, the [[San Diego Trolley]] in California, which adopted use of the German [[Siemens-Duewag U2]] light rail vehicle. (This was just three years after the first North American second-generation light rail system opened in the Canadian city of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] in 1978, and which used the same German Siemens-Duewag U2 vehicles as San Diego.)<ref name=\"LRT\" />\n\nHistorically, the rail gauge has had considerable variations, with a variety of gauges common in many early systems (e.g. the broad [[Broad gauge#Contemporary non standard broad gauges|Pennsylvania trolley gauge]], etc. used by New Orleans' streetcars and by the light rail systems in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh). However, most modern second-generation light rail systems now operate on [[standard gauge]] rail.<ref name=\"Bottoms\"/> An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives. Another factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular in second-generation light rail systems, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout.\n\n==List of light rail systems operating in the United States==\n{{As of|2020|March}}, there are a total of 53 operational light rail-type lines and systems (noting that some cities, such as Philadelphia, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle, have more than one light rail system) that offer regular year-round transit service in the United States: 26 modern light rail systems,<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson|first=Matt |url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/25286/see-americas-light-rail-and-streetcars-at-the-same-scale/ |title=See America's light rail and streetcars at the same scale |website=Greater Greater Washington |date=January 12, 2015 |access-date=2015-01-14}}</ref> 14 modern streetcar systems, and 13 heritage streetcar systems (including the [[San Francisco cable car system]]).

This is distinguished from '[[heavy rail]]' systems, also known as [[rapid transit]] or 'metro' (e.g. subway and/or elevated), which are fully grade-separated from other traffic, and which are characterized by higher passenger capacities than [[light rail]]. Arguably, traditional streetcars (also known as trolleys in North America, or as [[tram]]s outside of North America especially in Europe), which is rail-based transit that takes place in shared roadways with automobile traffic (i.e. with [[street running]]) and thus does not operate in exclusive rights-of-way, can be considered to be a sub-set of light rail, though the two modes of transit are often treated as distinct in the United States.\n\n==Light rail transit in the United States==\n[[File:Gold_Line_train_on_East_1st_Street,_July_2017.JPG|thumb|left|[[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]] [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Light Rail]], the most heavily utilized light rail system in the United States, serving [[Los Angeles]] ]]\n{{See also|List of United States light rail systems by ridership}}\nAccording to the [[American Public Transportation Association]], of the roughly 30 cities with light rail systems in the United States, the light rail systems in six of them ([[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland (Oregon)]], [[San Diego]], and [[San Francisco]]) achieve [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|more than 30 million unlinked passenger transits per year]].<ref name=\"APTA-2018-Q4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/Ridership/2018-Q4-Ridership-APTA.pdf|title=Transit Ridership Report Fourth Quarter  2018|date=April 12, 2019|publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] (APTA)|format=pdf|via=https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018-Q4-Ridership-APTA.pdf|accessdate=May 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe United States has a number of light rail systems in its mid-sized to large cities.

They became popular because roads were then poorly surfaced, and before the invention of the internal combustion engine and the advent of motor-buses, they were the only practical means of public transport around cities.<ref>{{cite web| author=Taplin, Michael| year=1998| title=The History of Tramways and Evolution of Light Rail| publisher=Light Rail Transit Association| url=http://www.lrta.org/mrthistory.html| access-date=2013-11-01| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825170136/http://www.lrta.org/mrthistory.html| archive-date=2016-08-25| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe streetcar systems constructed in the 19th and early 20th centuries typically only ran in single-car setups. Some rail lines experimented with multiple unit configurations, where streetcars were joined together to make short trains, but this did not become common until later. When lines were built over longer distances (typically with a single track) before good roads were common, they were generally called [[interurban|interurban streetcars]] or radial railways in North America.\n\n===Legacy systems===\nAfter World War II, six major cities in the United States (Boston, Newark, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco) continued to operate large first-generation streetcar systems, although most of them were later converted to modern light rail standards.<ref name=\"LRT\" /> Toronto in Canada marks the other city in North America with a continuing first-generation streetcar system.

While most of San Francisco's original streetcar lines had been converted to buses in the post-World War II years, five lines that had dedicated rights-of-way or used narrow tunnels (e.g. the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]] and the [[Sunset Tunnel]]) could not be converted to buses. By the 1950s and 1960s, planning for the '''[[Market Street Subway]]''' was undertaken that would serve both the planned [[rapid transit]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system, and operate as a new subway tunnel for the five remaining streetcar lines. The partial conversion to the [[Muni Metro]] light rail/subway began service in 1980, with full service commencing in 1982 \u2013 while operation in the Market Street Subway portion of Muni Metro can be considered true \"light rail\" service, the remaining surface portions of the five original Muni Metro lines still largely operate as streetcars. The surface Market Street streetcar operations ceased in 1982; however, full revenue surface streetcar service was restored to Market Street in 1995 as the [[heritage streetcar]] [[F Market & Wharves]] line. A sixth Muni Metro line, the [[T Third Street]], was added to the system in 2007 and has more features of true ''light rail'' than older lines; a new subway extension for this line, the [[Central Subway]], is under construction.<br>Many of these lines were formerly cable propelled, but converted to electric traction; only the steepest grades retained [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]]s. While serving primarily as a tourist attraction, sections of the current cable car system have been in place prior to consolidation under the Municipal Railway.\n|}\n\nWhen several of these cities upgraded to new technology (e.g. San Francisco, Newark, and Pittsburgh), they called it \"light rail\" to differentiate it from their existing streetcar systems since some continued to operate portions of both the old and new systems.\n\n[[File:San Diego Trolley (4799226755).jpg|thumb|left|[[San Diego Trolley]]]]\n\n===Second-generation systems===\nIn the United States, most of the original first-generation streetcar systems [[Great American Streetcar Scandal|were decommissioned]] from the 1950s onward through approximately 1970 as the popularity of the automobile increased. Although a few traditional streetcar or trolley systems still exist to this day (e.g. New Orleans), the term \"light rail\" has come to mean a different type of rail system. Modern light rail technology has primarily German origins, since an attempt by Boeing Vertol to introduce a new American light rail vehicle was a technical failure. After World War II, the Germans retained their streetcar (Stra\u00dfenbahn) networks and evolved them into model light rail systems ([[Stadtbahn]]). Except for Hamburg, all large and most medium-sized German cities maintain light rail (Stadtbahn) networks.<ref name=\"Bottoms\">{{cite conference  | url = http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/circulars/ec058/15_01_Bottoms.pdf | first = Glen | last = Bottoms | title = Continuing Developments in Light Rail Transit in Western Europe | publisher = Light Rail Transit Association | booktitle= | pages= | year=  2000 | location = 9th Annual Light Rail Transit Conference, Portland, Oregon | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe renaissance of light rail in the United States began in 1981, when the first truly second-generation light rail system was inaugurated in the United States, the [[San Diego Trolley]] in California, which adopted use of the German [[Siemens-Duewag U2]] light rail vehicle. (This was just three years after the first North American second-generation light rail system opened in the Canadian city of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] in 1978, and which used the same German Siemens-Duewag U2 vehicles as San Diego.)<ref name=\"LRT\" />\n\nHistorically, the rail gauge has had considerable variations, with a variety of gauges common in many early systems (e.g. the broad [[Broad gauge#Contemporary non standard broad gauges|Pennsylvania trolley gauge]], etc. used by New Orleans' streetcars and by the light rail systems in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh). However, most modern second-generation light rail systems now operate on [[standard gauge]] rail.<ref name=\"Bottoms\"/> An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives. Another factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular in second-generation light rail systems, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout.\n\n==List of light rail systems operating in the United States==\n{{As of|2020|March}}, there are a total of 53 operational light rail-type lines and systems (noting that some cities, such as Philadelphia, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle, have more than one light rail system) that offer regular year-round transit service in the United States: 26 modern light rail systems,<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson|first=Matt |url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/25286/see-americas-light-rail-and-streetcars-at-the-same-scale/ |title=See America's light rail and streetcars at the same scale |website=Greater Greater Washington |date=January 12, 2015 |access-date=2015-01-14}}</ref> 14 modern streetcar systems, and 13 heritage streetcar systems (including the [[San Francisco cable car system]]).
