When he was seven, Krieger accidentally broke his record player, but the radio introduced him to the likes of [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[the Platters]]. At the age of 10, he tried the trumpet but found it was not for him. He began playing the blues on his parents' piano with much more success than the trumpet.\n\nWhile Krieger was a boarding student at a private school called [[Menlo School]] in [[Menlo Park, California]], there was study time at night that allowed him to teach himself to play the guitar. He began by first de-tuning a ukulele to the bottom four strings of a guitar and mimicking a record he had. Later, in the mid-1960s, [[Asian American]] scholar [[Frank Chin]] taught Krieger how to play the [[flamenco guitar]].<ref>Stephen Davis, Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend 77 (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-59240-099-7}}</ref> During a Christmas break, Krieger and two classmates took a vacation to Puerto Vallarta where he purchased a peg-tuned [[Ram\u00edrez Guitars|Ram\u00edrez guitar]] and took lessons for a few months.

When he was seven, Krieger accidentally broke his record player, but the radio introduced him to the likes of [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[the Platters]]. At the age of 10, he tried the trumpet but found it was not for him. He began playing the blues on his parents' piano with much more success than the trumpet.\n\nWhile Krieger was a boarding student at a private school called [[Menlo School]] in [[Menlo Park, California]], there was study time at night that allowed him to teach himself to play the guitar. He began by first de-tuning a ukulele to the bottom four strings of a guitar and mimicking a record he had. Later, in the mid-1960s, [[Asian American]] scholar [[Frank Chin]] taught Krieger how to play the [[flamenco guitar]].<ref>Stephen Davis, Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend 77 (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-59240-099-7}}</ref> During a Christmas break, Krieger and two classmates took a vacation to Puerto Vallarta where he purchased a peg-tuned [[Ram\u00edrez Guitars|Ram\u00edrez guitar]] and took lessons for a few months.

The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.<ref>[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=W23 AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University)]</ref>\n\nIn 1948, WJMO carried the football games of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]].\n\nOn June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the [[WHLK|106.5 MHz facility]] that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959.\n\nSome of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two.\n\nWABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since.\n\n===ESPN 1540 KNR2===\nIn July 2006, the station was sold by D&E Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based [[Good Karma Broadcasting]], LLC., headed by [[Craig Karmazin]], for $2.5 million. Just before the sale closed, WABQ switched call letters with [[Painesville, Ohio]] station WBKC 1460-AM - owned by Radio Advantage One, LLC, a sister company to D&E Communications - on October 24, 2006.\n\nFour days later, WABQ's programming officially moved to 1460, and the 1540 facility relaunched as \"ESPN Radio 1540\" with a [[sports talk radio|sports/talk]] format. The station temporarily kept the WBKC call letters before adopting the WWGK callsign that November 7.\n\nWWGK's new format at 1540 first carried the entire [[ESPN Radio]] daytime lineup on its daytime only broadcasts, much like Good Karma-owned Milwaukee station [[WAUK]]. Speculation focused on plans to purchase nighttime clearance on [[WERE]] in order to have a 24-hour network clearance. Moreover, a companion \"1540 Days - 1300 Nights\" logo on WWGK's website had confirmed this, though it was since removed. There was never any official word that such an arrangement was ever attempted.\n\nOn December 4, 2006, ''Crain's Cleveland Business'' reported that Craig Karmazin's Good Karma Broadcasting was to purchase [[WKNR]] for $7 million, eventually combining both stations under one facility at [[The Galleria at Erieview]].\n\nOn February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation, while WWGK would take the branding AM 1540 KNR2, (a play on [[ESPN2]]) in keeping with its sister station.  In April 2010, the station began branding itself as ESPN 1540 KNR2.  Today, WWGK and WKNR are often promoted on-air jointly as ESPN Cleveland.\n\nThe new schedule also made WWGK the [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate in Cleveland, but still retained (at the time) ESPN Radio shows hosted by [[Colin Cowherd]] and [[Dan Patrick]] and the final hour of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' - all of which WKNR was unable to air otherwise. The station also started a 24-hour streaming audio service on its website.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, [[WKRK-FM]] 92.3 switched from [[alternative rock]] to a [[sports talk]] format, and (at the time) became the new Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland.  AM 1540 then replaced FSR with further ESPN Radio programming.\n\n===Doctor Radio===\nOn April 22, 2020, WWGK dropped all sports programming and switched to a health and medical news/talk format, airing programming from [[Sirius XM]]'s [[Doctor Radio]] service.  This was done to provide a health-related service during the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]].

The [[Bell Telephone Company]] was established in 1877 by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who obtained the first US patent for the telephone, and his father-in-law, [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]]. Bell and Hubbard also established [[AT&T (1885)|American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] in 1885, which acquired the Bell Telephone Company and became the primary telephone company in the United States. This company maintained a [[monopoly]] on telephone service in the United States until anti-trust regulators [[Bell System divestiture|split the company]] in 1982.\n\nAT&T Corporation was eventually purchased by one of its [[Regional Bell Operating Company]], the former Southwestern Bell Company, in 2005 and the combined company became known as [[AT&T]] Inc.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Bell System hires 1889 logo.PNG|100px|thumb|A [[Bell System]] logo (called the Blue Bell) used from 1889 to 1900.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]]\n[[File:Lines and Metallic Circuit Connections, American Telephone and Telegraph Co, March 1, 1891 edit.jpg|thumb|left|300px|AT&T's lines and metallic circuit connections.

Only three years earlier, Western Union had turned down Gardiner Hubbard's offer to sell it all rights to the telephone for $100,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1878}}}} in 2009 dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}).\n\nIn 1880, the management of American Bell created what would become AT&T Long Lines. The project was the first of its kind to create a nationwide long-distance network with a commercially viable cost-structure. This project was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company on March 3, 1885. Starting from [[New York City|New York]], the network reached [[Chicago]] in 1892.\n\nBell's [[patent]] on the telephone expired in 1893, but the company's much larger customer base made its service much more valuable than alternatives and substantial growth continued.\n\nOn December 30, 1899, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell; this was because [[Massachusetts]] corporate laws (which limited [[market capitalization]] to ten million dollars, preventing the direct growth of American Bell itself) were more restrictive than those of [[New York (state)|New York]], where AT&T was headquartered.<ref name=\"Brooks 1976, pg107\">Brooks 1976, p. 107.</ref> With this transfer of assets, AT&T became the parent of the [[Bell System]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1976, pg107\" />\n\nNational long-distance service reached [[San Francisco]] with the [[First transcontinental telephone call]] in 1915. This connection used a system of lines with [[loading coil]]s and the [[Audion]] vacuum tube repeater first tested between New York and Philadelphia in 1913.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ethw.org/First_Telephone_Repeater |title=First Telephone Repeater}}</ref>  Transatlantic services started in 1927 using two-way [[radio]], but the first [[Transatlantic telephone cable|trans-Atlantic]] [[submarine communications cable|telephone cable]] did not arrive until Sept. 25, 1956, with [[TAT-1]].\n\n== Monopoly ==\n{{further|Bell System}}\n[[File:Bell System hires 1969 logo blue.svg|thumb|right|100px|The Bell System [[logo]] and [[trademark]] as it appeared in 1972.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]]\n\nAs a result of a combination of regulatory actions by government and actions by AT&T, the firm eventually gained what most regard as [[monopoly]] status. In 1907, AT&T president [[Theodore Vail]] made it known that he was pursuing a goal of \"One Policy, One System, Universal Service.\" AT&T began purchasing competitors, which attracted the attention of [[antitrust]] regulators. To avoid antitrust action, in a deal with the government, Vail agreed to the [[Kingsbury Commitment]] of 1913. One of the three terms of the agreement forbade AT&T from acquiring any more independent phone companies without the approval of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].<ref>Brooks 1976, p. 136.</ref>\n\nG.W. Brock says in ''The Telecommunications Industry: The Dynamics Of Market Structure'', \"[The] provision allowed Bell and the independents to exchange telephones in order to give each other geographical monopolies. So long as only one company served a given geographical area there was little reason to expect price competition to take place.\"<ref>Brock 1981, p. 156.</ref> AT&T focused on purchasing companies within specific geographic areas that increased its effective control of the telephone system market, while selling its less-desirable and previously acquired companies to independent buyers. Also included in the Kingsbury Commitment was the requirement that AT&T allow competitors to connect through its phone lines, which reduced the incentive of these companies to build competing long-distance lines.\n\nIn 1913, after vacuum-tube inventor [[Lee de Forest]] began to suffer financial difficulties, AT&T bought De Forest's vacuum-tube patents for the bargain price of $50,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1913}}}} in 2009 dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}).  In particular, AT&T acquired ownership of the '{{lang|en|Audion}}', the first triode (three-element) [[vacuum tube]], which greatly amplified telephone signals.  The patent increased AT&T's control over the manufacture and distribution of long-distance telephone services, and allowed the Bell System to build the United States's first coast-to coast telephone line.  Thanks to the pressures of [[World War I]], AT&T and [[RCA]] owned all useful patents on vacuum tubes. RCA staked a position in wireless communication; AT&T pursued the use of tubes in telephone amplifiers. Some [[patent]] allies and partners in RCA were angered when the two companies' research on tubes began to overlap, and there were many patent disputes.\n\nAround 1917, the idea that everyone in the country should have phone service and that the government should promote that began being discussed in government. AT&T agreed, saying in a 1917 annual report: \"A combination of like activities under proper control and regulation, the service to the public would be better, more progressive, efficient, and economical than competitive systems.\" In 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid \"duplication.\" The claim was that telephone service was a \"[[natural monopoly]],\" meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\n\nAT&T, RCA, and their patent allies and partners finally settled their disputes in 1926 by compromise. AT&T decided to focus on the telephone business as a communications common carrier, and sold its broadcasting subsidiary [[Broadcasting Company of America]] to RCA. The assets included station [[WEAF (AM)|WEAF]], which for some time had broadcast from AT&T headquarters in New York City. In return, RCA signed a service agreement with AT&T, ensuring any radio network RCA started would have transmission connections provided by AT&T. Both companies agreed to cross-license patents, ending that aspect of the dispute. RCA, [[General Electric|GE]], and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] were now free to combine their assets to form the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]], or NBC network.\n\nIn 1925, AT&T created a new unit called Bell Telephone Laboratories, commonly known as [[Bell Labs]]. This [[research and development]] unit proved highly successful, pioneering, among other things, [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[photovoltaic cell]], the [[Unix]] [[operating system]], and the [[C programming language]]. AT&T ranked 13th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p. 619.</ref> In 1949, the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit aimed at forcing the divestiture of Western Electric, which was settled seven years later by AT&T's agreement to confine its products and services to common carrier telecommunications and license its patents to \"all interested parties.\" A key effect of this was to ban AT&T from selling computers despite its key role in electronics research and development. Nonetheless, technological innovation continued. For example, AT&T commissioned the first experimental communications [[satellite]], [[Telstar]] I in 1962.\n\n[[File:BellWesternElectricRotaryPhoneC.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Standard Western Electric [[Model 500 telephone]], rented (never sold) to U.S. telephone subscribers.]]\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AT&T logo 1969-1983.png|thumb|right|AT&T corporate logo (designed by [[Saul Bass]]), 1969\u20131983{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]] -->\n[[Public utility]] commissions in state and local [[jurisdiction]]s regulated the [[Bell System]] and all the other telephone companies. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulated all service across state lines. These commissions controlled the rates that companies could charge, and the specific services and equipment they could offer.\n\nAT&T increased its control of the telephone system through its leasing arrangements for telephones and telephone equipment made by its subsidiary, [[Western Electric]].  Like most telephones of the time in the United States, Western Electric-made phones were owned not by individual customers, but by local Bell System telephone companies \u2014 all of which were in turn owned by AT&T, which also owned Western Electric itself.  Each phone was leased from AT&T on a monthly basis by customers, who generally paid for their phone and its connection many times over in cumulative lease fees.  This monopoly made millions of extra dollars for AT&T, which had the secondary effect of greatly limiting phone choices and styles. AT&T strictly enforced policies against buying and using phones by other manufacturers that had not first been transferred to and re-rented from the local Bell monopoly. Many phones made by Western Electric thus carried the following disclaimer permanently molded into their housings: \"BELL SYSTEM PROPERTY \u2014 NOT FOR SALE.\" Telephones were also labeled with a sticker marking the Bell Operating Company that owned the telephone.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] allowed the [[Carterfone]] and other devices to be connected directly to the [[AT&T]] network, as long as they did not cause damage to the system. This ruling (13 F.C.C.2d 420) created the possibility of selling devices that could connect to the phone system and opened up the market to numerous products, including [[answering machine]]s, [[fax machine]]s, [[Cordless telephone|cordless phones]], computer [[modem]]s and the early, dialup [[Internet]].\n\nIn the 1980s, after some consumers began buying phones from other manufacturers anyway, AT&T changed its policy by selling customers the phone's housing, retaining ownership of the mechanical components \u2014 which still required paying AT&T a monthly leasing fee.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, AT&T subsidiary AT&T Long Lines thus enjoyed a near-total monopoly on long-distance telephone service in the United States. AT&T also controlled 22 [[Bell Operating Companies]] which provided [[local telephone service]] to most of the United States. While there were many \"independent telephone companies\", [[General Telephone and Electronics|General Telephone]] being the most significant, the [[Bell System]] was far larger than all the others, and widely considered a monopoly itself.\n\n=== Erosion of \"a natural monopoly\" ===\n\nFor many years, AT&T had been permitted to retain its monopoly status under the assumption that it was a [[natural monopoly]]. The first erosion to this monopoly occurred in 1956 where the ''[[Hush-A-Phone v. United States]]'' ruling allowed a third-party device to be attached to rented telephones owned by AT&T. This was followed by the 1968 [[Carterfone]] decision that allowed third-party equipment to be connected to the AT&T telephone network. The rise of cheap microwave communications equipment in the 1960s and 1970s opened a window of opportunity for competitors \u2014 no longer was the acquisition of expensive rights-of-way necessary for the construction of a long-distance telephone network. In light of this, the FCC permitted [[MCI Communications|MCI]] (Microwave Communications, Inc) to sell communication services to large businesses. This technical-economic argument against the necessity of AT&T's monopoly position would hold for a mere fifteen years until the beginning of the fiber-optics revolution sounded the end of microwave-based long distance.\n\n== Breakup ==\n{{further|Breakup of AT&T|Regional Bell Operating Company}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AT&T logo (1984).svg|125px|thumb|right|AT&T corporate logo, 1983\u20132005,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} designed by [[Saul Bass]]. It was nicknamed the \"Death Star\" due to its appearance's similarity to the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Death Star|space station of the same name]].]] -->\nThe rest of the telephone monopoly lasted until January 8, 1982, the date of settlement of ''[[United States v. AT&T]]'', a 1974 [[United States Department of Justice]] [[antitrust]] [[Bell System divestiture|suit against AT&T]]. Under the settlement AT&T (\"Ma Bell\") agreed to divest its local exchange service operating companies, in return for a chance to go into the computer business (see [[AT&T Computer Systems]]). AT&T's local operations were split into seven independent [[Regional Bell operating company|Regional Bell operating companies]], commonly known as \"[[Baby Bell]]s\".\n\nWith the American consumer's new ability to purchase phones outright, AT&T and the Bell System lost the considerable revenues earned from phone leasing by local Bell companies.  Forced to compete with other manufacturers for new phone sales, the aging Western Electric phone designs still marketed through AT&T failed to sell, and Western Electric eventually closed all of its U.S. phone manufacturing plants. AT&T, reduced in value by about 70%, continued to run all its long-distance services through [[AT&T Communications]] (the new name of AT&T Long Lines), although it lost some market share in the ensuing years to competitors [[MCI Communications|MCI]] and [[Sprint Nextel Corporation|Sprint]].\n\nA sign that hung in many Bell facilities in 1983 read:\n\n{{quote|There are two giant entities at work in our country, and they both have an amazing influence on our daily lives&nbsp;... one has given us radar, sonar, stereo, teletype, the transistor, hearing aids, artificial larynxes, talking movies, and the telephone.

After [[deregulation]] of the U.S. telecom industry via the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], NCR was divested again. At the same time, the majority of AT&T Technologies and the renowned [[Bell Labs]] was spun off as [[Lucent Technologies]]. The industry as a whole had many other reorganizations since the 1990s, both due to [[deregulation]] and because of technological advances reducing demand and [[pricing power]] in telecommunications.\n\nIn 1994, AT&T purchased the largest cellular carrier, [[McCaw Cellular]], for $11.5 billion and kick-started its cellular division with 2 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1994/211893.htm|title=Justice Department Files Antitrust Suit and Consent Decree in AT&T-McCaw Merger|date=1994-07-15|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004002550/http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1994/211893.htm|archivedate=2006-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/191742_attw21.html|title=The fall of AT&T Wireless|accessdate=|last=Richman|first=Dan|date=2004-09-21|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, AT&T purchased long-distance provider Alaska Communications System. FCC approval required the company be run as an AT&T subsidiary rather than a more likely absorption into [[AT&T Communications]], giving the company the [[AT&T Alascom]] name.\n\nIn 1997, AT&T hired former [[IBM]] executive [[C Michael Armstrong]] as its [[chief executive officer]]. Armstrong's vision was to change AT&T from a long-distance carrier into a global \"telecommunications [[supermarket]]\", eying Internet services for the [[Dot-com bubble|booming dot-com industry]].\n\nArmstrong's most prominent strategy was buying significant [[cable television]] assets. After acquiring John Malone's [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]] and [[Media One]] (gaining through the latter a 25% share of [[Time Warner Cable]]),{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} AT&T was the largest provider of [[cable television]] in the world.<ref name=\"NGen10\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: The Outsides|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=61}}</ref> It intended to use these assets to bridge the so-called \"[[last mile]]\" and break the Regional Bell Companies' access-monopoly of the consumer household for data and telephony services, but the wager was costly, substantially increasing the company's debt.  AT&T acquired TCI in a $48 billion all-stock transaction including the assumption of $16 billion of debt.

By mid-2001, customers were being directed to sign contracts with the parent companies, and [[Concert Communications Services]], as the venture was eventually known, was scrapped in October that year.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Att-logo.svg|thumb|right|125px|AT&T corporate logo, 1996\u20132005, was devised to simplify and eliminate multiple versions of the logo.]] -->\n\nIn 1999, AT&T acquired the [[Olivetti Research Laboratory|Olivetti & Oracle Research Lab]], from [[Olivetti]] and [[Oracle Corporation]]. In 2002, it closed down the research part of the lab.\n\nAlso in 1999, AT&T paid US$5 billion to purchase IBM's Global Network business, which became AT&T Global Network Services, LLC.  As part of the purchase agreement, IBM granted AT&T a five-year, US$5-billion contract to handle much of IBM's networking needs, and AT&T outsourced some of its applications processing and data management work to IBM.  IBM also committed to billing and installation for AT&T's long-distance customers in a 10-year deal valued at US$4 billion; and assumed management of AT&T's data processing centers.\n\nWith long-distance rates falling and the market for telecommunications services overall weakening, AT&T could not sustain the debt it had incurred in these ventures. Moreover, the cost of upgrading TCI's equipment to handle two-way communications proved far higher than pre-merger estimates. AT&T undertook a major reorganization in October 2000, moving its mobile phone and broadband units into separate companies, to allow each unit to raise capital independently.\n\n[[File:AT&T Comcast logo.svg|280px|thumb|left|The logo for AT&T Comcast, the original name for the AT&T Broadband/Comcast merger.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]]\nOn July 9, 2001, it spun off [[AT&T Wireless Services]] in what was then the world's largest [[initial public offering]] (IPO). Later that year it spun off [[AT&T Broadband]] and [[Liberty Media]], which comprised its [[cable television|cable TV]] assets. AT&T Broadband was subsequently acquired by [[Comcast]] in 2002, and AT&T Wireless merged with [[Cingular Wireless]] LLC in 2004. The merged wireless phone company operated as Cingular until 2007, when it became [[AT&T Mobility]].\n\nIn 2004, the U.S. government eliminated equal access regulations that allowed long-distance phone companies to access the networks owned by the regional Bell carriers at fixed rates. This ultimately caused AT&T to move away from the residential telephone business \u2014 declaring in the process that it would no longer market residential telephone service. Instead, its residential focus shifted to offering a voice service over a broadband Internet connection called [[AT&T CallVantage]].\n\n== Rise of SBC ==\n{{further|AT&T}}\nOne of the new companies formed by the breakup of AT&T was Southwestern Bell Corporation. This company grew continuously over the years until it acquired AT&T in 2005. After this acquisition, SBC took on AT&T's name and branding, and this is the company known as AT&T today.\n\n=== 1984\u20132001: Southwestern Bell Corporation ===\nAmerican Telephone and Telegraph Company officially transferred full ownership of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company to Southwestern Bell Corporation on January 1, 1984. It had three other subsidiaries: Southwestern Bell Publications, Inc., a directory publisher; Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc., in the business of mobile telephone service; and Southwestern Bell Telecommunications, Inc., focusing on marketing phone equipment to business customers. The holding company's new president was Zane Edison Barnes.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Southwestern Bell logo (1984).png|thumb|upright|Southwestern Bell Corporation logo, 1992\u20131995{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]] -->\nIn 1987, SBC bought [[Metromedia]] Inc.'s cellular and paging business. That, in turn, boosted the company to the third-largest cellular communications company in the United States, behind McCaw Cellular and [[Pacific Telesis]].

In 1994, it called off a $1.6&nbsp;billion acquisition attempt for 40% of [[Cox Communications|Cox Cable]] because of FCC rules on cable companies.

They then combined Southwestern Bell Telecom division (which made telephone equipment) into the company, due to new FCC rules.\n\nIn 1996, SBC announced it would acquire Pacific Telesis Group, a [[Regional Bell Operating Company]] (RBOC) in California and Nevada. 1997 brought rumors of a proposed merger between AT&T Corporation (the USA's largest long-distance provider) and SBC (the USA's largest local provider). The FCC disapproved of the merger, and it came to end. Later in 1997, SBC sold its last two cable companies, exiting the cable telecom field.\n\nIn January 1998, SBC announced it would take over the [[Southern New England Telephone Company]] (SNET) for $4.4&nbsp;billion in stock (the FCC would approve in October 1998). SBC also won a court judgment that would make it easier for RBOCs to enter the long-distance phone service, but it was being challenged by AT&T and the FCC. In May 1998, [[Ameritech]] and SBC announced a $62&nbsp;billion merger, in which SBC would take over Ameritech. After making several organizational changes (such as the sale of [[Ameritech Cellular|Ameritech Wireless]] to [[GTE]]) to satisfy state and federal regulators, the two merged on October 8, 1999. The FCC later fined SBC Communications $6&nbsp;million for failure to comply with agreements made in order to secure approval of the merger. SBC became the largest RBOC until the [[Bell Atlantic]] and GTE merger. 1998 revenues were $46&nbsp;billion, placing SBC among the top 15 companies in the [[Fortune 500]].<ref name=\"TIMWU\" />\n\nIn January 1999, SBC announced it would purchase Comcast Cellular, for $1.7&nbsp;billion, plus $1.3&nbsp;billion of debt. During 1999 SBC continued to prepare to be allowed to provide long-distance phone service. In February SBC acquired up to ten percent of Williams Companies' telecommunications division for about $500&nbsp;million, who were building a fiber optic network across the country and would carry SBC's future service. On November 1, 1999, SBC became a part of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (lasting through 2015).\n\n=== 2000\u20132005: One national brand, and acquisition of AT&T Corporation ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}\n\nIn 2002, SBC ended marketing its operating companies under different names, and simply opted to give its companies different [[doing business as]] names based on the state (a practice already in use by [[Ameritech]] since 1993), and it gave the holding companies it had purchased [[d/b/a]] names based on their general region.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lockup.svg|thumb|left|SBC-AT&T legacy transitional logo, used 2005\u20132006{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]] -->\n\nOn January 31, 2005, SBC announced that it would purchase [[AT&T Corporation]] for more than US$16&nbsp;billion.

The [[Bell Telephone Company]] was established in 1877 by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who obtained the first US patent for the telephone, and his father-in-law, [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]]. Bell and Hubbard also established [[AT&T (1885)|American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] in 1885, which acquired the Bell Telephone Company and became the primary telephone company in the United States. This company maintained a [[monopoly]] on telephone service in the United States until anti-trust regulators [[Bell System divestiture|split the company]] in 1982.\n\nAT&T Corporation was eventually purchased by one of its [[Regional Bell Operating Company]], the former Southwestern Bell Company, in 2005 and the combined company became known as [[AT&T]] Inc.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Bell System hires 1889 logo.PNG|100px|thumb|A [[Bell System]] logo (called the Blue Bell) used from 1889 to 1900.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]]\n[[File:Lines and Metallic Circuit Connections, American Telephone and Telegraph Co, March 1, 1891 edit.jpg|thumb|left|300px|AT&T's lines and metallic circuit connections. March 1, 1891.]]\n\nThe formation of the [[Bell Telephone Company]] superseded an agreement between [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and his financiers, principal among them [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]] and [[Thomas Sanders (U.S. businessman)|Thomas Sanders]]. Renamed the National Bell Telephone Company in March 1879, it became the American Bell Telephone Company in March 1880. By 1881, it had bought a controlling interest in the [[Western Electric]] Company from [[Western Union]]. Only three years earlier, Western Union had turned down Gardiner Hubbard's offer to sell it all rights to the telephone for $100,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1878}}}} in 2009 dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}).\n\nIn 1880, the management of American Bell created what would become AT&T Long Lines. The project was the first of its kind to create a nationwide long-distance network with a commercially viable cost-structure. This project was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company on March 3, 1885. Starting from [[New York City|New York]], the network reached [[Chicago]] in 1892.\n\nBell's [[patent]] on the telephone expired in 1893, but the company's much larger customer base made its service much more valuable than alternatives and substantial growth continued.\n\nOn December 30, 1899, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell; this was because [[Massachusetts]] corporate laws (which limited [[market capitalization]] to ten million dollars, preventing the direct growth of American Bell itself) were more restrictive than those of [[New York (state)|New York]], where AT&T was headquartered.<ref name=\"Brooks 1976, pg107\">Brooks 1976, p. 107.</ref> With this transfer of assets, AT&T became the parent of the [[Bell System]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1976, pg107\" />\n\nNational long-distance service reached [[San Francisco]] with the [[First transcontinental telephone call]] in 1915. This connection used a system of lines with [[loading coil]]s and the [[Audion]] vacuum tube repeater first tested between New York and Philadelphia in 1913.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ethw.org/First_Telephone_Repeater |title=First Telephone Repeater}}</ref>  Transatlantic services started in 1927 using two-way [[radio]], but the first [[Transatlantic telephone cable|trans-Atlantic]] [[submarine communications cable|telephone cable]] did not arrive until Sept. 25, 1956, with [[TAT-1]].\n\n== Monopoly ==\n{{further|Bell System}}\n[[File:Bell System hires 1969 logo blue.svg|thumb|right|100px|The Bell System [[logo]] and [[trademark]] as it appeared in 1972.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]]\n\nAs a result of a combination of regulatory actions by government and actions by AT&T, the firm eventually gained what most regard as [[monopoly]] status. In 1907, AT&T president [[Theodore Vail]] made it known that he was pursuing a goal of \"One Policy, One System, Universal Service.\" AT&T began purchasing competitors, which attracted the attention of [[antitrust]] regulators. To avoid antitrust action, in a deal with the government, Vail agreed to the [[Kingsbury Commitment]] of 1913. One of the three terms of the agreement forbade AT&T from acquiring any more independent phone companies without the approval of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].<ref>Brooks 1976, p. 136.</ref>\n\nG.W. Brock says in ''The Telecommunications Industry: The Dynamics Of Market Structure'', \"[The] provision allowed Bell and the independents to exchange telephones in order to give each other geographical monopolies. So long as only one company served a given geographical area there was little reason to expect price competition to take place.\"<ref>Brock 1981, p. 156.</ref> AT&T focused on purchasing companies within specific geographic areas that increased its effective control of the telephone system market, while selling its less-desirable and previously acquired companies to independent buyers. Also included in the Kingsbury Commitment was the requirement that AT&T allow competitors to connect through its phone lines, which reduced the incentive of these companies to build competing long-distance lines.\n\nIn 1913, after vacuum-tube inventor [[Lee de Forest]] began to suffer financial difficulties, AT&T bought De Forest's vacuum-tube patents for the bargain price of $50,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1913}}}} in 2009 dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}).  In particular, AT&T acquired ownership of the '{{lang|en|Audion}}', the first triode (three-element) [[vacuum tube]], which greatly amplified telephone signals.  The patent increased AT&T's control over the manufacture and distribution of long-distance telephone services, and allowed the Bell System to build the United States's first coast-to coast telephone line.  Thanks to the pressures of [[World War I]], AT&T and [[RCA]] owned all useful patents on vacuum tubes. RCA staked a position in wireless communication; AT&T pursued the use of tubes in telephone amplifiers. Some [[patent]] allies and partners in RCA were angered when the two companies' research on tubes began to overlap, and there were many patent disputes.\n\nAround 1917, the idea that everyone in the country should have phone service and that the government should promote that began being discussed in government. AT&T agreed, saying in a 1917 annual report: \"A combination of like activities under proper control and regulation, the service to the public would be better, more progressive, efficient, and economical than competitive systems.\" In 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid \"duplication.\" The claim was that telephone service was a \"[[natural monopoly]],\" meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\n\nAT&T, RCA, and their patent allies and partners finally settled their disputes in 1926 by compromise. AT&T decided to focus on the telephone business as a communications common carrier, and sold its broadcasting subsidiary [[Broadcasting Company of America]] to RCA. The assets included station [[WEAF (AM)|WEAF]], which for some time had broadcast from AT&T headquarters in New York City. In return, RCA signed a service agreement with AT&T, ensuring any radio network RCA started would have transmission connections provided by AT&T. Both companies agreed to cross-license patents, ending that aspect of the dispute. RCA, [[General Electric|GE]], and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] were now free to combine their assets to form the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]], or NBC network.\n\nIn 1925, AT&T created a new unit called Bell Telephone Laboratories, commonly known as [[Bell Labs]]. This [[research and development]] unit proved highly successful, pioneering, among other things, [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[photovoltaic cell]], the [[Unix]] [[operating system]], and the [[C programming language]]. AT&T ranked 13th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p. 619.</ref> In 1949, the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit aimed at forcing the divestiture of Western Electric, which was settled seven years later by AT&T's agreement to confine its products and services to common carrier telecommunications and license its patents to \"all interested parties.\" A key effect of this was to ban AT&T from selling computers despite its key role in electronics research and development. Nonetheless, technological innovation continued. For example, AT&T commissioned the first experimental communications [[satellite]], [[Telstar]] I in 1962.\n\n[[File:BellWesternElectricRotaryPhoneC.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Standard Western Electric [[Model 500 telephone]], rented (never sold) to U.S. telephone subscribers.]]\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AT&T logo 1969-1983.png|thumb|right|AT&T corporate logo (designed by [[Saul Bass]]), 1969\u20131983{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]] -->\n[[Public utility]] commissions in state and local [[jurisdiction]]s regulated the [[Bell System]] and all the other telephone companies. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulated all service across state lines. These commissions controlled the rates that companies could charge, and the specific services and equipment they could offer.\n\nAT&T increased its control of the telephone system through its leasing arrangements for telephones and telephone equipment made by its subsidiary, [[Western Electric]].  Like most telephones of the time in the United States, Western Electric-made phones were owned not by individual customers, but by local Bell System telephone companies \u2014 all of which were in turn owned by AT&T, which also owned Western Electric itself.  Each phone was leased from AT&T on a monthly basis by customers, who generally paid for their phone and its connection many times over in cumulative lease fees.  This monopoly made millions of extra dollars for AT&T, which had the secondary effect of greatly limiting phone choices and styles. AT&T strictly enforced policies against buying and using phones by other manufacturers that had not first been transferred to and re-rented from the local Bell monopoly. Many phones made by Western Electric thus carried the following disclaimer permanently molded into their housings: \"BELL SYSTEM PROPERTY \u2014 NOT FOR SALE.\" Telephones were also labeled with a sticker marking the Bell Operating Company that owned the telephone.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] allowed the [[Carterfone]] and other devices to be connected directly to the [[AT&T]] network, as long as they did not cause damage to the system. This ruling (13 F.C.C.2d 420) created the possibility of selling devices that could connect to the phone system and opened up the market to numerous products, including [[answering machine]]s, [[fax machine]]s, [[Cordless telephone|cordless phones]], computer [[modem]]s and the early, dialup [[Internet]].\n\nIn the 1980s, after some consumers began buying phones from other manufacturers anyway, AT&T changed its policy by selling customers the phone's housing, retaining ownership of the mechanical components \u2014 which still required paying AT&T a monthly leasing fee.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, AT&T subsidiary AT&T Long Lines thus enjoyed a near-total monopoly on long-distance telephone service in the United States. AT&T also controlled 22 [[Bell Operating Companies]] which provided [[local telephone service]] to most of the United States. While there were many \"independent telephone companies\", [[General Telephone and Electronics|General Telephone]] being the most significant, the [[Bell System]] was far larger than all the others, and widely considered a monopoly itself.\n\n=== Erosion of \"a natural monopoly\" ===\n\nFor many years, AT&T had been permitted to retain its monopoly status under the assumption that it was a [[natural monopoly]]. The first erosion to this monopoly occurred in 1956 where the ''[[Hush-A-Phone v. United States]]'' ruling allowed a third-party device to be attached to rented telephones owned by AT&T. This was followed by the 1968 [[Carterfone]] decision that allowed third-party equipment to be connected to the AT&T telephone network. The rise of cheap microwave communications equipment in the 1960s and 1970s opened a window of opportunity for competitors \u2014 no longer was the acquisition of expensive rights-of-way necessary for the construction of a long-distance telephone network. In light of this, the FCC permitted [[MCI Communications|MCI]] (Microwave Communications, Inc) to sell communication services to large businesses. This technical-economic argument against the necessity of AT&T's monopoly position would hold for a mere fifteen years until the beginning of the fiber-optics revolution sounded the end of microwave-based long distance.\n\n== Breakup ==\n{{further|Breakup of AT&T|Regional Bell Operating Company}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AT&T logo (1984).svg|125px|thumb|right|AT&T corporate logo, 1983\u20132005,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} designed by [[Saul Bass]]. It was nicknamed the \"Death Star\" due to its appearance's similarity to the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Death Star|space station of the same name]].]] -->\nThe rest of the telephone monopoly lasted until January 8, 1982, the date of settlement of ''[[United States v. AT&T]]'', a 1974 [[United States Department of Justice]] [[antitrust]] [[Bell System divestiture|suit against AT&T]]. Under the settlement AT&T (\"Ma Bell\") agreed to divest its local exchange service operating companies, in return for a chance to go into the computer business (see [[AT&T Computer Systems]]). AT&T's local operations were split into seven independent [[Regional Bell operating company|Regional Bell operating companies]], commonly known as \"[[Baby Bell]]s\".\n\nWith the American consumer's new ability to purchase phones outright, AT&T and the Bell System lost the considerable revenues earned from phone leasing by local Bell companies.  Forced to compete with other manufacturers for new phone sales, the aging Western Electric phone designs still marketed through AT&T failed to sell, and Western Electric eventually closed all of its U.S. phone manufacturing plants. AT&T, reduced in value by about 70%, continued to run all its long-distance services through [[AT&T Communications]] (the new name of AT&T Long Lines), although it lost some market share in the ensuing years to competitors [[MCI Communications|MCI]] and [[Sprint Nextel Corporation|Sprint]].\n\nA sign that hung in many Bell facilities in 1983 read:\n\n{{quote|There are two giant entities at work in our country, and they both have an amazing influence on our daily lives&nbsp;... one has given us radar, sonar, stereo, teletype, the transistor, hearing aids, artificial larynxes, talking movies, and the telephone.

After [[deregulation]] of the U.S. telecom industry via the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], NCR was divested again. At the same time, the majority of AT&T Technologies and the renowned [[Bell Labs]] was spun off as [[Lucent Technologies]]. The industry as a whole had many other reorganizations since the 1990s, both due to [[deregulation]] and because of technological advances reducing demand and [[pricing power]] in telecommunications.\n\nIn 1994, AT&T purchased the largest cellular carrier, [[McCaw Cellular]], for $11.5 billion and kick-started its cellular division with 2 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1994/211893.htm|title=Justice Department Files Antitrust Suit and Consent Decree in AT&T-McCaw Merger|date=1994-07-15|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004002550/http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1994/211893.htm|archivedate=2006-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/191742_attw21.html|title=The fall of AT&T Wireless|accessdate=|last=Richman|first=Dan|date=2004-09-21|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, AT&T purchased long-distance provider Alaska Communications System. FCC approval required the company be run as an AT&T subsidiary rather than a more likely absorption into [[AT&T Communications]], giving the company the [[AT&T Alascom]] name.\n\nIn 1997, AT&T hired former [[IBM]] executive [[C Michael Armstrong]] as its [[chief executive officer]]. Armstrong's vision was to change AT&T from a long-distance carrier into a global \"telecommunications [[supermarket]]\", eying Internet services for the [[Dot-com bubble|booming dot-com industry]].\n\nArmstrong's most prominent strategy was buying significant [[cable television]] assets. After acquiring John Malone's [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]] and [[Media One]] (gaining through the latter a 25% share of [[Time Warner Cable]]),{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} AT&T was the largest provider of [[cable television]] in the world.<ref name=\"NGen10\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: The Outsides|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=61}}</ref> It intended to use these assets to bridge the so-called \"[[last mile]]\" and break the Regional Bell Companies' access-monopoly of the consumer household for data and telephony services, but the wager was costly, substantially increasing the company's debt.  AT&T acquired TCI in a $48 billion all-stock transaction including the assumption of $16 billion of debt.

By mid-2001, customers were being directed to sign contracts with the parent companies, and [[Concert Communications Services]], as the venture was eventually known, was scrapped in October that year.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Att-logo.svg|thumb|right|125px|AT&T corporate logo, 1996\u20132005, was devised to simplify and eliminate multiple versions of the logo.]] -->\n\nIn 1999, AT&T acquired the [[Olivetti Research Laboratory|Olivetti & Oracle Research Lab]], from [[Olivetti]] and [[Oracle Corporation]]. In 2002, it closed down the research part of the lab.\n\nAlso in 1999, AT&T paid US$5 billion to purchase IBM's Global Network business, which became AT&T Global Network Services, LLC.  As part of the purchase agreement, IBM granted AT&T a five-year, US$5-billion contract to handle much of IBM's networking needs, and AT&T outsourced some of its applications processing and data management work to IBM.  IBM also committed to billing and installation for AT&T's long-distance customers in a 10-year deal valued at US$4 billion; and assumed management of AT&T's data processing centers.\n\nWith long-distance rates falling and the market for telecommunications services overall weakening, AT&T could not sustain the debt it had incurred in these ventures. Moreover, the cost of upgrading TCI's equipment to handle two-way communications proved far higher than pre-merger estimates. AT&T undertook a major reorganization in October 2000, moving its mobile phone and broadband units into separate companies, to allow each unit to raise capital independently.\n\n[[File:AT&T Comcast logo.svg|280px|thumb|left|The logo for AT&T Comcast, the original name for the AT&T Broadband/Comcast merger.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]]\nOn July 9, 2001, it spun off [[AT&T Wireless Services]] in what was then the world's largest [[initial public offering]] (IPO). Later that year it spun off [[AT&T Broadband]] and [[Liberty Media]], which comprised its [[cable television|cable TV]] assets. AT&T Broadband was subsequently acquired by [[Comcast]] in 2002, and AT&T Wireless merged with [[Cingular Wireless]] LLC in 2004. The merged wireless phone company operated as Cingular until 2007, when it became [[AT&T Mobility]].\n\nIn 2004, the U.S. government eliminated equal access regulations that allowed long-distance phone companies to access the networks owned by the regional Bell carriers at fixed rates. This ultimately caused AT&T to move away from the residential telephone business \u2014 declaring in the process that it would no longer market residential telephone service. Instead, its residential focus shifted to offering a voice service over a broadband Internet connection called [[AT&T CallVantage]].\n\n== Rise of SBC ==\n{{further|AT&T}}\nOne of the new companies formed by the breakup of AT&T was Southwestern Bell Corporation. This company grew continuously over the years until it acquired AT&T in 2005. After this acquisition, SBC took on AT&T's name and branding, and this is the company known as AT&T today.\n\n=== 1984\u20132001: Southwestern Bell Corporation ===\nAmerican Telephone and Telegraph Company officially transferred full ownership of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company to Southwestern Bell Corporation on January 1, 1984. It had three other subsidiaries: Southwestern Bell Publications, Inc., a directory publisher; Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc., in the business of mobile telephone service; and Southwestern Bell Telecommunications, Inc., focusing on marketing phone equipment to business customers. The holding company's new president was Zane Edison Barnes.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Southwestern Bell logo (1984).png|thumb|upright|Southwestern Bell Corporation logo, 1992\u20131995{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]] -->\nIn 1987, SBC bought [[Metromedia]] Inc.'s cellular and paging business. That, in turn, boosted the company to the third-largest cellular communications company in the United States, behind McCaw Cellular and [[Pacific Telesis]]. In January 1990, [[Ed Whitacre|Edward Whitacre]] took over as president of Southwestern Bell.<ref name=\"TIMWU\">[[Tim Wu|Wu, Tim]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=nlnpJl7lNKUC&printsec=frontcover ''The Master Switch''], New York : Random House, 2010.

It acquired two cable companies in [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] from Hauser Communications for $650 million, becoming the first regional Bell telephone company to acquire a cable company outside its service area. In 1994, it called off a $1.6&nbsp;billion acquisition attempt for 40% of [[Cox Communications|Cox Cable]] because of FCC rules on cable companies. SBC would later start selling its current cable company interests.\n\n=== 1995\u20132000: Changes to the company ===\n[[File:SBC Communications logo.svg|thumb|upright|SBC Communications logo, 2001\u20132005{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]]<!--Keep the logo there! A rationale was made for its use here!-->\nIn 1995 Southwestern Bell Corp. became SBC Communications. They then combined Southwestern Bell Telecom division (which made telephone equipment) into the company, due to new FCC rules.\n\nIn 1996, SBC announced it would acquire Pacific Telesis Group, a [[Regional Bell Operating Company]] (RBOC) in California and Nevada. 1997 brought rumors of a proposed merger between AT&T Corporation (the USA's largest long-distance provider) and SBC (the USA's largest local provider). The FCC disapproved of the merger, and it came to end. Later in 1997, SBC sold its last two cable companies, exiting the cable telecom field.\n\nIn January 1998, SBC announced it would take over the [[Southern New England Telephone Company]] (SNET) for $4.4&nbsp;billion in stock (the FCC would approve in October 1998). SBC also won a court judgment that would make it easier for RBOCs to enter the long-distance phone service, but it was being challenged by AT&T and the FCC. In May 1998, [[Ameritech]] and SBC announced a $62&nbsp;billion merger, in which SBC would take over Ameritech. After making several organizational changes (such as the sale of [[Ameritech Cellular|Ameritech Wireless]] to [[GTE]]) to satisfy state and federal regulators, the two merged on October 8, 1999. The FCC later fined SBC Communications $6&nbsp;million for failure to comply with agreements made in order to secure approval of the merger. SBC became the largest RBOC until the [[Bell Atlantic]] and GTE merger. 1998 revenues were $46&nbsp;billion, placing SBC among the top 15 companies in the [[Fortune 500]].<ref name=\"TIMWU\" />\n\nIn January 1999, SBC announced it would purchase Comcast Cellular, for $1.7&nbsp;billion, plus $1.3&nbsp;billion of debt. During 1999 SBC continued to prepare to be allowed to provide long-distance phone service. In February SBC acquired up to ten percent of Williams Companies' telecommunications division for about $500&nbsp;million, who were building a fiber optic network across the country and would carry SBC's future service. On November 1, 1999, SBC became a part of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (lasting through 2015).\n\n=== 2000\u20132005: One national brand, and acquisition of AT&T Corporation ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}\n\nIn 2002, SBC ended marketing its operating companies under different names, and simply opted to give its companies different [[doing business as]] names based on the state (a practice already in use by [[Ameritech]] since 1993), and it gave the holding companies it had purchased [[d/b/a]] names based on their general region.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lockup.svg|thumb|left|SBC-AT&T legacy transitional logo, used 2005\u20132006{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}]] -->\n\nOn January 31, 2005, SBC announced that it would purchase [[AT&T Corporation]] for more than US$16&nbsp;billion.

{"title_page": "OpenVX", "text_new": "{{Infobox software\n| name = OpenVX\n| logo = OpenVX logo.svg\n| logo size = 200px\n| author = \n| developer = [[Khronos Group]]\n| latest_release_version = 1.3\n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2019|10|22}}\n| programming_language = [[C (programming language)|C]]\n| operating_system = [[Cross-platform]]\n| platform = [[Cross-platform]]\n| genre = [[Application programming interface|API]]\n| license = \n| website = {{URL|https://www.khronos.org/openvx/}}\n}}\n\n'''OpenVX\u2122''' is an open, royalty-free standard for the cross-platform acceleration of [[computer vision]] applications. OpenVX is designed by the [[Khronos Group]] to enable performance and power-optimized computer vision processing, especially important in [[embedded]] and [[real-time]] use cases such as the face, body, and gesture tracking, smart video surveillance, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), object and scene reconstruction, augmented reality, visual inspection, robotics and more. It uses a [[connected graph]] representation of operations.\n\n==Overview==\nOpenVX specifies a higher [[Abstraction layer|level of abstraction]] for programming computer vision use cases than compute frameworks such as [[OpenCL]]. The high level makes the programming easy and the underlying execution will be efficient on different computing architectures. This is done while having a consistent and portable vision acceleration API.\n\nOpenVX is based on a connected graph of vision nodes that can execute the preferred chain of operations. It is possible to optimize the underlying implementation through various techniques, for example, acceleration on various [[Central processing unit|processing unit]]s or [[ASIC|dedicated hardware]]. This architecture facilitates applications programmed in OpenVX on different systems with different power and performance, including battery-sensitive, vision-enabled, [[Wearable Display|wearable display]]s.\n\nOpenVX is complementary to the open-source vision library [[OpenCV]]. OpenVX in some applications offers better-optimized graph management than OpenCV.\n\n==OpenVX Feature Sets==\nTo enable deployment flexibility while avoiding fragmentation, OpenVX 1.3 defines a number of feature sets that are targeted at common embedded use cases. Hardware vendors can include one or more complete feature sets in their implementations to meet the needs of their customers and be fully conformant. The flexibility of OpenVX enables deployment on a diverse range of accelerator architectures, and feature sets are expected to dramatically increase the breadth and diversity of available OpenVX implementations. The defined OpenVX 1.3 feature sets include:\n\n* Graph Infrastructure (baseline for other Feature Sets)\n* Default Vision\n* Enhanced Vision (functions introduced in OpenVX 1.2)\n* Neural Network Inferencing (including tensor objects)\n* NNEF Kernel import (including tensor objects)\n* Binary Images\n* Safety-Critical (reduced features to enable easier safety certification)\n\n==OpenVX: Vision Acceleration==\nOpenVX extends easily with reusable vision acceleration functions to every low-power domain. This provides a key advantage, promoting wide adoption, for OpenVX and for developers this delivers the following:\n\n* Royalty-free open standard API that is reliably accelerated by hardware vendors and tightly defined conformance tests.\n* Targeted at low-power, real-time applications including mobile and embedded platforms.\n* Portability across diverse heterogeneous processors, including ISPs, dedicated hardware, DSPs and DSP arrays, GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and more.\n* No requirement for a high-power CPU/GPU complex. A low-power host can set up and manage frame-rate vision processing pipelines.\n\n==OpenVX Graph==\nOpenVX allows graph-level processing optimizations, which lets implementations to fuse nodes when possible to achieve better overall performance. The graph also allows for auto graph-level memory optimizations to achieve a low memory footprint.

OpenVX is designed by the [[Khronos Group]] to enable performance and power-optimized computer vision processing, especially important in [[embedded]] and [[real-time]] use cases such as the face, body, and gesture tracking, smart video surveillance, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), object and scene reconstruction, augmented reality, visual inspection, robotics and more. It uses a [[connected graph]] representation of operations.\n\n==Overview==\nOpenVX specifies a higher [[Abstraction layer|level of abstraction]] for programming computer vision use cases than compute frameworks such as [[OpenCL]]. The high level makes the programming easy and the underlying execution will be efficient on different computing architectures. This is done while having a consistent and portable vision acceleration API.\n\nOpenVX is based on a connected graph of vision nodes that can execute the preferred chain of operations. It is possible to optimize the underlying implementation through various techniques, for example, acceleration on various [[Central processing unit|processing unit]]s or [[ASIC|dedicated hardware]]. This architecture facilitates applications programmed in OpenVX on different systems with different power and performance, including battery-sensitive, vision-enabled, [[Wearable Display|wearable display]]s.\n\nOpenVX is complementary to the open-source vision library [[OpenCV]]. OpenVX in some applications offers better-optimized graph management than OpenCV.\n\n==OpenVX Feature Sets==\nTo enable deployment flexibility while avoiding fragmentation, OpenVX 1.3 defines a number of feature sets that are targeted at common embedded use cases. Hardware vendors can include one or more complete feature sets in their implementations to meet the needs of their customers and be fully conformant. The flexibility of OpenVX enables deployment on a diverse range of accelerator architectures, and feature sets are expected to dramatically increase the breadth and diversity of available OpenVX implementations. The defined OpenVX 1.3 feature sets include:\n\n* Graph Infrastructure (baseline for other Feature Sets)\n* Default Vision\n* Enhanced Vision (functions introduced in OpenVX 1.2)\n* Neural Network Inferencing (including tensor objects)\n* NNEF Kernel import (including tensor objects)\n* Binary Images\n* Safety-Critical (reduced features to enable easier safety certification)\n\n==OpenVX: Vision Acceleration==\nOpenVX extends easily with reusable vision acceleration functions to every low-power domain. This provides a key advantage, promoting wide adoption, for OpenVX and for developers this delivers the following:\n\n* Royalty-free open standard API that is reliably accelerated by hardware vendors and tightly defined conformance tests.\n* Targeted at low-power, real-time applications including mobile and embedded platforms.\n* Portability across diverse heterogeneous processors, including ISPs, dedicated hardware, DSPs and DSP arrays, GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and more.\n* No requirement for a high-power CPU/GPU complex. A low-power host can set up and manage frame-rate vision processing pipelines.\n\n==OpenVX Graph==\nOpenVX allows graph-level processing optimizations, which lets implementations to fuse nodes when possible to achieve better overall performance. The graph also allows for auto graph-level memory optimizations to achieve a low memory footprint. OpenVX graph-optimized workloads can be deployed on a wide range of computer hardware, including small embedded CPUs, ASICs, APUs, discrete GPUs, and heterogeneous servers.\n\n* OpenVX developers express a graph of image operations, called \u2018nodes,\u2019 which can be on any hardware or processor coded in any language.\n* OpenVX Graphs enable implementations to optimize power and performance. Nodes may be fused by the implementation to eliminate memory transfers, and processing can be tiled to keep data entirely in local memory/cache.\n* Host interaction is minimized by the OpenVX Graph during frame-rate graph execution. The host processor can set up a graph which can then execute almost autonomously.\n\n==History==\n* OpenVX 1.0 specification was released in October 2014. \n* OpenVX sample implementation was released in December 2014.\n* OpenVX 1.1 specification was released on May 2, 2016.\n* OpenVX 1.2 was released on May 1, 2017.<ref>https://www.khronos.org/news/press/openvx-1.2-specification-cross-platform-acceleration-power-efficient-vision</ref>\n* Updated OpenVX adopters program and OpenVX 1.2 conformance test suite was released on November 21, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-updated-openvx-adopters-program|title=Khronos Releases Updated OpenVX Adopters Program|date=2017-11-21|work=The Khronos Group|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}</ref>\n*OpenVX 1.2.1 was released on November 27, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenVX/|title=Khronos OpenVX Registry - The Khronos Group Inc|website=www.khronos.org|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>\n*OpenVX 1.3 was released on October 22, 2019.<ref>https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-openvx-1.3-open-standard-for-cross-platform-vision-and-machine-intelligence-acceleration</ref>\n\n== Implementations, frameworks and libraries ==\n\n* [http://gpuopen.com/compute-product/amd-openvx/ AMD OpenVX (AMDOVX)] - for [[AMD]]'s [[Amd cpus|CPUs]] and [[AMD GPUs|GPUs]].\n* [https://ip.cadence.com/vision Cadence] - for [[Cadence Design Systems]]'s Tensilica Vision DSPs.\n* [https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/01/06/799884/0/en/PowerVR-GPUs-From-Imagination-Pass-OpenVX-Conformance-With-Khronos.html Imagination] - for [[Imagination Technologies]]'s PowerVR GPUs\n* [https://www.synopsys.com/dw/ipdir.php?ds=ev6x-vision-processors Synopsys] - for [[Synopsys]]' DesignWare EV Vision Processors\n* [https://www.ti.com/processors/automotive-processors/tdax-adas-socs/design-development.html Texas Instruments\u2019 OpenVX (TIOVX)] - for [[Texas Instruments]]\u2019 Jacinto\u2122 ADAS SoCs.\n* [https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/visionworks NVIDIA VisionWorks] - for [[CUDA|CUDA-capable]] [[Nvidia]] [[Nvidia gpus|GPUs]] and [[Tegra|SoCs]].\n\n* [https://gpuopen-professionalcompute-libraries.github.io/MIVisionX/ MIVisionX] - for [[AMD]]'s [[Amd cpus|CPUs]] and [[AMD GPUs|GPUs]].\n* [https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit OpenVINO] - for [[Intel]]'s [[List of Intel microprocessors|CPUs]], [[List of Intel graphics processing units|GPUs]], [[Intel VPUs|VPUs]], and [[Intel FPGAs|FPGAs]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.khronos.org/openvx/|name=Official website for OpenVX}}\n* [https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenVX/ OpenVX Specification Registry]\n* [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenVX-sample-impl OpenVX Sample Implementation]\n* [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/openvx-samples OpenVX Sample Applications]\n* [https://github.com/rgiduthuri/openvx_tutorial OpenVX Tutorial Material]\n\n{{Khronos Group standards}}\n\n[[Category:Application programming interfaces]]\n[[Category:Cross-platform software]]\n", "name_user": "Kiritigowda", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updates - AMD MIVisionX", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVX"}
