The cars were also referred to as '''\"World's Fair\" cars''', or '''R36WFs''' (R36 '''W'''orld's '''F'''air), and featured three-piece curved \"picture\" windows, unlike other [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] cars at the time.  While in regular service, five two-car consists of these cars were coupled to one single [[R33 World's Fair (New York City Subway car)|R33S]] car to make 11-car trains for the 7 and <7> routes.\n\nCars 9524-9557 were purchased for service on all other IRT routes. The cars were also referred to as '''\"Main Line\" cars''', or '''R36MLs''' (R36 '''M'''ain '''L'''ine) to distinguish them from the \"World's Fair\" cars. They were built from unfinished car body shells of the R33 order and therefore featured sported drop-sash side windows.\n\nThough all cars were originally delivered without air conditioning, all cars in this series received air conditioning as part of a retrofitting program in the earlier half of the 1980s.\n\nAlthough the R36s were later referred to as [[Redbird trains|Redbirds]], the cars were originally painted in different schemes when they were delivered. The \"World's Fair\" cars were painted in a light blue [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]] \"Bluebird\" scheme, while the \"main line\" cars were painted bright red like the R33s. These color schemes were used until 1977, when the cars were painted in the silver/blue MTA livery. Then they were painted in a full white (roof, bonnets, sides were all painted white) \"anti-graffiti\" scheme from 1981 to 1982 to combat [[graffiti]]; since the white paint was a Teflon-based paint, the graffiti did not stick to it very well. The look was abandoned for the famous \"Redbird\" style, which was applied onto the cars when they were rebuilt.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nIn 1962, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (NYCTA) ordered 430 cars for the {{NYCS|7}} train. This route would run to the World's Fair grounds in [[Flushing Meadows-Corona Park|Flushing Meadows]] in [[Queens]]. The first 40 cars were singles ([[R33 World's Fair (New York City Subway car)|R33S]]), with the rest being R36 cars; single cars were needed since the {{NYCS|7}} service runs 11-car trains, and R36 cars were built only in pairs. \n\nThe first R36 cars (\"World's Fair\" cars 9558\u20139561) arrived in fall 1963, shortly after the R33S cars began arriving in September that year. The first train of R33S and \"World's Fair\" R36 cars was placed in service on the {{NYCS|7}} route on October 24, 1963. With the fair opening approaching on April 12, 1964, \"World's Fair\" R36 cars were built and delivered in larger quantities that fall. More \"World's Fair\" cars arrived throughout 1964, enough to displace the [[R12 (New York City Subway car)|R12s]], [[R14 (New York City Subway car)|R14s]] and [[R15 (New York City Subway car)|R15s]] from the {{NYCS|7}} train by the close of 1964.\n\nThe \"Main Line\" R36s entered service on the '''{{NYCS|4}}''' almost a year later, on July 24, 1964. The cars ran on the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] main lines ([[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line|Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue]] and [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line|Lexington Avenue]]) - mainly on the '''{{NYCS|1}}''' and '''{{NYCS|3}}''' - until their overhauls.\n\n===Rebuilding===\nBy 1982, all cars had received air conditioning as part of a retrofitting program to replace the cars' original Axiflow ceiling fans.\n\nThe \"World's Fair\" R36s were the first cars to be rebuilt in the NYCTA's [[General Overhaul Program]] (GOH) in the 1980s. This program improved car life by rebuilding older cars and keeping other cars in a state of good repair. A trial rebuild program was done on selected Westinghouse R36 cars in 1981-83. Beginning in late 1984, the other R36 cars were rebuilt at rate of 200 cars per year, with the majority of them done in-house at the [[Coney Island Complex|Coney Island Shop]]. Others were rebuilt by [[General Electric]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and by [[Amtrak]] at its [[Beech Grove Shops|Beech Grove, Indiana]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]] shops. The last remaining cars were sent out for rebuild in late 1985, and by 1986, all cars were back in service.\n\nAfter rebuilding, the R36 cars were repainted in a scheme involving a deep maroon red body, black front bonnets and [[anti-climber]]s, and a silver roof prior to returning to service. At first, the scheme was known as \"Silver Fox,\" \"Broad Street Red,\"  or \"Gunn Red\" (after [[David L. Gunn|NYCT chief David L. Gunn]]) and was a graffiti-resistant red. By 1989, the Gunn Red would evolve into the \"Redbird\" scheme best known to many New Yorkers, with beige interiors, red exterior paint and interior doors and black and silver exterior trim along the car windows, roof, and undersides. In 1999, the R36 cars were the most reliable in the NYCT fleet, with a Mean Distance Between Failure (MDBF) rate of 194,150 miles, despite being 35 years old at the time. While in decent shape mechanically, rust holes and carbody corrosion were beginning to form in the sides of most of the cars.\n\nFrom the 1990s until mid-2001, \"World's Fair\" cars 9478\u20139523 usually ran on the {{NYCS|6}} train based at [[Westchester Yard]] in the Bronx. Previously, some Westinghouse-equipped cars had been assigned to the {{NYCS|1}} and {{NYCS|3}} trains in the 1970s. The \"Main Line\" cars usually ran on the '''{{NYCS|7}}''' from 1984 to 1988, and were transferred to the '''{{NYCS|6}}''' from 1988 to 2001, when they were returned to the 7. During this time, some cars also provided occasional service on the '''4''' route, which occasionally uses equipment borrowed from the '''6'''.\n\n===Retirement===\nIn 1996, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] announced their plans to phase out the [[Redbird trains|Redbirds]] with the [[R142 (New York City Subway car)|R142]] and [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142A]] fleets.\n\nWith the arrival of the R142As on the '''6''', the \"Main Line\" R36s were transferred over to the '''7'''. While the Redbirds on the IRT Main Line were retired starting in early 2001, the {{NYCS|7}} service was still provided by [[R33S (New York City Subway car)|R33S]] cars and R36s. In January 2002, a set of [[R62A (New York City Subway car)|R62As]] arrived from the IRT mainline. As more R142s and R142As were delivered, R62As were gradually transferred from the {{NYCS|3}} and {{NYCS|6}} to the {{NYCS|7}}, in turn replacing the R33S cars and R36s. The last \"Main Line\" R36 pair, 9542-9543, ran on the '''7''' until its retirement in August 2003. The last train of \"World's Fair\" R36s, consisting of pairs 9564\u20139565, 9616\u20139617, 9582\u20139583, 9584\u20139585, and 9586\u20139587 finally ran along the {{NYCS|7}} on November 3, 2003 with R33S car 9309, marking the end of the Redbird cars and non-stainless steel cars in the subway.\n\nMost of the Redbirds (1,294) were stripped and then [[Redbird Reef|submerged off the coast]] of [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Virginia]] as artificial barrier and diving [[artificial reef|reef]]s, by [[Weeks Marine]].

The cars were initially displayed at the transit museum, and finally participated on their first fan trip on June 8, 2014 on the 7 route, as part of the ''[[Train of Many Colors]].''\n\n\"World's Fair\" pair 9582\u20139583 also remains on MTA property. They were transferred to the [[Unionport Yard]], along with pairs 9584\u20139585, and 9586\u20139587. However, these cars ended up being stored due to structural issues and are now awaiting scrapping.\n\nIn addition to these cars, other cars were also stored around the system. \"World's Fair\" pair 9400-9401 was stored at the Corona Yard for preservation; however, the cars were never used and were scrapped on October 7, 2013. \"World's Fair\" pair 9564\u20139565 was set aside and transferred to [[Coney Island Yard]] in December 2004; car 9564 was planned to be repurposed into a visitor center at [[Queens Borough Hall]] in [[Kew Gardens, Queens]], and the car 9565 was planned to be preserved in a museum in [[West Babylon, New York]]. However, R33 9075 was used at Queens Borough hall instead of 9564, and 9565 never made it to the proposed museum; the cars were subsequently reefed in 2008. \"World's Fair\" pair 9588\u20139589 was stored at the [[Concourse Yard]] until 2008, when the pair was reefed.\n\n== In culture ==\nEight WH-powered \"World's Fair\" cars (9356\u201357, 9360\u201361, 9394\u201395, 9412\u201313) and two GE-powered cars (9712\u201313), in addition to one R33S (9327), were wrapped and painted in [[New York Mets]] colors on October 24, 2000 prior to Game 3 of the [[2000 World Series]] between the Yankees and Mets.\n\nIn addition, the \"World's Fair\" cars have made cameo roles in various TV shows and movies. [[Nicolas Cage]] rides a 7 train of \"World's Fair\" R36s in ''[[It Could Happen to You (1994 film)|It Could Happen to You]]'' (1994).

The so-called \"whiskey tax\" was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. Beer was difficult to transport and spoiled more easily than rum and whiskey. But the 1783 British Orders-in-Council had diminished rum distillation in the United States and, for factors described below, whiskey distribution and consumption had increased after the Revolutionary War (aggregate production had not outpaced rum by 1791). The \"whiskey tax\" became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War. The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but [[American whiskey]] a so the excise became widely known as a \"whiskey tax\". Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented [[mash ingredients|grain mixtures]] to make whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the [[American Revolution]], in particular against [[taxation without representation|taxation without local representation]], while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.\n\nThroughout Western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used violence and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance came to a climax in July 1794, when a U.S. marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector [[John Neville (general)|General John Neville]]. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania to negotiate with the rebels, while at the same time calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most distillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be all but impossible to tax\u2014in the next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law.<ref>Rorabaugh, W.J. ''The Alcoholic Republic: An American Tradition'', 1979. Oxford University Press, 53.</ref> Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts.<ref>Howlett, Leon. ''The Kentucky Bourbon Experience: A Visual Tour of Kentucky's Bourbon Distilleries'', 2012, 7.</ref>\n\nThe Whiskey Rebellion demonstrated that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect. The events contributed to the formation of political parties in the United States, a process already under way. The whiskey tax was repealed in the early 1800s during the [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson administration]]. Historian [[Carol Berkin]] argues that the episode in the long run strengthened American nationalism because the people appreciated how well Washington handled the rebels without resorting to tyranny.<ref>Carol Berkin, ''A Sovereign People: The Crises of the 1790s and the Birth of American Nationalism'' (2017) pp. 7\u201380.</ref>\n\n== Whiskey tax ==\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]] in a 1792 portrait by [[John Trumbull]]]]\n\nA new U.S. federal government began operating in 1789, following the ratification of the United States Constitution. The previous central government under the [[Articles of Confederation]] had been unable to levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolutionary War, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt.<ref>Chernow, 297.</ref> Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]] sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his ''[[Report on Public Credit]]'', he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the federal government. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.<ref>Chernow, 327\u201330.</ref>\n[[File:Whiskey Rebellion Flag.svg|thumb|Flag Used by some Protestors]]\nA source of government revenue was needed to pay the respectable amount due to the previous bondholders to whom the debt was owed. By December 1790, Hamilton believed that import duties, which were the government's primary source of revenue, had been raised as high as feasible.<ref>Chernow, 341.</ref> He therefore promoted passage of an excise tax on domestically produced distilled spirits. This was to be the first tax levied by the national government on a domestic product.<ref>Hogeland, 27.</ref> The transportation costs per gallon were higher for farmers removed from eastern urban centers, so the per-gallon profit was reduced disproportionately by the per-gallon tax on distillation of domestic alcohol such as whiskey. The excise became known as the \"whiskey tax.\" Taxes were politically unpopular,<!--- unlike today?? ---> and Hamilton believed that the whiskey excise was a luxury tax and would be the least objectionable tax that the government could levy.<ref>Chernow, 342\u201343; Hogeland, 63.</ref> In this, he had the support of some social reformers, who hoped that a \"[[sin tax]]\" would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol.<ref>Slaughter, 100.</ref> The whiskey excise act, sometimes known as the \"Whiskey Act\", became law in March 1791.<ref>Slaughter, 105; Hogeland, 64.</ref> George Washington defined the revenue districts, appointed the revenue supervisors and inspectors, and set their pay in November 1791.<ref>American State Papers [Finance: Volume 1], 110</ref>\n\n== Western grievances ==\nThe population of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790.<ref>{{cite web | title = ExplorePAHistory.com&nbsp;\u2013 Stories from PA History | url = http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=1-9-16&chapter=3 | accessdate = 2017-02-11  }}</ref> Among the farmers in the region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners.<ref>Slaughter, 97.</ref> Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small [[still]]s.<ref>Hogeland, 66.</ref> Farmers living west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers.<ref>Hogeland, 68.</ref> Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.<ref>Hogeland, 67; Holt, 30.</ref>\n\nSmall-scale farmers also protested that Hamilton's excise effectively gave unfair tax breaks to large distillers, most of whom were based in the east. There were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat fee or paying by the gallon. Large distillers produced whiskey in volume and could afford the flat fee. The more efficient they became, the less tax per gallon they would pay (as low as 6&nbsp;cents, according to Hamilton). Western farmers who owned small stills did not usually operate them year-round at full capacity, so they ended up paying a higher tax per gallon (9&nbsp;cents), which made them less competitive.<ref>Slaughter, 147\u201349; Hogeland, 68\u201370.</ref> The [[regressive taxation|regressive]] nature of the tax was further compounded by an additional factor: whiskey sold for considerably less on the cash-poor Western frontier than in the wealthier and more populous East. This meant that, even if all distillers had been required to pay the same amount of tax per gallon, the small-scale frontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion of their product's value than larger Eastern distillers. Small-scale distillers believed that Hamilton deliberately designed the tax to ruin them and promote big business, a view endorsed by some historians.<ref>Hogeland, 68\u201369; Holt, 30.</ref> However, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that a \"conspiracy of this sort is difficult to document\".<ref>Slaughter, 148.</ref> Whether by design or not, large distillers recognized the advantage that the excise gave them and they supported it.<ref>Slaughter, 148; Hogeland, 69.</ref>\n\nOther aspects of the excise law also caused concern. The law required all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 miles away from the small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.<ref name = Hoover />\n\nIn addition to the whiskey tax, westerners had a number of other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier.<ref name = Hoover /> The [[Northwest Indian War]] was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.<ref>Slaughter, 108.</ref>\n\n== Resistance ==\nMany residents of the western frontier petitioned against passage of the whiskey excise. When that failed, some western Pennsylvanians organized extralegal conventions to advocate repeal of the law.<ref>Slaughter, 110.</ref> Opposition to the tax was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties: [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]], [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette]], [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington]], and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]].<ref>Slaughter, 206.</ref> A preliminary meeting held on July 27, 1791 at [[Redstone Old Fort]] in Fayette County called for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly, which convened in Pittsburgh in early September 1791. The Pittsburgh convention was dominated by moderates such as [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]], who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence.<ref>Hogeland, 23\u201325; Slaughter, 113.</ref> The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S. House of Representatives, both located in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>Hogeland, 24.</ref> As a result of this and other petitions, the excise law was modified in May 1792. Changes included a 1-cent reduction in the tax that was advocated by [[William Findley]], a congressman from western Pennsylvania, but the new excise law was still unsatisfactory to many westerners.<ref>Hogeland, 114\u201315.</ref>\n\n[[File:Whiskey Insurrection.JPG|thumb|300px|left|\"Famous Whiskey Insurrection in Pennsylvania\", an 1880 illustration of a [[tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]] tax collector being made to [[Riding a rail|ride the rail]]]]\n\nAppeals to nonviolent resistance were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, a recently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was [[tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]] by a disguised gang in Washington County.<ref>Slaughter, 113. Hogeland dates the attack on Johnson to September 7, the night before the Pittsburgh convention; Hogeland, 24.</ref> A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered.<ref>Hogeland, 103\u201304.</ref> Because of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792.<ref>Slaughter, 114.</ref> The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the [[American Revolution]]. Supporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between [[taxation without representation]] in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.<ref>Slaughter, 103.</ref>\n\nOlder accounts of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in [[Appalachia]] (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia).<ref name=\"Tachau\">Mary K. Bonsteel Tachau, \"A New Look at the Whiskey Rebellion\", in Boyd, ''The Whiskey Rebellion: Past and Present Perspectives'', 97\u2013118.</ref> The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where no one could be convinced to enforce the law or prosecute evaders.<ref>Slaughter, 117.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1-4905-7274-1|pages=77\u201378}}</ref> In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General [[Edmund Randolph]] argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.<ref>Slaughter, 119; Hogeland, 124.</ref>\n\nIn August 1792, a second convention was held in Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley were not in attendance. Future [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Albert Gallatin]] was one moderate who did attend, to his later regret.<ref>Hogeland, 122\u201323.</ref> A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As some of them had done in the American Revolution, they raised [[liberty pole]]s, formed [[committee of correspondence|committees of correspondence]], and took control of the local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.<ref>Hogeland, 117\u201319; 122\u201323.</ref>\n\nHamilton regarded the second Pittsburgh convention as a serious threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official [[George Clymer]] to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration.<ref>Slaughter, 125\u201327.</ref> Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadsheet and printed in many newspapers.<ref>Slaughter, 119\u201323.</ref>\n\nFederal tax inspector for western Pennsylvania [[John Neville (general)|General John Neville]] was determined to enforce the excise law.<ref>Slaughter, 151\u201353.</ref> He was a prominent politician and wealthy planter\u2014and also a large-scale distiller. He had initially opposed the whiskey tax, but subsequently changed his mind, a reversal that angered some western Pennsylvanians.<ref>Hogeland, 97, 102.</ref> In August 1792, Neville rented a room in Pittsburgh for his tax office, but the landlord turned him out after being threatened with violence by the Mingo Creek Association.<ref>Hogeland, 119\u201324.</ref> From this point on, tax collectors were not the only people targeted in Pennsylvania; those who cooperated with federal tax officials also faced harassment. Anonymous notes and newspaper articles signed by \"Tom the [[wikt:tinker|Tinker]]\" threatened those who complied with the whiskey tax.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1-4905-7274-1|page=72}}</ref> Those who failed to heed the warnings might have their barns burned or their stills destroyed.<ref>Hogeland, 130\u201331.</ref>\n\nResistance to the excise tax continued through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Slaughter151\">Slaughter, 151.</ref> In June, Neville was [[burned in effigy]] by a crowd of about 100 people in Washington County.<ref>Slaughter, 150.</ref> On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region.<ref>Slaughter, 153.</ref> At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission.<ref name=\"Slaughter151\" /> President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.<ref>Slaughter, 165.</ref>\n\n== Insurrection ==\n[[File:William Findley.jpg|thumb|In his 1796 book, Congressman [[William Findley]] argued that Alexander Hamilton had deliberately provoked the Whiskey Rebellion.]]\n\nThe resistance came to a climax in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney [[William Rawle]] issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax.<ref>Slaughter, 177; Cooke, 328.</ref> Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means.<ref>Hogeland, 142.</ref> At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials to be held in local state courts.<ref>Slaughter, 170.</ref> But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General [[William Bradford (Attorney General)|William Bradford]] later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.<ref>Slaughter, 182.</ref>\n\nThe timing of these events later proved to be controversial. Findley was a bitter political foe of Hamilton, and he maintained in his book on the insurrection that the treasury secretary had deliberately provoked the uprising by issuing the subpoenas just before the law was made less onerous.<ref>Cooke, 321.</ref> In 1963, historian Jacob Cooke, an editor of Hamilton's papers, regarded this charge as \"preposterous\", calling it a \"conspiracy thesis\" that overstated Hamilton's control of the federal government.<ref>Cooke, 321\u201322.</ref> In 1986, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that the outbreak of the insurrection at this moment was due to \"a string of ironic coincidences\", although \"the question about motives must always remain\".<ref>Slaughter, 183.</ref> In 2006, William Hogeland argued that Hamilton, Bradford, and Rawle intentionally pursued a course of action that would provoke \"the kind of violence that would justify federal military suppression\".<ref>Hogeland, 124.</ref> According to Hogeland, Hamilton had been working towards this moment since the [[Newburgh Crisis]] in 1783, where he conceived of using military force to crush popular resistance to direct taxation for the purpose of promoting national unity and enriching the creditor class at the expense of common taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hogeland|first1=William|title=Why the Whiskey Rebellion Is Worth Recalling Now|url=http://hnn.us/articles/27341.html|website=History News Network|accessdate=February 11, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810021314/http://hnn.us/articles/27341.html|archivedate=August 10, 2010|url-status=live|date=July 3, 2006}}</ref> Historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison|S.

Their force had swelled to nearly 600 men, now commanded by Major James McFarlane, a veteran of the Revolutionary War.<ref>Hogeland, 150\u201351.</ref> Neville had also received reinforcements: 10 U.S. Army soldiers from Pittsburgh under the command of Major Abraham Kirkpatrick, Neville's brother-in-law.<ref>Slaughter, 179; Hogeland, 152.</ref> Before the rebel force arrived, Kirkpatrick had Neville leave the house and hide in a nearby ravine. David Lenox and General Neville's son [[Presley Neville]] also returned to the area, though they could not get into the house and were captured by the rebels.<ref>Hogeland, 153.</ref>\n\nFollowing some fruitless negotiations, the women and children were allowed to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered.<ref>Hogeland, 153\u201354; Slaughter, 3, 179\u201380.</ref> The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight.<ref>Slaughter, 180.</ref> The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away.

Radical leaders emerged, such as [[David Bradford (lawyer)|David Bradford]], urging violent resistance. On July 26, a group headed by Bradford robbed the U.S. mail as it left Pittsburgh, hoping to discover who in that town opposed them and finding several letters that condemned the rebels.

The furor over the whiskey excise had unleashed anger about other economic grievances. By this time, the victims of violence were often wealthy property owners who had no connection to the whiskey tax.<ref>Slaughter, 186\u201387.</ref> Some of the most radical protesters wanted to march on Pittsburgh, which they called \"[[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]\", loot the homes of the wealthy, and then burn the town to the ground.<ref>Slaughter, 187.</ref> Others wanted to attack [[Fort Fayette]]. There was praise for the [[French Revolution]] and calls for bringing the guillotine to America. David Bradford, it was said, was comparing himself to [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], a leader of the French [[Reign of Terror]].<ref>Slaughter, 188\u201389; Hogeland, 169.</ref>\n\nAt Braddock's Field, there was talk of declaring independence from the United States and of joining with Spain or Great Britain. Radicals flew a specially designed flag that proclaimed their independence. The flag had six stripes, one for each county represented at the gathering: the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny, [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford]], Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland, and Virginia's [[Ohio County, West Virginia|Ohio County]].<ref>Holt, 10.

He did not want to alienate public opinion, so he asked his cabinet for written opinions about how to deal with the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State [[Edmund Randolph]] who urged reconciliation.<ref>Elkins & McKitrick, 479.</ref> Washington did both: he sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. Washington privately doubted that the commissioners could accomplish anything, and believed that a military expedition would be needed to suppress further violence.<ref>Slaughter, 197\u201399.</ref> For this reason, historians have sometimes charged that the peace commission was sent only for the sake of appearances, and that the use of force was never in doubt.<ref>Slaughter, 199; Holt, 11.</ref> Historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick argued that the military expedition was \"itself a part of the reconciliation process\", since a show of overwhelming force would make further violence less likely.<ref>Elkins & McKitrick, 481.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Hamilton began publishing essays under the name of \"Tully\" in Philadelphia newspapers, denouncing mob violence in western Pennsylvania and advocating military action. [[Democratic-Republican Societies]] had been formed throughout the country, and Washington and Hamilton believed that they were the source of civic unrest. \"Historians are not yet agreed on the exact role of the societies\" in the Whiskey Rebellion, wrote historian Mark Spencer in 2003, \"but there was a degree of overlap between society membership and the Whiskey Rebels\".<ref>Mark G. Spencer, \"Democratic-Republican Societies\", in Peter Knight, ed., ''Conspiracy Theories in American History'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO Press, 2003), 1:221.</ref>\n\nBefore troops could be raised, the [[Militia Act of 1792]] required a justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] to certify that law enforcement was beyond the control of local authorities. On August 4, 1794, Justice [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] delivered his opinion that western Pennsylvania was in a state of rebellion.<ref>Slaughter, 192\u201393, 196; Elkins & McKitrick, 479.</ref> On August 7, Washington issued a presidential proclamation announcing, with \"the deepest regret\", that the militia would be called out to suppress the rebellion. He commanded insurgents in western Pennsylvania to disperse by September 1.<ref>Slaughter, 196.</ref>\n\n==== Negotiations ====\nIn early August 1794, Washington dispatched three commissioners to the west, all of them Pennsylvanians: Attorney General [[William Bradford (Attorney General)|William Bradford]], Justice [[Jasper Yeates]] of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and Senator [[James Ross (Pennsylvania congressman)|James Ross]]. Beginning on August 21, the commissioners met with a committee of westerners that included Brackenridge and Gallatin. The government commissioners told the committee that it must unanimously agree to renounce violence and submit to U.S. laws and that a popular referendum must be held to determine if the local people supported the decision. Those who agreed to these terms would be given amnesty from further prosecution.<ref>Slaughter, 199\u2013200; Hogeland, 199.</ref>\n\nThe committee was divided between radicals and moderates, and narrowly passed a resolution agreeing to submit to the government's terms. The popular referendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated.<ref name=\"Slaughter203\">Slaughter, 203.</ref> On September 24, 1794, Washington received a recommendation from the commissioners that in their judgment, \"(it was) ... necessary that the civil authority should be aided by a military force in order to secure a due execution of the laws...\"<ref name=\"Wash1976\">{{cite book|last1=Washington|first1=G.|last2=Jackson|first2=D.|last3=Twohig|first3=D.|year=1976|title=The diaries of George Washington|location=Charlottesville|publisher=University Press of Virginia|url=https://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/644873705?page=frame&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%3Fid%3DkigTAQAAMAAJ%26checksum%3Dba5f03da41c8eb81c13f065ffff48b64&title=&linktype=digitalObject&detail=|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> On September 25, Washington issued a proclamation summoning the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia militias into service and warned that anyone who aided the insurgents did so at their own peril.<ref name=\"Wash1976\" /><ref>Hogeland, 205\u201306.</ref> The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and [[David Redick]] to meet with Washington and to halt the progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing that violence was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.<ref name=\"Slaughter203\" />\n\n==== Militia expedition ====\nUnder the authority of the recently passed federal militia law, the state militias were called up by the governors of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The federalized militia force of 12,950 men was a large army by American standards of the time, comparable to Washington's armies during the Revolution.<ref>Chernow, 475\u201376; Hogeland, 189.</ref> Relatively few men volunteered for militia service, so a draft was used to fill out the ranks.  Draft evasion was widespread, and conscription efforts resulted in protests and riots, even in eastern areas. Three counties in eastern Virginia were the scenes of armed draft resistance. In Maryland, Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] sent 800 men to quash an anti-draft riot in [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]]; about 150 people were arrested.<ref>Slaughter, 210\u201314.</ref>\n\n[[File:AlbertGallatin.jpeg|thumb|Photo of [[Albert Gallatin]], who spoke publicly to rebel groups about the need for moderation]]\n\n[[Liberty pole]]s were raised in various places as the militia was recruited, worrying federal officials.

Two civilians were killed in these operations. On September 29, an unarmed boy was shot by an officer whose pistol accidentally fired. Two days later, an \"Itinerant Person\" was \"Bayoneted\" to death by a soldier while resisting arrest (the man had tried to wrest the rifle from the soldier he confronted; it is possible he had been a member of a 500-strong Irish work crew nearby who were \"digging, a [[Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company#Washington's 1794 militia expedition to Pittsburgh|canal]] into the Sculkill\" {{sic}}; at least one of that work gang's members protested the killing so vigorously that he was \"put under guard\").<ref name=\"forman\">{{cite web|last=Forman|first=Jonathan| title= Journal of Jonathan Forman (7 pgs.), September 21, 1794 \u2013 October 25, 1794: Box 1, Folder 1 Jonathan Forman Papers, September 21, 1794 \u2013 October 25, 1794, DAR.1982.01, Darlington Collection, Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735051656100.pdf|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref> President Washington ordered the arrest of the two soldiers and had them turned over to civilian authorities.

Some of the most prominent leaders of the insurrection, such as David Bradford, fled westward to safety. It took six months for those who were charged to be tried. Most were acquitted due to mistaken identity, unreliable testimony and lack of witnesses. Two were sentenced to hang, see below.\n\nImmediately before the arrests \"...{{nbsp}}as many as 2,000 of [the rebels]...had fled into the mountains, beyond the reach of the militia. It was a great disappointment to Hamilton, who had hoped to bring rebel leaders such as David Bradford to trial in Philadelphia...and possibly see them hanged for [[treason]]. Instead, when the militia at last turned back, out of all the suspects they had seized a mere twenty were selected to serve as examples, They were at worst bit players in the uprising, but they were better than nothing.\"{{sfn|Craughwell|Phelps|2008}}\n\nThe captured participants and the Federal militia arrived in Philadelphia on Christmas Day.

Federalists believed that the government was sovereign because it had been established by the people; radical protest actions were permissible during the American Revolution but were no longer legitimate, in their thinking. But the Whiskey Rebels and their defenders believed that the Revolution had established the people as a \"collective sovereign\", and the people had the collective right to change or challenge the government through extra-constitutional means.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fritz | first =  Christian G.

The so-called \"whiskey tax\" was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. Beer was difficult to transport and spoiled more easily than rum and whiskey. But the 1784 British Orders-in-Council had diminished rum distillation in the United States and, for factors described below, whiskey distribution and consumption had increased after the Revolutionary War (aggregate production had not outpaced rum by 1791). The \"whiskey tax\" became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War. The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but [[American whiskey]] a so the excise became widely known as a \"whiskey tax\". Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented [[mash ingredients|grain mixtures]] to make whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the [[American Revolution]], in particular against [[taxation without representation|taxation without local representation]], while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.\n\nThroughout Western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used violence and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance came to a climax in July 1794, when a U.S. marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector [[John Neville (general)|General John Neville]]. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania to negotiate with the rebels, while at the same time calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most distillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be all but impossible to tax\u2014in the next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law.<ref>Rorabaugh, W.J. ''The Alcoholic Republic: An American Tradition'', 1979. Oxford University Press, 53.</ref> Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts.<ref>Howlett, Leon. ''The Kentucky Bourbon Experience: A Visual Tour of Kentucky's Bourbon Distilleries'', 2012, 7.</ref>\n\nThe Whiskey Rebellion demonstrated that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect. The events contributed to the formation of political parties in the United States, a process already under way. The whiskey tax was repealed in the early 1800s during the [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson administration]]. Historian [[Carol Berkin]] argues that the episode in the long run strengthened American nationalism because the people appreciated how well Washington handled the rebels without resorting to tyranny.<ref>Carol Berkin, ''A Sovereign People: The Crises of the 1790s and the Birth of American Nationalism'' (2017) pp. 7\u201380.</ref>\n\n== Whiskey tax ==\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]] in a 1792 portrait by [[John Trumbull]]]]\n\nA new U.S. federal government began operating in 1789, following the ratification of the United States Constitution. The previous central government under the [[Articles of Confederation]] had been unable to levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolutionary War, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt.<ref>Chernow, 297.</ref> Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]] sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his ''[[Report on Public Credit]]'', he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the federal government. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.<ref>Chernow, 327\u201330.</ref>\n[[File:Whiskey Rebellion Flag.svg|thumb|Flag Used by some Protestors]]\nA source of government revenue was needed to pay the respectable amount due to the previous bondholders to whom the debt was owed. By December 1790, Hamilton believed that import duties, which were the government's primary source of revenue, had been raised as high as feasible.<ref>Chernow, 341.</ref> He therefore promoted passage of an excise tax on domestically produced distilled spirits. This was to be the first tax levied by the national government on a domestic product.<ref>Hogeland, 27.</ref> The transportation costs per gallon were higher for farmers removed from eastern urban centers, so the per-gallon profit was reduced disproportionately by the per-gallon tax on distillation of domestic alcohol such as whiskey. The excise became known as the \"whiskey tax.\" Taxes were politically unpopular,<!--- unlike today?? ---> and Hamilton believed that the whiskey excise was a luxury tax and would be the least objectionable tax that the government could levy.<ref>Chernow, 342\u201343; Hogeland, 63.</ref> In this, he had the support of some social reformers, who hoped that a \"[[sin tax]]\" would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol.<ref>Slaughter, 100.</ref> The whiskey excise act, sometimes known as the \"Whiskey Act\", became law in March 1791.<ref>Slaughter, 105; Hogeland, 64.</ref> George Washington defined the revenue districts, appointed the revenue supervisors and inspectors, and set their pay in November 1791.<ref>American State Papers [Finance: Volume 1], 110</ref>\n\n== Western grievances ==\nThe population of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790.<ref>{{cite web | title = ExplorePAHistory.com&nbsp;\u2013 Stories from PA History | url = http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=1-9-16&chapter=3 | accessdate = 2017-02-11  }}</ref> Among the farmers in the region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners.<ref>Slaughter, 97.</ref> Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small [[still]]s.<ref>Hogeland, 66.</ref> Farmers living west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers.<ref>Hogeland, 68.</ref> Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.<ref>Hogeland, 67; Holt, 30.</ref>\n\nSmall-scale farmers also protested that Hamilton's excise effectively gave unfair tax breaks to large distillers, most of whom were based in the east. There were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat fee or paying by the gallon. Large distillers produced whiskey in volume and could afford the flat fee. The more efficient they became, the less tax per gallon they would pay (as low as 6&nbsp;cents, according to Hamilton). Western farmers who owned small stills did not usually operate them year-round at full capacity, so they ended up paying a higher tax per gallon (9&nbsp;cents), which made them less competitive.<ref>Slaughter, 147\u201349; Hogeland, 68\u201370.</ref> The [[regressive taxation|regressive]] nature of the tax was further compounded by an additional factor: whiskey sold for considerably less on the cash-poor Western frontier than in the wealthier and more populous East. This meant that, even if all distillers had been required to pay the same amount of tax per gallon, the small-scale frontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion of their product's value than larger Eastern distillers. Small-scale distillers believed that Hamilton deliberately designed the tax to ruin them and promote big business, a view endorsed by some historians.<ref>Hogeland, 68\u201369; Holt, 30.</ref> However, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that a \"conspiracy of this sort is difficult to document\".<ref>Slaughter, 148.</ref> Whether by design or not, large distillers recognized the advantage that the excise gave them and they supported it.<ref>Slaughter, 148; Hogeland, 69.</ref>\n\nOther aspects of the excise law also caused concern. The law required all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 miles away from the small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.<ref name = Hoover />\n\nIn addition to the whiskey tax, westerners had a number of other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier.<ref name = Hoover /> The [[Northwest Indian War]] was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.<ref>Slaughter, 108.</ref>\n\n== Resistance ==\nMany residents of the western frontier petitioned against passage of the whiskey excise. When that failed, some western Pennsylvanians organized extralegal conventions to advocate repeal of the law.<ref>Slaughter, 110.</ref> Opposition to the tax was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties: [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]], [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette]], [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington]], and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]].<ref>Slaughter, 206.</ref> A preliminary meeting held on July 27, 1791 at [[Redstone Old Fort]] in Fayette County called for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly, which convened in Pittsburgh in early September 1791. The Pittsburgh convention was dominated by moderates such as [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]], who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence.<ref>Hogeland, 23\u201325; Slaughter, 113.</ref> The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S. House of Representatives, both located in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>Hogeland, 24.</ref> As a result of this and other petitions, the excise law was modified in May 1792. Changes included a 1-cent reduction in the tax that was advocated by [[William Findley]], a congressman from western Pennsylvania, but the new excise law was still unsatisfactory to many westerners.<ref>Hogeland, 114\u201315.</ref>\n\n[[File:Whiskey Insurrection.JPG|thumb|300px|left|\"Famous Whiskey Insurrection in Pennsylvania\", an 1880 illustration of a [[tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]] tax collector being made to [[Riding a rail|ride the rail]]]]\n\nAppeals to nonviolent resistance were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, a recently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was [[tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]] by a disguised gang in Washington County.<ref>Slaughter, 113. Hogeland dates the attack on Johnson to September 7, the night before the Pittsburgh convention; Hogeland, 24.</ref> A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered.<ref>Hogeland, 103\u201304.</ref> Because of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792.<ref>Slaughter, 114.</ref> The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the [[American Revolution]]. Supporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between [[taxation without representation]] in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.<ref>Slaughter, 103.</ref>\n\nOlder accounts of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in [[Appalachia]] (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia).<ref name=\"Tachau\">Mary K. Bonsteel Tachau, \"A New Look at the Whiskey Rebellion\", in Boyd, ''The Whiskey Rebellion: Past and Present Perspectives'', 97\u2013118.</ref> The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where no one could be convinced to enforce the law or prosecute evaders.<ref>Slaughter, 117.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1-4905-7274-1|pages=77\u201378}}</ref> In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General [[Edmund Randolph]] argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.<ref>Slaughter, 119; Hogeland, 124.</ref>\n\nIn August 1792, a second convention was held in Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley were not in attendance. Future [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Albert Gallatin]] was one moderate who did attend, to his later regret.<ref>Hogeland, 122\u201323.</ref> A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As some of them had done in the American Revolution, they raised [[liberty pole]]s, formed [[committee of correspondence|committees of correspondence]], and took control of the local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.<ref>Hogeland, 117\u201319; 122\u201323.</ref>\n\nHamilton regarded the second Pittsburgh convention as a serious threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official [[George Clymer]] to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration.<ref>Slaughter, 125\u201327.</ref> Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadsheet and printed in many newspapers.<ref>Slaughter, 119\u201323.</ref>\n\nFederal tax inspector for western Pennsylvania [[John Neville (general)|General John Neville]] was determined to enforce the excise law.<ref>Slaughter, 151\u201353.</ref> He was a prominent politician and wealthy planter\u2014and also a large-scale distiller. He had initially opposed the whiskey tax, but subsequently changed his mind, a reversal that angered some western Pennsylvanians.<ref>Hogeland, 97, 102.</ref> In August 1792, Neville rented a room in Pittsburgh for his tax office, but the landlord turned him out after being threatened with violence by the Mingo Creek Association.<ref>Hogeland, 119\u201324.</ref> From this point on, tax collectors were not the only people targeted in Pennsylvania; those who cooperated with federal tax officials also faced harassment. Anonymous notes and newspaper articles signed by \"Tom the [[wikt:tinker|Tinker]]\" threatened those who complied with the whiskey tax.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1-4905-7274-1|page=72}}</ref> Those who failed to heed the warnings might have their barns burned or their stills destroyed.<ref>Hogeland, 130\u201331.</ref>\n\nResistance to the excise tax continued through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Slaughter151\">Slaughter, 151.</ref> In June, Neville was [[burned in effigy]] by a crowd of about 100 people in Washington County.<ref>Slaughter, 150.</ref> On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region.<ref>Slaughter, 153.</ref> At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission.<ref name=\"Slaughter151\" /> President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.<ref>Slaughter, 165.</ref>\n\n== Insurrection ==\n[[File:William Findley.jpg|thumb|In his 1796 book, Congressman [[William Findley]] argued that Alexander Hamilton had deliberately provoked the Whiskey Rebellion.]]\n\nThe resistance came to a climax in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney [[William Rawle]] issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax.<ref>Slaughter, 177; Cooke, 328.</ref> Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means.<ref>Hogeland, 142.</ref> At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials to be held in local state courts.<ref>Slaughter, 170.</ref> But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General [[William Bradford (Attorney General)|William Bradford]] later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.<ref>Slaughter, 182.</ref>\n\nThe timing of these events later proved to be controversial. Findley was a bitter political foe of Hamilton, and he maintained in his book on the insurrection that the treasury secretary had deliberately provoked the uprising by issuing the subpoenas just before the law was made less onerous.<ref>Cooke, 321.</ref> In 1963, historian Jacob Cooke, an editor of Hamilton's papers, regarded this charge as \"preposterous\", calling it a \"conspiracy thesis\" that overstated Hamilton's control of the federal government.<ref>Cooke, 321\u201322.</ref> In 1986, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that the outbreak of the insurrection at this moment was due to \"a string of ironic coincidences\", although \"the question about motives must always remain\".<ref>Slaughter, 183.</ref> In 2006, William Hogeland argued that Hamilton, Bradford, and Rawle intentionally pursued a course of action that would provoke \"the kind of violence that would justify federal military suppression\".<ref>Hogeland, 124.</ref> According to Hogeland, Hamilton had been working towards this moment since the [[Newburgh Crisis]] in 1783, where he conceived of using military force to crush popular resistance to direct taxation for the purpose of promoting national unity and enriching the creditor class at the expense of common taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hogeland|first1=William|title=Why the Whiskey Rebellion Is Worth Recalling Now|url=http://hnn.us/articles/27341.html|website=History News Network|accessdate=February 11, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810021314/http://hnn.us/articles/27341.html|archivedate=August 10, 2010|url-status=live|date=July 3, 2006}}</ref> Historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison|S.

After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded.

His \"murder\", as the rebels saw it, further radicalized the countryside.<ref>Slaughter, 181\u201383.</ref> Moderates such as Brackenridge were hard-pressed to restrain the populace. Radical leaders emerged, such as [[David Bradford (lawyer)|David Bradford]], urging violent resistance. On July 26, a group headed by Bradford robbed the U.S. mail as it left Pittsburgh, hoping to discover who in that town opposed them and finding several letters that condemned the rebels. Bradford and his band called for a military assembly to meet at [[Braddock's Field]], about {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Pittsburgh.<ref>Slaughter, 183\u201385.</ref>\n\nOn August 1, about 7,000 people gathered at Braddock's Field.<ref>Slaughter, 186; Hogeland, 172.</ref> The crowd consisted primarily of poor people who owned no land, and most did not own whiskey stills. The furor over the whiskey excise had unleashed anger about other economic grievances. By this time, the victims of violence were often wealthy property owners who had no connection to the whiskey tax.<ref>Slaughter, 186\u201387.</ref> Some of the most radical protesters wanted to march on Pittsburgh, which they called \"[[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]\", loot the homes of the wealthy, and then burn the town to the ground.<ref>Slaughter, 187.</ref> Others wanted to attack [[Fort Fayette]]. There was praise for the [[French Revolution]] and calls for bringing the guillotine to America. David Bradford, it was said, was comparing himself to [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], a leader of the French [[Reign of Terror]].<ref>Slaughter, 188\u201389; Hogeland, 169.</ref>\n\nAt Braddock's Field, there was talk of declaring independence from the United States and of joining with Spain or Great Britain. Radicals flew a specially designed flag that proclaimed their independence. The flag had six stripes, one for each county represented at the gathering: the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny, [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford]], Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland, and Virginia's [[Ohio County, West Virginia|Ohio County]].<ref>Holt, 10. Holt writes that earlier historians had misidentified the six counties represented by the flag.</ref>\n\nPittsburgh citizens helped to defuse the threat by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to the rebels, and by sending a delegation to Braddock's Field that expressed support for the gathering.<ref>Slaughter, 185.</ref> Brackenridge prevailed upon the crowd to limit the protest to a defiant march through the town.

He did not want to alienate public opinion, so he asked his cabinet for written opinions about how to deal with the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State [[Edmund Randolph]] who urged reconciliation.<ref>Elkins & McKitrick, 479.</ref> Washington did both: he sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. Washington privately doubted that the commissioners could accomplish anything, and believed that a military expedition would be needed to suppress further violence.<ref>Slaughter, 197\u201399.</ref> For this reason, historians have sometimes charged that the peace commission was sent only for the sake of appearances, and that the use of force was never in doubt.<ref>Slaughter, 199; Holt, 11.</ref> Historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick argued that the military expedition was \"itself a part of the reconciliation process\", since a show of overwhelming force would make further violence less likely.<ref>Elkins & McKitrick, 481.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Hamilton began publishing essays under the name of \"Tully\" in Philadelphia newspapers, denouncing mob violence in western Pennsylvania and advocating military action. [[Democratic-Republican Societies]] had been formed throughout the country, and Washington and Hamilton believed that they were the source of civic unrest. \"Historians are not yet agreed on the exact role of the societies\" in the Whiskey Rebellion, wrote historian Mark Spencer in 2003, \"but there was a degree of overlap between society membership and the Whiskey Rebels\".<ref>Mark G. Spencer, \"Democratic-Republican Societies\", in Peter Knight, ed., ''Conspiracy Theories in American History'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO Press, 2003), 1:221.</ref>\n\nBefore troops could be raised, the [[Militia Act of 1792]] required a justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] to certify that law enforcement was beyond the control of local authorities. On August 4, 1794, Justice [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] delivered his opinion that western Pennsylvania was in a state of rebellion.<ref>Slaughter, 192\u201393, 196; Elkins & McKitrick, 479.</ref> On August 7, Washington issued a presidential proclamation announcing, with \"the deepest regret\", that the militia would be called out to suppress the rebellion. He commanded insurgents in western Pennsylvania to disperse by September 1.<ref>Slaughter, 196.</ref>\n\n==== Negotiations ====\nIn early August 1794, Washington dispatched three commissioners to the west, all of them Pennsylvanians: Attorney General [[William Bradford (Attorney General)|William Bradford]], Justice [[Jasper Yeates]] of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and Senator [[James Ross (Pennsylvania congressman)|James Ross]]. Beginning on August 21, the commissioners met with a committee of westerners that included Brackenridge and Gallatin. The government commissioners told the committee that it must unanimously agree to renounce violence and submit to U.S. laws and that a popular referendum must be held to determine if the local people supported the decision. Those who agreed to these terms would be given amnesty from further prosecution.<ref>Slaughter, 199\u2013200; Hogeland, 199.</ref>\n\nThe committee was divided between radicals and moderates, and narrowly passed a resolution agreeing to submit to the government's terms. The popular referendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated.<ref name=\"Slaughter203\">Slaughter, 203.</ref> On September 24, 1794, Washington received a recommendation from the commissioners that in their judgment, \"(it was) ... necessary that the civil authority should be aided by a military force in order to secure a due execution of the laws...\"<ref name=\"Wash1976\">{{cite book|last1=Washington|first1=G.|last2=Jackson|first2=D.|last3=Twohig|first3=D.|year=1976|title=The diaries of George Washington|location=Charlottesville|publisher=University Press of Virginia|url=https://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/644873705?page=frame&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%3Fid%3DkigTAQAAMAAJ%26checksum%3Dba5f03da41c8eb81c13f065ffff48b64&title=&linktype=digitalObject&detail=|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> On September 25, Washington issued a proclamation summoning the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia militias into service and warned that anyone who aided the insurgents did so at their own peril.<ref name=\"Wash1976\" /><ref>Hogeland, 205\u201306.</ref> The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and [[David Redick]] to meet with Washington and to halt the progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing that violence was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.<ref name=\"Slaughter203\" />\n\n==== Militia expedition ====\nUnder the authority of the recently passed federal militia law, the state militias were called up by the governors of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The federalized militia force of 12,950 men was a large army by American standards of the time, comparable to Washington's armies during the Revolution.<ref>Chernow, 475\u201376; Hogeland, 189.</ref> Relatively few men volunteered for militia service, so a draft was used to fill out the ranks.  Draft evasion was widespread, and conscription efforts resulted in protests and riots, even in eastern areas. Three counties in eastern Virginia were the scenes of armed draft resistance. In Maryland, Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] sent 800 men to quash an anti-draft riot in [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]]; about 150 people were arrested.<ref>Slaughter, 210\u201314.</ref>\n\n[[File:AlbertGallatin.jpeg|thumb|Photo of [[Albert Gallatin]], who spoke publicly to rebel groups about the need for moderation]]\n\n[[Liberty pole]]s were raised in various places as the militia was recruited, worrying federal officials. A liberty pole was raised in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] on September 11, 1794.<ref>Slaughter, 208.</ref> The federalized militia arrived in that town later that month and rounded up suspected pole-raisers. Two civilians were killed in these operations. On September 29, an unarmed boy was shot by an officer whose pistol accidentally fired. Two days later, an \"Itinerant Person\" was \"Bayoneted\" to death by a soldier while resisting arrest (the man had tried to wrest the rifle from the soldier he confronted; it is possible he had been a member of a 500-strong Irish work crew nearby who were \"digging, a [[Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company#Washington's 1794 militia expedition to Pittsburgh|canal]] into the Sculkill\" {{sic}}; at least one of that work gang's members protested the killing so vigorously that he was \"put under guard\").<ref name=\"forman\">{{cite web|last=Forman|first=Jonathan| title= Journal of Jonathan Forman (7 pgs.), September 21, 1794 \u2013 October 25, 1794: Box 1, Folder 1 Jonathan Forman Papers, September 21, 1794 \u2013 October 25, 1794, DAR.1982.01, Darlington Collection, Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735051656100.pdf|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref> President Washington ordered the arrest of the two soldiers and had them turned over to civilian authorities.

Some of the most prominent leaders of the insurrection, such as David Bradford, fled westward to safety. It took six months for those who were charged to be tried. Most were acquitted due to mistaken identity, unreliable testimony and lack of witnesses. Two were sentenced to hang, see below.\n\nImmediately before the arrests \"...{{nbsp}}as many as 2,000 of [the rebels]...had fled into the mountains, beyond the reach of the militia. It was a great disappointment to Hamilton, who had hoped to bring rebel leaders such as David Bradford to trial in Philadelphia...and possibly see them hanged for [[treason]]. Instead, when the militia at last turned back, out of all the suspects they had seized a mere twenty were selected to serve as examples, They were at worst bit players in the uprising, but they were better than nothing.\"{{sfn|Craughwell|Phelps|2008}}\n\nThe captured participants and the Federal militia arrived in Philadelphia on Christmas Day.

Legal historian [[Christian G.

Federalists believed that the government was sovereign because it had been established by the people; radical protest actions were permissible during the American Revolution but were no longer legitimate, in their thinking. But the Whiskey Rebels and their defenders believed that the Revolution had established the people as a \"collective sovereign\", and the people had the collective right to change or challenge the government through extra-constitutional means.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fritz | first =  Christian G.
