The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert [[Pan-Islamism]] in the Ottoman Empire, resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. Assyrians were massacred in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Hasankeyef]], [[Sivas]] and other parts of Anatolia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced \"Ottomanisation\" of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Turkish troops looted the remains of the Assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by Kurds.

Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population.\n\nThis led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, [[Iran]], and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]].<ref>The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? - Page 51 by United States Congress</ref><ref>The Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum \u2013 Page 272 edited by Richard Hovannisian</ref><ref>Not Even My Name: A True Story \u2013 Page 131 by Thea Halo</ref><ref>The Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G. Korbani</ref>\n\nIn reaction to the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and lured by [[United Kingdom|British]] and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by [[Agha Petros]] and [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the Bit-[[Tyari]] tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces in an [[Assyrian war of independence]]. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in Syria.]]\nThe majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of [[Iraq]] and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] asked the [[League of Nations]] to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the \"[[Assyrian triangle]]\" in northern Iraq. During the [[French mandate]] period, some Assyrians, fleeing [[ethnic cleansing]]s in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] during the [[Simele massacre]], established numerous villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] during the 1930s.\n\nThe [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and [[Tartan (Assyrian)|Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,<ref>Len Dieghton, ''Blood Sweat and Tears''</ref> and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During [[World War II]], eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the [[Royal Marine Commando]] and were involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-[[Nazi]] Iraqi forces at the battle of [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] in 1941.\n\nHowever, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele Massacre by the [[Iraqi Army]] in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] the Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.<ref>{{Citation|last=Zubaida|first=S|title=Contested nations: Iraq and the Assyrians|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=July 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=363\u2013382|doi=10.1111/j.1354-5078.2000.00363.x|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/contestednations.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"peshitta1\">{{cite web|title=Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|url=http://www.peshitta.org/initial/mareshai.html|work=Committee of the 50th Anniversary of the Patriarchate of Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|publisher=peshitta.org|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:SyriacChurch-Mosul.jpg|thumb|left|Celebration at a Syriac Orthodox monastery in [[Mosul]], [[Ottoman Syria]], early 20th century.]]\n\nThe period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports.\n\nThe [[Ba'ath Party]] seized power in [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|Iraq]] and [[1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|Syria]] in 1963, introducing laws aimed at suppressing the Assyrian national identity via arabization policies. The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as ''Iraqi/Syrian Christians''. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church).<ref name=\"UNHCR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html |title=Refworld \u2013 Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |work=Refworld |accessdate=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019062353/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CUSCIS%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C3f520de14%2C0.html |archivedate=19 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=\u0632\u0648\u0639\u0627|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s.

While Assyrians are predominantly Christian, an echoing minority, particularly those raised in the [[western world|west]], tend to be [[irreligious]] or [[atheist]]ic in nature.\n\nMany members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet system]].\nThe group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of Syriac Christianity and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into:\n* adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]] following the [[East Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Nestorians''\n* adherents of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] following the East Syrian Rite also known as ''Chaldeans''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] following the [[West Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Jacobites''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] following the West Syrian Rite\n\nBaptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a [[Brit Milah]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of [[Jesus]]; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.\n\nDuring the \"Seyfo\" genocide, there were a number of Assyrians who converted to Islam.

Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general Near Eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of [[circle dance]]s that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both \u2013 The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is [[khigga]], which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and [[tempo]] of a song.\n[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Folk dance]] in an Assyrian party in [[Chicago]]]]\n\n=== Festivals ===\nAssyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which [[Easter]] is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the [[Gregorian calendar]] and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter].

It is commemorated annually on August 7.\n\nAssyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2\u20133 days; in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] they last 1\u20132 days.\n\n=== Traditional clothing ===\n{{Main|Assyrian clothing}}\nAssyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Assyrian cuisine}}\nAssyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread and tomatoes.

He spent some time in Persia under the [[Ilkhanate]]. The 14th century massacres of Timur devastated the Assyrian people. Timur's massacres and pillages of all that was Christian drastically reduced their existence. At the end of the reign of Timur, the Assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places.

Assyrians were massacred in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Hasankeyef]], [[Sivas]] and other parts of Anatolia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced \"Ottomanisation\" of the inhabitants of 245 villages.

Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population.\n\nThis led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, [[Iran]], and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]].<ref>The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? - Page 51 by United States Congress</ref><ref>The Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum \u2013 Page 272 edited by Richard Hovannisian</ref><ref>Not Even My Name: A True Story \u2013 Page 131 by Thea Halo</ref><ref>The Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G. Korbani</ref>\n\nIn reaction to the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and lured by [[United Kingdom|British]] and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by [[Agha Petros]] and [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the Bit-[[Tyari]] tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces in an [[Assyrian war of independence]]. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in Syria.]]\nThe majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of [[Iraq]] and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] asked the [[League of Nations]] to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the \"[[Assyrian triangle]]\" in northern Iraq. During the [[French mandate]] period, some Assyrians, fleeing [[ethnic cleansing]]s in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] during the [[Simele massacre]], established numerous villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] during the 1930s.\n\nThe [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and [[Tartan (Assyrian)|Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,<ref>Len Dieghton, ''Blood Sweat and Tears''</ref> and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During [[World War II]], eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the [[Royal Marine Commando]] and were involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-[[Nazi]] Iraqi forces at the battle of [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] in 1941.\n\nHowever, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele Massacre by the [[Iraqi Army]] in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] the Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.<ref>{{Citation|last=Zubaida|first=S|title=Contested nations: Iraq and the Assyrians|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=July 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=363\u2013382|doi=10.1111/j.1354-5078.2000.00363.x|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/contestednations.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"peshitta1\">{{cite web|title=Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|url=http://www.peshitta.org/initial/mareshai.html|work=Committee of the 50th Anniversary of the Patriarchate of Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|publisher=peshitta.org|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:SyriacChurch-Mosul.jpg|thumb|left|Celebration at a Syriac Orthodox monastery in [[Mosul]], [[Ottoman Syria]], early 20th century.]]\n\nThe period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports.\n\nThe [[Ba'ath Party]] seized power in [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|Iraq]] and [[1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|Syria]] in 1963, introducing laws aimed at suppressing the Assyrian national identity via arabization policies. The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as ''Iraqi/Syrian Christians''. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church).<ref name=\"UNHCR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html |title=Refworld \u2013 Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |work=Refworld |accessdate=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019062353/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CUSCIS%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C3f520de14%2C0.html |archivedate=19 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=\u0632\u0648\u0639\u0627|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s.

In Iraq, Chaldean Catholics inhabit the western [[Nineveh Plains]] villages of [[Alqosh]], [[Batnaya]], [[Tel Keppe]] and [[Tesqopa]], as well as the [[Nahla valley]] and [[Aqra]].

A small minority of Assyrians accepted the [[Protestant Reformation]] thus are [[Reformed Orthodoxy (Eastern Christianity)|Reform Orthodox]] in the 20th century, possibly due to British influences, and is now organized in the [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]], the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and other Protestant/Reform Orthodox Assyrian groups. While Assyrians are predominantly Christian, an echoing minority, particularly those raised in the [[western world|west]], tend to be [[irreligious]] or [[atheist]]ic in nature.\n\nMany members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet system]].\nThe group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of Syriac Christianity and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into:\n* adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]] following the [[East Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Nestorians''\n* adherents of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] following the East Syrian Rite also known as ''Chaldeans''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] following the [[West Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Jacobites''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] following the West Syrian Rite\n\nBaptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a [[Brit Milah]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of [[Jesus]]; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.\n\nDuring the \"Seyfo\" genocide, there were a number of Assyrians who converted to Islam. They reside in Turkey, and practice Islam but still retain their identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seyfocenter.com/english/muslim-assyrians-who-are-they/|title=Muslim Assyrians?

Instruments traditionally used by Assyrians include the [[zurna]] and [[davul]]a, but has expanded to include guitars, pianos, violins, synthesizers (keyboards and [[electronic drum]]s), and other instruments.\n\nSome well known Assyrian singers in modern times are [[Ashur Bet Sargis]], [[Sargon Gabriel]], [[Evin Agassi]], [[Janan Sawa]], [[Juliana Jendo]], and [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]. Assyrian artists that traditionally sing in other languages include [[Melechesh]], [[Timz]] and [[Aril Brikha]]. Assyrian-Australian band [[Azadoota]] performs its songs in the Assyrian language whilst using a western style of instrumentation.\n\nThe first international [[Aramaic Music Festival]] was held in Lebanon in August 2008 for Assyrian people internationally.\n\n=== Dance ===\n{{Main|Assyrian folk dance}}\nAssyrians have numerous traditional dances which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings. Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general Near Eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of [[circle dance]]s that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both \u2013 The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is [[khigga]], which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and [[tempo]] of a song.\n[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Folk dance]] in an Assyrian party in [[Chicago]]]]\n\n=== Festivals ===\nAssyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which [[Easter]] is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the [[Gregorian calendar]] and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter]. Article from [[United States Naval Observatory]] (March 27, 2007).</ref> However, members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East celebrate Easter on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 inclusively on the Gregorian calendar (March 22 and April 25 on the [[Julian calendar]]). During [[Lent]], Assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based.\n\nAssyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones:\n* [[Kha b-Nisan]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|\u071a\u0715 \u0712\u0722\u071d\u0723\u0722}}'', the Assyrian New Year, traditionally on April 1, though usually celebrated on January 1. Assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties, dancing, and listening to poets telling the story of creation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119121049/http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf|url-status=dead|title=AUA Release March 26, 2006.|archivedate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Sauma d-Ba'utha]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|\u0712\u0725\u0718\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0722\u071d\u0722\u0718\u071d\u0710}}'', the Nineveh fast, is a three-day period of fasting and prayer.<ref name=SycOrth>{{cite web|title=Three Day Fast of Nineveh |url=http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |publisher=syrianorthodoxchurch.org |accessdate=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025123007/http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |archivedate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n* Somikka, All Saints Day, is celebrated to motivate children to fast during Lent through use of frightening costumes\n* Kalu d'Sulaqa, feast of the Bride of the Ascension, celebrates Assyrian resistance to the invasion of Assyria by Tamerlane\n* Nusardyl, commemorating the baptism of the Assyrians of Urmia by St. Thomas.<ref name=\"FestivalsAssyrianIranica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = FESTIVALS ix.

It is commemorated annually on August 7.\n\nAssyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2\u20133 days; in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] they last 1\u20132 days.\n\n=== Traditional clothing ===\n{{Main|Assyrian clothing}}\nAssyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Assyrian cuisine}}\nAssyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread and tomatoes. Typically, rice is served with every meal, with a stew poured over it. Tea is a popular drink, and there are several dishes of desserts, snacks, and beverages. Alcoholic drinks such as wine and [[wheat beer]] are organically produced and drunk.\n\n== Genetics ==\n{{Further|Genetic history of the Near East}}\nLate 20th century DNA analysis conducted by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]], Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, \"shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population.\"<ref name=\"assyrianfoundation.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816235456/http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm|url-status=dead|title=Dr. Joel J.

Jones and Headon were replaced  by three unknowns: guitarists [[Vince White]] and [[Nick Sheppard]] and drummer [[Pete Howard]]. During the tense recording sessions, and Clash manager [[Bernard Rhodes|Bernie Rhodes]] and Strummer fought with each other for control over the band's songwriting and musical direction.\n\nStrummer and Rhodes co-wrote most of the songs. During production, Rhodes took charge of the [[arrangement]]s, track sequencing and the final [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]]. His production choices, which rely heavily on Strummer's preference for [[synthesizers|synthetic]] drum sounds and Rhodes' own inclusion of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]], were widely derided.

White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for a lead single.\n\nThe album was poorly received upon release, and is still generally regarded as the band's worst album; Strummer performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash's compilations and box sets. Some retrospective assessments have been more sympathetic; a number of critics and writers have praised Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance, and Rhode's production, especially on the tracks \"This Is England\", \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\".\n\n==Background==\n[[The Clash]]'s internal difficulties during 1983 led to two of its core members being fired: guitarist [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]] was seen as adopting rock star posturing that vocalist [[Joe Strummer]] considered anathema to what the band stood for, and drummer [[Topper Headon]] had developed a [[heroin]] addiction which left him unreliable.<ref name=\"e103\">Egan (2014), p. 103</ref> After the band undertook rehearsals in London during June 1983,<ref>Gilbert (2014), pp. 336\u2013337</ref> interpersonal tensions reemerged.

His production choices, which rely heavily on Strummer's preference for [[synthesizers|synthetic]] drum sounds and Rhodes' own inclusion of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]], were widely derided.

White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for a lead single.\n\nThe album was poorly received upon release, and is still generally regarded as the band's worst album; Strummer performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash's compilations and box sets. Some retrospective assessments have been more sympathetic; a number of critics and writers have praised Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance, and Rhode's production, especially on the tracks \"This Is England\", \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\".\n\n==Background==\n[[The Clash]]'s internal difficulties during 1983 led to two of its core members being fired: guitarist [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]] was seen as adopting rock star posturing that vocalist [[Joe Strummer]] considered anathema to what the band stood for, and drummer [[Topper Headon]] had developed a [[heroin]] addiction which left him unreliable.<ref name=\"e103\">Egan (2014), p. 103</ref> After the band undertook rehearsals in London during June 1983,<ref>Gilbert (2014), pp. 336\u2013337</ref> interpersonal tensions reemerged.

The dimer interface II has its I255 [[side chain]] located in the N-terminal.<ref name = \"Makthal_2016\" />\n\n==== C-Terminal ====\nThe C- terminal domain, also known as RopB-CTD is a [[Carboxy-terminal|carboxy terminal]][[Ligand binding domain|ligand-binding domain]] made of amino acids 56\u2013280. RopB-CTD houses 5 TPR motifs and attaches to the SIP [[peptide]] in the innermost part of the SIP [[binding pocket]] in a sequence-specific manner without induction of [[polymerization]].<ref name = \"Do_2019\" />\n\n==== TPR domain ====\nThe [[tetratricopeptide repeat]] domain provides the concave surface necessitated for SIP recognition. RopB-CTD houses 5 stacked TPR motifs, each having sets of paired antiparallel helices that aid in the formation of a concave inner pathway and a convex exterior. The base of the recognition site is constructed by \u03b16 and \u03b18 helices [See Also: [[alpha helix]]], while the supporting walls are constructed from helices \u03b12, and \u03b112. The exterior portion of the recognition site is flanked by [[Asparagine|asparagines]] N152 and N192 thus providing a ridge of support for the peptide-protein complex.<ref name = \"Makthal_2016\" /><ref name = \"Do_2019\" />\n\n==== Dimer interface ====\nThe dimer interfaces of RopB are constructed by a union of the \u03b18 - \u03b112 helices of the N- terminal domain and the C-terminal domain. Additionally, there is an Interface I forged from 3 side chains (C22, Y224, and R226), an Interface II forged from 1 side chain (I255), and N- terminal domains that are all responsible for [[Dimerization (chemistry)|dimerizing]] RopB protein subunits together.<ref name = \"Makthal_2016\" />\n\n==== Peptide binding pocket ====\nThe SIP peptide binding pocket is the docking station of the eight amino acid leaderless peptide signal, SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP). The binding pocket is a tripartite construction of the C-terminal\u2019s \u03b112 helix which is a capping helix, TPR3\u2019s \u03b16 helix that has a [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] interplay with SIP sidechains, and TPR 4\u2019s \u03b18 helix which electrostatically stabilizes SIP. Variations in pH level altered strength of adherence between SIP and the SIP binding pocket with acidic pH levels between 5.5 and 6.5 enhancing adherence and pH levels between 7 and 9 reducing adherence.<ref name = \"Do_2019\" />\n\n==== Histidine switch ====\n[[File:Histidine Switch in RopB.jpg|thumb|Functional Dimerized RopB with Histidine Switch Highlighted]]\nThough the RopB protein has 7 [[Histidine|histidines]] (H12, H81, H93, H144, H265, H266, and H277) structurally present, the RopB histidine switch primarily operates with a single functionally involved histidine (H144) conveniently placed to associate with RopB sidechains (Y176 and E185) that near each other upon the addition of a [[hydrogen ion]] to H144 in acidic conditions.

During the neutral to basic pH conditions whether synthetically induced or naturally caused by low [[population density]] of S. pyogenes, the interaction between the unprotonated functionally involved histidine (H144) with relevant sidechains (Y176, Y182, E185) in the SIP binding pocket domain is impaired and SpeB protease expression is inhibited.

Iskandar\u016bn</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]], it was named '''''al-\u02bcIskandar\u016bn''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646), the Arabic rendering of the original \"Alexandrou\"; this name was further turkified into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as '''\u0130skender\u016bn''' (\u0625\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646), which in turn was preserved in its current [[Turkish language|modern Turkish]] form as \u0130skenderun.\n\n==Geography==\n\u0130skenderun is located on the eastern Mediterranean coast on the [[Gulf of \u0130skenderun]], at the foot of the [[Nur Mountains]] (Amanos Mountains).\n\n\u0130skenderun is a busy commercial centre and is one of the largest cities in Hatay Province, similar in size to the provincial seat of [[Antakya]]. The city is one of Turkey's largest ports on the Mediterranean and an important industrial centre, home to the [[\u0130sdemir]] steelworks, one of Turkey's largest. \u0130skenderun has an active, modern life with good hotels, restaurants and cafes along the palm-lined sea front. There is a variety of accommodation for visitors. \u0130skenderun is also an important naval training base.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate on this stretch of the Mediterranean is hot and humid in summer. Winters are mild and wet (''[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Csa]]''). At certain times of the year the town is swept by a strong wind called 'Yar\u0131kkaya'. The countryside contains large areas of fruit groves. It is an important producer of [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[tangerines]] and [[lemons]], and even tropical fruits such as [[mango]]es.\n\n{{Weather box |metric first= Yes |single line= Yes |location= \u0130skenderun\n| Jan record high C = 25.0 \n| Feb record high C = 26.4\n| Mar record high C = 31.7\n| Apr record high C = 36.0\n| May record high C = 40.0\n| Jun record high C = 37.6\n| Jul record high C = 37.2\n| Aug record high C = 38.8\n| Sep record high C = 40.0\n| Oct record high C = 37.4\n| Nov record high C = 31.2\n| Dec record high C = 26.5 \n| Jan high C = 15.4 \n| Feb high C = 16.1\n| Mar high C = 18.7\n| Apr high C = 22.3\n| May high C = 25.5\n| Jun high C = 28.5\n| Jul high C = 30.7\n| Aug high C = 31.5\n| Sep high C = 30.3\n| Oct high C = 27.1\n| Nov high C = 21.7\n| Dec high C = 17.1\n| Jan low C = 8.6 \n| Feb low C = 9.0\n| Mar low C = 11.3\n| Apr low C = 14.7\n| May low C = 18.4\n| Jun low C = 22.0\n| Jul low C = 25.0\n| Aug low C = 25.7\n| Sep low C = 23.3\n| Oct low C = 18.9\n| Nov low C = 13.8\n| Dec low C = 10.2 \n| Jan record low C = -0.8\n| Feb record low C = -0.3\n| Mar record low C = 0.4\n| Apr record low C = 5.1\n| May record low C = 11.2\n| Jun record low C = 14.8\n| Jul record low C = 18.6\n| Aug record low C = 18.6\n| Sep record low C = 15.4\n| Oct record low C = 8.1\n| Nov record low C = 2.4\n| Dec record low C = 0.8\n| Jan precipitation mm = 81.7\n| Feb precipitation mm = 85.6\n| Mar precipitation mm = 85.9\n| Apr precipitation mm = 63.8\n| May precipitation mm = 47.0\n| Jun precipitation mm = 35.4\n| Jul precipitation mm = 12.1\n| Aug precipitation mm = 18.9\n| Sep precipitation mm = 39.4\n| Oct precipitation mm = 79.8\n| Nov precipitation mm = 88.8\n| Dec precipitation mm = 89.4\n| Jan rain days = 11.3 \n| Feb rain days = 11.1\n| Mar rain days = 11.4\n| Apr rain days = 9.4\n| May rain days = 6.6\n| Jun rain days = 3.3\n| Jul rain days = 3.1\n| Aug rain days = 3.7\n| Sep rain days = 5.8\n| Oct rain days = 8.7\n| Nov rain days = 8.7\n| Dec rain days = 11.1 \n| Jan humidity = 61\n| Feb humidity = 63\n| Mar humidity = 66\n| Apr humidity = 69\n| May humidity = 72 \n| Jun humidity = 74\n| Jul humidity = 74\n| Aug humidity = 72\n| Sep humidity = 67\n| Oct humidity = 65\n| Nov humidity = 63\n| Dec humidity = 63\n| Jan sun = 130.2\n| Feb sun = 142.8 \n| Mar sun = 189.1 \n| Apr sun = 216 \n| May sun = 279 \n| Jun sun = 309 \n| Jul sun = 294.5 \n| Aug sun = 288.3 \n| Sep sun = 264 \n| Oct sun = 232.5 \n| Nov sun = 168 \n| Dec sun = 124 \n| source 1 = Devlet Meteoroloji \u0130\u015fleri Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmi.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?m=ISKENDERUN |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007203828/http://www.dmi.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?m=ISKENDERUN |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| source 2 = Weatherbase<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=7371&refer=&units=metric|title=Iskenderun, Turkey Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase}}</ref>\n| date     = February 2011\n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Iskenderun mean sea temperature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seatemperature.org/middle-east/turkey/iskenderun-may.htm|title=\u0130skenderun Sea Temperature May Average, Turkey - Sea Temperatures|first=Copyright Global Sea Temperatures - A-Connect|last=Ltd|website=World Sea Temperatures}}</ref>\n|-\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n|- style=\"background:#ff6; font-size:85%;\"\n| {{convert|17.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|16.4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|16.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|17.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|20.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|24.8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|27.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|28.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|27.8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|25.4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|21.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|18.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Cuisine===\nDistinctive \u0130skenderun dishes include [[Kadaif#Kun.C4.81fah.2FK.C3.BCnefe|K\u00fcnefe]], a hot dessert with cheese. The main dishes include the Turkish staples such as [[d\u00f6ner]] and other [[kebab]]s served in the flat [[d\u00fcr\u00fcm]] bread, [[lahmacun]] and also [[Antakya]] influenced cuisine including [[kibbeh]], and sour [[pomegranate]] syrup used as a salad dressing. \u0130skenderun in particular offers good quality fish and prawns.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Baghras2.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Bagras|Bagras Castle]] on the [[Nur Mountains|Nur (Amanos) Mountains]] near \u0130skenderun]]\n\n===Antiquity===\n\u0130skenderun preserves the name, but probably not the exact site, of Alexandria ad Issum. The settlement was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC to supersede [[Myriandrus]] as the key to the [[Syrian Gates]], about 37&nbsp;km (23 miles) south of the scene of his victory at the [[Battle of Issus]]. Alexander camped in the highlands of \u0130skenderun, around ''Esentepe'', and then ordered the city to be established and named ''Alexandria''. \u0130skenderun is one of many cities founded on Alexander's orders, including [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]]. A memorial, a monument and a bronze statue for the victory raised at the city, and [[Herodian]] writes that they were there even at his time.<ref>[http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg0015/tlg001/opp-grc1/3.4 Herodian, History of the Empire, \u00a73.4.1]</ref>\n\nThe importance of the place comes from its relation to the Syrian Gates, the easiest approach to the open ground of Hatay Province and [[Aleppo]].\n\n===Ecclesiastical history===\n[[File:Antioch Alexandria and Seleucia.png|thumb|left|The Peutinger Map showing \u0130skenderun and Seleucia in the 4th century.]]The bishopric of Alexandria Minor was a [[suffragan]] of [[Anazarbus]], the capital and so also the [[ecclesiastical metropolis]] of the [[Roman province]] of [[Cilicia Secunda]]. Greek menologia speak of [[Helenus of Alexandria (Cilicia)|Saint Helenus]], and the martyr saints [[Saint Aristion|Aristio]] and [[Theodore the Martyr|Theodore]] as early bishops of the See. But the first documented one is Hesychius, who took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and in a synod at Antioch in 341. Philomusus participated in the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Baranes is mentioned in connection with a synod at Antioch in 445. At the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, Julianus was represented by his metropolitan, Cyrus of Anazarbus. Basilius was at the synod in [[Constantinople]] in 459 that condemned [[simony|simoniacs]]. In 518, Paulus was deposed by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] for supporting the [[Jacobite Church|Jacobite]] [[Severus of Antioch]].<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 903-906</ref><ref>Sim\u00e9on Vailh\u00e9, v.

The Ottomans continued to fortify the city, and the remains of the early 17th-century Ottoman castle walls can still be seen where the G\u00fcz\u00fcn stream crosses the Varyant road. The city was well described in 1675 by the English naval chaplain [[Henry Teonge]] in his diary. The next army to cross the [[Belen Pass]] and attack [[Anatolia]] through here were the [[Egyptians]] of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in 1832.\n\n[[File:IskenderunShoreline092012.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] from the promenade of \u0130skenderun]]\n\nHowever, in the later Ottoman period the city developed as the main port on the Mediterranean for the overland trade from [[Baghdad]] and [[India]], which had great importance until the establishment of the [[Egypt]]ian overland route. Iskenderun served as a base, first for [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants, then Western and Northern European merchants. The British [[Levant Company]] maintained an agency and [[factor (agent)|factory]] here for 200 years, until 1825, in spite of high mortality among its employees because of regional disease, some due to lack of sanitation systems. During the 19th century the port grew, and the road to [[Aleppo]] was improved. The railway was built in 1912.\n\nAt the outset of [[World War I]], when Britain was contemplating the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] considered the conquest of Alexandretta to be essential in providing Britain with a port and railhead from which to access [[Iraq]]. He proposed a new railway be built to the east from Alexandretta, which would greatly reduce the time for reaching India from the UK. The De Bunsen Committee (8 April - 30 June 1915), a British inter-departmental group which was set up to discuss the issue in greater detail, preferred [[Haifa]] for this purpose.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[A Peace to End all Peace]]|author=David Fromkin|authorlink=David Fromkin|year=1989|page=149}}</ref>\n\nUltimately the British decided not to attack the Ottoman Empire via Alexandretta. On 8 February 1915 the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], protested to Britain's Foreign Secretary, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] about such an attack, citing a commitment that Britain made in 1912 that it had no designs on Syria.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Line in the Sand|author=James Barr|authorlink=James Barr (author)|year=2011|page=15}}</ref> The German field marshal, [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], subsequently said that \n<blockquote>\"Perhaps not the whole course of the war, but certainly the fate of our Ottoman Ally, could have been settled out of hand, if England had secured a decision in that region, or even seriously attempted it. Possession of the country south of the Tauras [mountains] would have been lost to Turkey at a blow if the English had succeeded in landing at Alexandretta\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Neglected War: Mesopotamia 1914-1918,|author=A.J.

Iskandar\u016bn</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]], it was named '''''al-\u02bcIskandar\u016bn''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646), the Arabic rendering of the original \"Alexandrou\"; this name was further turkified into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as '''\u0130skender\u016bn''' (\u0625\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646), which in turn was preserved in its current [[Turkish language|modern Turkish]] form as \u0130skenderun.\n\n==Geography==\n\u0130skenderun is located on the eastern Mediterranean coast on the [[Gulf of \u0130skenderun]], at the foot of the [[Nur Mountains]] (Amanos Mountains).\n\n\u0130skenderun is a busy commercial centre and is one of the largest cities in Hatay Province, similar in size to the provincial seat of [[Antakya]]. The city is one of Turkey's largest ports on the Mediterranean and an important industrial centre, home to the [[\u0130sdemir]] steelworks, one of Turkey's largest. \u0130skenderun has an active, modern life with good hotels, restaurants and cafes along the palm-lined sea front. There is a variety of accommodation for visitors. \u0130skenderun is also an important naval training base.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate on this stretch of the Mediterranean is hot and humid in summer. Winters are mild and wet (''[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Csa]]''). At certain times of the year the town is swept by a strong wind called 'Yar\u0131kkaya'. The countryside contains large areas of fruit groves. It is an important producer of [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[tangerines]] and [[lemons]], and even tropical fruits such as [[mango]]es.\n\n{{Weather box |metric first= Yes |single line= Yes |location= \u0130skenderun\n| Jan record high C = 25.0 \n| Feb record high C = 26.4\n| Mar record high C = 31.7\n| Apr record high C = 36.0\n| May record high C = 40.0\n| Jun record high C = 37.6\n| Jul record high C = 37.2\n| Aug record high C = 38.8\n| Sep record high C = 40.0\n| Oct record high C = 37.4\n| Nov record high C = 31.2\n| Dec record high C = 26.5 \n| Jan high C = 15.4 \n| Feb high C = 16.1\n| Mar high C = 18.7\n| Apr high C = 22.3\n| May high C = 25.5\n| Jun high C = 28.5\n| Jul high C = 30.7\n| Aug high C = 31.5\n| Sep high C = 30.3\n| Oct high C = 27.1\n| Nov high C = 21.7\n| Dec high C = 17.1\n| Jan low C = 8.6 \n| Feb low C = 9.0\n| Mar low C = 11.3\n| Apr low C = 14.7\n| May low C = 18.4\n| Jun low C = 22.0\n| Jul low C = 25.0\n| Aug low C = 25.7\n| Sep low C = 23.3\n| Oct low C = 18.9\n| Nov low C = 13.8\n| Dec low C = 10.2 \n| Jan record low C = -0.8\n| Feb record low C = -0.3\n| Mar record low C = 0.4\n| Apr record low C = 5.1\n| May record low C = 11.2\n| Jun record low C = 14.8\n| Jul record low C = 18.6\n| Aug record low C = 18.6\n| Sep record low C = 15.4\n| Oct record low C = 8.1\n| Nov record low C = 2.4\n| Dec record low C = 0.8\n| Jan precipitation mm = 81.7\n| Feb precipitation mm = 85.6\n| Mar precipitation mm = 85.9\n| Apr precipitation mm = 63.8\n| May precipitation mm = 47.0\n| Jun precipitation mm = 35.4\n| Jul precipitation mm = 12.1\n| Aug precipitation mm = 18.9\n| Sep precipitation mm = 39.4\n| Oct precipitation mm = 79.8\n| Nov precipitation mm = 88.8\n| Dec precipitation mm = 89.4\n| Jan rain days = 11.3 \n| Feb rain days = 11.1\n| Mar rain days = 11.4\n| Apr rain days = 9.4\n| May rain days = 6.6\n| Jun rain days = 3.3\n| Jul rain days = 3.1\n| Aug rain days = 3.7\n| Sep rain days = 5.8\n| Oct rain days = 8.7\n| Nov rain days = 8.7\n| Dec rain days = 11.1 \n| Jan humidity = 61\n| Feb humidity = 63\n| Mar humidity = 66\n| Apr humidity = 69\n| May humidity = 72 \n| Jun humidity = 74\n| Jul humidity = 74\n| Aug humidity = 72\n| Sep humidity = 67\n| Oct humidity = 65\n| Nov humidity = 63\n| Dec humidity = 63\n| Jan sun = 130.2\n| Feb sun = 142.8 \n| Mar sun = 189.1 \n| Apr sun = 216 \n| May sun = 279 \n| Jun sun = 309 \n| Jul sun = 294.5 \n| Aug sun = 288.3 \n| Sep sun = 264 \n| Oct sun = 232.5 \n| Nov sun = 168 \n| Dec sun = 124 \n| source 1 = Devlet Meteoroloji \u0130\u015fleri Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmi.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?m=ISKENDERUN |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007203828/http://www.dmi.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?m=ISKENDERUN |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| source 2 = Weatherbase<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=7371&refer=&units=metric|title=Iskenderun, Turkey Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase}}</ref>\n| date     = February 2011\n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Iskenderun mean sea temperature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seatemperature.org/middle-east/turkey/iskenderun-may.htm|title=\u0130skenderun Sea Temperature May Average, Turkey - Sea Temperatures|first=Copyright Global Sea Temperatures - A-Connect|last=Ltd|website=World Sea Temperatures}}</ref>\n|-\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n|- style=\"background:#ff6; font-size:85%;\"\n| {{convert|17.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|16.4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|16.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|17.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|20.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|24.8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|27.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|28.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|27.8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|25.4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|21.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|18.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Cuisine===\nDistinctive \u0130skenderun dishes include [[Kadaif#Kun.C4.81fah.2FK.C3.BCnefe|K\u00fcnefe]], a hot dessert with cheese.

The settlement was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC to supersede [[Myriandrus]] as the key to the [[Syrian Gates]], about 37&nbsp;km (23 miles) south of the scene of his victory at the [[Battle of Issus]]. Alexander camped in the highlands of \u0130skenderun, around ''Esentepe'', and then ordered the city to be established and named ''Alexandria''. \u0130skenderun is one of many cities founded on Alexander's orders, including [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]]. A memorial, a monument and a bronze statue for the victory raised at the city, and [[Herodian]] writes that they were there even at his time.<ref>[http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg0015/tlg001/opp-grc1/3.4 Herodian, History of the Empire, \u00a73.4.1]</ref>\n\nThe importance of the place comes from its relation to the Syrian Gates, the easiest approach to the open ground of Hatay Province and [[Aleppo]].\n\n===Ecclesiastical history===\n[[File:Antioch Alexandria and Seleucia.png|thumb|left|The Peutinger Map showing \u0130skenderun and Seleucia in the 4th century.]]The bishopric of Alexandria Minor was a [[suffragan]] of [[Anazarbus]], the capital and so also the [[ecclesiastical metropolis]] of the [[Roman province]] of [[Cilicia Secunda]]. Greek menologia speak of [[Helenus of Alexandria (Cilicia)|Saint Helenus]], and the martyr saints [[Saint Aristion|Aristio]] and [[Theodore the Martyr|Theodore]] as early bishops of the See. But the first documented one is Hesychius, who took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and in a synod at Antioch in 341. Philomusus participated in the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Baranes is mentioned in connection with a synod at Antioch in 445. At the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, Julianus was represented by his metropolitan, Cyrus of Anazarbus. Basilius was at the synod in [[Constantinople]] in 459 that condemned [[simony|simoniacs]]. In 518, Paulus was deposed by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] for supporting the [[Jacobite Church|Jacobite]] [[Severus of Antioch]].<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 903-906</ref><ref>Sim\u00e9on Vailh\u00e9, v.

The Ottomans continued to fortify the city, and the remains of the early 17th-century Ottoman castle walls can still be seen where the G\u00fcz\u00fcn stream crosses the Varyant road. The city was well described in 1675 by the English naval chaplain [[Henry Teonge]] in his diary. The next army to cross the [[Belen Pass]] and attack [[Anatolia]] through here were the [[Egyptians]] of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in 1832.\n\n[[File:IskenderunShoreline092012.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] from the promenade of \u0130skenderun]]\n\nHowever, in the later Ottoman period the city developed as the main port on the Mediterranean for the overland trade from [[Baghdad]] and [[India]], which had great importance until the establishment of the [[Egypt]]ian overland route. Iskenderun served as a base, first for [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants, then Western and Northern European merchants. The British [[Levant Company]] maintained an agency and [[factor (agent)|factory]] here for 200 years, until 1825, in spite of high mortality among its employees because of regional disease, some due to lack of sanitation systems. During the 19th century the port grew, and the road to [[Aleppo]] was improved. The railway was built in 1912.\n\nAt the outset of [[World War I]], when Britain was contemplating the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] considered the conquest of Alexandretta to be essential in providing Britain with a port and railhead from which to access [[Iraq]]. He proposed a new railway be built to the east from Alexandretta, which would greatly reduce the time for reaching India from the UK. The De Bunsen Committee (8 April - 30 June 1915), a British inter-departmental group which was set up to discuss the issue in greater detail, preferred [[Haifa]] for this purpose.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[A Peace to End all Peace]]|author=David Fromkin|authorlink=David Fromkin|year=1989|page=149}}</ref>\n\nUltimately the British decided not to attack the Ottoman Empire via Alexandretta. On 8 February 1915 the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], protested to Britain's Foreign Secretary, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] about such an attack, citing a commitment that Britain made in 1912 that it had no designs on Syria.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Line in the Sand|author=James Barr|authorlink=James Barr (author)|year=2011|page=15}}</ref> The German field marshall, [[Paul von Hindenburg|von Hindenberg]], subsequently said that \n<blockquote>\"Perhaps not the whole course of the war, but certainly the fate of our Ottoman Ally, could have been settled out of hand, if England had secured a decision in that region, or even seriously attempted it. Possession of the country south of the Tauras [mountains] would have been lost to Turkey at a blow if the English had succeeded in landing at Alexandretta\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Neglected War: Mesopotamia 1914-1918,|author=A.J.

Between 1921 and 1937, the city was part of the autonomous [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]] within French-controlled [[Syria]], under the [[League of Nations]] [[French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon]].<ref>Sarah Shields, ''Fezzes in the River'' Oxford University Press, 2011</ref> The [[Republic of Hatay]] was founded. In 1939, it joined with the Republic of Turkey after a referendum. The referendum was, and still is, regarded as illegitimate by [[Syria]]. There was evidence that the Turks moved supporters into the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-syria-is-used-to-the-slings-and-arrows-of-friends-and-enemies-6297648.html|title=Robert Fisk: Syria is used to the slings and arrows of friends and enemies|last=Fisk|first=Robert|date=1 February 2012|work=[[The Independent]]|quote=French handed it over to Turkey after a fraudulent referendum|accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-land-in-the-shadow-of-death-1283939.html|title=A LAND IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH|last=Fisk|first=Robert|work=[[The Independent]]|quote=After engineering a fraudulent referendum in north-west Syria - the Turks trucked their supporters into the city|accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> In addition, before the referendum, the Turkish army \"expelled most of the province's Alawite Arabs and Armenian majority.\"<ref name=JackKalpakian>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EmlX4Y7PMjgC&pg=PA130|title=Identity, Conflict and Cooperation in International River Systems|author=Jack Kalpakian|edition=Hardcover|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-7546-3338-1|page=130|quote=Turkish army ... expelled most the province's Alawite Arabs and Armenian majority.

The coast is lined with holiday homes and there is accommodation in hotels or guest houses.\n\n{{wide image|Iskenderun banner.jpg|900px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the [[Gulf of Alexandretta|Gulf of \u0130skenderun]] from \u0130skenderun's district center}}\n\n==Sport==\nThe city has two [[association football|football]] clubs. One of them is [[K\u00f6rfez \u0130skenderunspor]]. The other, more successful team [[\u0130skenderunspor]] folded in 2006, however a [[Phoenix club (association football)|phoenix club]] [[\u0130skenderunspor 1967]] has been founded in 2009.\n\nThe city's basketball team is called ''\u0130skenderun Belediyesi Spor Kul\u00fcb\u00fc''.\n\n==Media==\n\u0130skenderun is served by the ''G\u00fcney Gazetesi'' newspaper.\n\n==Film==\n\u0130skenderun is featured in the film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' as an important starting point for the [[Holy Grail|Grail]] map.
