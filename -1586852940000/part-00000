The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Its story is set in [[Kanpur]] and written by Dilip Shukla. ''Dabangg 2'' serves as a sequel to the 2010 film ''[[Dabangg]]'' and is the second part in the highly successful ''[[Dabangg (film series)|Dabangg franchise]]''. It stars [[Salman Khan]], [[Sonakshi Sinha]], Arbaaz Khan, [[Mahie Gill]] and [[Vinod Khanna]] reprising their roles from ''Dabangg'', with [[Prakash Raj]] playing the antagonist replacing [[Sonu Sood]]. The supporting cast includes [[Nikitin Dheer]], [[Gireesh Sahdev]], [[Pankaj Tripathi]], [[Manoj Pahwa]] and [[Deepak Dobriyal]], with [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] and [[Tinnu Anand]] appearing in cameo roles.\n\nThe development of ''Dabangg 2'' commenced after the release of ''Dabangg''. [[Abhinav Kashyap]], who directed ''Dabangg'', refused to direct the film citing unknown reasons; following this, [[Arbaaz Khan]] decided to make his directorial debut. Invested at {{INRConvert|700|m}}, filming for ''Dabangg 2'' began on 9 March 2012 in [[Mumbai]].\n\n''Dabangg 2'' theatrically released in India on 21 December 2012 during the [[Christmases]] festival. It earned {{INRConvert|583|m}} [[nett]] in India within three days of its release to break the record of ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]'', another film featuring Salman Khan. ''Dabangg 2'' grossed over {{INRConvert|2.52|b}} at the worldwide box office, becoming the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2012 behind ''Ek Tha Tiger'', and one of the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films of all time]]. The film acculumated {{INRConvert|1.55|b}} nett and was termed a \"blockbuster\" by [[Box Office India]]. The third film in the franchise, ''[[Dabangg 3]]'', was released in December 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story carries on from the [[Dabangg (2010 film)|previous film]]\u2014 [[Chulbul Pandey (character)|Inspector Chulbul Pandey]] ([[Salman Khan]])\u2014 in charge of a local police station in [[Kanpur]] and resides there with his wife Rajjo ([[Sonakshi Sinha]]), half brother Makkhi ([[Arbaaz Khan]]) and stepfather ([[Vinod Khanna]]). A boy gets kidnapped from a school, therefore Chulbul deals with the problem. In Kanpur, an assassin murders a witness who is about to testify against a dreaded don. Chulbul tracks the assassin down, killing him at a [[coffeehouse]]. The don is Thakur Bachcha Singh ([[Prakash Raj]]), a struggling politician. After several public altercations, Bachcha's brother Genda ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) convinces him to get rid of Pandey, threatening Chulbul's stepfather to kill his entire family if Chulbul keeps on interfering in Bachcha's criminal activities.\n\nGenda harasses a girl, arriving at her wedding to kidnap her. Chulbul arrives at the wedding and asks Genda to leave. Genda refuses to comply and continues to insult Chulbul. Chulbul breaks his neck, leading to his death. In the meantime his wife becomes pregnant, Pandey being advised by everybody to leave Bachcha alone for the sake of his family's safety. Bachcha, promising to avenge his brother's death, decides to do so before the election. He meets Rajjo and Makkhi while they are leaving a temple where Makkhi is shot by Bachcha and Rajjo is pushed off the temple stairs. However, both of them survive with Rajjo having a miscarriage and suffering a head injury.\n\nChulbul is enraged at the loss of his first child. He enters Bachcha's location and kills all of his men. He fights him and gets him arrested, but when Bachcha tries to threaten him, he kills him instantly by grabbing a gun and shooting him with two bullets in the chest. Later, Chulbul and Rajjo have their first child, a baby boy. Right at the end, Chedi Singh's photographer (from the first film, Dabangg) arrives asking for a family photo. They all laugh, and the photographer takes the picture.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Salman Khan]] as Inspector Chulbul Pandey\n* [[Sonakshi Sinha]] as Rajjo Pandey\n* [[Arbaaz Khan]] as Makhanchand \"Makkhi\" Pandey\n* [[Vinod Khanna]] as Prajapati Pandey\n* [[Mahi Gill]] as Nirmala Pandey\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Thakur Bachcha Singh\n* [[Nikitin Dheer]] as Chunni\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Genda\n* [[Gireesh Sahedev]] as Inspector Siddique\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Commissioner\n* [[Asha Saini|Flora Asha Saini]] in a cameo as a reporter<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-21/news-interviews/35952706_1_dabangg-2-flora-saini-telugu-film |title=Flora Saini's comeback with Dabangg 2 |newspaper=Times of India |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Sandeepa Dhar]] as Anjali<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2012/dec/121212-Sandeepa-Dhar-on-sharing-screen-space-with-Salman.htm |title=Sandeepa Dhar on sharing screen space with Salman |publisher=Mid-day.com |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-17/news-interviews/35868428_1_dabangg-cameo-sandeepa-dhar |title=Sandeepa's cameo in Dabangg 2 |newspaper=Times of India |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Tinu Anand]] as master in special appearance\n* [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as a shopkeeper in special appearance\n* [[Nitesh Pandey]] as doctor in special appearance\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]]\n* [[Rashami Desai]] in cameo appearance in song \"Dagabaaz Re\"\n* [[Nandish Sandhu]] in cameo appearance in song \"Dagabaaz Re\"\n* [[Malaika Arora Khan]] as Munni in [[item number]] \"Pandeyji Seeti\"\n* [[Kareena Kapoor]] as an [[item number]] \"Fevicol Se\"\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nWhen director [[Abhinav Kashyap]] opted out of directing the sequel, Arbaaz Khan himself decided to helm the film.<ref group =d>{{cite news|title=It's official!

A boy gets kidnapped from a school, therefore Chulbul deals with the problem. In Kanpur, an assassin murders a witness who is about to testify against a dreaded don. Chulbul tracks the assassin down, killing him at a [[coffeehouse]]. The don is Thakur Bachcha Singh ([[Prakash Raj]]), a struggling politician. After several public altercations, Bachcha's brother Genda ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) convinces him to get rid of Pandey, threatening Chulbul's stepfather to kill his entire family if Chulbul keeps on interfering in Bachcha's criminal activities.\n\nGenda harasses a girl, arriving at her wedding to kidnap her. Chulbul arrives at the wedding and asks Genda to leave. Genda refuses to comply and continues to insult Chulbul. Chulbul breaks his neck, leading to his death. In the meantime his wife becomes pregnant, Pandey being advised by everybody to leave Bachcha alone for the sake of his family's safety. Bachcha, promising to avenge his brother's death, decides to do so before the election. He meets Rajjo and Makkhi while they are leaving a temple where Makkhi is shot by Bachcha and Rajjo is pushed off the temple stairs. However, both of them survive with Rajjo having a miscarriage and suffering a head injury.\n\nChulbul is enraged at the loss of his first child. He enters Bachcha's location and kills all of his men. He fights him and gets him arrested, but when Bachcha tries to threaten him, he kills him instantly by grabbing a gun and shooting him with two bullets in the chest. Later, Chulbul and Rajjo have their first child, a baby boy. Right at the end, Chedi Singh's photographer (from the first film, Dabangg) arrives asking for a family photo. They all laugh, and the photographer takes the picture.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Salman Khan]] as Inspector Chulbul Pandey\n* [[Sonakshi Sinha]] as Rajjo Pandey\n* [[Arbaaz Khan]] as Makhanchand \"Makkhi\" Pandey\n* [[Vinod Khanna]] as Prajapati Pandey\n* [[Mahi Gill]] as Nirmala Pandey\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Thakur Bachcha Singh\n* [[Nikitin Dheer]] as Chunni\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Genda\n* [[Gireesh Sahedev]] as Inspector Siddique\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Commissioner\n* [[Asha Saini|Flora Asha Saini]] in a cameo as a reporter<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-21/news-interviews/35952706_1_dabangg-2-flora-saini-telugu-film |title=Flora Saini's comeback with Dabangg 2 |newspaper=Times of India |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Sandeepa Dhar]] as Anjali<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2012/dec/121212-Sandeepa-Dhar-on-sharing-screen-space-with-Salman.htm |title=Sandeepa Dhar on sharing screen space with Salman |publisher=Mid-day.com |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-17/news-interviews/35868428_1_dabangg-cameo-sandeepa-dhar |title=Sandeepa's cameo in Dabangg 2 |newspaper=Times of India |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Tinu Anand]] as master in special appearance\n* [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as a shopkeeper in special appearance\n* [[Nitesh Pandey]] as doctor in special appearance\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]]\n* [[Rashami Desai]] in cameo appearance in song \"Dagabaaz Re\"\n* [[Nandish Sandhu]] in cameo appearance in song \"Dagabaaz Re\"\n* [[Malaika Arora Khan]] as Munni in [[item number]] \"Pandeyji Seeti\"\n* [[Kareena Kapoor]] as an [[item number]] \"Fevicol Se\"\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nWhen director [[Abhinav Kashyap]] opted out of directing the sequel, Arbaaz Khan himself decided to helm the film.<ref group =d>{{cite news|title=It's official!

However some species are omnivorous, like raccoons and bears, and quite few species like [[panda]]s are specialized herbivores. Its members are formally referred to as '''carnivorans''', whereas the word \"carnivore\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. With at least 279 extant species found on every major landmass and in a variety of habitats, ranging the cold polar regions to the hyper-arid region of the [[Sahara Desert]] to the open seas even, Carnivora is the fifth largest order of mammals and one of the more successful members of the group. They come in a huge array of different body plans in contrasting shapes and sizes.  The smallest carnivoran is the [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), which can weigh as little as 25 g (0.88&nbsp;oz) and 11&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in), as the largest is the [[southern elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina''), whose adult males weigh up to 5,000&nbsp;kg (11,000&nbsp;lb) and measure up to 6.7&nbsp;m (22&nbsp;ft) in length. All species of carnivorans are descended from a group of mammals which were related to today's [[pangolin]]s, having appeared in [[North America]] 6 million years after the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].<ref name=\"hunter2018\"/><ref name=Polly/> These early ancestors of carnivorans would have resembled small weasel or genet-like mammals, occupying a nocturnal shift on the forest floor or in the trees, as other groups of mammals like the [[mesonychian]]s and [[creodont]]s were occupying the top faunivorous niche. However, by the time [[Miocene]] epoch appeared, most if not all of the major lineages and families of carnivorans had diversified and took over this niche.\n\nCarnivora can be divided into two subclades: the cat-like [[Feliformia]] and the dog-like [[Caniformia]] which are differentiated based on the structure of their ear bones and cranial features. The feliforms include families such as the [[cat]]s, the [[hyena]]s, the [[mongoose]]s and the [[civet]]s. Majority of feliform species are found in the [[Old World]], though the cats and [[Chasmaporthetes|one extinct genus of hyena]] have successfully diversified into the [[Americas]]. The caniforms include the [[Canidae|dog]]s, [[bear]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[weasel]]s, and [[pinniped]]s. Members of this group are found worldwide and with incredible diversity in their diet, behavior, and morphology. Despite this the two groups of carnivorans share several unique traits, one being the presence of the [[carnassial]] teeth. In carnivorans the carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. There is variation among the carnassial pair depending on the family. Some species are [[cursorial]] and the foot posture in terrestrial species is either [[digitigrade]] or [[plantigrade]]. In pinnipeds the feet have become flippers where the locomotion is unique in each of the pinniped families.\n\nCarnivorans are arguably after primates the group of mammals most fascinated or of interest to humans. The [[dog]] is noteworthy for not only being the first species of carnivoran to be domesticated, but also the first species of any organism. In the last 10 to 12,000 years humans have selectively bred dogs for a variety of different tasks and today there are well over 400 breeds. The [[cat]] is another domesticated carnivoran and it is today considered one of the most successful species on the planet, due to their close proximity to humans and the popularity of cats as pets. Many other species popular, often part of the [[charismatic megafauna]] where every major civilization has incorporated a species of carnivoran into their culture such as the [[lion]], viewed as royalty. Yet many species such as [[wolves]] and the [[big cat]]s have been hunted and persecution, with some places they have been extirpated. Habitat loss and human encroachment as well as [[climate change]] have been the primary cause of many species to go into decline. Most species need large adequate amount of territory and plenty of food resources in order to survive, and the decline of both of them are the primary reasons of decline. Four species of carnivorans have gone extinct since the 1600s: [[Falkland Island Wolf]] (''Dusicyon australis'') in 1876; the [[Sea Mink]] (''Neovison macrodon'') in 1894; the [[Japanese Sea Lion]] (''Zalophus japonicus'') in 1951 and the [[Caribbean Monk Seal]] (''Neomonachus tropicalis'') in 1952.<ref name=\"hunter2018\">{{cite book | last1 = Hunter | first1 = L. | year = 2018 | title = Field Guide to Carnivores of the World.  | url = | publisher = Bloomsbury Wildlife | pages = 1\u2013271 |isbn = 1472950798}}</ref> Some species such as the [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') and [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') have been introduced to [[Australasia]] that have caused many native species to become endangered or even extinct.<ref>{{cite web|title= 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species | url = http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=98&fr=1&sts=&lang=EN |publisher=Invasive Species Specialist Group}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics==\n===Evolution===\n[[Image:Tapocyon robustus.jpg|thumb|Life reconstruction of ''[[Tapocyon]] robustus'', a species of [[Miacidae|miacid]]]]\n\nThe order Carnivora belongs to a group of mammals known as [[Laurasiatheria]], which also includes other groups such as [[bat]]s and [[ungulate]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Waddell | first1 = Peter J.| last2 = Okada | first2 = Norihiro| last3 = Hasegawa | first3 = Masami| doi = 10.1093/sysbio/48.1.1 | title = Towards Resolving the Interordinal Relationships of Placental Mammals | journal = [[Systematic Biology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u20135 | year = 1999 | pmid = 12078634| pmc = | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=Tsagkogeorga2013>{{cite journal |last1=Tsagkogeorga |first1=G |last2=Parker |first2=J |last3=Stupka |first3=E |last4=Cotton |first4=J.A. |last5=Rossiter |first5=S.J. |year=2013 |title=Phylogenomic analyses elucidate the evolutionary relationships of bats |journal=Current Biology |volume=23 |issue=22 |pages=2262\u20132267 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.014 |pmid=24184098|doi-access=free }}</ref> Within this group the carnivorans are placed in the clade [[Ferae]].

The miacoids include the families [[Viverravidae]] and [[Miacidae]], and together the Carnivora and Miacoidea form the stem-clade [[Carnivoramorpha]].  The miacoids were small, gennet-like carnivoramorphs that occupy a variety of niches such as terrestrial and arboreal habitats. Recent studies have shown a supporting amount of evidence that Miacoidea is an evolutionary grade of canivoramorphs that, while viverravids are monophyletic basal group, the miacids are paraphyletic in respect to Carnivora (as shown in the phylogeny below).<ref name = Bryant2004>Bryant, H.N., and M.

The canines are thick and incredibly stress resistant.

In terrestrial carnivorans the feet have soft pads. The feet can either be [[digitgrade]] seen in cats, hyenas and dogs or [[plantigrade]] seen in bears, skunks, raccoons, weasels, civets and mongooses. In pinnipeds the limbs have been modified into [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]]. Unlike other [[marine mammal]]s, such as [[cetacean]]s and [[sirenian]]s which have fully functional [[tail]]s to help them swim, pinnipeds use their limbs underwater for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In [[earless seal]]s they use their back flippers; sea lions and fur seals use their front flippers, and the [[walrus]] use all of their limbs. This resulted in pinnipeds having significantly shorter tails. Aside from the pinnipeds, dogs, bears, hyenas, and cats have distinct and recognizable appearances. Dogs are usually [[cursorial]] mammals and are gracile in appearance, often relying on their teeth to hold to prey; bears are much larger and rely on their physical strength to forage for food. Cats in comparison to dogs and bears have much longer and stronger frontlimbs armed with retractable [[claws]] to hold on to prey. Hyenas are dog-like feliforms that have sloping backs due to their front legs being longer than their hindlegs. The raccoon family as well as the [[red panda]] are small, bear-like carnivorans with long tails. The other small carnivoran families [[Nandiniidae]], [[Prionodontidae]], [[Viverridae]], [[Herpestidae]], Eupleridae, [[Mephitidae]] and Mustelidae have through [[convergent evolution]] maintained the small, ancestral appearance of the miacoids, though there is some variation seen such as the robust and stout physicality of [[badger]]s and the [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo'').<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/>\n\nDepending on the environment the species is, the length and density of their [[fur]] varies. In warm climate species the fur is often short in length and lighter. In comparison to cold climate species the fur is either dense or long, often with an oily substance to keep them warm. The pelage coloration comes in many colors, often including black, white, orange, yellow, red, and many shades of gray and brown. There can be colored patterns too, such striped, spotted, blotched, banded, or otherwise boldly patterned. There seems to be a correlation between habitat and color pattern as for example spotted or banded species tend to be found in heavily forested environments.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/> Some species like the grey wolf is a [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species with different individual variation in colors. The [[arctic fox]] (''Vulpes lagopus'') and the [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') the fur goes from white and dense in the winter to brown and sparse in the summer. In pinnipeds, [[polar bear]]s, and sea otters have a thick insulating layer of blubber to help maintain their body temperature.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of carnivorans by population]]\n* [[List of species in order Carnivora]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Carnivora}}\n{{Wikibooks|Dichotomous Key|Carnivora}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Carnivora}}\n* [http://brainmaps.org/index.php?p=datasets-species#carnivore High-Resolution Images of Carnivore Brains]{{cbignore|bot=medic}}\n\n{{Mammals}}\n{{Carnivora}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q25306}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Carnivorans| ]]\n[[Category:Mammal orders]]\n[[Category:Extant Lutetian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Thomas Edward Bowdich]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||information on all meat-eating organisms|Carnivore|the alternative medicine \"Carnivora\"|Venus flytrap#In alternative medicine}}\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2015}}\n{{Automatic taxobox\n|name = Carnivorans\n|fossil_range = {{Geological range|42|0}}[[Middle Eocene]]-[[Holocene]]<ref name=Heinrich2008/>\n|image = <imagemap>\nFile:Carnivora_portraits.jpg|300px\nrect 580 485 0 0 [[Cheetah]]\nrect 582 0 1191 485 [[Grizzly bear]]\n\nrect 0 486 577 972 [[Spotted Hyaena]]\nrect 581 487 1190 971 [[Wolf]]\n\nrect 0 975 577 1387 [[Binturong]]\nrect 582 974 1190 1388 [[Raccoon]]\n\nrect 0 1392 577 1805 [[Indian grey mongoose]]\nrect 581 1391 1188 1807 [[American mink]]\n\nrect 0 1811 577 2231 [[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]]\nrect 581 1810 1190 2231 [[Walrus]]\n</imagemap>\n\n|image_upright = 1.15\n|image_caption = Various carnivorans, with [[feliform]]s to the left, and [[caniform]]s to the right\n|taxon = Carnivora\n|authority = [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]], 1821<ref name=\"Bowditch, T.

However some species are omnivorous, like raccoons and bears, and quite few species like [[panda]]s are specialized herbivores. Its members are formally referred to as '''carnivorans''', whereas the word \"carnivore\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. With at least 279 extant species found on every major landmass and in a variety of habitats, ranging the cold polar regions to the hyper-arid region of the [[Sahara Desert]] to the open seas even, Carnivora is the fifth largest order of mammals and one of the more successful members of the group. They come in a huge array of different body plans in contrasting shapes and sizes.  The smallest carnivoran is the [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), which can weigh as little as 25 g (0.88&nbsp;oz) and 11&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in), as the largest is the [[southern elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina''), whose adult males weigh up to 5,000&nbsp;kg (11,000&nbsp;lb) and measure up to 6.7&nbsp;m (22&nbsp;ft) in length. All species of carnivorans are descended from a group of mammals which were related to today's [[pangolin]]s, having appeared in [[North America]] 6 million years after the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].<ref name=\"hunter2018\"/><ref name=Polly/> These early ancestors of carnivorans would have resembled small weasel or genet-like mammals, occupying a nocturnal shift on the forest floor or in the trees, as other groups of mammals like the [[mesonychian]]s and [[creodont]]s were occupying the top faunivorous niche. However, by the time [[Miocene]] epoch appeared, most if not all of the major lineages and families of carnivorans had diversified and took over this niche.\n\nCarnivora can be divided into two subclades: the cat-like [[Feliformia]] and the dog-like [[Caniformia]] which are differentiated based on the structure of their ear bones and cranial features. The feliforms include families such as the [[cat]]s, the [[hyena]]s, the [[mongoose]]s and the [[civet]]s. Majority of feliform species are found in the [[Old World]], though the cats and [[Chasmaporthetes|one extinct genus of hyena]] have successfully diversified into the [[Americas]]. The caniforms include the [[Canidae|dog]]s, [[bear]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[weasel]]s, and [[pinniped]]s. Members of this group are found worldwide and with incredible diversity in their diet, behavior, and morphology. Despite this the two groups of carnivorans share several unique traits, one being the presence of the [[carnassial]] teeth. In carnivorans the carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. There is variation among the carnassial pair depending on the family. Some species are [[cursorial]] and the foot posture in terrestrial species is either [[digitigrade]] or [[plantigrade]]. In pinnipeds the feet have become flippers where the locomotion is unique in each of the pinniped families.\n\nCarnivorans are arguably after primates the group of mammals most fascinated or of interest to humans. The [[dog]] is noteworthy for not only being the first species of carnivoran to be domesticated, but also the first species of any organism. In the last 10 to 12,000 years humans have selectively bred dogs for a variety of different tasks and today there are well over 400 breeds. The [[cat]] is another domesticated carnivoran and it is today considered one of the most successful species on the planet, due to their close proximity to humans and the popularity of cats as pets. Many other species popular, often part of the [[charismatic megafauna]] where every major civilization has incorporated a species of carnivoran into their culture such as the [[lion]], viewed as royalty. Yet many species such as [[wolves]] and the [[big cat]]s have been hunted and persecution, with some places they have been extirpated. Habitat loss and human encroachment as well as [[climate change]] have been the primary cause of many species to go into decline. Most species need large adequate amount of territory and plenty of food resources in order to survive, and the decline of both of them are the primary reasons of decline. Four species of carnivorans have gone extinct since the 1600s: [[Falkland Island Wolf]] (''Dusicyon australis'') in 1876; the [[Sea Mink]] (''Neovison macrodon'') in 1894; the [[Japanese Sea Lion]] (''Zalophus japonicus'') in 1951 and the [[Caribbean Monk Seal]] (''Neomonachus tropicalis'') in 1952.<ref name=\"hunter2018\">{{cite book | last1 = Hunter | first1 = L. | year = 2018 | title = Field Guide to Carnivores of the World.  | url = | publisher = Bloomsbury Wildlife | pages = 1\u2013271 |isbn = 1472950798}}</ref> Some species such as the [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') and [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') have been introduced to [[Australasia]] that have caused many native species to become endangered or even extinct.<ref>{{cite web|title= 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species | url = http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=98&fr=1&sts=&lang=EN |publisher=Invasive Species Specialist Group}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics==\n===Evolution===\n[[Image:Tapocyon robustus.jpg|thumb|Life reconstruction of ''[[Tapocyon]] robustus'', a species of [[Miacidae|miacid]]]]\n\nThe order Carnivora belongs to a group of mammals known as [[Laurasiatheria]], which also includes other groups such as [[bat]]s and [[ungulate]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Waddell | first1 = Peter J.| last2 = Okada | first2 = Norihiro| last3 = Hasegawa | first3 = Masami| doi = 10.1093/sysbio/48.1.1 | title = Towards Resolving the Interordinal Relationships of Placental Mammals | journal = [[Systematic Biology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u20135 | year = 1999 | pmid = 12078634| pmc = | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=Tsagkogeorga2013>{{cite journal |last1=Tsagkogeorga |first1=G |last2=Parker |first2=J |last3=Stupka |first3=E |last4=Cotton |first4=J.A. |last5=Rossiter |first5=S.J. |year=2013 |title=Phylogenomic analyses elucidate the evolutionary relationships of bats |journal=Current Biology |volume=23 |issue=22 |pages=2262\u20132267 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.014 |pmid=24184098|doi-access=free }}</ref> Within this group the carnivorans are placed in the clade [[Ferae]].

The canines are thick and incredibly stress resistant. All of the terrestrial species of carnivorans have three [[incisor]]s on the top and bottom row of the dentition (the exception being is the [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') which only has two lower incisor teeth).<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/><ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The third [[molar (tooth)|molar]] has been lost. The carnassial pair is made up by the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. Like most mammals the dentition is [[heterodont]] in nature, though in some species like the [[aardwolf]] (''Proteles cristata'') the teeth have been greatly reduced and the cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. In pinnipeds the teeth are [[homodont]] as they have evolved to grasp or to catch fish, and the cheek teeth are often lost.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> In bears and raccoons the carnassial pair is secondarily reduced.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> The skulls are heavily built with a strong [[zygomatic arch]].<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\"/> Often a [[sagittal crest]] is present, sometimes more evident in sexual dimorphic species like [[sea lion]]s and [[fur seal]]s, though it has also been greatly reduced seen in some small carnivorans.<ref name=\"MammalogyCarnivores\">{{cite book | last1 = Vaughan | first1 = T.

These two species illustrate the diversity in bodyplan seen among carnivorans, especially between pinnipeds and their terrestrial relatives.]]\nAside from an accumulation of characteristics in the dental and cranial features, not much of their overall anatomy unites them as a group.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\">{{cite book | last1 = Nowak | first1 = R. M. | year = 2005 | chapter = | editor1-last =  | editor1-first = | editor2-last =  | editor2-first =  | title = Walker's Carnivores of the World | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location= Baltimore, Maryland | pages = 1\u2013328 |isbn = 0801880335}}</ref>  All species of carnivorans have [[quadrupedal]] [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s with usually five digits at the front feet and four digits at the back feet. In terrestrial carnivorans the feet have soft pads. The feet can either be [[digitgrade]] seen in cats, hyenas and dogs or [[plantigrade]] seen in bears, skunks, raccoons, weasels, civets and mongooses. In pinnipeds the limbs have been modified into [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]]. Unlike other [[marine mammal]]s, such as [[cetacean]]s and [[sirenian]]s which have fully functional [[tail]]s to help them swim, pinnipeds use their limbs underwater for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In [[earless seal]]s they use their back flippers; sea lions and fur seals use their front flippers, and the [[walrus]] use all of their limbs. This resulted in pinnipeds having significantly shorter tails. Aside from the pinnipeds, dogs, bears, hyenas, and cats have distinct and recognizable appearances. Dogs are usually [[cursorial]] mammals and are gracile in appearance, often relying on their teeth to hold to prey; bears are much larger and rely on their physical strength to forage for food. Cats in comparison to dogs and bears have much longer and stronger frontlimbs armed with retractable [[claws]] to hold on to prey. Hyenas are dog-like feliforms that have sloping backs due to their front legs being longer than their hindlegs. The raccoon family as well as the [[red panda]] are small, bear-like carnivorans with long tails. The other small carnivoran families [[Nandiniidae]], [[Prionodontidae]], [[Viverridae]], [[Herpestidae]], Eupleridae, [[Mephitidae]] and Mustelidae have through [[convergent evolution]] maintained the small, ancestral appearance of the miacoids, though there is some variation seen such as the robust and stout physicality of [[badger]]s and the [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo'').<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/>\n\nDepending on the environment the species is, the length and density of their [[fur]] varies. In warm climate species the fur is often short in length and lighter. In comparison to cold climate species the fur is either dense or long, often with an oily substance to keep them warm. The pelage coloration comes in many colors, often including black, white, orange, yellow, red, and many shades of gray and brown. There can be colored patterns too, such striped, spotted, blotched, banded, or otherwise boldly patterned. There seems to be a correlation between habitat and color pattern as for example spotted or banded species tend to be found in heavily forested environments.<ref name=\"WalkersCarnivores\"/> Some species like the grey wolf is a [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species with different individual variation in colors. The [[arctic fox]] (''Vulpes lagopus'') and the [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea'') the fur goes from white and dense in the winter to brown and sparse in the summer. In pinnipeds, [[polar bear]]s, and sea otters have a thick insulating layer of blubber to help maintain their body temperature.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of carnivorans by population]]\n* [[List of species in order Carnivora]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Carnivora}}\n{{Wikibooks|Dichotomous Key|Carnivora}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Carnivora}}\n* [http://brainmaps.org/index.php?p=datasets-species#carnivore High-Resolution Images of Carnivore Brains]{{cbignore|bot=medic}}\n\n{{Mammals}}\n{{Carnivora}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q25306}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Carnivorans| ]]\n[[Category:Mammal orders]]\n[[Category:Extant Lutetian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Thomas Edward Bowdich]]\n", "name_user": "2601:8c3:4101:31d0:8c19:5df7:b67e:ea47", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora"}

It took place on the same day as many other local elections in Wales and [[England]].\n\nThe previous elections to this one were [[1969 Cardiff City Council election|in May 1969]] and the next elections would be [[1971 Cardiff City Council election|in May 1971]]. These would be some of the last all-Cardiff elections before the dissolution of the unitary authority and the creation of the new second-tier district authority of [[Cardiff City Council]] in 1974.  \n{{TOC right}}\n\nThe election saw the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] taking seats from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].<ref name=\"SWE Labour whoop\">{{cite news|title=Labour whoop for joy on poll triumph |work=[[South Wales Echo]] |date= 8 May 1970 |page=13 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nCardiff County Borough Council had been created in 1889. Cardiff became a city in 1905. Elections to the local authority were held annually, though not all council seats were included in each contest, because each of the three councillors in each ward stood down for election in rotation.<ref>{{cite news|title=All eyes on Whitchutch and Rhiwbina - newcomers hold the key to power |work=South Wales Echo |date= 9 May 1967 |page=6 |quote=For to bring the election procedure into line with that in the city's other wards, whoever tops the poll in the two new wards goes to City Hall for a full three-year term. The runners-up will serve for two years, while those in third place ...must face the electorate again in 12 months time... In this way the added areas will in future elect one member every year from 1968.}}</ref> The councillors elected in 1970 would be the last to serve a full three year term in office. Nineteen seats in 19 [[electoral wards]] were up for election in May 1970.\n\n==Overview of the result==\n\nThe Labour Party recovered the position they had been in prior to the 1967 election, gaining three seats from the Conservatives. This was credited to the fact Labour's supporters had come out to vote, rather than staying home as they had done at the last election.<ref name=\"SWE Labour whoop\" /> The campaign against the new hook road in the north of the city was a factor. Two wards where Labour made gains, [[Cathays (electoral ward)|Cathays]] and [[Central (Cardiff electoral ward)|Central]], were directly affected. Bill Herbert, who won in the Central ward, was chairman of the Cardiff United Residents Association and a leading campaigner against the new road.<ref name=\"SWE Labour whoop\" />\n\nThe most prominent casualty of the election was Councillor Mary Hallinan, the Lady Mayoress, who lost her seat in the Central ward.<ref name=\"Wmail 8 May\">{{cite news|title=Lady Mayoress loses city council seat to Labour |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|The Western Mail]] |date= 8 May 1970 |page=4 }}</ref>  The morning after the election, the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Alderman Lincoln Hallinan, broke an 18 year tradition when he refused to welcome the three newly elected (Labour) councillors, Herbert, Matthewson and Edwards, in his parlour.

Two wards where Labour made gains, [[Cathays (electoral ward)|Cathays]] and [[Central (Cardiff electoral ward)|Central]], were directly affected. Bill Herbert, who won in the Central ward, was chairman of the Cardiff United Residents Association and a leading campaigner against the new road.<ref name=\"SWE Labour whoop\" />\n\nThe most prominent casualty of the election was Councillor Mary Hallinan, the Lady Mayoress, who lost her seat in the Central ward.<ref name=\"Wmail 8 May\">{{cite news|title=Lady Mayoress loses city council seat to Labour |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|The Western Mail]] |date= 8 May 1970 |page=4 }}</ref>  The morning after the election, the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Alderman Lincoln Hallinan, broke an 18 year tradition when he refused to welcome the three newly elected (Labour) councillors, Herbert, Matthewson and Edwards, in his parlour. He later agreed to meet them before the first council meeting the following week.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lord Mayor declines to 'receive' new councillors |work=[[South Wales Echo]] |date= 8 May 1970

second in [[Llandaff]].<ref name=\"SWE Labour whoop\" />\n\n===Council composition===\nFollowing the May 1970 election the balance on the city council was 57 Conservatives, 18 Labour and one Plaid
