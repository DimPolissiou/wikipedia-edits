The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of [[Hayam Wuruk]] is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:\n\n<blockquote>I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about {{convert|10|or|12|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of [[coconut palms]], [[tamarind]] and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=The Malay Archipelago|year=1869|isbn=9780794605636|page=116}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1906)|assaults at the Sanur region]] in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (''[[puputan]]'') to avoid the humiliation of surrender.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.<ref>[[#Haer|Haer]], p. 38.</ref> In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|Dutch intervention in Bali]], a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterward the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of [[aesthetes]] at peace with themselves and nature\".

It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on [[Borneo]] were inoperative due to heavy rains, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer [Senur].

Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.\n\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]].

Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional [[caste system]], and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) and the [[Indonesian Nationalist Party]] (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> [[30 September Movement|An attempted coup]] in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.\n\nThe army became the dominant power as it instigated [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u201366|a violent anti-communist purge]], in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/><ref name=Friend/><ref name=Ricklefs/> With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.<ref name=Ricklefs/>\n\nAs a result of the 1965\u201366 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno [[Transition to the New Order|out of the presidency]]. His [[New Order (Indonesia)|\"New Order\"]] government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as \"paradise\" was revived in a modern form.

Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately {{cvt|75|km|mi}} (see [[List of rivers of Bali]]).\n\nThe island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]]. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have [[black sand]]. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small ''[[sampan]]'' boats.

These islands are separated from Bali by the [[Badung Strait]].\n\nTo the east, the [[Lombok Strait]] separates Bali from [[Lombok]] and marks the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] division between the fauna of the [[Indomalaya]]n [[ecozone]] and the distinctly different fauna of [[Australasia]]. The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s. When sea levels dropped during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], Bali was connected to Java and [[Sumatra]] and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda archipelago]] isolated.\n\n==Climate==\nBeing just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round.

As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |title=Short Post |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072104/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072220/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.<ref>{{cite book|title=Masked Performance: The Play of Self and Other in Ritual and Theatre|last=Emigh|first=John|authorlink=John Emigh|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1336-X}} The author is a Western theatre professor who has become a performer in Balinese [[topeng]] theater himself.</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\nThroughout the year, there are a number of festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaTTAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT25|title= Rough Guide to Bali & Lombok|isbn=978-1405381352|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|year=2011|page=}}</ref>\n\nThe Hindu New Year, ''[[Nyepi]]'', is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of [[Hayam Wuruk]] is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386.

It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:\n\n<blockquote>I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about {{convert|10|or|12|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of [[coconut palms]], [[tamarind]] and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=The Malay Archipelago|year=1869|isbn=9780794605636|page=116}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1906)|assaults at the Sanur region]] in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (''[[puputan]]'') to avoid the humiliation of surrender.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.<ref>[[#Haer|Haer]], p. 38.</ref> In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|Dutch intervention in Bali]], a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterward the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of [[aesthetes]] at peace with themselves and nature\". Western tourists began to visit the island.<ref name=Friend>Friend, Theodore.

It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on [[Borneo]] were inoperative due to heavy rains, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer [Senur]. The island was quickly captured.<ref>{{cite web|author = Klemen, L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/bali.html |title= The Capture of Bali Island, February 1942 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai|Gusti Ngurah Rai]], formed a Balinese 'freedom army'.

Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.\n\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]].

Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional [[caste system]], and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) and the [[Indonesian Nationalist Party]] (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> [[30 September Movement|An attempted coup]] in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.\n\nThe army became the dominant power as it instigated [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u201366|a violent anti-communist purge]], in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/><ref name=Friend/><ref name=Ricklefs/> With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.<ref name=Ricklefs/>\n\nAs a result of the 1965\u201366 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno [[Transition to the New Order|out of the presidency]]. His [[New Order (Indonesia)|\"New Order\"]] government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as \"paradise\" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> [[2002 Bali bombings|A bombing in 2002]] by militant [[Islamist]]s in the tourist area of [[Kuta]] killed 202 people, mostly foreigners.

Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately {{cvt|75|km|mi}} (see [[List of rivers of Bali]]).\n\nThe island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]]. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have [[black sand]]. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small ''[[sampan]]'' boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of [[Tanah Lot]], they are not yet used for significant tourism.\n\nThe largest city is the provincial capital, [[Denpasar]], near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500 (2002). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, [[Singaraja]], which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/travel/beach/829926/Bali-holiday-travel-tips-beach|title=Picture perfect beaches, romantic sunsets and delicious Asian food: Discover Bali|last=Stafford|first=Stephanie|date=2017-07-22|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}</ref> Other important cities include the beach resort, [[Kuta]], which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and [[Ubud]], situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/09/indonesia-holiday-guide-bali-lombok-java-flores|title=Indonesia beginners\u2019 guide: Bali, Lombok, Java and Flores|last=Sutcliffe|first=Theodora|date=2016-04-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThree small islands lie to the immediate south east and all are administratively part of the [[Klungkung]] regency of Bali: [[Nusa Penida]], [[Nusa Lembongan]] and [[Nusa Ceningan]]. These islands are separated from Bali by the [[Badung Strait]].\n\nTo the east, the [[Lombok Strait]] separates Bali from [[Lombok]] and marks the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] division between the fauna of the [[Indomalaya]]n [[ecozone]] and the distinctly different fauna of [[Australasia]]. The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s. When sea levels dropped during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], Bali was connected to Java and [[Sumatra]] and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda archipelago]] isolated.\n\n==Climate==\nBeing just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} with a humidity level of about 85%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.neotravellers.com/exhaustive-guide-romantic-things-to-do-in-bali// |title=Climate of Bali |publisher=neotravellers.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-10 }}</ref>\n\nDay time temperatures at low elevations vary between {{convert|20|to|33|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.\n\nThe west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. During rainy season there are comparatively fewer tourists seen in Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays the weather is very unpredictable. Outside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Bali Mynah - Houston Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Bali myna]] is found only on Bali and is critically endangered.]]\nBali lies just to the west of the [[Wallace Line]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=T\u00e4nzler|first=Rene|last2=Toussaint|first2=Emmanuel F.

The banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct.

They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the [[Javan langur]], locally known as \"lutung\".

Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\n\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.\n\nBali's tourism economy survived the [[Islamists]] terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3 million tourists.

This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J.

Indonesia, Asia Pacific, Japan, North America, Latin America and Europe'' Periplus Editions (H) Ltd</ref>\n\nApart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |title=Short Post |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072104/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072220/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.<ref>{{cite book|title=Masked Performance: The Play of Self and Other in Ritual and Theatre|last=Emigh|first=John|authorlink=John Emigh|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1336-X}} The author is a Western theatre professor who has become a performer in Balinese [[topeng]] theater himself.</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\nThroughout the year, there are a number of festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaTTAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT25|title= Rough Guide to Bali & Lombok|isbn=978-1405381352|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|year=2011|page=}}</ref>\n\nThe Hindu New Year, ''[[Nyepi]]'', is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

Their sixth studio album, ''[[The 2nd Law]]'' (2012) relates to economics, thermodynamics, and apocalyptic themes.

Several royal heirs stayed in the Kuchesar Fort as a means of furthering profits stemming from India, thus increasing the trading depot's popularity. Eventually, government officials closed the fort due to a significant number of [[Death|deaths]] and [[Disease|illnesses]]. Many theorized that the plants that grew all over the building were responsible for the \"unhealthy environment\". Recently, the locals of [[Kuchesar]] took the initiative to clear away the plants.

Many royal heirs stayed in the Kuchesar Fort as a means of furthering profits stemming from India, thus increasing the trading depot's popularity. Eventually, government officials closed the fort due to a significant number of [[Death|deaths]] and [[Disease|illnesses]]. Many theorized that the plants that grew all over the building were responsible for the \"unhealthy environment\". Recently, the locals of [[Kuchesar]] took the initiative to clear away the plants.

In [[Old English]] the country was named ''Sw\u00e9oland'' and ''Sw\u00edor\u00edce'' ([[Old Norse]] ''Sv\u00edar\u00edki''). [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] of the 12th and 13th centuries used ''Suane'', ''Swane'' (with the adjective as ''Suaneis''). In [[Scots language|Scots]] ''Swane'', ''Swaine'', appears in the 16th century.  [[Early Modern English]] used ''Swedeland''.<ref>{{OED|Sweden|ID=195631}}</ref>\n\nThe Swedish name ''Sverige'' (a compound of the words ''Svea'' and ''rike'', with [[lenition]] of the consonant [k], first recorded in the cognate ''Sw\u0113orice'' in [[Beowulf]])<ref>{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |trans-title=Swedish etymological dictionary |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerup |location=Lund |language=Swedish |page=917 |url=http://runeberg.org/svetym/1005.html |access-date=30 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828081321/http://runeberg.org/svetym/1005.html |archive-date=28 August 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> literally means \"realm of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]]\", excluding the [[Geats]] in [[G\u00f6taland]].\n\nVariations of the name ''Sweden'' are used in most languages, with the exception of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] using ''Sverige'', [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Sv\u00f8r\u00edki'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'', and the more notable exception of some [[Finnic languages]] where ''Ruotsi'' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and ''Rootsi'' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]) are used, names commonly considered as referring to the people from the coastal areas of [[Roslagen]], [[Uppland]], who were known as the ''[[Rus' people|Rus']]'', and through them etymologically related to the English name for [[Russia]].\n\nThe etymology of ''Swedes'', and thus ''Sweden'', is generally not agreed upon but may derive from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''Swihoniz'' meaning \"one's own\",<ref>{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |url=https://archive.org/details/svensketymologis00hell |trans-title=Swedish etymological dictionary |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerup |location=Lund |language=Swedish |page=[https://archive.org/details/svensketymologis00hell/page/915 915]}}</ref> referring to one's own Germanic tribe.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Sweden}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{Main|Prehistoric Sweden}}\n[[File:Vendel I helmet 456057.jpg|thumb|A [[Vendel Period|Vendel-era]] helmet, at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]]\nSweden's prehistory begins in the [[Aller\u00f8d oscillation]],{{according to whom|date=May 2015}} a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late [[Palaeolithic]] [[reindeer]]-hunting camps of the [[Bromme culture]] at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, [[Scania]]. This period was characterised by small bands of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer-fishers]] using [[flint]] technology.\n\nSweden is first described in a written source in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' by [[Tacitus]] in 98 AD. In [[s:Germania#XLIV|Germania 44 and 45]] he mentions the Swedes (''Suiones'') as a powerful tribe (''distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets'') with ships that had a [[prow]] at each end ([[longship]]s). Which kings (''kuningaz'') ruled these Suiones is unknown, but [[Norse mythology]] presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the [[runic alphabet|runic script]] was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke [[Proto-Norse]] at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other [[North Germanic languages]].{{Primary source inline|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the 6th century, [[Jordanes]] names two tribes living in [[Scandza]], both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the ''Suetidi'' and ''Suehans''. ''Suetidi'' is considered to be the Latin form of ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'', the Old Norse name for the Swedes. Jordanes describes the ''Suetidi'' and ''[[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Dani]]'' as being of the same stock and the tallest of people. He later mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of a same stature.{{Primary source inline|date=May 2015}} The ''Suehans'' were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the ''[[Thuringians|Thyringi]]'' of ''Germania'' (''alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis''). The Icelandic historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] also wrote that the Swedish king [[Adils]] (Eadgils) had the finest horses of his day.\n\n===The Vikings===\n{{See also|Early Swedish history|Foundation of Modern Sweden|Varangians}}\n[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|left|[[Viking]] expeditions (blue lines)]]\n\nThe Swedish [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and [[Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, the [[Baltic countries]], Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the [[Black Sea]] and even as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|through the Dnieper]] south to [[Constantinople]], on which they carried out numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. The Swedish Vikings, called [[Rus (people)|Rus]] are believed to be the founding fathers of [[Kievan Rus']]. The Arab traveller [[Ibn Fadlan]] described these Vikings as follows:\n\n{{quote|I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the [[Volga|Itil]]. I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an axe, a sword, and a knife, and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved, of Frankish sort.<ref>Quoted from: Gwyn Jones. ''A History of the Vikings''.

There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England runestones]]. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor. What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness.\n\n=== The Kingdom of Sweden ===\nIt is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the [[list of Swedish monarchs]] is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both [[Svealand]] (Sweden) and G\u00f6taland (Gothia) as one province, beginning with [[Eric the Victorious]]. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem ''Beowulf'' describes semi-legendary [[Swedish-Geatish wars]] in the 6th century. ''G\u00f6taland'' in this sense mainly includes the provinces of [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]] (East Gothia) and [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] (West Gothia). The island of [[Gotland]] was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time (Danish, Hanseatic, and Gotland-domestic). [[Sm\u00e5land]] was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of [[Kalmar]] with its castle was of importance. The south-west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces ([[Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]]). North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province [[Bohusl\u00e4n]]. But there were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of [[Norrland]].\n\n[[File:Suecia 1-064 ; Gambla Ubsala h\u00f6gar.png|thumb|left|[[Gamla Uppsala]] (Old Uppsala), a site of religious and political importance in the early days of Sweden]]\n\nDuring the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, [[Ystad]] in the [[Denmark|Danish]] province Scania and [[Paviken]] on Gotland were flourishing centres of trade, but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 AD have been found in Ystad.<ref name=\"Sawyer\" /> In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined.<ref name=\"Sawyer\">{{cite book |last1=Sawyer |first1=Birgit |first2=Peter |last2=Sawyer |year=1993 |title=Medieval Scandinavia: from Conversion to Reformation, Circa 800\u20131500 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-1739-5 |pages=150\u2013153}}</ref>\n\n[[Ansgar|St Ansgar]] is usually credited with introducing Christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace [[paganism]] until the 12th century.

The period between 1100 and 1400 was characterised by internal power struggles and competition among the Nordic kingdoms. In the years 1150\u20131293 according to the legend of [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric IX]] and the ''[[Eric Chronicles]]'' Swedish kings made a [[First Swedish Crusade|first]], [[Second Swedish Crusade|second]] and [[Third Swedish Crusade|third crusade]] to pagan Finland against [[Finns proper|Finns]], [[Tavastians]] and [[Karelians]] and started conflicts with the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] who no longer had any connection with Sweden.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bagge |first=Sverre |chapter=The Scandinavian Kingdoms |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |editor-first=Rosamond |editor-last=McKitterick |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-36289-4 |page=724 |quote=Swedish expansion in Finland led to conflicts with Rus', which were temporarily brought to an end by a peace treaty in 1323, dividing the Karelian peninsula and the northern areas between the two countries.}}</ref> The [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|Swedish colonisation]] of the coastal areas of Finland started also during the 12th and 13th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=N\u00e4r kom svenskarna till Finland?|editor-first=Ann-Marie|editor-last=Ivars|editor-first2=Lena|editor-last2= Hulden|publisher=Studier utg. av Svenska Litteraturs\u00e4llskapet i Finland 646|year=2002|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Om svenskarnes inflyttningar till Finland|last=Meinander|first=Carl Fredrik|publisher=Historisk Tidskrift f\u00f6r Finland 3/1983|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In the 14th century, the Swedish colonisation of coastal areas of Finland began to be more organised and in the end of the century several of the coastal areas of Finland were inhabited mostly by Swedes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sveriges \u00d6sterland: Fr\u00e5n forntiden till Gustav Vasa.

Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry, and some became labourers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of the province of [[Dalsland]] would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish, which they consumed, while the iron would be shipped abroad.<ref>Scott, pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Sweden was struck by the [[Black Death]].<ref>Scott, pp. 56\u201357.</ref> The population of Sweden and most of Europe was seriously decimated. The population (at same territory) did not reach the numbers of the year 1348 again until the beginning of the 19th century. One third of the population died in the triennium of 1349\u20131351. During this period, the Swedish cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] effected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility.\n\n[[File:Gustav Vasa.jpg|thumb|left|185px|[[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]] [[Swedish War of Liberation|liberated]] Sweden from [[Christian II of Denmark]], ending the [[Kalmar Union]]. He established the [[House of Vasa]] which ruled Sweden and [[Poland]] until the 17th century]]\n\nMany times the Swedish crown was inherited by children kings over the course of the kingdom's existence; consequently real power was held for long periods by regents (notably those of the [[Sture]] family) chosen by the Swedish parliament. King [[Christian II of Denmark]], who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm in 1520. This came to be known as the \"[[Stockholm blood bath]]\" and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 June (now Sweden's national holiday) in 1523, they made [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] their king.<ref>Scott, p. 121.</ref> This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern Sweden]]. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nThe Hanseatic League had been officially formed at [[L\u00fcbeck]] on the Baltic coast of [[Holy Roman Empire|Northern Germany]] in 1356. The League sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert S. |last1=Hoyt |first2=Stanley |last2=Chodorow |title=Europe in the Middle Ages |url=https://archive.org/details/europeinmiddleag00robe |url-access=registration |publisher=Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich, Inc. |location=New York |year=1976 |page=[https://archive.org/details/europeinmiddleag00robe/page/628 628]}}</ref> In exchange, they offered a certain amount of protection to the joining cities.

They sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes. With these concessions, L\u00fcbeck merchants flocked to Stockholm, where they soon came to dominate the city's economic life and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden.<ref name=\"Scott, p. 52\">Scott, p. 52.</ref> Under the Hanseatic trade, two-thirds of Stockholm's imports consisted of [[textiles]], while the remaining third was [[salt]]. The main exports from Sweden were [[iron]] and [[copper]].<ref name=\"Scott, p. 52\"/>\n\nHowever, the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa (mostly consisting of German citizens), and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]] broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people.<ref>Scott, p. 132.</ref> History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation.

While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role in people's [[self-concept|self-identity]]. The provinces are usually grouped together in three large ''[[lands of Sweden|lands]]'', parts, the northern Norrland, the central Svealand and southern G\u00f6taland. The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60% of the country. Sweden also has the [[Vindelfj\u00e4llens Nature Reserve|Vindelfj\u00e4llen Nature Reserve]], one of the largest protected areas in Europe, totaling 562,772 ha (approx. 5,628&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}).\n\nAbout 15% of Sweden lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, with increasing forest coverage northward. Around 65% of Sweden's total land area is covered with forests. The highest population density is in the [[\u00d8resund Region|\u00d6resund Region]] in southern Sweden, along the western coast up to central Bohusl\u00e4n, and in the valley of lake [[M\u00e4laren]] and Stockholm.

V\u00e4nern is the third largest in Europe, after [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]] in Russia. Combined with the third and fourth largest lakes M\u00e4laren and [[Hj\u00e4lmaren]], these lakes take up a significant part of the southern Sweden's area. Sweden's extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the [[G\u00f6ta Canal]] in the 19th century, shortening the potential distance between the Baltic Sea south of [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] and [[Gothenburg]] by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotakanal.se/en/|title=G\u00f6ta kanal official website|publisher=[[G\u00f6ta Canal]]|accessdate=9 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112033839/http://www.gotakanal.se/en/|archive-date=12 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nMost of Sweden has a [[temperate climate]], despite its northern [[latitude]], with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year.

Temperatures expected in Sweden are heavily influenced by the large Fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental Europe and western Russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to Sweden. That, in turn, renders most of Sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby [[British Isles]], even matching temperatures found along the continental Atlantic coast as far south as in northern [[Spain]]. In winter, however, the same high-pressure systems sometimes put the entire country far below freezing temperatures. There is some maritime moderation from the Atlantic which renders the Swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby Russia. Even though temperature patterns differ between north and south, the summer climate is surprisingly similar all through the entire country in spite of the large latitudinal differences. This is due to the south's being surrounded by a greater mass of water, with the wider Baltic Sea and the Atlantic air passing over lowland areas from the south-west.\n\nApart from the ice-free Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover. By the time winter finally breaks through, daylight hours rise quickly, ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring. With the greater number of clear nights, frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as April. The cold winters occur when low-pressure systems are weaker. An example is that the coldest ever month (January 1987) in Stockholm was also the sunniest January month on record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_jan15.pdf?71642|title=Precipitation, Sunshine & Radiation for January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv|publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]]|accessdate=31 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212312/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_jan15.pdf?71642|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?18701|title=Temperature & Wind \u2013 January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv|publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]]|accessdate=31 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212312/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?18701|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe relative strength of low and high-pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers.

The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that ''naturally'' can grow at various places. Sweden is divided in five major vegetation zones. These are:\n\n* The southern deciduous forest zone\n* The southern coniferous forest zone\n* The northern coniferous forest zone, or the [[Taiga]]\n* The alpine-birch zone\n* The bare mountain zone\n\nPlease see the map to the right, Vegetation Zones in Sweden.\n\n;Southern deciduous forest zone\nAlso known as the nemoral region, the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes Denmark and large parts of Central Europe. It has to a rather large degree become agricultural areas, but larger and smaller forests still exist. The region is characterised by a large wealth of trees and shrubs. The [[beech]] are the most dominant tree, but [[oak]] can also form smaller forests. [[elm]] at one time formed forests, but have been heavily reduced due to [[Dutch Elm disease]]. Other important trees and shrubs in this zone include [[hornbeam]], [[Sambucus nigra|elder]], [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], [[Lonicera xylosteum|fly honeysuckle]], [[Tilia|linden (lime)]], [[Euonymus europaeus|spindle]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[alder buckthorn]], [[blackthorn]], [[Populus tremula|aspen]], [[European rowan]], [[Swedish whitebeam]], [[Juniperus communis|juniper]], [[European holly]], [[Hedera helix|ivy]], [[Cornus sanguinea|dogwood]], [[goat willow]], [[Larix decidua|larch]], [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[maple]], [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], [[alder]] along creeks, and in sandy soil [[birch]] compete with [[pine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/naturhansyn/naturmiljoer-fran-norr-till-soder/sodra-lovskogsregionen/|title=S\u00f6dra l\u00f6vskogsregionen \u2013 Skogskunskap|website=www.skogskunskap.se|access-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012044304/https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/naturhansyn/naturmiljoer-fran-norr-till-soder/sodra-lovskogsregionen/|archive-date=12 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Spruce]] is not native but between approximately 1870 and 1980, large areas were planted with it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Forest and Buildings |url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/skane/Sv/samhallsplanering-och-kulturmiljo/landskapsvard/kulturmiljoprogram/historia-utveckling/skogens-landskap/skog-och-bebyggelse/Pages/index.aspx |website=lansstyrelsen.se |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012055002/http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/skane/Sv/samhallsplanering-och-kulturmiljo/landskapsvard/kulturmiljoprogram/historia-utveckling/skogens-landskap/skog-och-bebyggelse/Pages/index.aspx |archivedate=12 October 2017 |language=Swedish|quote=\"Granskogen, som spreds norrifr\u00e5n, n\u00e5dde inte Sk\u00e5ne f\u00f6rr\u00e4n mot slutet av 1800-talet.

The [[beech]]'s northern boundary crosses this zone. This is however not the case with [[oak]] and [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]]. Although in its natural area, also ''planted'' Spruce are common, and such woods are very dense, as the spruces can grow very tight, especially in this vegetation zone's southern areas.\n\n;Northern coniferous forest zone, or the [[Taiga]]\nThe northern coniferous forest zone begins north of the natural boundary of the [[oak]]. Of deciduous species the [[birch]] is the only one of significance. [[Pine]] and [[spruce]] are dominant, but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets. In the extreme north is it difficult to state the trees forms true forests at all, due to the large distances between the trees.\n\n;Alpine-birch and bare mountain zones\nThe alpine-birch zone, in the Scandinavian mountains, depending on both latitude and altitude, is an area where only a smaller kind of [[birch]] (''Betula pubescens'' or ''B.tortuosa'') can grow.

Sweden is one of 28 member states of the European Union.]]\n\nThroughout the 20th century, [[Swedish foreign policy]] was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and [[neutral country|neutrality]] in wartime. Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.<ref name=\"NB335-339\" />\n\nSweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a [[war|state of war]] since the end of the [[Swedish campaign against Norway (1814)|Swedish campaign against Norway]] in 1814. During World War II Sweden joined neither the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] nor [[Axis powers|axis]] powers. This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods,<ref name=\"Koblik303-313\" /><!---Koblik, p. 313---><ref name=\"NB313-319\" /> especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden, which was vital to the German war machine.<ref name=\"NB313-319\" /><ref>Nordstrom p. 302: \"In fact, the plans were mostly a ruse to establish control of the crucial Norwegian port of Narvik and the iron mines of northern Sweden, which were vitally important to the German war efforts.\"</ref> However, Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the Winter War, and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943.\n\n[[File:ODA percent of GNI 2009.png|thumb|left|[[Official development assistance|Development aid]] measured in [[Gross national income|GNI]] in 2009.

For the next several decades, the Swedish poured an annual average of about 5% of GDP into making their defenses credible.\"</ref> At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange. In 1952, a Swedish [[DC-3]] was [[Catalina affair|shot down]] over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] [[jet aircraft|jet]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cold War Spy Plane Found in Baltic Sea|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/10/1010_031010_swedishspyplane.html|publisher=[[National Geographic News]]|accessdate=10 June 2013|date=10 October 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329214137/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/10/1010_031010_swedishspyplane.html|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Another plane, a [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[search and rescue]] plane, was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well. Prime Minister Olof Palme made an official visit to [[Cuba]] during the 1970s, during which he denounced [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s government and praised contemporary [[26 July Movement|Cuban]] and [[Khmer Rouge|Cambodian]] revolutionaries in a speech.\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations. It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the [[Third World]].\n\nOn 27 October 1981, a [[Whiskey-class submarine]] ([[Soviet submarine S-363|''U 137'']]) from the [[Soviet Union]] ran aground close to the [[Karlskrona naval base|naval base]] at [[Karlskrona]] in the southern part of the country. Research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against Swedish military potential. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union. Following the [[Assassination of Olof Palme|1986 assassination of Olof Palme]] and with the end of the Cold War, Sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach. Nevertheless, the country remains active in peace keeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget.\n\nSince 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Swedish Armed Forces|Law enforcement in Sweden}}\n[[File:Swedish JAS-39 Gripen landing.jpg|thumb|The Saab [[JAS 39 Gripen]] is an advanced Swedish multi-role [[fighter aircraft]] of the [[Swedish Air Force]].]]\nThe [[Law enforcement in Sweden|law is enforced in Sweden]] by several government entities. The Swedish police is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency]] concerned with police matters. The [[National Task Force]] is a national [[SWAT]] unit within the Police Service. The [[Swedish Security Service]]'s responsibilities are [[counter-espionage]], anti-terrorist activities, protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people.\n\n''F\u00f6rsvarsmakten'' (Swedish Armed Forces) is a government agency reporting to the Swedish [[Ministry of Defence (Sweden)|Ministry of Defence]] and responsible for the [[peacetime]] operation of the armed forces of Sweden. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peace support forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war. The armed forces are divided into [[Swedish Army|Army]], [[Swedish Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Swedish Navy|Navy]]. The head of the armed forces is the [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] (''\u00d6verbef\u00e4lhavaren'', \u00d6B), the most senior commissioned officer in the country. Up to 1974 the King was ''pro forma'' [[Commander in chief#Sweden|Commander-in-Chief]], but in reality it was clearly understood all through the 20th century that the Monarch would have no ''active'' role as a military leader.\n\n[[File:Stridsfordon 90 Revinge 2012-2.jpg|thumb|The Infantry fighting vehicle [[Combat Vehicle 90|CV90]], which is produced and used by Sweden]]\nUntil the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of [[military service]] were [[conscription|conscripted]]. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically, while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely those otherwise most fit for service. All soldiers serving abroad must by law be volunteers. In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003 it was down to 15,000.\n\nOn 1 July 2010 Sweden stopped routine conscription, switching to an all volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/Rekrytering/Varnplikt/ |publisher=[[Swedish Armed Forces]] |title=V\u00e4rnplikt |trans-title=Conscription |accessdate=21 April 2010 |language=sv }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.22620/1.1595556/allmanna_varnplikten_skrotas?lid=puff_1597044&lpos=extra_0 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |title=Allm\u00e4nna v\u00e4rnplikten skrotas |trans-title=General conscription scrapped |accessdate=21 April 2010 |language=sv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426203557/http://svt.se/2.22620/1.1595556/allmanna_varnplikten_skrotas?lid=puff_1597044&lpos=extra_0 |archivedate=26 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/21494/20090816/ |newspaper=[[The Local]] |title=Military conscription phase out under fire |accessdate=21 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122021708/http://www.thelocal.se/21494/20090816/ |archivedate=22 January 2010}}</ref> The need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service will be emphasised.

Outside of major cities, areas with notably higher population density include the agricultural part of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, the western coast, the area around Lake M\u00e4laren and the agricultural area around Uppsala.\n\nNorrland, which covers approximately 60% of the Swedish territory, has a very low population density (below 5 people per square kilometre). The mountains and most of the remote coastal areas are almost unpopulated. Low population density exists also in large parts of western Svealand, as well as southern and central Sm\u00e5land. An area known as ''Finnveden'', which is located in the south-west of Sm\u00e5land, and mainly below the 57th parallel, can also be considered as almost empty of people.\n\nBetween 1820 and 1930, approximately 1.3 million Swedes, a third of the country's population at the time, [[Swedish emigration to North America|emigrated to North America]], and most of them to the United States.

After the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1530s, a change led by [[Martin Luther]]'s Swedish associate [[Olaus Petri]], the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was abolished and [[Lutheranism]] became widespread. Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the [[Uppsala Synod]] of 1593, and it became the official religion. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of [[Lutheran orthodoxy]], small groups of non-Lutherans, especially [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]], the [[Moravian Church]] and [[French Huguenots]] played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gritsch|first1=Eric|title=A History of Lutheranism|date=2010|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9781451407754|pages=351|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ApWxByVqe-MC&dq=lutheranism+history+in+sweden|accessdate=20 March 2017}}</ref> The [[Sami people|Sami]] originally had their own [[Animism|shamanistic religion]], but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n[[File:Katarina kyrka February 2015 02.jpg|thumb|left|The Protestant [[Katarina Church]] in Stockholm]]\n[[File:Moske Malmo 2014Jun17 0002-3.jpg|thumb|left|The second oldest mosque in Sweden is the [[Malm\u00f6 Mosque]]]]\n\nWith religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including [[History of the Jews in Sweden|Judaism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], were allowed to live and work freely in the country.

The 19th century saw the arrival of various [[Low church|evangelical]] [[free church]]es, and, towards the end of the century, [[secularism]], leading many to distance themselves from church rituals.

The nation's most well-known artists are painters such as [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Anders Zorn]], and the sculptors [[Tobias Sergel]] and [[Carl Milles]].\n\nSwedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with [[Mauritz Stiller]] and [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]]. In the 1920s\u20131980s, the filmmaker [[Ingmar Bergman]] and actors [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] became internationally noted people within cinema.

Early Swedish stone buildings are the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches on the country side. As so happens, many of them were built in Scania and are in effect Danish churches. This would include the [[Lund Cathedral]] from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in [[Dalby, Lund|Dalby]], but also many early [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malm\u00f6 and Helsingborg.\n\nCathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops. The [[Skara Cathedral]] is of bricks from the 14th century, and the [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in the 15th. In 1230 the foundations of the [[Link\u00f6ping]] Cathedral were made, the material was there [[limestone]], but the building took some 250 years to finish.\n\nAmong older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at [[Borgholm Castle]], [[Halltorps Manor]] and [[Eketorp]] fortress on the island \u00d6land, the [[Nyk\u00f6ping]] fortress and the [[Visby city wall]].\n\n[[File:Kalmar domkyrka 002.jpg|thumb|[[Kalmar Cathedral]]]]\nAround 1520 Sweden was out of the [[Middle Ages]] and united under King Gustav Vasa, who immediately initiated grand mansions, castles and fortresses to be built. Some of the more magnificent include [[Kalmar Castle]], [[Gripsholm Castle]] and the one at [[Vadstena]].\n\nIn the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by [[Baroque architecture]] and later the [[rococo]]. Notable projects from that time include the city Karlskrona, which has now also been declared a World Heritage Site and the [[Drottningholm Palace]].\n\n1930 was the year of the great Stockholm exhibition, which marked the breakthrough of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], or \"funkis\" as it became known. The style came to dominate in the following decades. Some notable projects of this kind were the [[Million Programme]], offering affordable living in large apartment complexes.\n\nThe [[Ericsson Globe]] is the largest hemispherical building on Earth, Shaped like a large white ball, and took two and a half years to build. It's located in Stockholm.\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media in Sweden}}\n[[File:Sveriges Television, 2.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of [[Sveriges Television]] in Stockholm]]\nSwedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' (liberal), ''[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]'' (liberal), ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' (liberal conservative) and ''[[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]]'' (liberal). The two largest evening [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] are ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' (social democratic) and ''[[Expressen]]'' (liberal). The ad-financed, free international morning paper, ''[[Metro International]]'', was founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by, among others, ''[[The Local]]'' (liberal).<ref>{{cite book |first=Kenneth E. |last=Olson |title=The history makers;: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965 |publisher=LSU Press |year=1966 |pages=33\u201349}}</ref>\n\nThe public broadcasting companies held a monopoly on radio and television for a long time in Sweden. Licence funded radio broadcasts started in 1925. A second radio network was started in 1954 and a third opened 1962 in response to pirate radio stations. Non-profit [[Community radio#Sweden|community radio]] was allowed in 1979 and in 1993 commercial local radio started.\n\nThe licence-funded television service was officially launched in 1956. A second channel, [[SVT2|TV2]], was launched in 1969. These two channels (operated by [[Sveriges Television]] since the late 1970s) held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available. The first Swedish language satellite service was [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] which started broadcasting from London in 1987. It was followed by [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]] in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the [[terrestrial television|terrestrial network]]. TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country.\n\nAround half the population are connected to cable television. [[Digital terrestrial television in Sweden]] started in 1999 and the last analogue terrestrial broadcasts were terminated in 2007.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Swedish literature}}\n[[File:Portrait of August Strindberg by Richard Bergh 1905.jpg|upright|thumb|The writer and playwright [[August Strindberg]]]]\n\nThe first literary text from Sweden is the [[R\u00f6k Runestone]], carved during the Viking Age c. 800 AD. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the [[Middle Ages]], during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore, there are only a few texts in the [[Swedish language#Old Swedish|Old Swedish]] from that period. Swedish literature only flourished when the Swedish language was standardised in the 16th century, a standardisation largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so-called [[Gustav Vasa Bible]].\n\nWith improved education and the freedom brought by [[secularisation]], the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (17th century), who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish; [[Johan Henric Kellgren]] (18th century), the first to write fluent Swedish prose; Carl Michael Bellman (late 18th century), the first writer of [[burlesque]] ballads; and August Strindberg (late 19th century), a socio-realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, (Nobel laureate 1909), [[Verner von Heidenstam]] (Nobel laureate 1916) and [[P\u00e4r Lagerkvist]] (Nobel laureate 1951).\n\nIn recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, including the detective novelist [[Henning Mankell]] and the writer of spy fiction [[Jan Guillou]]. The Swedish writer to have made the most lasting impression on world literature is the children's book writer Astrid Lindgren, and her books about [[Pippi Longstocking]], [[Emil i L\u00f6nneberga|Emil]], and others. In 2008, the second best-selling fiction author in the world was [[Stieg Larsson]], whose ''Millennium'' series of crime novels is being published posthumously to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/15/bestselling-fiction-authors-in-the-world-for-2008/ |title=Bestselling fiction authors in the world for 2008 |publisher=Abebooks.com |access-date=5 September 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120529183203/http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/15/bestselling-fiction-authors-in-the-world-for-2008/ |archive-date=29 May 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Larsson drew heavily on the work of Lindgren by basing his central character, Lisbeth Salander, on Longstocking.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/26/stieg-larsson-thriller-novels-sweden|title=Poisoned Legacy Left By The King Of Thrillers|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2014|date=25 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013155817/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/26/stieg-larsson-thriller-novels-sweden|archive-date=13 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Holidays===\n{{Main|Public holidays in Sweden}}\n[[File:Valborgsbrasa-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walpurgis Night]] bonfire in Sweden]]\nApart from traditional Protestant [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]], Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition. They include [[Midsummer]] celebrating the summer [[solstice]]; [[Walpurgis Night]] (''Valborgsm\u00e4ssoafton'') on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or Mayday on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations. The day of giver-of-light [[Saint Lucy|Saint Lucia]], 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season.\n\n6 June is the [[National holiday of Sweden|National Day of Sweden]] and has since 2005 been a public holiday. Furthermore, there are [[Flag days in Sweden|official flag day]] observances and a [[Namesdays in Sweden]] calendar. In August many Swedes have ''kr\u00e4ftskivor'' (crayfish dinner parties). [[Martin of Tours]] Eve is celebrated in [[Scania]] in November with ''M\u00e5rten G\u00e5s'' parties, where roast goose and ''[[svartsoppa]]'' ('black soup', made of goose stock, fruit, spices, spirits and goose blood) are served. The [[Sami people|Sami]], one of Sweden's indigenous minorities, have their holiday on 6 February and Scania celebrate their Scanian Flag day on the third Sunday in July.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Swedish cuisine}}\n[[File:Sveriges Nationaldag 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[cinnamon roll]]s originated in Sweden and Denmark.]]\n[[File:Knaeckebroed.jpg|thumb|Swedish kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d ([[crisp bread]])]]\n\nSwedish cuisine, like that of the other [[Scandinavia]]n countries ([[Cuisine of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Cuisine of Norway|Norway]] and [[Cuisine of Finland|Finland]]), was traditionally simple. Fish (particularly [[herring]]), meat, potatoes and [[dairy products]] played prominent roles. Spices were sparse. Preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and [[lingonberry jam]]; pancakes; ''[[lutefisk|lutfisk]]''; and the [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]], or lavish buffet. ''[[Akvavit]]'' is a popular alcoholic [[distilled beverage]], and the drinking of ''[[snaps]]'' is of cultural importance. The traditional flat and dry [[crisp bread]] has developed into several contemporary variants. Regionally important foods are the ''[[surstr\u00f6mming]]'' (a fermented fish) in northern Sweden and [[eel]] in Scania in southern Sweden.\n\nSwedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, are still an important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern-day Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes.\n\nIn August, at the traditional feast known as crayfish party, ''[[kr\u00e4ftskiva]]'', Swedes eat large amounts of [[crayfish]] boiled with dill.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sweden}}\nSwedes have been fairly prominent in the film area through the years. A number of Swedish people have found success in Hollywood, including Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo and [[Max von Sydow]]. Amongst several directors who have made internationally successful films can be mentioned Ingmar Bergman, Lukas Moodysson and Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m.\n\n===Fashion===\nInterest in fashion is big in Sweden and the country is headquartering famous brands like [[H&M|Hennes & Mauritz]] (operating as H&M), [[J. Lindeberg]] (operating as JL), [[Acne Jeans|Acne]], [[Lindex]], [[Odd Molly]], [[Cheap Monday]], [[Gant U.S.A.|Gant]], [[WESC]], [[Filippa K]], and [[Nakkna]] within its borders. These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Sweden}}\n[[File:Bj\u00f6rn Borg2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Former World No. 1 tennis player [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]]]]\nSport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating in organised sporting activities.

Athletics has enjoyed a surge in popularity due to several successful athletes in recent years, such as [[Carolina Kl\u00fcft]] and [[Stefan Holm]].\n\nSweden hosted the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]].

In [[Old English]] the country was named ''Sw\u00e9oland'' and ''Sw\u00edor\u00edce'' ([[Old Norse]] ''Sv\u00edar\u00edki''). [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] of the 12th and 13th centuries used ''Suane'', ''Swane'' (with the adjective as ''Suaneis''). In [[Scots language|Scots]] ''Swane'', ''Swaine'', appears in the 16th century.  [[Early Modern English]] used ''Swedeland''.<ref>{{OED|Sweden|ID=195631}}</ref>\n\nThe Swedish name ''Sverige'' (a compound of the words ''Svea'' and ''rike'', with [[lenition]] of the consonant [k], first recorded in the cognate ''Sw\u0113orice'' in [[Beowulf]])<ref>{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |trans-title=Swedish etymological dictionary |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerup |location=Lund |language=Swedish |page=917 |url=http://runeberg.org/svetym/1005.html |access-date=30 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828081321/http://runeberg.org/svetym/1005.html |archive-date=28 August 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> literally means \"realm of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]]\", excluding the [[Geats]] in [[G\u00f6taland]].\n\nVariations of the name ''Sweden'' are used in most languages, with the exception of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] using ''Sverige'', [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Sv\u00f8r\u00edki'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'', and the more notable exception of some [[Finnic languages]] where ''Ruotsi'' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and ''Rootsi'' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]) are used, names commonly considered as referring to the people from the coastal areas of [[Roslagen]], [[Uppland]], who were known as the ''[[Rus' people|Rus']]'', and through them etymologically related to the English name for [[Russia]].\n\nThe etymology of ''Swedes'', and thus ''Sweden'', is generally not agreed upon but may derive from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''Swihoniz'' meaning \"one's own\",<ref>{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |url=https://archive.org/details/svensketymologis00hell |trans-title=Swedish etymological dictionary |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerup |location=Lund |language=Swedish |page=[https://archive.org/details/svensketymologis00hell/page/915 915]}}</ref> referring to one's own Germanic tribe.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Sweden}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{Main|Prehistoric Sweden}}\n[[File:Vendel I helmet 456057.jpg|thumb|A [[Vendel Period|Vendel-era]] helmet, at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]]\nSweden's prehistory begins in the [[Aller\u00f8d oscillation]],{{according to whom|date=May 2015}} a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late [[Palaeolithic]] [[reindeer]]-hunting camps of the [[Bromme culture]] at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, [[Scania]]. This period was characterised by small bands of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer-fishers]] using [[flint]] technology.\n\nSweden is first described in a written source in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' by [[Tacitus]] in 98 AD. In [[s:Germania#XLIV|Germania 44 and 45]] he mentions the Swedes (''Suiones'') as a powerful tribe (''distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets'') with ships that had a [[prow]] at each end ([[longship]]s). Which kings (''kuningaz'') ruled these Suiones is unknown, but [[Norse mythology]] presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the [[runic alphabet|runic script]] was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke [[Proto-Norse]] at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other [[North Germanic languages]].{{Primary source inline|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the 6th century, [[Jordanes]] names two tribes living in [[Scandza]], both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the ''Suetidi'' and ''Suehans''. ''Suetidi'' is considered to be the Latin form of ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'', the Old Norse name for the Swedes. Jordanes describes the ''Suetidi'' and ''[[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Dani]]'' as being of the same stock and the tallest of people. He later mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of a same stature.{{Primary source inline|date=May 2015}} The ''Suehans'' were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the ''[[Thuringians|Thyringi]]'' of ''Germania'' (''alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis''). The Icelandic historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] also wrote that the Swedish king [[Adils]] (Eadgils) had the finest horses of his day.\n\n===The Vikings===\n{{See also|Early Swedish history|Foundation of Modern Sweden|Varangians}}\n[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|left|[[Viking]] expeditions (blue lines)]]\n\nThe Swedish [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and [[Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, the [[Baltic countries]], Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the [[Black Sea]] and even as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|through the Dnieper]] south to [[Constantinople]], on which they carried out numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. The Swedish Vikings, called [[Rus (people)|Rus]] are believed to be the founding fathers of [[Kievan Rus']]. The Arab traveller [[Ibn Fadlan]] described these Vikings as follows:\n\n{{quote|I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the [[Volga|Itil]]. I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an axe, a sword, and a knife, and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved, of Frankish sort.<ref>Quoted from: Gwyn Jones. ''A History of the Vikings''.

There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England runestones]]. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor. What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness.\n\n=== The Kingdom of Sweden ===\nIt is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the [[list of Swedish monarchs]] is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both [[Svealand]] (Sweden) and G\u00f6taland (Gothia) as one province, beginning with [[Eric the Victorious]]. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem ''Beowulf'' describes semi-legendary [[Swedish-Geatish wars]] in the 6th century. ''G\u00f6taland'' in this sense mainly includes the provinces of [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]] (East Gothia) and [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] (West Gothia). The island of [[Gotland]] was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time (Danish, Hanseatic, and Gotland-domestic). [[Sm\u00e5land]] was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of [[Kalmar]] with its castle was of importance. The south-west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces ([[Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]]). North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province [[Bohusl\u00e4n]].

Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry, and some became labourers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of the province of [[Dalsland]] would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish, which they consumed, while the iron would be shipped abroad.<ref>Scott, pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Sweden was struck by the [[Black Death]].<ref>Scott, pp. 56\u201357.</ref> The population of Sweden and most of Europe was seriously decimated. The population (at same territory) did not reach the numbers of the year 1348 again until the beginning of the 19th century. One third of the population died in the triennium of 1349\u20131351. During this period, the Swedish cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] effected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility.\n\n[[File:Gustav Vasa.jpg|thumb|left|185px|[[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]] [[Swedish War of Liberation|liberated]] Sweden from [[Christian II of Denmark]], ending the [[Kalmar Union]]. He established the [[House of Vasa]] which ruled Sweden and [[Poland]] until the 17th century]]\n\nMany times the Swedish crown was inherited by children kings over the course of the kingdom's existence; consequently real power was held for long periods by regents (notably those of the [[Sture]] family) chosen by the Swedish parliament. King [[Christian II of Denmark]], who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm in 1520. This came to be known as the \"[[Stockholm blood bath]]\" and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 June (now Sweden's national holiday) in 1523, they made [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] their king.<ref>Scott, p. 121.</ref> This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern Sweden]]. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nThe Hanseatic League had been officially formed at [[L\u00fcbeck]] on the Baltic coast of [[Holy Roman Empire|Northern Germany]] in 1356. The League sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert S. |last1=Hoyt |first2=Stanley |last2=Chodorow |title=Europe in the Middle Ages |url=https://archive.org/details/europeinmiddleag00robe |url-access=registration |publisher=Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich, Inc. |location=New York |year=1976 |page=[https://archive.org/details/europeinmiddleag00robe/page/628 628]}}</ref> In exchange, they offered a certain amount of protection to the joining cities.

They sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes. With these concessions, L\u00fcbeck merchants flocked to Stockholm, where they soon came to dominate the city's economic life and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden.<ref name=\"Scott, p. 52\">Scott, p. 52.</ref> Under the Hanseatic trade, two-thirds of Stockholm's imports consisted of [[textiles]], while the remaining third was [[salt]]. The main exports from Sweden were [[iron]] and [[copper]].<ref name=\"Scott, p. 52\"/>\n\nHowever, the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa (mostly consisting of German citizens), and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]] broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people.<ref>Scott, p. 132.</ref> History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustav would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop, freed itself from the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class.<ref>Scott, pp. 156\u2013157.</ref>\n\nThe end of the 16th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities.

Before the emergence of the Swedish Empire, Sweden was a poor and scarcely populated country on the fringe of European civilisation, with no significant power or reputation.

From 1643 to 1645, during the last years of the war, Sweden and [[Denmark-Norway]] fought the [[Torstenson War]].

The country can be divided into three types of climate: the southernmost part has an [[oceanic climate]], the central part has a [[humid continental climate]] and the northernmost part has a [[subarctic climate]].\nHowever, Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the combination of the [[Gulf Stream]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/impact/gulf_stream.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=BBC Climate and the Gulf Stream |accessdate=29 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928040727/http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/impact/gulf_stream.shtml |archive-date=28 September 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/ |title=The Gulf Stream Myth |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=393\u2013394 |accessdate=29 October 2008 |bibcode=1900MWRv...28..393W |last1=Watts |first1=Harvey Maitland |year=1900 |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1900)28[393:TGSM]2.0.CO;2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225021029/http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/ |archive-date=25 February 2011 |url-status=live  |doi-access=free }}</ref> and the general west wind drift, caused by the direction of planet Earth's rotation.

Temperatures expected in Sweden are heavily influenced by the large Fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental Europe and western Russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to Sweden. That, in turn, renders most of Sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby [[British Isles]], even matching temperatures found along the continental Atlantic coast as far south as in northern [[Spain]]. In winter, however, the same high-pressure systems sometimes put the entire country far below freezing temperatures. There is some maritime moderation from the Atlantic which renders the Swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby Russia. Even though temperature patterns differ between north and south, the summer climate is surprisingly similar all through the entire country in spite of the large latitudinal differences. This is due to the south's being surrounded by a greater mass of water, with the wider Baltic Sea and the Atlantic air passing over lowland areas from the south-west.\n\nApart from the ice-free Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover. By the time winter finally breaks through, daylight hours rise quickly, ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring. With the greater number of clear nights, frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as April. The cold winters occur when low-pressure systems are weaker. An example is that the coldest ever month (January 1987) in Stockholm was also the sunniest January month on record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_jan15.pdf?71642|title=Precipitation, Sunshine & Radiation for January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv|publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]]|accessdate=31 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212312/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_jan15.pdf?71642|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?18701|title=Temperature & Wind \u2013 January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv|publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]]|accessdate=31 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212312/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?18701|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe relative strength of low and high-pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers.

Despite northerly locations, southern and central Sweden may have almost no snow in some winters. Most of Sweden is located in the [[rain shadow]] of the Scandinavian Mountains through Norway and north-west Sweden. The blocking of cool and wet air in summer, as well as the greater landmass, leads to warm and dry summers far north in the country, with quite warm summers at the Bothnia Bay coast at 65 degrees latitude, which is unheard of elsewhere in the world at such northerly coastlines.\n\n'''Swedish Meteorological Institute, SMHI's monthly average temperatures of some of their weather stations \u2013 for the latest scientific full prefixed thirty-year period 1961\u20131990'''\nNext will be presented in year 2020.

In the first case, Svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way. However, historians usually start the line of [[Swedish monarchs]] from when Svealand and G\u00f6taland were ruled under the same king, namely Eric the Victorious (Geat) and his son [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung]] in the 10th century. These events are often described as the [[consolidation of Sweden]], although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later.\n\nEarlier kings, for which no reliable historical sources exist, can be read about in [[mythical kings of Sweden]] and [[semi-legendary kings of Sweden]].

Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.<ref name=\"NB335-339\" />\n\nSweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a [[war|state of war]] since the end of the [[Swedish campaign against Norway (1814)|Swedish campaign against Norway]] in 1814.

In 1952, a Swedish [[DC-3]] was [[Catalina affair|shot down]] over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] [[jet aircraft|jet]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]].

It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the [[Third World]].\n\nOn 27 October 1981, a [[Whiskey-class submarine]] ([[Soviet submarine S-363|''U 137'']]) from the [[Soviet Union]] ran aground close to the [[Karlskrona naval base|naval base]] at [[Karlskrona]] in the southern part of the country. Research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against Swedish military potential. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union. Following the [[Assassination of Olof Palme|1986 assassination of Olof Palme]] and with the end of the Cold War, Sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach. Nevertheless, the country remains active in peace keeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget.\n\nSince 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Swedish Armed Forces|Law enforcement in Sweden}}\n[[File:Swedish JAS-39 Gripen landing.jpg|thumb|The Saab [[JAS 39 Gripen]] is an advanced Swedish multi-role [[fighter aircraft]] of the [[Swedish Air Force]].]]\nThe [[Law enforcement in Sweden|law is enforced in Sweden]] by several government entities.

During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of [[Lutheran orthodoxy]], small groups of non-Lutherans, especially [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]], the [[Moravian Church]] and [[French Huguenots]] played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gritsch|first1=Eric|title=A History of Lutheranism|date=2010|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9781451407754|pages=351|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ApWxByVqe-MC&dq=lutheranism+history+in+sweden|accessdate=20 March 2017}}</ref> The [[Sami people|Sami]] originally had their own [[Animism|shamanistic religion]], but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n[[File:Katarina kyrka February 2015 02.jpg|thumb|left|The Protestant [[Katarina Church]] in Stockholm]]\n[[File:Moske Malmo 2014Jun17 0002-3.jpg|thumb|left|The second oldest mosque in Sweden is the [[Malm\u00f6 Mosque]]]]\n\nWith religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including [[History of the Jews in Sweden|Judaism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], were allowed to live and work freely in the country. However, until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutherans to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various [[Low church|evangelical]] [[free church]]es, and, towards the end of the century, [[secularism]], leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another [[Christian denomination]].

The nation's most well-known artists are painters such as [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Anders Zorn]], and the sculptors [[Tobias Sergel]] and [[Carl Milles]].\n\nSwedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with [[Mauritz Stiller]] and [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]]. In the 1920s\u20131980s, the filmmaker [[Ingmar Bergman]] and actors [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] became internationally noted people within cinema.

Early Swedish stone buildings are the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches on the country side. As so happens, many of them were built in Scania and are in effect Danish churches. This would include the [[Lund Cathedral]] from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in [[Dalby, Lund|Dalby]], but also many early [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malm\u00f6 and Helsingborg.\n\nCathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops. The [[Skara Cathedral]] is of bricks from the 14th century, and the [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in the 15th. In 1230 the foundations of the [[Link\u00f6ping]] Cathedral were made, the material was there [[limestone]], but the building took some 250 years to finish.\n\nAmong older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at [[Borgholm Castle]], [[Halltorps Manor]] and [[Eketorp]] fortress on the island \u00d6land, the [[Nyk\u00f6ping]] fortress and the [[Visby city wall]].\n\n[[File:Kalmar domkyrka 002.jpg|thumb|[[Kalmar Cathedral]]]]\nAround 1520 Sweden was out of the [[Middle Ages]] and united under King Gustav Vasa, who immediately initiated grand mansions, castles and fortresses to be built. Some of the more magnificent include [[Kalmar Castle]], [[Gripsholm Castle]] and the one at [[Vadstena]].\n\nIn the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by [[Baroque architecture]] and later the [[rococo]]. Notable projects from that time include the city Karlskrona, which has now also been declared a World Heritage Site and the [[Drottningholm Palace]].\n\n1930 was the year of the great Stockholm exhibition, which marked the breakthrough of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], or \"funkis\" as it became known. The style came to dominate in the following decades. Some notable projects of this kind were the [[Million Programme]], offering affordable living in large apartment complexes.\n\nThe [[Ericsson Globe]] is the largest hemispherical building on Earth, Shaped like a large white ball, and took two and a half years to build. It's located in Stockholm.\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media in Sweden}}\n[[File:Sveriges Television, 2.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of [[Sveriges Television]] in Stockholm]]\nSwedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' (liberal), ''[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]'' (liberal), ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' (liberal conservative) and ''[[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]]'' (liberal). The two largest evening [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] are ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' (social democratic) and ''[[Expressen]]'' (liberal). The ad-financed, free international morning paper, ''[[Metro International]]'', was founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by, among others, ''[[The Local]]'' (liberal).<ref>{{cite book |first=Kenneth E. |last=Olson |title=The history makers;: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965 |publisher=LSU Press |year=1966 |pages=33\u201349}}</ref>\n\nThe public broadcasting companies held a monopoly on radio and television for a long time in Sweden. Licence funded radio broadcasts started in 1925. A second radio network was started in 1954 and a third opened 1962 in response to pirate radio stations. Non-profit [[Community radio#Sweden|community radio]] was allowed in 1979 and in 1993 commercial local radio started.\n\nThe licence-funded television service was officially launched in 1956. A second channel, [[SVT2|TV2]], was launched in 1969. These two channels (operated by [[Sveriges Television]] since the late 1970s) held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available. The first Swedish language satellite service was [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] which started broadcasting from London in 1987. It was followed by [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]] in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the [[terrestrial television|terrestrial network]]. TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country.\n\nAround half the population are connected to cable television. [[Digital terrestrial television in Sweden]] started in 1999 and the last analogue terrestrial broadcasts were terminated in 2007.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Swedish literature}}\n[[File:Portrait of August Strindberg by Richard Bergh 1905.jpg|upright|thumb|The writer and playwright [[August Strindberg]]]]\n\nThe first literary text from Sweden is the [[R\u00f6k Runestone]], carved during the Viking Age c. 800 AD. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the [[Middle Ages]], during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore, there are only a few texts in the [[Swedish language#Old Swedish|Old Swedish]] from that period. Swedish literature only flourished when the Swedish language was standardised in the 16th century, a standardisation largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so-called [[Gustav Vasa Bible]].\n\nWith improved education and the freedom brought by [[secularisation]], the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (17th century), who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish; [[Johan Henric Kellgren]] (18th century), the first to write fluent Swedish prose; Carl Michael Bellman (late 18th century), the first writer of [[burlesque]] ballads; and August Strindberg (late 19th century), a socio-realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, (Nobel laureate 1909), [[Verner von Heidenstam]] (Nobel laureate 1916) and [[P\u00e4r Lagerkvist]] (Nobel laureate 1951).\n\nIn recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, including the detective novelist [[Henning Mankell]] and the writer of spy fiction [[Jan Guillou]]. The Swedish writer to have made the most lasting impression on world literature is the children's book writer Astrid Lindgren, and her books about [[Pippi Longstocking]], [[Emil i L\u00f6nneberga|Emil]], and others. In 2008, the second best-selling fiction author in the world was [[Stieg Larsson]], whose ''Millennium'' series of crime novels is being published posthumously to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/15/bestselling-fiction-authors-in-the-world-for-2008/ |title=Bestselling fiction authors in the world for 2008 |publisher=Abebooks.com |access-date=5 September 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120529183203/http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/15/bestselling-fiction-authors-in-the-world-for-2008/ |archive-date=29 May 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Larsson drew heavily on the work of Lindgren by basing his central character, Lisbeth Salander, on Longstocking.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/26/stieg-larsson-thriller-novels-sweden|title=Poisoned Legacy Left By The King Of Thrillers|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2014|date=25 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013155817/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/26/stieg-larsson-thriller-novels-sweden|archive-date=13 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Holidays===\n{{Main|Public holidays in Sweden}}\n[[File:Valborgsbrasa-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walpurgis Night]] bonfire in Sweden]]\nApart from traditional Protestant [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]], Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition. They include [[Midsummer]] celebrating the summer [[solstice]]; [[Walpurgis Night]] (''Valborgsm\u00e4ssoafton'') on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or Mayday on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations. The day of giver-of-light [[Saint Lucy|Saint Lucia]], 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season.\n\n6 June is the [[National holiday of Sweden|National Day of Sweden]] and has since 2005 been a public holiday. Furthermore, there are [[Flag days in Sweden|official flag day]] observances and a [[Namesdays in Sweden]] calendar. In August many Swedes have ''kr\u00e4ftskivor'' (crayfish dinner parties). [[Martin of Tours]] Eve is celebrated in [[Scania]] in November with ''M\u00e5rten G\u00e5s'' parties, where roast goose and ''[[svartsoppa]]'' ('black soup', made of goose stock, fruit, spices, spirits and goose blood) are served. The [[Sami people|Sami]], one of Sweden's indigenous minorities, have their holiday on 6 February and Scania celebrate their Scanian Flag day on the third Sunday in July.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Swedish cuisine}}\n[[File:Sveriges Nationaldag 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[cinnamon roll]]s originated in Sweden and Denmark.]]\n[[File:Knaeckebroed.jpg|thumb|Swedish kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d ([[crisp bread]])]]\n\nSwedish cuisine, like that of the other [[Scandinavia]]n countries ([[Cuisine of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Cuisine of Norway|Norway]] and [[Cuisine of Finland|Finland]]), was traditionally simple. Fish (particularly [[herring]]), meat, potatoes and [[dairy products]] played prominent roles. Spices were sparse. Preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and [[lingonberry jam]]; pancakes; ''[[lutefisk|lutfisk]]''; and the [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]], or lavish buffet. ''[[Akvavit]]'' is a popular alcoholic [[distilled beverage]], and the drinking of ''[[snaps]]'' is of cultural importance. The traditional flat and dry [[crisp bread]] has developed into several contemporary variants. Regionally important foods are the ''[[surstr\u00f6mming]]'' (a fermented fish) in northern Sweden and [[eel]] in Scania in southern Sweden.\n\nSwedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, are still an important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern-day Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes.\n\nIn August, at the traditional feast known as crayfish party, ''[[kr\u00e4ftskiva]]'', Swedes eat large amounts of [[crayfish]] boiled with dill.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sweden}}\nSwedes have been fairly prominent in the film area through the years. A number of Swedish people have found success in Hollywood, including Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo and [[Max von Sydow]]. Amongst several directors who have made internationally successful films can be mentioned Ingmar Bergman, Lukas Moodysson and Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m.\n\n===Fashion===\nInterest in fashion is big in Sweden and the country is headquartering famous brands like [[H&M|Hennes & Mauritz]] (operating as H&M), [[J. Lindeberg]] (operating as JL), [[Acne Jeans|Acne]], [[Lindex]], [[Odd Molly]], [[Cheap Monday]], [[Gant U.S.A.|Gant]], [[WESC]], [[Filippa K]], and [[Nakkna]] within its borders. These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Sweden}}\n[[File:Bj\u00f6rn Borg2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Former World No. 1 tennis player [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]]]]\nSport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating in organised sporting activities.

Second to football, [[Horse#Sport|horse sports]] have the highest number of practitioners who are mostly women.{{ambiguous|date=February 2018}}<!--should probably be \"most of whom are women\"?--> Thereafter, golf, [[track and field]], and the [[team sport]]s of [[handball]], [[floorball]], basketball and [[bandy]] are the most popular.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe Swedish national men's ice hockey team, affectionately known as ''[[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Tre Kronor]]'' (English: [[Three Crowns]]; the national symbol of Sweden), is regarded as one of the best in the world. The team has won the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]] nine times, placing them third in the all-time medal count. Tre Kronor also won Olympic gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]]. In 2006, Tre Kronor became the first national hockey team to win both the Olympic and world championships in the same year. The [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national football team]] has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. Athletics has enjoyed a surge in popularity due to several successful athletes in recent years, such as [[Carolina Kl\u00fcft]] and [[Stefan Holm]].\n\nSweden hosted the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]. Other big sports events include the [[UEFA Euro 1992]], [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup]], [[1995 World Championships in Athletics]], [[UEFA Women's Euro 2013]], and several championships of ice hockey, [[curling]], athletics, [[skiing]], [[Bandy World Championship|bandy]], [[figure skating]] and swimming.\n\nSuccessful football players include [[Gunnar Nordahl]], [[Gunnar Gren]], [[Nils Liedholm]], [[Henrik Larsson]], [[Freddie Ljungberg]], [[Caroline Seger]], [[Lotta Schelin]], [[Hedvig Lindahl]], and [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]]. Successful tennis players include former world number 1 players [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]], [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Stefan Edberg]]. Other famous Swedish athletes include the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion and [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]]r [[Ingemar Johansson]], [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]r [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]], and multiple World Championships and Olympics medalist in table tennis [[Jan-Ove Waldner]]. Due to its northerly latitude numerous world class winter sports athletes have come from Sweden. This includes alpine skiers [[Ingemar Stenmark]], [[Anja P\u00e4rson]] and [[Pernilla Wiberg]] as well as cross country-skiers [[Gunde Svan]], [[Thomas Wassberg]], [[Charlotte Kalla]] and [[Marcus Hellner]], all Olympic gold medalists.\n\nIn 2016, The Swedish Poker Federation (Svepof) has joined The [[International Federation of Poker]] (IFP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pokerfed.org/2016/05/17/sweden-becomes-member-ifp-family/|title=Sweden Becomes a Member of the IFP Family|last=Goenka|first=Varun|date=17 May 2016|website=International Federation of Poker|access-date=4 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715082640/http://pokerfed.org/2016/05/17/sweden-becomes-member-ifp-family/|archive-date=15 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==International rankings==\nThe following are links to international rankings of Sweden from selected research institutes and foundations including economic output and various composite indices.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
