As of 2010, the population was estimated to be 33,771.<ref name=\"United States Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3979002|title=QuickFacts: Upper Arlington, City|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Census|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe land that is currently Upper Arlington was first known to be inhabited by the [[Adena culture|Adena people]], renowned for building conical mounds for burial sites. Centuries later the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, [[Jonathan Dayton]] and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.\n\nBrothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres, land south of the current Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] They first referred to the area as the \"Country Club District\" modeled after the Country Club development in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], but by 1917 the community became known as \"Upper Arlington\" in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as [[Marble Cliff]]). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a street-car shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library.\n\nThe development proceeded according to the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]]\u2013inspired plan by [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.\n\nIn 1916, the development was interrupted when the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio's [[Governor of Ohio|governor]] at the time, [[Frank B. Willis]]. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against [[Pancho Villa]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.\n\nMany restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. From 1930 to 1945, 77.3% of the 22 new subdivisions built in the Columbus, Ohio area either explicitly prohibited African Americans or permitted only whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueckeberg|first=Donald A.|date=January 1996|title=Reviews : Planning for the Private Interest: Land Use Controls and Residential Patterns in Columbus, Ohio, 1900-1970.

Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington's northern border since 1969.\n\nThe annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.\n\nOther Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.\n[[File:Founding Families.jpg|left|thumb|Richards & McCoy Reunion]]\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic [[ranch-style house]]s like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the \"Upper Arlington Historic District\" (or colloquially \"Old Arlington\" or \"South of Lane\"), was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.\n\n==Geography==\nUpper Arlington is bordered on the west by the [[Scioto River]], on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by [[Marble Cliff, Ohio|Marble Cliff]] and [[Grandview Heights, Ohio|Grandview Heights]]. The [[Olentangy River]] and the main campus of the [[Ohio State University]] are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington's eastern border.\n\nThe city is around 800&nbsp;ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the [[Scioto River]]. However, the Turkey Run is longer. It originates in the north then runs southwards until it makes an eastward bend around Reed Rd. Then, it flows eastwards through the OSU Golf Course. The run is used as a storm drain at points, has been dammed in the Ohio State course and runs through concrete pipes at two points. The soil is [[Till|glacial till]] and is suitable for agriculture, supporting a research farm operated by [[The Ohio State University]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 620\n|1930= 3059\n|1940= 5370\n|1950= 9024\n|1960= 28486\n|1970= 38727\n|1980= 35648\n|1990= 34128\n|2000= 33686\n|2010= 33771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=35522\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the 2010 census, the population was 33,771 persons, 16,157 male (47.84%) and 17,614 female (52.16%).

Other elementary schools include Greensview, Tremont and Windermere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaschools.org/|title=Upper Arlington City Schools|website=www.uaschools.org|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\nHastings Middle School was built in the 1960s and serves the northern area of the district. Jones Middle School is located in the former high school building that was also the site of the Willis National Guard Camp and serves the southern portion. [[Upper Arlington High School (Ohio)|Upper Arlington High School]] serves students from the entire district and boasts membership in the [[International Baccalaureate]] program. The Upper Arlington High School mascot is the Golden Bear, which became the nickname of professional golfer [[Jack Nicklaus]], an alumnus of the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaschools.org/|title=Upper Arlington City Schools|website=www.uaschools.org|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the city are a private K-12 school, The [[Wellington School, The (Columbus, Ohio)|Wellington School]] and two [[Catholic school|Catholic grade schools]]\u2014St. Agatha and St. Andrew.

The City Council is elected by citizens and then hires a professional City Manager to run day-to-day operations and implement policy passed by Council.\n\nUpper Arlington's Community Development Department coordinates the many aspects involved in the City's growth, development and preservation Building, Planning and Property Maintenance divisions, with development projects guided and served by an award-winning, streamlined review and zoning process. An Economic Development Division provides a range of services to help existing, new and expanding businesses grow and be successful in the community while diversifying and expanding the range of businesses, and amenities available to residents and strengthening the tax base. The Engineering Division manages the City's public infrastructure\u2014such as roads, waterlines, sanitary and storm sewer systems, and public right-of-way\u2014with a 10-year Capital Improvement Program in place to ensure proactive reinvestment in these critical community assets. The Public Works Division focuses on vital services that keep motorists traveling safely within our community throughout the seasons, including minor road repairs, street cleaning, snow removal and leaf collection.\n\nThe City is always looking for innovative ways to bring the best care and public safety to the community. This is done through a variety of services including: CARES, Bike Helmets for Kids, Blood Pressure Checks, CPR Training, and Safe Baby Training. Upper Arlington's Fire Division also staffs all medic trucks with at least two paramedics and all fire apparatus with at least one paramedic at all times. The Police Division provides 24-hour service and is an integral part of developing and maintaining a safe and secure community.\n\nThe Parks & Recreation Department fulfills the recreational, cultural and educational needs of the community through an exciting array of programs and activities, as well as maintaining the City's beautiful parks, street trees and other public spaces. They offer programs and activities for youth, adult and senior adults varying from cultural arts, aquatics and tennis, culinary and crafts.\n\nUpper Arlington oversees and maintains 21 parks covering approximately 186 acres. Park facilities include playgrounds, sports fields, shelters and picnic areas, walking paths, fitness trails and wooded areas. In addition, the City owns and operates three outdoor community swimming pools \u2013 Tremont Pool, Devon Pool, and the Reed Road Water Park \u2013 which are open Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://upperarlingtonoh.gov/|title=City of Upper Arlington \u2013 Cherished Past &#9733 Golden Future|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== Upper Arlington Public Library ==\nThe Upper Arlington Public Library system comprises the Main Library, a 60,000 square foot facility located on Tremont Road near the geographic center of the city, the 10,000 square foot Lane Road Branch, approximately three miles to the north, and the 4,400 square foot Miller Park Branch, one and one half miles south near the center of Old Arlington. Prior to 1967, the libraries in Upper Arlington were branches of the Grandview Heights Public Library. After circulation at the Upper Arlington branches surpassed their parent library, Mayor John Dunkel spearheaded an effort to challenge a law prohibiting new library systems in Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ualibrary.org/|title=Upper Arlington Public Library|website=Upper Arlington Public Library|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> Thanks to his perseverance, the Ohio General Assembly passed Ohio House Bill No. 494 in 1967, allowing Upper Arlington to independently establish and govern its own library system. Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2017, the Upper Arlington Library System is considered a community jewel, providing opportunities for lifelong learning and fellowship.\n\n==Sister city==\nThe city is sister cities with [[St. Andrews]], [[Scotland]].\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[John W.

As of 2010, the population was estimated to be 33,771.<ref name=\"United States Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3979002|title=QuickFacts: Upper Arlington, City|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Census|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe land that is currently Upper Arlington was first known to be inhabited by the [[Adena culture|Adena people]], renowned for building conical mounds for burial sites. Centuries later the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, [[Jonathan Dayton]] and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.\n\nBrothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres, land south of the current Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] They first referred to the area as the \"Country Club District\" modeled after the Country Club development in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], but by 1917 the community became known as \"Upper Arlington\" in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as [[Marble Cliff]]). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a street-car shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library.\n\nThe development proceeded according to the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]]\u2013inspired plan by [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.\n\nIn 1916, the development was interrupted when the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio's [[Governor of Ohio|governor]] at the time, [[Frank B. Willis]]. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against [[Pancho Villa]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.\n\nMany restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. From 1930 to 1945, 77.3% of the 22 new subdivisions built in the Columbus, Ohio area either explicitly prohibited African Americans or permitted only whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueckeberg|first=Donald A.|date=January 1996|title=Reviews : Planning for the Private Interest: Land Use Controls and Residential Patterns in Columbus, Ohio, 1900-1970.

Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington's northern border since 1969.\n\nThe annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.\n\nOther Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.\n[[File:Founding Families.jpg|left|thumb|Richards & McCoy Reunion]]\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic [[ranch-style house]]s like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the \"Upper Arlington Historic District\" (or colloquially \"Old Arlington\" or \"South of Lane\"), was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.\n\n==Geography==\nUpper Arlington is bordered on the west by the [[Scioto River]], on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by [[Marble Cliff, Ohio|Marble Cliff]] and [[Grandview Heights, Ohio|Grandview Heights]]. The [[Olentangy River]] and the main campus of the [[Ohio State University]] are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington's eastern border.\n\nThe city is around 800&nbsp;ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the [[Scioto River]]. However, the Turkey Run is longer. It originates in the north then runs southwards until it makes an eastward bend around Reed Rd. Then, it flows eastwards through the OSU Golf Course. The run is used as a storm drain at points, has been dammed in the Ohio State course and runs through concrete pipes at two points. The soil is [[Till|glacial till]] and is suitable for agriculture, supporting a research farm operated by [[The Ohio State University]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 620\n|1930= 3059\n|1940= 5370\n|1950= 9024\n|1960= 28486\n|1970= 38727\n|1980= 35648\n|1990= 34128\n|2000= 33686\n|2010= 33771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=35522\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the 2010 census, the population was 33,771 persons, 16,157 male (47.84%) and 17,614 female (52.16%).

The City Council is elected by citizens and then hires a professional City Manager to run day-to-day operations and implement policy passed by Council.\n\nUpper Arlington's Community Development Department coordinates the many aspects involved in the City's growth, development and preservation Building, Planning and Property Maintenance divisions, with development projects guided and served by an award-winning, streamlined review and zoning process. An Economic Development Division provides a range of services to help existing, new and expanding businesses grow and be successful in the community while diversifying and expanding the range of businesses, and amenities available to residents and strengthening the tax base. The Engineering Division manages the City's public infrastructure\u2014such as roads, waterlines, sanitary and storm sewer systems, and public right-of-way\u2014with a 10-year Capital Improvement Program in place to ensure proactive reinvestment in these critical community assets. The Public Works Division focuses on vital services that keep motorists traveling safely within our community throughout the seasons, including minor road repairs, street cleaning, snow removal and leaf collection.\n\nThe City is always looking for innovative ways to bring the best care and public safety to the community. This is done through a variety of services including: CARES, Bike Helmets for Kids, Blood Pressure Checks, CPR Training, and Safe Baby Training. Upper Arlington's Fire Division also staffs all medic trucks with at least two paramedics and all fire apparatus with at least one paramedic at all times. The Police Division provides 24-hour service and is an integral part of developing and maintaining a safe and secure community.\n\nThe Parks & Recreation Department fulfills the recreational, cultural and educational needs of the community through an exciting array of programs and activities, as well as maintaining the City's beautiful parks, street trees and other public spaces. They offer programs and activities for youth, adult and senior adults varying from cultural arts, aquatics and tennis, culinary and crafts.\n\nUpper Arlington oversees and maintains 21 parks covering approximately 186 acres.

{"title_page": "Salmon conservation", "text_new": "[[File:Salmon swimming upstream in Ketchikan Creek 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Salmon swimming upstream in a river in Alaska]]\n\nThe survival of wild [[salmon]] relies heavily on them having suitable [[habitat]] for [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] and rearing of their young.<ref>NOAA</ref> This habitat is the main concern for conservationists everywhere.  Salmon habitat can be degraded by many different factors including [[land development]], timber harvest, or resource extraction.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\">Rahr, 2005</ref>  These threats bring about the traditional methods of protecting the salmon, but a new movement aims to protect the habitats before they require intervention.\n\n== History of salmon decline ==\nWild salmon in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and southern British Columbia have been on a 160+ year downward trend and are now at very low levels.<ref name=\"Lackey, Lach, and Duncan, 2006\">Lackey, Lach, and Duncan, 2006</ref> Efforts to reverse the decline have been extensive and expensive, but have not met with much success.\n\n\tSalmon in the lower 48 states are well on their way to attaining the status enjoyed by some other notable species \u2014 wolves, condors, grizzlies, bison \u2014 wild animals that are unlikely to disappear entirely, but struggle to survive as remnants of once flourishing species in small portions of their original range.<ref>Lackey, 2006</ref> \tIn California, Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and southern British Columbia, many runs are reduced to less than 10% of their historical numbers; some have disappeared. Many salmon runs are dominated by hatchery-bred fish. In the Columbia River, once one of the largest salmon-producers, over 80% of the total run is now hatchery-bred fish.<ref name=\"Lackey, Lach, and Duncan, 2006\"/>\n\n\tThe pattern of salmon decline is not unique to western North America. Of the Earth's four regions where salmon runs occurred historically (Asian Far East, Atlantic Europe, eastern North America, and western North America), it appears probable that salmon runs in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and southern British Columbia, without a dramatic change in current and long-term trends, will emulate the other three: extirpated or much reduced runs. Since the late 1840s, an array of factors has caused the decline and a plethora of specific impediments has prevented their recovery. Throughout the region, many wild salmon stocks (a group of interbreeding individuals that is roughly equivalent to a \"population\") have declined and some have disappeared.\n\n\tThe status of salmon along the west coast of North America is not uniform. Some wild salmon and habitat restoration possibilities are better than others. There are still relatively healthy runs of wild salmon (and habitat) in some locations such as the coastal watersheds of Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and some areas of southern British Columbia. Runs in northern British Columbia, Yukon, and Alaska are in much better condition.\n\n==Past policy choices==\n\n\t1820-1840 \u2014 With the arrival of trappers in the Pacific Northwest in the early 19th century, a systematic, intense harvest of beavers began. Large numbers of beaver can considerably alter the aquatic environment, in most cases improving salmon rearing habitat. As beaver populations declined, many salmon runs were adversely affected. As competition intensified between the United States and Great Britain for control of the Pacific Northwest, the British Hudson's Bay Company adopted a policy of leaving no beaver in the watersheds they trapped, because without beavers, the American fur trappers (and settlers) would be less likely to come to the Pacific Northwest. The overall effect on West Coast salmon of nearly extirpating beaver is unknown, but it was likely great.\n\n\t1848 \u2014 The most visible milestone in the two-century decline of wild salmon occurred with the discovery of gold in California. By 1849, the decline of salmon started in earnest and was widely reported in the newspapers of the day. By the 1850s, excessive harvest and the impacts of mining activities had decimated salmon in streams in and surrounding the California Central Valley. In response, there were regulations restricting some fishing and mining practices. Later, there were calls for the creation of salmon hatcheries to provide supplemental stocking to overcome the devastating effects of mining operations.<ref>Lackey 2006</ref>\n\n\t1870-1900 \u2014 In the Central Valley of California, after a 30-year decline in salmon runs, supplemental stocking from hatcheries was widely viewed by professional fisheries scientists and the public as the solution to declining salmon runs. By 1900, stocking from hatcheries had largely won out over preserving or restoring natural habitat as the preferred recovery strategy.\n\n\t1905-1939 \u2014 The political goal to \"reclaim the Klamath Basin\" (along the Oregon/California border) reflected the values and priorities of the era. Creating productive farmland by irrigation was the public policy goal. In the competition between societal priorities, irrigated agriculture won out over salmon. Over the next several decades, millions of dollars were spent to develop an elaborate system of dams and canals in the Klamath Basin (and elsewhere).\n\n\t1929-39 \u2014 The policy goal to \"put people to work\" dominated the political landscape as people debated how to counter the effects of the Great Depression. Massive public works projects, such the high dams of the Columbia Basin and elsewhere, were built even though the anticipated and ruinous effect on wild salmon was understood. A single dam, the Grand Coulee, completely and permanently blocked a quarter of the Columbia Basin to migratory salmon, a thousand miles of the mainstem river lost to salmon in a single action.\n\n\t1941-45 \u2014 The posters adorning many public buildings proclaimed \"America \u2014 the Arsenal of Democracy.\" Warplanes were needed in great quantities and in the shortest possible time. Thus, electrical generation in the Pacific Northwest was greatly increased to supply the voracious appetites of aluminum smelters. The hydro-power was there; the war-time demand for aluminum was acute; the public support was near universal. Turbines, operating at maximum capacity seven days per week, 24 hours per day, for four years, chewed up salmon at devastating rates. It was a war for survival and bombers won out over salmon.\n\n\t1948 \u2014 Widespread floods caused disastrous effects across the region, and politicians heeded the public's call for protection. After the 1948 flood, many flood control dams were built in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia. Society collectively demanded that human life and property be protected from uncontrolled river discharges.\n\n\t1955-65 \u2013 The technology for cheap, effective home and commercial air conditioning developed rapidly after World War II. By 1960, the indirect effect on salmon of widespread adoption of air conditioning was clear: (1) greatly increased demand for electricity; and (2) increased overall regional population growth because previously undesirable areas became, with the advent of air conditioning, more desirable places to live. Much of the West Coast is hot during summer months, thus air conditioners found a receptive market.  Directly relevant to salmon runs, electricity demand is now high for ''both'' winter and summer, necessitating more generating capacity and transmission lines.\n\n\t1991-2011 \u2014 The first salmon \"distinct population segment\" was listed under terms of the Endangered Species Act. With this action, the policy debate shifted away from restoring salmon runs in order to support fishing, to protecting salmon runs from extinction, two very different policy objectives. A century ago there was not much concern over whether a salmon started life in a hatchery or in a stream. Now, according to some, hatchery-produced salmon are not the restoration solution, they are part of the restoration problem.\n\t\n\t2001 \u2014 The California drought of 2001 was severe, and combined with ongoing California blackouts, provoked the U.S. Bonneville Power Administration to declare a power emergency, abandon previously agreed upon interagency salmon flow release targets, and generate electricity for transmission to California using water reserved to help salmon migrate.\n\n==Traditional protections==\nTraditionally salmon habitats have not been protected until they are severely degraded and the run is nearing extinction.<ref name=\"Lackey - 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Lackey |first1=Robert |title=Wild salmon recovery and inconventient reality along the West Coast |journal=WIREs Water |date=2015 |volume=2 |issue=5 |page=433-437 |doi=https://doi.org/10.1002/wat2.1093}}</ref>  At that time, several steps might be taken to restore the population.  Fish hatcheries are a popular remedy that are successful in the short term.  However, they may just be masking a problem instead of getting to the root of it.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  Other methods of conservation may include limiting or eliminating harvests of the run, protecting [[water quality]] or reducing [[Water abstraction|water extraction]] for human consumption, and protecting the habitat.  In the last 20 years, Washington State Fisheries, in cooperation with local tribes, has decreased the [[Puget Sound salmon]] harvest by as much as 90% (NMFS, 2007).\n\nProtection of habitat is addressed in a core/satellite model in which certain areas are identified as highly used \"core\" areas and less valuable \"satellite\" areas.<ref>Frissell, 2000</ref>  This model assumes that not all potential habitats will be used by the salmon.  The problem with this method is that the reaches between the core and satellite areas are given a low intrinsic potential, which may result in a lower priority for protection.  If these corridors become impassable due to damming or destruction of riparian habitat, the corresponding satellite region is lost as habitat.  If several of these reaches go unprotected, the total habitat area for the salmon can quickly dwindle.  This is considered by some to be a losing strategy, possible leading to the extinction of salmon.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>\n\n==Protective sanctuary strategy==\nA new method of conservation has been put forward by Rahr and Augerot of the [[Wild Salmon Center]].<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  Their method takes a broader stance at protecting salmon habitat.  Instead of using the core/satellite approach, they propose protecting entire [[Drainage basin|river basins]] as whole systems.  They call this the \"Proactive Sanctuary Strategy,\" which aims to preserve the stream habitats in the [[western United States]] and Canada with particularly high values, areas considered \"salmon strongholds.\"  There is an estimated four to six stream basins that would meet this requirement.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  These high-value basins are irreplaceable and must be protected now while they are still mostly pristine.  Basins or \"strongholds\" in this category are expected to be able to sustain themselves for the next 100 years.  This method is not meant to be a replacement to the currently ongoing protections afforded by local, state, and federal governments, such as the methods discussed above.  Instead, it is a proactive method to reduce or prevent the need for these other methods.\n\t\nThe idea for this \"headwaters to the sea\" strategy was first proposed in 1892.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  Due to the success of hatcheries on American rivers, the idea did not gain any momentum at the time.  The idea was revived in the early 1990s when conservationists realized the shortcomings and lack of coordination between efforts by federal, state, and local authorities.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  The agencies in charge of the fisheries such as NOAA often lack the authority to act on existing threats.  The new conceptualization of salmon [[habitat conservation]] posited that we must protect the most intact or valuable drainages first by working from the headwaters downstream to create a continuous corridor of protected habitat.  Several of these sub-basin scale refuges would come together to protect an entire basin as a whole unit.  This does not mean that all of the land will be owned by governments or conservation organizations.  The plan envisions both public and private landowners working together on a sub-basin scale to preserve habitat.  This goal will be met using three main principles.  The first aims to create \"a series of intact and diverse (in terms of life histories, genetics, and species) [[Salmon|Pacific salmon]] populations in full basin sanctuaries.\"<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  These populations could be a source of individuals to transplant to other rivers if needed.  The second principle aims to \"Ensure the maintenance of functional habitat connectivity from the headwaters to the estuary.\"<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  This connection of habitat helps to promote diversity in the population by providing several localized spawning locations.  The final principle establishes a \"system of strongholds (regional priority sub-basins)\"<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/> which would contain the most biologically significant populations and habitats.\n\t\nThese principles could be used to create the sub-basin strongholds and basin sanctuaries discussed above.  In regions where the habitat is currently highly fragmented due to high human populations, it may only be possible to create sub-basin level protections.  These areas include the regions at the southern end of the extent of salmon habitat such as [[northern California]].  Full basin sanctuaries may only be possible in sparsely populated areas such as northern [[British Columbia]] and Alaska.  There likely would only be four to six of these basin scale sanctuaries.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  These areas could be mixed use so as to provide value to local populations as well as salmon populations.  Mixed use would have limits though.  Such limits may include exclusions from areas of great value to salmon such as ideal spawning grounds or places where young fish may be vulnerable.  Strongholds would be determined by the value and practicality of connecting the often more intact headwaters with the often disturbed estuary zones.\n\t\nThis relatively new method of conservation does not advocate for the elimination of current conservation methods.  Instead, it builds a foundation for future salmon habitat that does not need such restoration and restriction.  These goals are large and will likely require funding that has never been seen in salmon conservation, but it has the potential to pay off better in the long term.  Until this kind of planning and funding is a reality, smaller scale projects like the one recently adopted in [[Puget Sound]] represent a bridge between old and new methods.\n\n==Puget Sound salmon recovery plan==\nIn 2007, the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] adopted a new plan for the recovery of salmon in Puget Sound.  It is estimated that currently 10% of the historic salmon runs still exist in the region.  Some individual runs have diminished to just one percent.<ref name=\"NMFS, 2007\">NMFS, 2007</ref>  The newly adopted plan combines specific efforts on the watershed level with more general legislation at the state level.  Focusing on watershed level management is similar to the ideas presented by Rahr et al.,<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/> except that in the Puget Sound plan, all watersheds, no matter their value, have developed a plan of action.  However, by allowing each watershed group to customize their plan for conservation, higher value regions can adopt more of the principles set forth by Rahr et al.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  Lower value watersheds will use more traditional methods to reach citizens and educate them about the ecology of their streams.<ref name=\"NMFS, 2007\"/>\n\t\nIt may be that the Protective Sanctuary Strategy put forth by<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/> will be necessary to ensure the future of our wild salmon populations.  Unfortunately, large scale and high cost may prohibit it from becoming reality for some time.  In the meantime, efforts such as the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Plan will slowly move toward that larger scale.  By combining the currently most practical basin sanctuary methods with proven legislation and community cooperation, salmon habitat in the Puget Sound will be well on its way to recovery and preservation.\n\n==Nigiri Project==\nRecently efforts in Northern California have been successful in increasing the size of very young salmon in a short period of time.  It is unclear what the long term results will be.  Rice fields near Davis California have been flooded in the wintertime to allow Salmon to eat on the remains of the fields.  Salmon have experienced substantial growth in just knee deep water.  The salmon appear to grow faster in these shallow fields instead of the deep rivers.\n\n==Simulating Rain upstream with Pulsing==\nPulsing is being used as a method of attracting Salmon upstream.  Dam water is released at certain times to encourage salmon to migrate upstream.  This release of cold dam water simulates rain from the mountains and attracts the salmon upstream.  Most recently this has been successful on the Mokelumne River which recently experienced its fifth largest salmon run in 74 years.\n\n==Hatcheries==\nThere are debates over the effectiveness of hatcheries.<ref name=\"Lackey - 2015\">{{cite journal}}</ref> Proponents of the plan argue that hatcheries are essential to the survival of salmon within the Puget Sound region and beyond. Other groups argue against the hatcheries because they claim that it offsets the environmental balance by introducing the artificially raised salmon populations and pitting them against the natural population.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brannon |first=Ernest L. |date=September 2004 |title=The Controversy about Salmon Hatcheries |journal=Fisheries |publisher=American Fisheries Society |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=12\u201331 |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(2004)29[12:TCASH]2.0.CO;2|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\nThe problem with hatcheries lies in the subtle connections between elements of the salmon system. The earliest hatcheries were simply egg-incubating that released small fry into the streams. Through this system, people tried to protect the eggs in the bottom of stream so that they would reduce the mortality of young salmon hoping to increase the salmon population. People raise them to fingerling size before turning them loose, and people put salmon in the tightly packed space. However, people feed them a mixture of fish offal, horse meat, tripe, and condemned pork and beef. As a result, it causes disease, furthermore, the disease infects from one salmon to others.<ref>http://www.salmonnation.com/essays/hatcheries.html</ref><ref>http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/resources/search_faq.cfm?faqmaincatid=3</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\nSalmon use a variety of habitats and cross multiple international borders which make conservation acts even harder to organize and manage. Their habitat must be fixed and monitored before we can even begin to think about conserving and protecting these magnificent creatures. Salmon are a very resilient species, but human causes are driving them to the brink of disaster as we continue to invade their habitat space. Dams, population growth and other human causes are significantly impacting salmon runs and the way that these organisms live.\n\n==Dam removal==\nThe life cycle of salmon is a very important factor in conservation. They return to the same gravel bed where they were hatched to lay their eggs and then die, providing the surrounding environment with nutrients that they would otherwise not have.

Salmon habitat can be degraded by many different factors including [[land development]], timber harvest, or resource extraction.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\">Rahr, 2005</ref>  These threats bring about the traditional methods of protecting the salmon, but a new movement aims to protect the habitats before they require intervention.\n\n== History of salmon decline ==\nWild salmon in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and southern British Columbia have been on a 160+ year downward trend and are now at very low levels.<ref name=\"Lackey, Lach, and Duncan, 2006\">Lackey, Lach, and Duncan, 2006</ref> Efforts to reverse the decline have been extensive and expensive, but have not met with much success.\n\n\tSalmon in the lower 48 states are well on their way to attaining the status enjoyed by some other notable species \u2014 wolves, condors, grizzlies, bison \u2014 wild animals that are unlikely to disappear entirely, but struggle to survive as remnants of once flourishing species in small portions of their original range.<ref>Lackey, 2006</ref> \tIn California, Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and southern British Columbia, many runs are reduced to less than 10% of their historical numbers; some have disappeared. Many salmon runs are dominated by hatchery-bred fish. In the Columbia River, once one of the largest salmon-producers, over 80% of the total run is now hatchery-bred fish.<ref name=\"Lackey, Lach, and Duncan, 2006\"/>\n\n\tThe pattern of salmon decline is not unique to western North America. Of the Earth's four regions where salmon runs occurred historically (Asian Far East, Atlantic Europe, eastern North America, and western North America), it appears probable that salmon runs in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and southern British Columbia, without a dramatic change in current and long-term trends, will emulate the other three: extirpated or much reduced runs. Since the late 1840s, an array of factors has caused the decline and a plethora of specific impediments has prevented their recovery. Throughout the region, many wild salmon stocks (a group of interbreeding individuals that is roughly equivalent to a \"population\") have declined and some have disappeared.\n\n\tThe status of salmon along the west coast of North America is not uniform. Some wild salmon and habitat restoration possibilities are better than others. There are still relatively healthy runs of wild salmon (and habitat) in some locations such as the coastal watersheds of Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and some areas of southern British Columbia. Runs in northern British Columbia, Yukon, and Alaska are in much better condition.\n\n==Past policy choices==\n\n\t1820-1840 \u2014 With the arrival of trappers in the Pacific Northwest in the early 19th century, a systematic, intense harvest of beavers began. Large numbers of beaver can considerably alter the aquatic environment, in most cases improving salmon rearing habitat. As beaver populations declined, many salmon runs were adversely affected. As competition intensified between the United States and Great Britain for control of the Pacific Northwest, the British Hudson's Bay Company adopted a policy of leaving no beaver in the watersheds they trapped, because without beavers, the American fur trappers (and settlers) would be less likely to come to the Pacific Northwest. The overall effect on West Coast salmon of nearly extirpating beaver is unknown, but it was likely great.\n\n\t1848 \u2014 The most visible milestone in the two-century decline of wild salmon occurred with the discovery of gold in California. By 1849, the decline of salmon started in earnest and was widely reported in the newspapers of the day. By the 1850s, excessive harvest and the impacts of mining activities had decimated salmon in streams in and surrounding the California Central Valley. In response, there were regulations restricting some fishing and mining practices. Later, there were calls for the creation of salmon hatcheries to provide supplemental stocking to overcome the devastating effects of mining operations.<ref>Lackey 2006</ref>\n\n\t1870-1900 \u2014 In the Central Valley of California, after a 30-year decline in salmon runs, supplemental stocking from hatcheries was widely viewed by professional fisheries scientists and the public as the solution to declining salmon runs. By 1900, stocking from hatcheries had largely won out over preserving or restoring natural habitat as the preferred recovery strategy.\n\n\t1905-1939 \u2014 The political goal to \"reclaim the Klamath Basin\" (along the Oregon/California border) reflected the values and priorities of the era. Creating productive farmland by irrigation was the public policy goal. In the competition between societal priorities, irrigated agriculture won out over salmon. Over the next several decades, millions of dollars were spent to develop an elaborate system of dams and canals in the Klamath Basin (and elsewhere).\n\n\t1929-39 \u2014 The policy goal to \"put people to work\" dominated the political landscape as people debated how to counter the effects of the Great Depression. Massive public works projects, such the high dams of the Columbia Basin and elsewhere, were built even though the anticipated and ruinous effect on wild salmon was understood. A single dam, the Grand Coulee, completely and permanently blocked a quarter of the Columbia Basin to migratory salmon, a thousand miles of the mainstem river lost to salmon in a single action.\n\n\t1941-45 \u2014 The posters adorning many public buildings proclaimed \"America \u2014 the Arsenal of Democracy.\" Warplanes were needed in great quantities and in the shortest possible time. Thus, electrical generation in the Pacific Northwest was greatly increased to supply the voracious appetites of aluminum smelters. The hydro-power was there; the war-time demand for aluminum was acute; the public support was near universal. Turbines, operating at maximum capacity seven days per week, 24 hours per day, for four years, chewed up salmon at devastating rates. It was a war for survival and bombers won out over salmon.\n\n\t1948 \u2014 Widespread floods caused disastrous effects across the region, and politicians heeded the public's call for protection. After the 1948 flood, many flood control dams were built in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia. Society collectively demanded that human life and property be protected from uncontrolled river discharges.\n\n\t1955-65 \u2013 The technology for cheap, effective home and commercial air conditioning developed rapidly after World War II. By 1960, the indirect effect on salmon of widespread adoption of air conditioning was clear: (1) greatly increased demand for electricity; and (2) increased overall regional population growth because previously undesirable areas became, with the advent of air conditioning, more desirable places to live. Much of the West Coast is hot during summer months, thus air conditioners found a receptive market.  Directly relevant to salmon runs, electricity demand is now high for ''both'' winter and summer, necessitating more generating capacity and transmission lines.\n\n\t1991-2011 \u2014 The first salmon \"distinct population segment\" was listed under terms of the Endangered Species Act. With this action, the policy debate shifted away from restoring salmon runs in order to support fishing, to protecting salmon runs from extinction, two very different policy objectives. A century ago there was not much concern over whether a salmon started life in a hatchery or in a stream. Now, according to some, hatchery-produced salmon are not the restoration solution, they are part of the restoration problem.\n\t\n\t2001 \u2014 The California drought of 2001 was severe, and combined with ongoing California blackouts, provoked the U.S. Bonneville Power Administration to declare a power emergency, abandon previously agreed upon interagency salmon flow release targets, and generate electricity for transmission to California using water reserved to help salmon migrate.\n\n==Traditional protections==\nTraditionally salmon habitats have not been protected until they are severely degraded and the run is nearing extinction.  At that time, several steps might be taken to restore the population.  Fish hatcheries are a popular remedy that are successful in the short term.  However, they may just be masking a problem instead of getting to the root of it.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  Other methods of conservation may include limiting or eliminating harvests of the run, protecting [[water quality]] or reducing [[Water abstraction|water extraction]] for human consumption, and protecting the habitat.  In the last 20 years, Washington State Fisheries, in cooperation with local tribes, has decreased the [[Puget Sound salmon]] harvest by as much as 90% (NMFS, 2007).\n\nProtection of habitat is addressed in a core/satellite model in which certain areas are identified as highly used \"core\" areas and less valuable \"satellite\" areas.<ref>Frissell, 2000</ref>  This model assumes that not all potential habitats will be used by the salmon.  The problem with this method is that the reaches between the core and satellite areas are given a low intrinsic potential, which may result in a lower priority for protection.  If these corridors become impassable due to damming or destruction of riparian habitat, the corresponding satellite region is lost as habitat.  If several of these reaches go unprotected, the total habitat area for the salmon can quickly dwindle.  This is considered by some to be a losing strategy, possible leading to the extinction of salmon.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>\n\n==Protective sanctuary strategy==\nA new method of conservation has been put forward by Rahr and Augerot of the [[Wild Salmon Center]].<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  Their method takes a broader stance at protecting salmon habitat.  Instead of using the core/satellite approach, they propose protecting entire [[Drainage basin|river basins]] as whole systems.  They call this the \"Proactive Sanctuary Strategy,\" which aims to preserve the stream habitats in the [[western United States]] and Canada with particularly high values, areas considered \"salmon strongholds.\"  There is an estimated four to six stream basins that would meet this requirement.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  These high-value basins are irreplaceable and must be protected now while they are still mostly pristine.  Basins or \"strongholds\" in this category are expected to be able to sustain themselves for the next 100 years.  This method is not meant to be a replacement to the currently ongoing protections afforded by local, state, and federal governments, such as the methods discussed above.  Instead, it is a proactive method to reduce or prevent the need for these other methods.\n\t\nThe idea for this \"headwaters to the sea\" strategy was first proposed in 1892.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  Due to the success of hatcheries on American rivers, the idea did not gain any momentum at the time.  The idea was revived in the early 1990s when conservationists realized the shortcomings and lack of coordination between efforts by federal, state, and local authorities.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  The agencies in charge of the fisheries such as NOAA often lack the authority to act on existing threats.  The new conceptualization of salmon [[habitat conservation]] posited that we must protect the most intact or valuable drainages first by working from the headwaters downstream to create a continuous corridor of protected habitat.  Several of these sub-basin scale refuges would come together to protect an entire basin as a whole unit.  This does not mean that all of the land will be owned by governments or conservation organizations.  The plan envisions both public and private landowners working together on a sub-basin scale to preserve habitat.  This goal will be met using three main principles.  The first aims to create \"a series of intact and diverse (in terms of life histories, genetics, and species) [[Salmon|Pacific salmon]] populations in full basin sanctuaries.\"<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  These populations could be a source of individuals to transplant to other rivers if needed.  The second principle aims to \"Ensure the maintenance of functional habitat connectivity from the headwaters to the estuary.\"<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  This connection of habitat helps to promote diversity in the population by providing several localized spawning locations.  The final principle establishes a \"system of strongholds (regional priority sub-basins)\"<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/> which would contain the most biologically significant populations and habitats.\n\t\nThese principles could be used to create the sub-basin strongholds and basin sanctuaries discussed above.  In regions where the habitat is currently highly fragmented due to high human populations, it may only be possible to create sub-basin level protections.  These areas include the regions at the southern end of the extent of salmon habitat such as [[northern California]].  Full basin sanctuaries may only be possible in sparsely populated areas such as northern [[British Columbia]] and Alaska.  There likely would only be four to six of these basin scale sanctuaries.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  These areas could be mixed use so as to provide value to local populations as well as salmon populations.  Mixed use would have limits though.  Such limits may include exclusions from areas of great value to salmon such as ideal spawning grounds or places where young fish may be vulnerable.  Strongholds would be determined by the value and practicality of connecting the often more intact headwaters with the often disturbed estuary zones.\n\t\nThis relatively new method of conservation does not advocate for the elimination of current conservation methods.  Instead, it builds a foundation for future salmon habitat that does not need such restoration and restriction.  These goals are large and will likely require funding that has never been seen in salmon conservation, but it has the potential to pay off better in the long term.  Until this kind of planning and funding is a reality, smaller scale projects like the one recently adopted in [[Puget Sound]] represent a bridge between old and new methods.\n\n==Puget Sound salmon recovery plan==\nIn 2007, the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] adopted a new plan for the recovery of salmon in Puget Sound.  It is estimated that currently 10% of the historic salmon runs still exist in the region.  Some individual runs have diminished to just one percent.<ref name=\"NMFS, 2007\">NMFS, 2007</ref>  The newly adopted plan combines specific efforts on the watershed level with more general legislation at the state level.  Focusing on watershed level management is similar to the ideas presented by Rahr et al.,<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/> except that in the Puget Sound plan, all watersheds, no matter their value, have developed a plan of action.  However, by allowing each watershed group to customize their plan for conservation, higher value regions can adopt more of the principles set forth by Rahr et al.<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/>  Lower value watersheds will use more traditional methods to reach citizens and educate them about the ecology of their streams.<ref name=\"NMFS, 2007\"/>\n\t\nIt may be that the Protective Sanctuary Strategy put forth by<ref name=\"Rahr, 2005\"/> will be necessary to ensure the future of our wild salmon populations.  Unfortunately, large scale and high cost may prohibit it from becoming reality for some time.  In the meantime, efforts such as the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Plan will slowly move toward that larger scale.  By combining the currently most practical basin sanctuary methods with proven legislation and community cooperation, salmon habitat in the Puget Sound will be well on its way to recovery and preservation.\n\n==Nigiri Project==\nRecently efforts in Northern California have been successful in increasing the size of very young salmon in a short period of time.  It is unclear what the long term results will be.  Rice fields near Davis California have been flooded in the wintertime to allow Salmon to eat on the remains of the fields.  Salmon have experienced substantial growth in just knee deep water.  The salmon appear to grow faster in these shallow fields instead of the deep rivers.\n\n==Simulating Rain upstream with Pulsing==\nPulsing is being used as a method of attracting Salmon upstream.  Dam water is released at certain times to encourage salmon to migrate upstream.  This release of cold dam water simulates rain from the mountains and attracts the salmon upstream.  Most recently this has been successful on the Mokelumne River which recently experienced its fifth largest salmon run in 74 years.\n\n==Hatcheries==\nThere are debates over the effectiveness of hatcheries. Proponents of the plan argue that hatcheries are essential to the survival of salmon within the Puget Sound region and beyond. Other groups argue against the hatcheries because they claim that it offsets the environmental balance by introducing the artificially raised salmon populations and pitting them against the natural population.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brannon |first=Ernest L. |date=September 2004 |title=The Controversy about Salmon Hatcheries |journal=Fisheries |publisher=American Fisheries Society |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=12\u201331 |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(2004)29[12:TCASH]2.0.CO;2|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\nThe problem with hatcheries lies in the subtle connections between elements of the salmon system. The earliest hatcheries were simply egg-incubating that released small fry into the streams. Through this system, people tried to protect the eggs in the bottom of stream so that they would reduce the mortality of young salmon hoping to increase the salmon population. People raise them to fingerling size before turning them loose, and people put salmon in the tightly packed space. However, people feed them a mixture of fish offal, horse meat, tripe, and condemned pork and beef. As a result, it causes disease, furthermore, the disease infects from one salmon to others.<ref>http://www.salmonnation.com/essays/hatcheries.html</ref><ref>http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/resources/search_faq.cfm?faqmaincatid=3</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\nSalmon use a variety of habitats and cross multiple international borders which make conservation acts even harder to organize and manage. Their habitat must be fixed and monitored before we can even begin to think about conserving and protecting these magnificent creatures. Salmon are a very resilient species, but human causes are driving them to the brink of disaster as we continue to invade their habitat space. Dams, population growth and other human causes are significantly impacting salmon runs and the way that these organisms live.\n\n==Dam removal==\nThe life cycle of salmon is a very important factor in conservation. They return to the same gravel bed where they were hatched to lay their eggs and then die, providing the surrounding environment with nutrients that they would otherwise not have.  A recent study documented 137 species that benefit from and utilize the ocean-origin nutrients that salmon deliver.<ref>Save Our Wild Salmon. \"Why Restore Wild Salmon?\" Save Our Wild Salmon. 23 May 2011.<http://www.wildsalmon.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=94&Itemid=62>.</ref>  The creation of many dams along the Snake and Columbia Rivers have blocked Salmon access to some of the most pristine habitats available, preventing them for being able to spawn effectively as they would've done without the dams being in their way.

January 2020, he previously held this position from December 2017 to May 2019. In addition, Kurz has been [[List of chairpersons of the Austrian People's Party|chairman]] of the [[Austrian People's Party]] since May 2017.\n\nKurz was born and raised in [[Meidling]], [[Vienna]]. He acquired his [[Maturazeugnis|Matura]] in 2004 at the [[GRG 12 Erlgasse]] and subsequently completed mandatory military service in 2005. Following the same year, Kurz attended the [[Law school|faculty of law]] at the [[University of Vienna]], but voluntarily left before graduating to focus on his political career. Kurz entered politics when he joined the [[Young People's Party (Austria)|Young People's Party]] (JVP) in 2003. Five years later he assumed his first political office there as chairman of the JVP for Vienna. In 2010, Kurz successfully ran for the [[Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna|Viennese State Diet]] and thereby obtained his first governmental post. Following a reshuffle of the [[First Faymann cabinet]] in 2011, Kurz was nominated and appointed state secretary of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Interior Ministry]] for [[social integration]]. After the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|2013 legislative election]], Kurz became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Austria)|foreign minister of Austria]] and remained the country's head diplomat until December 2017.\n\nFollowing the resignation of [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] [[Reinhold Mitterlehner]] as chairman of the People's Party (\u00d6VP) in May 2017, Kurz was named his successor. Mitterlehner's withdrawal from politics led to the end of the [[Kern cabinet]] and triggered a [[2017 Austrian legislative election|legislative snap election in 2017]]; in which Kurz participated as the top candidate of his party. As leader of the largest party after the election, Kurz was charged with forming [[First Kurz government|his first cabinet]] and subsequently formed a [[coalition government|coalition]] with the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6). During his chancellorship, Kurz [[Actions of the first Kurz cabinet|passed many changes and reforms]] but suffered multiple scandals. Following the [[Ibiza affair]] and the end of the \u00d6VP\u2013FP\u00d6 majority coalition, Kurz was dismissed by the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] through a [[motion of no confidence]] passed by the [[SP\u00d6]], FP\u00d6 and [[JETZT (party)|JETZT]] in May 2019. However, he returned to power after the [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 legislative snap elections]], forming another coalition this time with the environmentalist [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]].\n\nHis youth and political tenor have been credited with revitalizing the traditional [[Politics of Austria|conservative movement in Austria]], and to a larger extent, in Europe. Opponents have, however, denounced him as uncooperative and hasty, particularly with respect to [[Sebastian Kurz#Political stances|his signature issues]]: immigration and social politics. Aged 33, Kurz is the [[Lists of state leaders by age#10 youngest serving state leaders|youngest head of government]] in the world, and first elected to the post aged 31, the youngest chancellor in [[History of Austria|Austrian history]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Ancestry ===\nKurz was born in [[Vienna]], the only child<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobil.krone.at/386793|title=Trauen Sie sich alles zu, Herr Kurz?|language=German|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Krone|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017203941/http://mobil.krone.at/386793|archive-date=2017-10-17|url-status=live}}</ref> of Roman Catholic parents Josef and Elisabeth Kurz (n\u00e9e D\u00f6ller).

While the basic income was initially denoted \"minimum grant\" (''Mindestsicherung''), it will be renamed \"social aid\" (''Sozialhilfe''). The new statute resulting from the changes, will supersede the \"federation-states-agreement on minimum standards of social services\" (which expired in 2016) and federalize the basic income through a framework law \u2013 which will allow for states to keep their autonomy in making decisions on the basic income, but only within that by the law explicitly defined framework.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.profil.at/oesterreich/mindestsicherung-neu-regeln-detail-10102185|website=www.profil.at|title=Die neuen Regeln im Detail|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dieneuevolkspartei.at/QAs-zur-Mindestsicherung|website=www.dieneuevolkspartei.at|title=Fragen & Antworten zur Mindestsicherung Neu|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe new law will grant recipients of the basic income that are singles a maximum of \u20ac863,04 monthly, couples will obtain a maximum of \u20ac1.208,26 monthly. Parents will receive \u20ac215 for their first child, \u20ac129 for their second one and \u20ac43 from the third one onward. Citizens of the [[European Union]], the [[European Economic Area]] and foreign countries, only are eligible to apply for the basic income after a legally registered stay of five years or when having served as an [[employer]]. Immigrants with insufficient German language skills will receive a reduced basic income of only \u20ac563 \u2013 cabinet argued that the difference of \u20ac300 will pay for their German language courses. The full amount of \u20ac863 will be acquirable by immigrants when having achieved German level B1 (being able to understand the basics when a standard vocabulary is applied and when it comes to trusted things like work, school or free time) or English level C1 (being able to comprehend a broad spectrum of long and challenging texts and implicit meanings). To retain the basic income an application must be re-submitted every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000095750305/Mindestsicherung-Modell-bringt-Einschnitte-und-ermoeglicht-Boni|website=derstandard.at|title=Mindestsicherung: Was das neue Modell bringt|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.krone.at/1881854|website=amp.krone.at|title=Mindestsicherung Neu: Wartefrist f\u00fcr Zuwanderer|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the changes will merge the unemployment insurance (''Arbeitslosengeld'') with the emergency aid (''Notstandshilfe''); the merger's result will then be called \"unemployment insurance NEW\" (''Arbeitslosengeld NEU''). While the prior unemployment insurance was only claimable for one year by the newly unemployed, the new unemployment insurance expands this tenure up to two years. However, when people's eligibility for the old unemployment insurance expired they could claim the constantly-renewable but less awarding emergency aid.

Furthermore, extraordinary students may face discrimination, many teachers do not have the necessary requirements, costs for the implementation are gigantic and all extraordinary students are in the same class regardless of their age, which prevents them from learning efficiently.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000081415792/Innsbruck-will-eigene-Deutschfoerderklassen-nicht-umsetzen|website=derstandard.at|title=Weiter Widerstand gegen separate Deutschklassen|language=de|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://diepresse.com/home/bildung/schule/5588031/Deutschklassen_Die-Bedingungen-sind-ein-Wahnsinn|website=diepresse.com|title=Deutschklassen: \"Die Bedingungen sind ein Wahnsinn\"|language=de|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2906109/|website=wien.orf.at|title=Wien sagt Nein zu Deutschklassen|language=de|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n'''Family subsidy for European foreigners'''<br />\nIn October 2018, the Kurz cabinet amended the family subsidy for European foreigners through legislation, the changes will be in effect as of 1 January 2019.

The cabinet stated that \"centralizing the social insurance system will improve services for the insured\".\n\nFollowing insurance organizations will be merged: \n* the nine health insurances of [[States of Austria|Austria's nine states]] (''Gebietskrankenkassen'') into the federalized \"Austrian Health Insurance\" (\u00d6GK), \n* the Social Insurance for the Commercial Economy with the one of the farmers into the Social Insurance for Independents (SVS), \n* the Insurance for Railways and Mining with the Insurance for Governmental Officials into the \"BVAEB\".\n\nThe Pension Insurance (PVA) and the Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) will remain untouched. In addition the Association of Austrian Social Insurances (''Hauptverband der \u00f6sterreichischen Sozialversicherungstr\u00e4ger''), which comprises all social insurance organisations, will be reduced and disempowered when the amendment is in effect.\n\nThe project will officially begin in April 2019 with the initiation of a parliamentary transitional committee overseeing the fusion. The committee will be abolished at the end of 2019 and starting 2020 the new organisation and structure will be in full effect.\n\nThe opposition (consisting of [[SP\u00d6]], [[NEOS - The New Austria|NEOS]] and [[NOW - List Pilz|NOW]]), the chairman of the Association of Austrian Social Insurances and multiple health economists have condemned these changes, saying that \"they would not centralize but decentralize and impair a perfectly functioning and effective system and thus be a general worsening for the insured\".

January 2020, he previously held this position from December 2017 to May 2019. In addition, Kurz has been [[List of chairpersons of the Austrian People's Party|chairman]] of the [[Austrian People's Party]] since May 2017.\n\nKurz was born and raised in [[Meidling]], [[Vienna]]. He acquired his [[Maturazeugnis|Matura]] in 2004 at the [[GRG 12 Erlgasse]] and subsequently completed mandatory military service in 2005. Following the same year, Kurz attended the [[Law school|faculty of law]] at the [[University of Vienna]], but voluntarily left before graduating to focus on his political career. Kurz entered politics when he joined the [[Young People's Party (Austria)|Young People's Party]] (JVP) in 2003. Five years later he assumed his first political office there as chairman of the JVP for Vienna. In 2010, Kurz successfully ran for the [[Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna|Viennese State Diet]] and thereby obtained his first governmental post. Following a reshuffle of the [[First Faymann cabinet]] in 2011, Kurz was nominated and appointed state secretary of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Interior Ministry]] for [[social integration]]. After the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|2013 legislative election]], Kurz became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Austria)|foreign minister of Austria]] and remained the country's head diplomat until December 2017.\n\nFollowing the resignation of [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] [[Reinhold Mitterlehner]] as chairman of the People's Party (\u00d6VP) in May 2017, Kurz was named his successor. Mitterlehner's withdrawal from politics led to the end of the [[Kern cabinet]] and triggered a [[2017 Austrian legislative election|legislative snap election in 2017]]; in which Kurz participated as the top candidate of his party. As leader of the largest party after the election, Kurz was charged with forming [[First Kurz government|his first cabinet]] and subsequently formed a [[coalition government|coalition]] with the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6). During his chancellorship, Kurz [[Actions of the first Kurz cabinet|passed many changes and reforms]] but suffered multiple scandals. Following the [[Ibiza affair]] and the end of the \u00d6VP\u2013FP\u00d6 majority coalition, Kurz was dismissed by the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] through a [[motion of no confidence]] passed by the [[SP\u00d6]], FP\u00d6 and [[JETZT (party)|JETZT]] in May 2019. However, he returned to power after the [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 legislative snap elections]], forming another coalition this time with the environmentalist [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]].\n\nHis youth and political tenor have been credited with revitalizing the traditional [[Politics of Austria|conservative movement in Austria]], and to a larger extent, in Europe. Opponents have, however, denounced him as uncooperative and hasty, particularly with respect to [[Sebastian Kurz#Political stances|his signature issues]]: immigration and social politics. Aged 33, Kurz is the [[Lists of state leaders by age#10 youngest serving state leaders|youngest head of government]] in the world, and first elected to the post aged 31, the youngest chancellor in [[History of Austria|Austrian history]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Ancestry ===\nKurz was born in [[Vienna]], the only child<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobil.krone.at/386793|title=Trauen Sie sich alles zu, Herr Kurz?|language=German|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Krone|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017203941/http://mobil.krone.at/386793|archive-date=2017-10-17|url-status=live}}</ref> of Roman Catholic parents Josef and Elisabeth Kurz (n\u00e9e D\u00f6ller).

The new statute resulting from the changes, will supersede the \"federation-states-agreement on minimum standards of social services\" (which expired in 2016) and federalize the basic income through a framework law \u2013 which will allow for states to keep their autonomy in making decisions on the basic income, but only within that by the law explicitly defined framework.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.profil.at/oesterreich/mindestsicherung-neu-regeln-detail-10102185|website=www.profil.at|title=Die neuen Regeln im Detail|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dieneuevolkspartei.at/QAs-zur-Mindestsicherung|website=www.dieneuevolkspartei.at|title=Fragen & Antworten zur Mindestsicherung Neu|language=de|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe new law will grant recipients of the basic income that are singles a maximum of \u20ac863,04 monthly, couples will obtain a maximum of \u20ac1.208,26 monthly. Parents will receive \u20ac215 for their first child, \u20ac129 for their second one and \u20ac43 from the third one onward. Citizens of the [[European Union]], the [[European Economic Area]] and foreign countries, only are eligible to apply for the basic income after a legally registered stay of five years or when having served as an [[employer]]. Immigrants with insufficient German language skills will receive a reduced basic income of only \u20ac563 \u2013 cabinet argued that the difference of \u20ac300 will pay for their German language courses. The full amount of \u20ac863 will be acquirable by immigrants when having achieved German level B1 (being able to understand the basics when a standard vocabulary is applied and when it comes to trusted things like work, school or free time) or English level C1 (being able to comprehend a broad spectrum of long and challenging texts and implicit meanings).

While the prior unemployment insurance was only claimable for one year by the newly unemployed, the new unemployment insurance expands this tenure up to two years.

Natella created the site in 2008, but it was not until October 2009 that it gained attention from the press and online internet users. This Man's notoriety spawned several internet memes that spoofed flyers of the website, references in films and television shows like ''[[The X-Files]]'', and a [[manga]] series based on the hoax by ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]''. In 2010, Natella confirmed that This Man was a hoax that was part of a [[guerilla marketing]] stunt; some sources claimed it was meant to promote a film of the same name by [[Bryan Bertino]] and [[Ghost House Pictures]] that never came into fruition.\n\n== Story of the hoax ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = left\n | image1            = Upiorwoperze ALWebber (cropped).jpg\n | width1            = 200\n | image2            = Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.jpg\n | width2            = 150\n | footer            = According to Natella,  some emails sent to ThisMan.org compared the look of This Man to real-life people such as [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ''(left)'' and [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] ''(right)''.\n}}\nAs ''Ever Dreamed This Man'', the website under the domain ThisMan.org, claims, This Man was first drawn by a \"well-known [psychiatrist]\" from New York (the site does not identify which) in January 2006, while dealing with a female patient that claimed to keep seeing This Man in her dreams.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisman.org/history/|title=History|website=Ever Dreamed This Man?|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref> A few days later, one of the psychiatrist's male patients recognized the man from the drawing and said he also saw the man while sleeping.<ref name=\"History\" /> Both patients claimed they never saw him in real life.<ref name=\"History\" /> The psychiatrist then sent the picture to four other colleagues who were dealing with people having repeated dreams, and four of those colleagues' patients identified the man and described him as \"This Man.\"<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nAccording to the storyline, later on, more than 2000 people from other major cities across the world such as [[Los Angeles]], [[Berlin]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Tehran]], [[Beijing]], [[Rome]], [[Barcelona]], [[Stockholm]], [[Paris]], [[New Delhi]], and [[Moscow]] claimed to have seen the man while sleeping.<ref name=\"History\" /> Stories from those who dreamed him, who remained anonymous, suggest he was a Brazilian school teacher who had six fingers on his right hand.<ref name=\"History\" /> These dreamers' experiences of the man varied from romantic, sexual, or deadly situations to flying with the man to just seeing him staring at the dreamer and doing nothing.<ref name=\"Dreams\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisman.org/dreams/|title=Dreams|website=Ever Dreamed This Man?|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAndrea Natella, when interviewed by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine for an article that took the myth seriously (thus making Natella answer the questions as if for real), explained that he first dreamed This Man before he was aware of who he really was;

The EPA still regulates the type of wastewater that can be injected through the [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program|Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program]], but broadly, the UIC Program allows much higher levels of pollutants to be injected compared to the NPDES, due to the natural filtration action that occurs in groundwater aquifers.

The County also referred to the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Michigan v. EPA]]'' (2015), which stated the EPA failed to consider the costs necessary in what it considered a \"necessary and appropriate\" rule-making change to enforcement of the [[Clear Air Act]] that affected the nation's power plants.<ref>{{ussc|name=Michigan v.

In his opinion, Breyer wrote that the \"fairly traceable\" test that the Ninth Circuit had adopted would give the EPA greater authority on pollutant regulation than Congress had given at the time, as the Ninth Circuit's test could apply to a source of pollution that may have occurred a century before and hundreds of miles away due to the slow motion of groundwater. However, the decision also outright rejected the County of Maui's argument that the discharge in the present case did not need a permit, as the language of the CWA as intended by Congress would cover the types of discharge. In the decision, Breyer asserted that a permit for discharge would be required for point sources, or for \"the functional equivalent of a direct discharge\", which had been demonstrated in the present case. Breyer instructed the Ninth on remand to consider the \"functional equivalent\" test, in guidance with the EPA, to re-evaluate the discharge from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and for similar cases going forward, barring a change in the CWA statute from Congress.<ref name=\"cnn decision\"/> This would thus determine if the original case brought by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund could then proceed. In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh stressed that the majority opinion was consistent with the plurality decision from ''[[Rapanos v. United States]]'' (2006).\n\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a dissent joined by Justice [[Neil Gorsuch]]. Thomas took the stance that the CWA was more restrictive and only required a permit from a true direct discharge source, and would have reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision in favor of the County of Maui. Justice [[Samuel Alito]] also wrote a dissent, more critical of the majority opinion setting a new standard for determining the need for a permit, but would have reversed the Ninth's decision.<ref name=\"cnn decision\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rejects-trump-administrations-view-on-key-aspect-of-clean-water-act/2020/04/23/a826b828-8570-11ea-a3eb-e9fc93160703_story.html |title = Supreme Court rejects Trump administration\u2019s view on key aspect of Clean Water Act | first = Robert | last=  Barnes | date = April 23, 2020  |accessdate = April 23, 2020  |work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{caselaw source\n | case = ''County of Maui v.

With the election of [[Donald Trump]] in 2016, the EPA took a stronger stance against the environmentalist position, and in April 2019, after the trial court and appellate court decisions, issued a new guidance document asserting that the CWA does not cover such discharges.

Miccosukee Tribe]]'' (2004)<ref>{{ussc|name=South Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe|link=South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe|volume=541|page=95|pin=|year=2004}}.</ref> and upheld in several subsequent cases. The County also raised concerns that this test would affect a significant portion of the other 650,000 Class V wells in operation, requiring these wells to also obtain NPDES permits. The County also referred to the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Michigan v. EPA]]'' (2015), which stated the EPA failed to consider the costs necessary in what it considered a \"necessary and appropriate\" rule-making change to enforcement of the [[Clear Air Act]] that affected the nation's power plants.<ref>{{ussc|name=Michigan v. EPA|volume=576|docket=14-46|year=2015}}.</ref> The County believed that the new point source test from the Ninth Circuit would be a similar economic burden.

The Justices debated with the legal representatives on the impact of a ruling in either direction. A ruling that favored the county of Maui could potentially allow wastewater dischargers to simply modify how their wastewater is discharged with minimal cost to avoid EPA's regulations, while a ruling favoring the Wildlife Fund could leave many smaller property owners, including home owners, at fault for unintentional leaks of wastewater from their properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-water/u-s-supreme-court-weighs-important-environmental-case-from-hawaii-idUSKBN1XG2EE |title=U.S. Supreme Court justices seek compromise in Hawaii water pollution case |first=Lawrence |last=Hurley |date=November 6, 2019 | accessdate = November 8, 2019 |publisher=[[Reuters]] }}</ref>\n\nThe Court issued its 6-3 decision on April 23, 2020, which vacated the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanded the case to the lower court.<ref name=SCOTUS/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/supreme-court-issues-mixed-ruling-on-reach-of-clean-water-act |title=Supreme Court Gives Environmentalists Partial Win on Water Law |first= Greg |last=Stohr |date=April 23, 2020 |accessdate=April 23, 2020 |work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}</ref> Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]], [[Elena Kagan]], and [[Brett Kavanaugh]]. In his opinion, Breyer wrote that the \"fairly traceable\" test that the Ninth Circuit had adopted would give the EPA greater authority on pollutant regulation than Congress had given at the time, as the Ninth Circuit's test could apply to a source of pollution that may have occurred a century before and hundreds of miles away due to the slow motion of groundwater. However, the decision also outright rejected the County of Maui's argument that the discharge in the present case did not need a permit, as the language of the CWA as intended by Congress would cover the types of discharge. In the decision, Breyer asserted that a permit for discharge would be required for point sources, or for \"the functional equivalent of a direct discharge\", which had been demonstrated in the present case. Breyer instructed the Ninth on remand to consider the \"functional equivalent\" test, in guidance with the EPA, to re-evaluate the discharge from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and for similar cases going forward, barring a change in the CWA statute from Congress.<ref name=\"cnn decision\"/> This would thus determine if the original case brought by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund could then proceed. In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh stressed that the majority opinion was consistent with the plurality decision from ''[[Rapanos v. United States]]'' (2006).\n\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a dissent joined by Justice [[Neil Gorsuch]]. Thomas took the stance that the CWA was more restrictive and only required a permit from a true direct discharge source, and would have reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision in favor of the County of Maui. Justice [[Samuel Alito]] also wrote a dissent, more critical of the majority opinion setting a new standard for determining the need for a permit, but would have reversed the Ninth's decision.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rejects-trump-administrations-view-on-key-aspect-of-clean-water-act/2020/04/23/a826b828-8570-11ea-a3eb-e9fc93160703_story.html |title = Supreme Court rejects Trump administration\u2019s view on key aspect of Clean Water Act | first = Robert | last=  Barnes | date = April 23, 2020  |accessdate = April 23, 2020  |work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref><ref name=\"cnn decision\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{caselaw source\n | case = ''County of Maui v.
