In that year, Rev. William Thompson, later the author of ''The Land and the Book'', founded in Beirut the first Protestant Seminary in the area. In 1843 the Seminary moved to [[Aabey|Abey]], in the mountain not far south of Beirut, under the leadership of Dr. [[Cornelius Van Dyck]], translator of the Bible into [[Arabic]]. It offered classes in both theology and general education.\n\nOut of the Abey Seminary grew, in 1866, the Syrian Protestant College, now the [[American University of Beirut]]. With the founding of the College, it was decided that the seminary pursue only theological studies, while the College be responsible for general studies. The Seminary had several locations in the subsequent years and, in 1905, moved back to Beirut .\n\nIn 1912, under Principal F. E. Hoskins, Colton Hall \u2013 a gift of Mr. Milton Colton of [[Jenkintown, Pennsylvania]] \u2013 was constructed on a piece of land near the center of the city and became the home of the N.E.S.T. until 1971.\n\nIn the meantime, as early as 1839, theological education was being offered in the area which is now [[Turkey]], under the leadership of the Rev. [[Cyrus Hamlin]], of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], in [[Bebek, Be\u015fikta\u015f|Bebek]] and later in Marzifoon, [[Marash]] and [[Harput]]. However, because of the [[Armenian Genocide|events which befell the Armenian population]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]], these seminaries were closed and consolidated in the establishment of the School of Religion in [[Istanbul]], with the Rev. Fred Goodsell as President. After the catastrophe of [[Izmir]] in 1922, the Armenian and Greek students of the School, together with Professor Loutfi Levonian, moved to Athens. In 1925, the Istanbul branch of the school was closed and the institutions were combined in the School of Religion in Athens.\n\nIn 1930, missionaries in the Near East, seeking to strengthen theological education in the area, proposed to unite the theological institutions in Athens and Beirut . In the spring of that year, after a period of negotiations between the Syria Mission (Presbyterian) and the Near East Mission (Congregational), an agreement was reached for the two schools to merge and form the new Near East School of Theology in Beirut. The merger was consummated on November 11, 1932, with Gaius Greenslade as Principal and Loutfi Levonian as Dean.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], the two American Boards were joined by the [[National Evangelical Synod of Syria and Lebanon]], the [[Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East]] (1945), the [[Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem|Diocese of Jerusalem]] of the Episcopal Church (1950) and the Lutheran Church in [[Jordan]] (1967).\n\nIn 1971, the School moved to its new home: a modern, well equipped building, two blocks to the south of the American University of Beirut in [[Ras Beirut]]. The credit for this considerable achievement must go above all to the late President [[Hovhannes Aharonian]], who, from 1959 and until his retirement in 1978, presided over the destiny of the School, and had served in other capacities for many years prior to that. On the occasion of his retirement, the Reverend Aharonian was named Honorary President.\n\nThe events of recent years in Lebanon have left their mark on the whole society and on every institution in the country. The N.E.S.T. too was adversely affected, especially through the loss of teaching faculty and the reduction of the student body to a third of its pre-war size. Nevertheless, the School was able to keep its doors open all through the troubles and is now attempting to rebuild its student body and to reach out in new directions. The first sign of this renewal is perhaps the revised curriculum for all degree programs which is included in this catalog, and was implemented as of October, 1991. The new curriculum is an attempt at updating the course offerings and the requirements in the various degree programs so as to meet the changes in the situation of the churches in this region, as well as to keep in line with the ecumenical renewal in theological education worldwide.\n\n==Profile==\nThe NEST is an undergraduate and graduate theological seminary of some 40 students and seven full and two part-time faculty. The seminary offers the following programs: B.A. in Christian Education; B.Th. with emphasis in pastoral studies; B.Th. in Christian Education; M.A.C.E., a graduate program for educational ministries; M.Div. for Pastoral ministry; S.T.M., a post graduate research degree; and the S.T.M. in Ministry established jointly with [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].\n\nThe seminary is housed in a modern building with classrooms, offices, faculty and student lounges, dining facilities, sanctuary and chapel, coffee shop, dormitory rooms for 50 students, six faculty apartments and a gymnasium and theater which are under construction. The library contains 42,000 volumes in Arabic, Armenian, English, French and German.\n\n==Church relationship==\nThe NEST is under the auspices and support of four mainline Protestant [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches in the [[Middle East]], the [[National Evangelical Synod of Syria and Lebanon]], the [[Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East]], the [[Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East]] of the Anglican Communion, and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land]]. These four local churches jointly sponsor the N.E.S.T. and enjoy the full cooperation and support of Associate Members, all of whom are represented on the Board of Managers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Protestantism in Lebanon]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.theonest.edu.lb Official website]\n\n{{coord missing|Lebanon}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Near East School Of Theology}}\n[[Category:Evangelical seminaries and theological colleges]]\n[[Category:Schools in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Education in Beirut]]\n[[Category:Universities in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Protestantism in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1932]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Beirut]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=May 2014}}\n{{Infobox university   \n| name              = Near East School of Theology\n| native_name       = \n| native_name_lang  = \n| image             = Near East School of Theology Beirut.jpg\n| image_alt         = \n| caption           = Building.\n| latin_name        = \n| other_name        = <!--or, other_names-->\n| former_name       = <!--or, former_names-->\n| motto             = \n| motto_lang        = \n| mottoeng          = \n| type              = Theological seminary\n| established       = {{start date|1932}} \n| closed            = <!-- {{end date|YYYY}} -->\n| founder           = \n| parent            = \n| affiliation       = \n| religious_affiliation = Interdenominational Protestant\n| academic_affiliation  = \n| endowment         = \n| budget            = \n| officer_in_charge = \n| chairman          = \n| chairperson       = \n| chancellor        = \n| president         = \n| vice-president    = \n| superintendent    = \n| provost           = \n| vice_chancellor   = \n| rector            = \n| principal         = \n| dean              = \n| director          = \n| head_label        = \n| head              = \n| academic_staff    = 9\n| administrative_staff = \n| students          = 40\n| undergrad         = \n| postgrad          = \n| doctoral          = \n| other             = \n| address           = <!-- Please discuss before using -->\n| city              = Beirut\n| state             = \n| province          = \n| country           = Lebanon\n| postcode          = <!--or, postalcode or zipcode-->\n| coordinates       = <!-- {{Coord}} -->\n| campus            = \n| language          = \n| free_label        = \n| free              = \n| colors            = <!--or, colours= -->\n| athletics         = \n| sports            = \n| athletics_nickname = <!--or,  sports_nickname= -->\n| mascot            = <!--or, mascots= -->\n| sporting_affiliations = \n| website           = <!-- {{URL|example.com}} -->\n| logo              = \n| logo_size         = \n| logo_alt          = \n| footnotes         = \n}}\n\nThe '''Near East School of Theology''' (NEST), located in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], is an interdenominational [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[theology|theological]] [[seminary]] serving Christian churches of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and also educates international students who have a special interest in [[Biblical studies|Biblical]] and [[Islamic studies]] in a Middle Eastern context or those especially interested in the [[History of early Christianity|Ancient church]]es.\n\n==History==\nThe Near East School of Theology, formed in 1932 by the merger of the School for Religious Workers in Beirut and the School of Religion in [[Athens]], is built upon a history of evangelical theological education in the [[Near East]] which goes back to 1835.

However, because of the [[Armenian Genocide|events which befell the Armenian population]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]], these seminaries were closed and consolidated in the establishment of the School of Religion in [[Istanbul]], with the Rev. Fred Goodsell as President. After the catastrophe of [[\u0130zmir|Izmir]] in 1922, the Armenian and Greek students of the School, together with Professor Loutfi Levonian, moved to Athens. In 1925, the Istanbul branch of the school was closed and the institutions were combined in the School of Religion in Athens.\n\nIn 1930, missionaries in the Near East, seeking to strengthen theological education in the area, proposed to unite the theological institutions in Athens and Beirut . In the spring of that year, after a period of negotiations between the Syria Mission (Presbyterian) and the Near East Mission (Congregational), an agreement was reached for the two schools to merge and form the new Near East School of Theology in Beirut. The merger was consummated on November 11, 1932, with Gaius Greenslade as Principal and Loutfi Levonian as Dean.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], the two American Boards were joined by the [[National Evangelical Synod of Syria and Lebanon]], the [[Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East]] (1945), the [[Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem|Diocese of Jerusalem]] of the Episcopal Church (1950) and the Lutheran Church in [[Jordan]] (1967). \n\nIn 1971, the School moved to its new home: a modern, well equipped building, two blocks to the south of the American University of Beirut in [[Ras Beirut]]. The credit for this considerable achievement must go above all to the late President [[Hovhannes Aharonian]], who, from 1959 and until his retirement in 1978, presided over the destiny of the School, and had served in other capacities for many years prior to that. On the occasion of his retirement, the Reverend Aharonian was named Honorary President.\n\nThe events of recent years in Lebanon have left their mark on the whole society and on every institution in the country. The N.E.S.T. too was adversely affected, especially through the loss of teaching faculty and the reduction of the student body to a third of its pre-war size. Nevertheless, the School was able to keep its doors open all through the troubles and is now attempting to rebuild its student body and to reach out in new directions. The first sign of this renewal is perhaps the revised curriculum for all degree programs which is included in this catalog, and was implemented as of October, 1991. The new curriculum is an attempt at updating the course offerings and the requirements in the various degree programs so as to meet the changes in the situation of the churches in this region, as well as to keep in line with the ecumenical renewal in theological education worldwide.\n\n==Profile==\nThe NEST is an undergraduate and graduate theological seminary of some 40 students and seven full and two part-time faculty. The seminary offers the following programs: B.A. in Christian Education; B.Th. with emphasis in pastoral studies; B.Th. in Christian Education; M.A.C.E., a graduate program for educational ministries; M.Div. for Pastoral ministry; S.T.M., a post graduate research degree; and the S.T.M. in Ministry established jointly with [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].\n\nThe seminary is housed in a modern building with classrooms, offices, faculty and student lounges, dining facilities, sanctuary and chapel, coffee shop, dormitory rooms for 50 students, six faculty apartments and a gymnasium and theater which are under construction. The library contains 42,000 volumes in Arabic, Armenian, English, French and German.\n\n==Church relationship==\nThe NEST is under the auspices and support of four mainline Protestant [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches in the [[Middle East]], the [[National Evangelical Synod of Syria and Lebanon]], the [[Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East]], the [[Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East]] of the Anglican Communion, and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land]]. These four local churches jointly sponsor the N.E.S.T. and enjoy the full cooperation and support of Associate Members, all of whom are represented on the Board of Managers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Protestantism in Lebanon]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.theonest.edu.lb Official website]\n\n{{coord missing|Lebanon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Near East School Of Theology}}\n[[Category:Evangelical seminaries and theological colleges]]\n[[Category:Schools in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Education in Beirut]]\n[[Category:Universities in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Protestantism in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1932]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Beirut]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East_School_of_Theology"}

The pioneer settlement had an economy based on the development of lumber, farming, and port industries. In 1892, [[Joseph Eloi Broussard]] opened the first commercially successful rice mill in Texas, stimulating development of rice farming in the area; he also started an irrigation company (since 1933 established as the [[Lower Neches Valley Authority]]) to support rice culture. Rice became an important commodity crop in Texas and is now cultivated in 23 counties.<ref name=\"Handbook\">{{cite web  | title = Broussard, Joseph Eloi  | work = The Handbook of Texas Online  | url = https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbrbh | accessdate = 2015-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nA big change occurred in 1901 with the [[Spindletop]] gusher, which demonstrated that a huge oil field lay underneath and adjacent to the city. With Spindletop, several energy companies developed in Beaumont, and some remain. The area rapidly developed as one of the country's major petro-chemical refining areas. Along with [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]], Beaumont forms the [[Golden Triangle (Texas)|Golden Triangle]], a major industrial area on the Texas [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].\n\nBeaumont is home to [[Lamar University]], a national [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|Carnegie]] Doctoral Research university with 14,966 students, including undergraduates and postgraduates. Over the years, several corporations have been based in this city, including [[Gulf States Utilities]], which had its headquarters in Beaumont until its takeover by [[Entergy Corporation]] in 1993.

Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. The Port of Beaumont became a successful regional shipping center.  Beaumont was a small center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. The city exported rice as a commodity crop.  Beaumont's lumber boom, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, was stimulated by the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads in the state and region after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Robert S.

The first Jewish man in the city was from Louisiana, others migrated from the South, and were joined by immigrants. They worked as merchants and in a variety of jobs in the growing city and ranching area. In 1895 Jews formed their first congregation.<ref>[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/beaumont.html \"Beaumont, Texas\"], ''Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities''</ref> By the early 20th century, the city was served by the Southern Pacific; Kansas City Southern, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; and Missouri Pacific railroad systems.<ref>Robert L.

Spindletop became the first major [[oil field]] and one of the largest in American history. With the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Beaumont's population more than tripled in two months from 9,000 in January 1901 to 30,000 in March 1901. Oil is, and has always been, a major export of the city, and a major contributor to the national GDP.\n\n[[Captain W. C. Tyrrell|William Casper Tyrrell]], nicknamed \"Captain W.C.\", was a leading businessman and oil tycoon in the city in the early 20th century, developing businesses during the [[Texas Oil Boom]]. An entrepreneur from Pennsylvania and Iowa, he arrived after the gusher at [[Spindletop]], and invested in development of a commercial port in the city, and an irrigation system to support the local rice industry, as well as residential and retail development of suburban property. He was also a philanthropist. He purchased and donated First Baptist Church, whose congregation had moved to a new facility, to use as the city's first public library, now known as the [[Tyrrell Historical Library]].<ref>Carolyn Davis Smith, \"Captain William Casper Tyrrell: Philanthropist Extraordinaire and the Legacy of Philanthropy in Beaumont,\" ''Texas Gulf Historical and Biographical Record'' 2002 38: 5\u201318</ref>\n\nWhen the city became a major center for defense shipbuilding during [[World War II]], tens of thousands of rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern whites were working closely with blacks for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyard in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000.<ref>{{cite web | author = James S.

The community served as a stand-in for the British for Paris, France, which was the same distance from London, England as Beaumont is from Terrell.<ref>[[AT6 Monument]]</ref>\n\nIn the postwar years, Beaumont's port continued in importance. As was typical with other cities, post-war highway construction led to the development of new suburbs and dispersal of the population in search of new housing. Recently, there has been some renewal in Downtown Beaumont and in other areas of the city.\n\nIn 1996, the Jefferson County courts, located in Beaumont, became the first court in the nation to implement electronic filing and service of court documents. This eliminated the need for law firms to print and mail reams of documents.\n\nIn 2005 and 2008, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from [[Hurricane Rita]] and [[Hurricane Ike]], respectively. Mandatory evacuations were issued in advance of both storms.\n\nIn August 2017, Beaumont and surrounding areas experienced severe flooding as a result of [[Hurricane Harvey]]. Due to the flooding, Memorial Hermann Baptist Hospital evacuated all of its highest level of acuity patients with the help of National Guard helicopters. In addition, many Beaumont residents had to be rescued by both boats and helicopters as a result of the floodwaters. {{as of|2019|March}}, many residents in the area are still attempting to recover from the hurricane.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|222.3|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|214.5|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|7.9|km2|order=flip}}, or 3.53%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\" />\n\nBeaumont lies on Texas' coastal plain, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], {{convert|85|mi}} east of [[Houston]], and just south of the dense pine forests of [[East Texas]]. The city is bordered on the east by the [[Neches River]] and to the north by [[Pine Island Bayou]]. Before being settled, the area was crisscrossed by numerous small streams. Most of these streams have since been filled in or converted for drainage purposes. The island directly across from Riverfront Park is called Trinity Island. There are also three other islands in the Neches River around the [[Downtown Beaumont|downtown]] area/port: Harbor, Smith and Clark. Beaumont is relatively flat compared to other Texas cites at being 16&nbsp;ft. above sea level. South of Beaumont, Port Arthur is only 7&nbsp;ft. above sea level.\n\n===Towns and communities===\nSeveral towns and communities have been absorbed into the city of Beaumont.

The pioneer settlement had an economy based on the development of lumber, farming, and port industries. In 1892, [[Joseph Eloi Broussard]] opened the first commercially successful rice mill in Texas, stimulating development of rice farming in the area; he also started an irrigation company (since 1933 established as the [[Lower Neches Valley Authority]]) to support rice culture. Rice became an important commodity crop in Texas and is now cultivated in 23 counties.<ref name=\"Handbook\">{{cite web  | title = Broussard, Joseph Eloi  | work = The Handbook of Texas Online  | url = https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbrbh | accessdate = 2015-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nA big change occurred in 1901 with the [[Spindletop]] gusher, which demonstrated that a huge oil field lay underneath and adjacent to the city. With Spindletop, several energy companies developed in Beaumont, and some remain. The area rapidly developed as one of the country's major petro-chemical refining areas. Along with [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]], Beaumont forms the [[Golden Triangle (Texas)|Golden Triangle]], a major industrial area on the Texas [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].\n\nBeaumont is home to [[Lamar University]], a national [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|Carnegie]] Doctoral Research university with 14,966 students, including undergraduates and postgraduates. Over the years, several corporations have been based in this city, including [[Gulf States Utilities]], which had its headquarters in Beaumont until its takeover by [[Entergy Corporation]] in 1993.

Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. The Port of Beaumont became a successful regional shipping center.  Beaumont was a small center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. The city exported rice as a commodity crop.  Beaumont's lumber boom, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, was stimulated by the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads in the state and region after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Robert S.

The first Jewish man in the city was from Louisiana, others migrated from the South, and were joined by immigrants. They worked as merchants and in a variety of jobs in the growing city and ranching area. In 1895 Jews formed their first congregation.<ref>[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/beaumont.html \"Beaumont, Texas\"], ''Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities''</ref> By the early 20th century, the city was served by the Southern Pacific; Kansas City Southern, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; and Missouri Pacific railroad systems.<ref>Robert L.

Spindletop became the first major [[oil field]] and one of the largest in American history. With the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Beaumont's population more than tripled in two months from 9,000 in January 1901 to 30,000 in March 1901. Oil is, and has always been, a major export of the city, and a major contributor to the national GDP.\n\n[[Captain W. C. Tyrrell|William Casper Tyrrell]], nicknamed \"Captain W.C.\", was a leading businessman and oil tycoon in the city in the early 20th century, developing businesses during the [[Texas Oil Boom]]. An entrepreneur from Pennsylvania and Iowa, he arrived after the gusher at [[Spindletop]], and invested in development of a commercial port in the city, and an irrigation system to support the local rice industry, as well as residential and retail development of suburban property. He was also a philanthropist. He purchased and donated First Baptist Church, whose congregation had moved to a new facility, to use as the city's first public library, now known as the [[Tyrrell Historical Library]].<ref>Carolyn Davis Smith, \"Captain William Casper Tyrrell: Philanthropist Extraordinaire and the Legacy of Philanthropy in Beaumont,\" ''Texas Gulf Historical and Biographical Record'' 2002 38: 5\u201318</ref>\n\nWhen the city became a major center for defense shipbuilding during [[World War II]], tens of thousands of rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern whites were working closely with blacks for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyard in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000.<ref>{{cite web | author = James S.

The wartime social disruption was similar to [[List of ethnic riots#War and interwar period: 1914\u20131945|war time riots]] which had occurred in other parts of the country during and following [[World War I]].\n\nDuring the war years, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Beaumont on training flights. The community served as a stand-in for the British for Paris, France, which was the same distance from London, England as Beaumont is from Terrell.<ref>[[AT6 Monument]]</ref>\n\nIn the postwar years, Beaumont's port continued in importance. As was typical with other cities, post-war highway construction led to the development of new suburbs and dispersal of the population in search of new housing. Recently, there has been some renewal in Downtown Beaumont and in other areas of the city.\n\nIn 1996, the Jefferson County courts, located in Beaumont, became the first court in the nation to implement electronic filing and service of court documents. This eliminated the need for law firms to print and mail reams of documents.\n\nIn 2005 and 2008, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from [[Hurricane Rita]] and [[Hurricane Ike]], respectively. Mandatory evacuations were issued in advance of both storms.\n\nIn August 2017, Beaumont and surrounding areas experienced severe flooding as a result of [[Hurricane Harvey]]. Due to the flooding, Memorial Hermann Baptist Hospital evacuated all of its highest level of acuity patients with the help of National Guard helicopters. In addition, many Beaumont residents had to be rescued by both boats and helicopters as a result of the floodwaters. {{as of|2019|March}}, many residents in the area are still attempting to recover from the hurricane.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|222.3|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|214.5|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|7.9|km2|order=flip}}, or 3.53%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\" />\n\nBeaumont lies on Texas' coastal plain, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], {{convert|85|mi}} east of [[Houston]], and just south of the dense pine forests of [[East Texas]]. The city is bordered on the east by the [[Neches River]] and to the north by [[Pine Island Bayou]]. Before being settled, the area was crisscrossed by numerous small streams. Most of these streams have since been filled in or converted for drainage purposes. The island directly across from Riverfront Park is called Trinity Island. There are also three other islands in the Neches River around the [[Downtown Beaumont|downtown]] area/port: Harbor, Smith and Clark. Beaumont is relatively flat compared to other Texas cites at being 16&nbsp;ft. above sea level. South of Beaumont, Port Arthur is only 7&nbsp;ft. above sea level.\n\n===Towns and communities===\nSeveral towns and communities have been absorbed into the city of Beaumont. These include: Amelia, established in 1885 and incorporated into Beaumont in 1956; Elizabeth, the depot of Amelia that was established around 1903 or after and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Elwood, established sometimes in the late 1800s, changed to Voth in 1902, and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Guffey, post office was established in 1901 and closed in 1925 but is part of Beaumont now; Santa Anna, became part of Beaumont when it was founded; Tevis Bluff, became part of Beaumont when it was founded in 1835.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Republic of Texas Land Grants'', \"Jefferson County Towns and Communities\"|url=https://www.co.jefferson.tx.us/historical_commission/files/History/Jefferson_County_History_2015-12-03.pdf|publisher=Texas historical Commission||page= 68|accessdate=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n   \n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Beaumont, Texas}}\n\nThe city of Beaumont is within the [[humid subtropical]] climate regime,<ref>Thomas J.

The city has two distinct seasons, a [[wet season]] from April to October and a [[dry season]] from November to March. Hurricanes also pose a threat to the region.

This was largely a result of McKay's views on both education and strengthening the church outside of its longtime intermountain west U.S. base. The original class consisted of 153 students and 20 faculty meeting in old [[World War II]] buildings, with [[Reuben D. Law]] as the school's first president. The school's first buildings were dedicated on December 17, 1958. The college was at first a two-year college but was reorganized in 1959 to become a four-year college. By 1961 the college had been granted four-year accreditation by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]]. Dormitories, a cafeteria, and other buildings had also been constructed.<ref name = \"History\" />\n\nLDS [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] established the [[Polynesian Cultural Center]] in November 1963 as a means of preserving the Pacific cultures that the Latter-day Saints had encountered in their [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] work.  In the 1970s, the school was also used to teach LDS missionaries pacific languages and cultures before going out to the islands. The center also provided jobs for students of the college.  In 1974, the Church College of Hawaii was elevated to the rank of university by the [[Church Educational System|Church Board of Education]] and renamed.\n\nThe school was governed as a satellite campus of [[Brigham Young University]] in Provo, Utah until 2004, when it was announced that the school would report directly to the [[Commissioner of Church Education]].

Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the [[Brigham Young Academy]] and educator [[Karl G. Maeser]]. Maeser created the \"Domestic Organization,\" which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.\n\nThe Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and [[academic dishonesty]]. [[Ernest L. Wilkinson]] expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. (At this time, Wilkinson, as President of BYU, had some authority over BYU\u2013Hawaii as well.) This led to the Honor Code today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs and alcohol. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure.<ref name=BYUhouse3>{{cite book |last1= Bergera |first1= Gary James |last2= Priddis |first2= Ronald |year= 1985 |chapter= Chapter 3: Standards & the Honor Code |chapter-url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=13895 |title= Brigham Young University: A House of Faith |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Signature Books]] |isbn= 0-941214-34-6 |oclc= 12963965 }}</ref> One significant difference between the versions of the Honor Code used at the main BYU campus and BYU\u2013Hawaii is specific prohibition of the drinking of [[kava]] by BYU-Hawaii students and faculty.

Two years after the temple was dedicated then-[[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|LDS Church apostle]] [[David O. McKay]] stated the church would build a school in the area in the future.

This was largely a result of McKay's views on both education and strengthening the church outside of its longtime intermountain west U.S. base. The original class consisted of 153 students and 20 faculty meeting in old [[World War II]] buildings, with [[Reuben D. Law]] as the school's first president. The school's first buildings were dedicated on December 17, 1958. The college was at first a two-year college but was reorganized in 1959 to become a four-year college. By 1961 the college had been granted four-year accreditation by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]]. Dormitories, a cafeteria, and other buildings had also been constructed.<ref name = \"History\" />\n\nLDS [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] established the [[Polynesian Cultural Center]] in November 1963 as a means of preserving the Pacific cultures that the Latter-day Saints had encountered in their [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] work.  In the 1970s, the school was also used to teach LDS missionaries pacific languages and cultures before going out to the islands. The center also provided jobs for students of the college.  In 1974, the Church College of Hawaii was elevated to the rank of university by the [[Church Educational System|Church Board of Education]] and renamed.\n\nThe school was governed as a satellite campus of [[Brigham Young University]] in Provo, Utah until 2004, when it was announced that the school would report directly to the [[Commissioner of Church Education]].

Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the [[Brigham Young Academy]] and educator [[Karl G. Maeser]]. Maeser created the \"Domestic Organization,\" which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.\n\nThe Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and [[academic dishonesty]]. [[Ernest L. Wilkinson]] expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. (At this time, Wilkinson, as President of BYU, had some authority over BYU\u2013Hawaii as well.) This led to the Honor Code today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs and alcohol. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure.<ref name=BYUhouse3>{{cite book |last1= Bergera |first1= Gary James |last2= Priddis |first2= Ronald |year= 1985 |chapter= Chapter 3: Standards & the Honor Code |chapter-url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=13895 |title= Brigham Young University: A House of Faith |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Signature Books]] |isbn= 0-941214-34-6 |oclc= 12963965 }}</ref> One significant difference between the versions of the Honor Code used at the main BYU campus and BYU\u2013Hawaii is specific prohibition of the drinking of [[kava]] by BYU-Hawaii students and faculty.

When Sarah's apartment lease is up, she moves back into their old home and suggests to Macon that they start over. Macon leaves Muriel, and he and Sarah set up house once more.\n\nWhen Macon visits [[Paris]] for research, Muriel surprises him by showing up on the same flight and stays in the same Paris hotel, recommended by Macon in one of his travel guides.  She suggests that they enjoy themselves as if they are vacationing together.

Macon's back is still in pain the day before his return flight to Baltimore. Sarah proposes they reschedule the flight and make the trip a second honeymoon to which Macon agrees. However, Sarah continues to question Macon about his relationship with and attraction to Muriel, angering Macon.\n\nThe next morning, Macon dresses while Sarah still sleeps, then wakes her to tell her that he is going back to Muriel. On the way to the airport, Macon spots Muriel hailing a taxi and tells the driver to stop. Thinking the driver stopped for her, Muriel bends to gather her luggage and catches sight of Macon in the taxi. She smiles, and Macon returns the smile.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Hurt]] as Macon Leary\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Sarah Leary\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Muriel Pritchett\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Julian Edge\n* [[Amy Wright]] as Rose Leary\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Porter Leary\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Charles Leary\n* [[Robert Hy Gorman]] as Alexander Pritchett\n* [[Bradley Mott]] as Mr. Loomis\n* [[Seth Granger]] as Ethan Leary\n* [[Jake Kasdan]] as Scott Canfield\n* [[Jonathan Kasdan]] as boy at doctor's office\n* [[Peggy Converse]] as Mrs. Barrett\n* [[Walter Sparrow]] as hot dog vendor\n* [[Paul Williamson]] as London hotel manager\n* [[Audrey Rapoport]] as girl on plane\n* [[Meg Kasdan]] as receptionist\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Roger Ebert]] praised the film, giving it four out of four stars.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890106/REVIEWS/901060301/1023 | title =  The Accidental Tourist | date =  January 6, 1989 | author = Roger Ebert | authorlink = Roger Ebert | work = Chicago Sun Times }}</ref> The film holds a rating of 81% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 32 reviews. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/accidental_tourist|title= The Accidental Tourist (1988)|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n'''Won:'''\n* [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] - [[Geena Davis]]\n* [[New York Film Critics Circle Awards]] 1988 - Best Film \n* [[USC Scripter Award 1988]]\n* [[Golden Horse Award]] for Best Foreign Actor - [[William Hurt]]\n\n'''Nominated:'''\n* [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]\n* [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]\n* [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama]]\n* [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]]\n* Golden St. George - [[16th Moscow International Film Festival]]<ref name=\"Moscow1989\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |title=16th Moscow International Film Festival (1989) |accessdate=2013-03-02 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316085017/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |archivedate=2013-03-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2002: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]] \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/passions400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0094606|title=The Accidental Tourist}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|accidental_tourist}}\n* {{Mojo title|accidentaltourist}}\n\n{{Lawrence Kasdan}}\n{{Anne Tyler}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Accidental Tourist}}\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:1980s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lawrence Kasdan]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Maryland]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Williams]]\n", "text_old": "{{ref improve|date=February 2015}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Accidental Tourist\n| image          = The_accidental_tourist.jpg\n| image size     = \n| border         = yes\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Lawrence Kasdan]]\n| producer       = Lawrence Kasdan<br>Charles Okun<br>Michael Grillo\n| screenplay     = [[Frank Galati]]<br>Lawrence Kasdan\n| based on       = {{based on|''[[The Accidental Tourist]]''|[[Anne Tyler]]}}\n| narrator       =\n| starring       = {{plainlist|\n* [[William Hurt]]\n* [[Kathleen Turner]]\n* [[Geena Davis]]\n* [[Bill Pullman]]}}\n| music          = [[John Williams]]\n| cinematography = [[John Bailey (cinematographer)|John Bailey]]\n| editing        = [[Carol Littleton]]\n| distributor    = [[Warner Bros.]]\n| released       = {{Film date|1988|12|23}}\n| runtime        = 121 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         =\n| gross          = $32.6 million (United&nbsp;States)\n}}\n'''''The Accidental Tourist''''' is a 1988 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and starring [[William Hurt]], [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Geena Davis]].

At that time, BMA held two higher educational institutions including BMA Medical College and Vajira Hospital and Kuakarun College of Nursing, yet, these two institutions did not have official higher education institute status and thus could not grant their own certificate. Both two colleges' graduates were granted degrees by [[Mahidol University]] as Mahidol affiliated institutes.\n\nThe \"Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Autonomous University Act B.E. ...\" draft was submitted to the [[Cabinet of Thailand|cabinet]] on June 2007.

Student numbers grew to over 1200 by 1995. During the same period academic staff grew to 85. On 27 May 1995 the university held its first graduation ceremony at which the Doctor of Technology honorary degree was conferred upon the President and Chancellor Cde R.G. Mugabe. Some graduates from the Faculties of Commerce and Applied Sciences were capped.\n\nOn 20 July 1995 the university held its second graduation ceremony, where 281 graduands were capped. The first cohort of graduates from the Faculty of Industrial Technology and the Department of Computer Science were conferred with degrees on that occasion.\n\nA donation by the Bulawayo City Council of a site 160 hectares in size and the provision of a capital budget by the government has enabled the first construction phase to begin. Work started in March 1992 when the first contract valued at Z$4,6m was awarded to A. P. Gledinning for the bulk earth works and civil engineering construction for roads. Briefs for the building were completed in May 1992.\n\nIn July 1993 the construction programme started with the award of the first contract to Belmont Construction for the Administration Block. A year later, in September 1994 the second contractor, International Construction Zimbabwe started work on the Faculty of Commerce block. In November and December 1994 work also started on the departments of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering respectively. Construction of the first student hostel began a year later, in September 1995. Work on the library began in April 1998, followed by the Ceremonial Hall and the Student Services Centre in November of the same year.\n\nThe university moved to campus on 1 August 1998, to occupy the Faculty of Commerce and Administration Buildings. The first lectures on campus took place in the Faculty of Commerce Building on 17 August 1998.\n\nIn 2011 '''NUST faculty of Medicine''' was closed because it was unable to comply with medical council requirements. The Zimbabwean government went even further by declaring that any diplomas, degrees, or certificates received from the medical school through government funding would be withdrawn until these graduates served the government for the years they received funding.
