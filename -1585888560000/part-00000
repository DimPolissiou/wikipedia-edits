{"title_page": "Israil Bercovici", "text_new": "'''Israil (Israel) Bercovici''' ({{IPA-ro|isra\u02c8il \u02c8berkovit\u0361\u0283\u02b2}}; 1921&ndash;1988) was a [[Jew]]ish [[Romania]]n dramaturg, playwright, director, biographer, and memoirist, who served the [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]] of Romania between 1955 and 1982; he also wrote [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-language]] poetry.\n\n==Biography==\nBercovici was born into a poor working-class family in [[Boto\u015fani]], Romania, and received a traditional Jewish education. During [[World War II]] he served time at hard labor until the arrival of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Army in Romania.\n\nAfter the war, he began his career in Yiddish-language newspapers and radio, notably the weekly ''[[IKUF-Bleter]]'' (1946&ndash;1953), and the ''Revista Cultului Mozaic din R.P.R.'' (''[[Journal of Jewish Culture in the People's Republic of Romania]]'', also known as ''Tsaytshrift''). The ''Journal'' was launched in 1956 and had sections in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], Yiddish and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Bercovici edited the Yiddish section from 1970 to 1972.\n\nAs a literature student after the war at a secular secondary school in [[Bucharest]], Bercovici published his first Yiddish-language poetry in ''IKUF-Bleter''. Judging by theater reviews he wrote in the early 1950s, he appears to have been an ardent Communist, grateful for his liberation from the labor camp and for the opportunity to receive a secular education, advocating a [[socialist realism|socialist realist]] aesthetic for Yiddish-language theater.\n\nHis affiliation with the State Jewish Theater began in 1955, initially as ''\"literarischer Sekret\u00e4r\"''. He continued to be very aware of developments in theater beyond the Yiddish language: he drove the theater toward being a contemporary theater, rather than a mere museum of inherited plays. Elvira Groezinger compares his goals to those of [[New York City]]'s [[Arbeter Teater Farband]] (ARTEF, \"Workers' Theatre Society\"), goals well-aligned with those of the Communist regime.\n\nBercovici translated works from world literature: [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s ''Frank V'' (1964), [[Karl Gutzkow]]'s ''[[Uriel Acosta]]'' (1968), and [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1972), and wrote his own Yiddish-language plays, including ''Der goldener fodem'' (\"The Golden Thread\", 1963), about [[Abraham Goldfaden]] (who in 1876 founded the world's first Yiddish-language theater, in [[Ia\u015fi]], Romania), and the musical revue ''A shnirl perl'' (\"A Pearl Necklace\", 1967). He also wrote books about Yiddish theater history.\n\nToward the end of Bercovici's career, in Romania, as elsewhere in Europe, Yiddish was a language in decline. The State Jewish Theater coped, in part, by installing headphones throughout the theater to allow simultaneous translation of the plays into Romanian; the system is still in use when the theater performs Yiddish-language plays today.\n\nBercovici's 3000-volume Yiddish-language library is now part of the Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Potsdam.\n\nIsrail Bercovici claims that the [[Danse Macabre]] originated among [[Sephardic Jews]] in 14th century Spain (Bercovici, 1992, p.&nbsp;27).\n\n==Works for theater==\nThe following list is drawn from Bercovici's own history of Yiddish theater in Romania ([Bercovici 1998]). The list may be incomplete; many of Bercovici's works were musical and folkloric [[revue]]s and some were reworkings of [[Purim]] plays. The music for most of Bercovici's plays was composed by [[Haim Schwartzmann]]; \"The Golden Thread\" also uses music by Avram Goldfaden, whom the play is about. Schwartzmann and Eugen Koffler contributed music for ''A Pearl Necklace'' and ''Bara\u015feum '72''; ''Mangheriada'' used music by Schwartzmann, Koffler, [[Dov Seltzer|Dubi Seltzer]], Henech Cohn, and Simha Schwartz; a 1976 production of \"The Golden Thread\" credits additional music by Adalbert Winkler.\n\nThe list contains Romanian-language titles and Yiddish-language titles with Romanian phonetic transcription. Some works had only a Romanian language title; when titles in both languages are given by Bercovici, the Romanian title precedes the Yiddish.

As a figure on Romania's [[Modernist literature|modernist]] scene throughout the early [[interwar period]], he was noted for combining a [[picturesque]] perspective on the rural [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian community]], to which he belonged, with traditionalist and [[avant-garde]] elements. His early works, including the novel ''Copil\u0103ria unui netrebnic'' (\"The Childhood of a Ne'er-do-well\"), bring together elements of [[Social Realism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Expressionism]] over a conventional narrative line based on [[oral tradition]] and the classics of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]]. C\u0103lug\u0103ru, who moved from the moderate ''[[Contimporanul]]'' magazine to the Surrealist platform ''[[unu]]'', was also one of the main contributors to ''Integral'', a tribune for avant-garde literature in general. Although publicly known for his [[Socialism|socialist]] convictions and his [[far left]] inclinations, he was, through his position at ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'' newspaper, present in the proximity of [[Fascism|fascist]] circles, and had an ambiguous attitude toward his employer, the [[far right]] thinker [[Nae Ionescu]].\n\nShortly before the establishment of Romania's [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], C\u0103lug\u0103ru embraced [[Socialist Realism]] and became and made official his relationship with the ruling [[Romanian Communist Party]]. During this final period of his career, he wrote the controversial novel ''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine'' (\"Steel and Bread\"), an epic of [[industrialization]], widely seen as one of the most representative samples of politicized literature to have seen print in 1950s Romania. Despite his formal affiliation to [[Marxism-Leninism]], C\u0103lug\u0103ru had doubts about the new political realities and commented with sarcasm on the regime's self-contradictions. These opinions were expressed in his private diaries, which became the subject of research and public scrutiny some fifty years after his death.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and debut===\nA native of [[Dorohoi]] ''[[shtetl]]'', in the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Moldavia]], Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru spent his early years in relative cultural isolation among the local Jewish community. This environment, which was later the main focus of his literary work, was described by literary historian [[Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu]] as \"not actually a [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]] life\", but made distinct from other environments for being both Jewish and Moldavian.<ref name=\"oc346\">Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.346</ref> Researcher [[Paul Cernat]] also noted that C\u0103lug\u0103ru, like his future Surrealist colleague [[Benjamin Fondane]], illustrated the Jewish section of the Romanian [[avant-garde]] and its connections with the local [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] tradition.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda...'', p.34, 36, 276</ref>\n\nShortly after [[World War I]], the young author moved to [[Bucharest]], together with his poet friend [[Sa\u0219a Pan\u0103]]. He managed to attend the [[Matei Basarab National College (Bucharest)|Matei Basarab National College]], but lived precariously\u2014his family lacked the means to support him.<ref name=\"to132\"/> According to his friends' testimonies, he was still noticeably poor, well into the 1930s.<ref>Boia, p.34</ref>\n\nTogether with Fondane and Pan\u0103, he was one of the regulars at the literary parties hosted by controversial businessman [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pite\u0219ti]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda...'', p.34, 39; Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.346, 347</ref> The three became well acquainted with the [[avant-garde]] society of Bucharest.

Croitoru received his first encouragements from critic [[Eugen Lovinescu]], who published his texts in ''[[Sbur\u0103torul]]'' magazine.

Later that decade however, he parted with this group and began working with the original representatives of Romanian Surrealism, contributing his works to publications such as ''Integral'' (which he helped establish) and ''[[unu]]''. He was also a member of ''Integral''{{'}}s editorial staff, alongside writers Brunea-Fox and Voronca, with artist [[M. H. Maxy]] as administrative director.<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.167</ref> In doing so, he broke with Vinea's moderation, [[eclecticism]] and political ambiguity to side with what was the more radical and most explicitly [[left-wing]] tendency among young writers.<ref name=\"pcsubterana\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Subterana-politica-a-avangardei-romanesti*articleID_19500-articles_details.html \"Subterana politic\u0103 a avangardei rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti\"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 417, April 2008</ref><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda...'', p.239-244, 413; Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.65-66, 166, 346</ref> In 1932 however, C\u0103lug\u0103ru was, with poet [[N.

The three were in correspondence, and, according to Roll's testimony, C\u0103lug\u0103ru was making efforts at establishing Fondane's reputation at home by reviewing his [[French language|French-language]] poetry.<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.99, 107</ref> C\u0103lug\u0103ru's social networking with the avant-garde also earned him a profile among Bucharest's informal avant-garde salons. According to the personal recollections of art historian [[Amelia Pavel]] (at the time a high school student debuting on the social scene), C\u0103lug\u0103ru frequented the same social circle as cartoonist [[Saul Steinberg]] and poet [[Sesto Pals]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Amelia Pavel]], [http://www.romlit.ro/prieteni_din_anii_30 \"Prieteni din anii '30\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311230036/http://www.romlit.ro/prieteni_din_anii_30 |date=2012-03-11 }}, in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 30/2003</ref>\n\nIn tandem, he was building connections with the militant socialist or [[Communism|communist]] groups: a contributor to the leftist platform ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul Liber (1924)|Cuv\u00e2ntul Liber]]'', C\u0103lug\u0103ru also sent his work to be published in more radical magazines sponsored by the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR)\u2014''Reporter'' and ''Era Nou\u0103'', both edited by pro-PCR activist [[N.

Cocea]].<ref>Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.153, 166, 346</ref> Himself a [[Marxism|Marxist]], Crohm\u0103lniceanu noted that C\u0103lug\u0103ru's gradual move toward a Marxist outlook was determined by his commitment to Surrealism. This path, he proposed, made C\u0103lug\u0103ru a voice similar to those of other left-wing Surrealists: [[Louis Aragon]], [[Robert Desnos]], [[Paul \u00c9luard]], [[Pablo Neruda]] internationally, [[Geo Bogza]] and [[Miron Radu Paraschivescu]] locally; but also that it made him stand in contrast to younger Surrealists who chose [[libertarian socialism]] ([[Gherasim Luca]] and [[Dolfi Trost]]).<ref>Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.73</ref> Around 1937, C\u0103lug\u0103ru was also a columnist for ''Reporter'', with a series of social and [[Satire|satirical]] pieces collectively titled ''Urangutania'' (from ''urangutan'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"[[orangutan]]\").<ref>Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.158</ref> He was also a sporadic contributor to writer [[Isac Ludo]]'s leftist publication, ''Adam'',<ref>Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.345</ref> and had personal contacts with various leftist organizations representing the Jewish community.<ref name=\"pcsubterana\"/>\n\nThe leftist politicization of Romania's avant-garde and its connections with a banned party soon alarmed the political establishment: like other members of the ''unu'' faction, C\u0103lug\u0103ru was constantly monitored and informed upon by the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s secret service, ''[[Siguran\u021ba Statului]]''. This resulted in a sizable personal file, which informed on not just his underground connections but also, reflecting the secret policemen's personal [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] tendencies rather than official policy,<ref name=\"pcsubterana\"/> his publicized critique of [[fascism]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. The ''Siguran\u021ba'' operatives therefore found cause for concern in one of C\u0103lug\u0103ru's mocking essays, targeting Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name=\"pcsubterana\"/>\n\nThe dossier also includes the denunciations provided by Sergiu Dan's brother, Mihail, who had infiltrated the ''unu'' group. His notes document the conflict between Vinea's publications and the ''unu'' group from an interpersonal perspective: Mihail Dan alleged that Roll, together with his fellow writers [[Sa\u0219a Pan\u0103]] and [[Geo Bogza]], exercised absolute control over ''unu'', leading into an explicitly communist and artistically inferior direction.<ref name=\"pcsubterana\"/>\n\n===''Integral'' theorist and film critic===\nThe diverse allegiances affected C\u0103lug\u0103ru's literary work, being reflected in a new series of works, many of which were urban-themed and distinctly modernist. According to Crohm\u0103lniceanu's classification, the subsequent works fall into two main categories: on one hand, the urban-themed modernist novels, including ''Paradisul statistic'' (\"Statistical Paradise\", 1926), ''Omul de dup\u0103 u\u0219\u0103'' (\"The Man behind the Door\", 1931), ''Don Juan Coco\u0219atul'' (\"[[Don Juan]] the Hunchback\", 1934), ''Erdora'' (1934), alongside the 1935 short story collection ''De la cinci p\u00e2n\u0103 la cinci'' (\"From Five to Five\"); on the other, the writings with rural or mixed rural-urban subjects\u2014''Abecedar de povestiri populare'' (\"A Primer of Folk Stories\", 1930), ''Copil\u0103ria unui netrebnic'' (1936), ''Trustul'' (\"The Trust\", 1937), ''Lumina prim\u01ceverii'' (\"The Light of Spring\", 1947).<ref name=\"oc347\">Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.347</ref>\n\nIn joining the common effort of ''Integral'' writers, C\u0103lug\u0103ru threw his support behind a literary movement that viewed itself as both urban and innovative, theorizing connections between the creative human and the modern rhythms of technology.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda...'', p.225; R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.150</ref> His interest in cutting edge modernism was also leading him to explore the world of cinema, as a result of which he was also one of ''Integral''{{'}}s film critics, with Fondane, Roll, [[Barbu Florian]], [[I.

The result was described by Crohm\u0103lniceanu as \"an actual [[monograph]] of humanity\", depicted with \"unusual sensory acuteness\" and the \"suaveness\" of [[Marc Chagall]]'s paintings, inviting readers into a universe at once \"tough\" and \"[[bucolic]]\".<ref name=\"oc348\">Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.348</ref> At the core, the same critic argued, was: \"The [[osmosis]] between the autochthonous [Romanian] element and an age-old foreign [Jewish] tradition\".<ref name=\"oc348\"/> The text makes heavy use of the [[picturesque]] in depicting scenes of Jewish life.

In Macovescu's opinion, the text \"is not a reportage, but an article not yet woven, or a fragment from a report not so well researched.\"<ref>Selejan, p.333</ref>\n\n===''Casa \u0219oarecilor''===\nThe ''Casa \u0219oarecilor'' pieces, which are the last stories ever published under Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru's name, do not comply with the Socialist Realist canon. The volume's first section, titled ''Schi\u021be f\u0103r\u0103 umor'' (\"Humorless Sketches\"), comprise literary portraits and musings. Critic Simona Vasilache notes that such fragments revolve around the author's subjective perception of the world: \"Not all the phrases make sense, not all the scenes have depth, that being because C\u0103lug\u0103ru's search is not one for clarity but, quite the contrary, for the vapor. The sensation of memory, more precious than the reasoned test of memory.\"<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> The volume, she notes, comprises elements from all the stages in C\u0103lug\u0103ru's early career, from \"the [[Lyricism|lyrical]] exercises of youth\" to \"lively dialogues, written with good craftsmanship\".<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> The stories mark a return to C\u0103lug\u0103ru's preoccupation with rural and suburban life. They introduce characters who live meager existence on the margin of society, such as the [[Tatars of Romania|Tatar]] Mahmud, hanged on cherry tree, and the philosophical Jewish salesman \u0218melche.<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> One piece, believed by Vasilache to echo the sketches of Romania's 19th century classic [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], shows a female shopkeeper on the night of her husband's death, struggling between closing the establishment to mark his death or keeping it open to pay for his funeral.<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> Other fragments resurrect Buiuma\u0219 and some other protagonists of ''Copil\u0103ria...''. The eponymous story begins with the boy and his mother inquiring about a possible inheritance from a relative in Japan, and culminates in describing the hypnotic effect of mice swarming around the local post office.<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> One other short narrative shows Buiuma\u0219 lecturing his playmates about justice and sin, described by Vasilache as a strange outcome: \"A child would have found any other means. That is why the sketches' endings are puzzling, depicting, with stinginess in words and even more stinginess in deeds, a world that is no longer itself.\"<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/>\n\nThe second half of ''Casa \u0219oarecilor'' comprises novellas such as ''Sfin\u021benia lui Veniamin Jidovul'' (\"The Holiness of Veniamin the Jew\")\u2014described by Vasilache as \"a ''[[Vanitas|vanitas vanitatum]]'' just as hasty, just as cruel as is the world of [''Schi\u021be f\u0103r\u0103 umor''], with barbaric shindigs, indifferent to death, living through the pointless momentary torments.\"<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> These stories rely heavily on documenting the person's imaginary universe, as is the case with ''Firi ne\u00een\u021belese'' (\"Misunderstood Characters\") and ''Conflictul meu cu Portugalia'' (\"My Conflict with Portugal\").<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> Vasilache notes: \"These are merely projected ideas, grouped together by a not so tightly knit web of a narrative. [...] Random matches, over which blows an avant-garde wind.\"<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nIon C\u0103lug\u0103ru's Socialist Realist work, like other writings by his peers, fell out of favor in the 1970s and '80s: [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s [[National communism|national communist]] leadership entirely discarded earlier expressions of socialist literature, and removed most of them from the [[Education in Romania|national curriculum]].<ref name=\"ipmanuale\"/> C\u0103lug\u0103ru's books of the 1950s were reevaluated critically especially following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], with which came the end of Romania's communist period. The 1995 ''Dic\u021bionarul scriitorilor rom\u00e2ni'' (\"Romanian Writers' Dictionary\"), edited by [[Mircea Zaciu]], [[Marian Papahagi]] and [[Aurel Sasu]], noted: \"[Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru] had engaged himself, with short-term profits, but failure in the long run, into an intervention against nature and [...] against the nature of art, but also against his own nature: abruptly moving from eroticism to heroism, he was not recommended for such an enterprise by either his native temperament, his collected life experience, and his artistic means. Together with the other relics of proletkult, ''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine'' is presently interesting at most as a symptomatic study case for an as yet virtual sociology of literature.\"<ref name=\"iluzina\"/> L\u0103cust\u0103 also noted: \"After four and a half decades, [''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine''] can perhaps only be read as a literary document of its epoch.\"<ref name=\"iluzina\"/> In contrast, others have defended the interwar C\u0103lug\u0103ru as a writer of talent. This is the case of Simu\u021b, who notes that C\u0103lug\u0103ru, like his Jewish cogenerationists [[Ury Benador]] and [[I. Peretz]], is one of the \"interesting\" details \"worthy of an honest literary history.\"<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Ion Simu\u021b]], [http://www.romlit.ro/gelozia_maladiv \"Gelozia maladiv\u0103\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 43/2005</ref> Henri Zalis, who took charge of a project to reedit C\u0103lug\u0103ru's early writings as part of a larger project involving interwar Jewish contributions, complained in 2004 that there was a real danger that writers from C\u0103lug\u0103ru to [[Felix Aderca]], [[Sergiu Dan]] and [[Alexandru Jar]] would be forgotten by the public, \"pulverized\" by literary historians, their work \"degraded by antisemitic hawking\".<ref name=\"hzapropieri\"/>\n\nDuring the Ceau\u0219escu years, C\u0103lug\u0103ru's rival Dumitriu also parted with Socialist Realism and began writing more unconventional stories. Literary historian [[Ion Vartic]], who proposes that Dumitriu built his new career on [[plagiarism]], notes that many of his short stories and novels incorporated real-life stories told by his elder Ion Vinea. Vartic concludes that one such short piece, published by Dumitriu under the title ''Cafin\u00e9'', is an \"erotic farce\" played on Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru at some point during the interwar period.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Ion Vartic]], [http://www.romlit.ro/petru_dumitriu_i_negrul_su_ii \"Petru Dumitriu \u0219i 'negrul' s\u0103u (II)\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 16/2005</ref>\n\nMentions of C\u0103lug\u0103ru's life are also present in [[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''Autobiography'', written during Eliade's self-exile and teaching career at the [[University of Chicago]]. Eliade notably describes his meeting with the ''Cuv\u00e2ntul'' journalist, recalling his surprise that C\u0103lug\u0103ru's everyday vocabulary seemed to be quoting avant-garde stories by [[Urmuz]] or [[Sa\u0219a Pan\u0103]].<ref name=\"ippudriera\"/> Recalling her 1971 meeting with Eliade on American soil, Romanian poet [[Constan\u021ba Buzea]] wrote: \"[Eliade] asks if Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru has an echo among us, today.

As a figure on Romania's [[Modernist literature|modernist]] scene throughout the early [[interwar period]], he was noted for combining a [[picturesque]] perspective on the rural [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian community]], to which he belonged, with traditionalist and [[avant-garde]] elements. His early works, including the novel ''Copil\u0103ria unui netrebnic'' (\"The Childhood of a Ne'er-do-well\"), bring together elements of [[Social Realism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Expressionism]] over a conventional narrative line based on [[oral tradition]] and the classics of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]]. C\u0103lug\u0103ru, who moved from the moderate ''[[Contimporanul]]'' magazine to the Surrealist platform ''[[unu]]'', was also one of the main contributors to ''Integral'', a tribune for avant-garde literature in general. Although publicly known for his [[Socialism|socialist]] convictions and his [[far left]] inclinations, he was, through his position at ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'' newspaper, present in the proximity of [[Fascism|fascist]] circles, and had an ambiguous attitude toward his employer, the [[far right]] thinker [[Nae Ionescu]].\n\nShortly before the establishment of Romania's [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], C\u0103lug\u0103ru embraced [[Socialist Realism]] and became and made official his relationship with the ruling [[Romanian Communist Party]]. During this final period of his career, he wrote the controversial novel ''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine'' (\"Steel and Bread\"), an epic of [[industrialization]], widely seen as one of the most representative samples of politicized literature to have seen print in 1950s Romania. Despite his formal affiliation to [[Marxism-Leninism]], C\u0103lug\u0103ru had doubts about the new political realities and commented with sarcasm on the regime's self-contradictions. These opinions were expressed in his private diaries, which became the subject of research and public scrutiny some fifty years after his death.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and debut===\nA native of [[Dorohoi]] ''[[shtetl]]'', in the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Moldavia]], Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru spent his early years in relative cultural isolation among the local Jewish community. This environment, which was later the main focus of his literary work, was described by literary historian [[Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu]] as \"not actually a [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]] life\", but made distinct from other environments for being both Jewish and Moldavian.<ref name=\"oc346\">Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.346</ref> Researcher [[Paul Cernat]] also noted that C\u0103lug\u0103ru, like his future Surrealist colleague [[Benjamin Fondane]], illustrated the Jewish section of the Romanian [[avant-garde]] and its connections with the local [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] tradition.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda...'', p.34, 36, 276</ref>\n\nShortly after [[World War I]], the young author moved to [[Bucharest]], together with his poet friend [[Sa\u0219a Pan\u0103]].

This view was criticized by C\u0103lug\u0103ru's contemporary, modernist literary chronicler [[Perpessicius]], who noted that all these authors had matured before Urmuz was even discovered by the literary establishment, and as such that they could not be considered Urmuz's pupils (an assessment described by Cernat as \"singular, although somewhat amendable\").<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda...'', p.348</ref> In contrast, Perpessicius' colleague [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]] included C\u0103lug\u0103ru among those modernists who incorporated Urmuz's brand of [[absurdism]] in works they wrote well into their careers.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda...'', p.349</ref> According to Cernat, C\u0103lug\u0103ru's texts, like those of his various colleagues, have assimilated the \"Urmuz effect\".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda...'', p.345</ref>\n\nC\u0103lug\u0103ru's subsequent work in the novel genre was considered important, but less accomplished than his novellas, by literary chronicler [[Pericle Martinescu]].<ref name=\"pmdiscutii\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Pericle Martinescu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/societateademaine/pdf/BCUCLUJ_FP_279802_1936_013_002.pdf \"Discu\u021bii \u0219i recenzii.

The result was described by Crohm\u0103lniceanu as \"an actual [[monograph]] of humanity\", depicted with \"unusual sensory acuteness\" and the \"suaveness\" of [[Marc Chagall]]'s paintings, inviting readers into a universe at once \"tough\" and \"[[bucolic]]\".<ref name=\"oc348\">Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.348</ref> At the core, the same critic argued, was: \"The [[osmosis]] between the autochthonous [Romanian] element and an age-old foreign [Jewish] tradition\".<ref name=\"oc348\"/> The text makes heavy use of the [[picturesque]] in depicting scenes of Jewish life. Some such aspects relate specifically to the minute characteristics of Judaism as practiced in a provincial community: the ''[[yeshiva]]'' is disrupted by the intrusion of a cow,<ref name=\"gc795; oc348\">C\u0103linescu, p.795; Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.348</ref> while synagogue life is interrupted by what George C\u0103linescu refers to as \"the tiny comedies of [[bigotry]]\".<ref name=\"gc795\"/> The ritual itself is a source for wonder, as is the case with a common wedding, presented by the narrator as an alluring magic ritual.<ref name=\"gc795; oc348\"/> In one chapter, whose symbolism is seen by C\u0103linescu as pointing to \"the universality of faith\", Mihalache, the local Christian tasked with supervising the burning candles after service in the temple, finds himself thrilled by the spectacle they offer, and marks a [[Sign of the Cross]].<ref name=\"gc795\"/> The [[Shabbath]] ritual, Henri Zalis suggests, gives a respectable, mystical, air to what is a slow-moving and decadent, but \"unique\", ''shtetl'' community.<ref name=\"hzapropieri\"/>\n\nThese are complemented by various [[anecdote]]-like episodes: the [[Romanian Police|Romanian policeman]] makes a habit of frightening Jewish children; the beggar Moi\u0219\u0103 Lungu recounts macabre stories whereas the local Jewish women are fascinated by the short passage through the region of [[List of Romanian consorts|Romania's Queen]].<ref name=\"oc349\">Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.349</ref> An episode, seen by Henri Zalis as reuniting the book's \"ingenious characters\" and \"infantile mystique\", shows the encounter between Buiuma\u0219 and a [[rabbi]] at a lively county fair.<ref name=\"hzapropieri\"/> Such details, Crohm\u0103lniceanu notes, are completed by C\u0103lug\u0103ru's recourse to linguistic resourcefulness in authentically rendering his characters' speech patterns: an accumulation of proverbs, idiotisms and [[Curse|execrations]], sourced from a common oral culture and together reflecting \"a bitter life experience\".<ref name=\"oc349\"/> Samples of this include sarcastic references to children as \"rats\", or useless consumers of food, the expressions of \"aggressive pride\" on the part of paupers surviving on [[alms]], and curses which suppose \"imaginative power\" (\"may your mouth move into your ear\", \"may your copulation last only as long as it takes steam to leave the mouth\" etc.).<ref name=\"oc349\"/> Buiuma\u0219's vindictive mother \u021aipra is herself a source for these quasi-ritual gestures: when her daughter Blima crosses her, she decides to cut her away from the family, and refuses to ever again mention her son-in-law by name.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.795-796</ref> Buiuma\u0219 himself braves a similar treatment when he asks to be enlisted in a non-Jewish school. An old woman encourages \u021aipra to vehemently oppose his wish, suggesting that [[popular education]] is a vehicle for Christian [[proselytism]] and [[Jewish assimilation]]: \"tie [Buiuma\u0219] up, or else he'll grow up into a ne'er-do-well who will go as far to baptize himself, so as to become an officer.

According to Pericle Martinescu, these works \"revive\" the Romanian novella genre, reconnecting it with its sources and evidencing a storyteller of \"accomplished talent\".<ref name=\"pmdiscutii\"/> ''Luceaf\u0103rul mor\u021bii'' (\"Death's Evening Star\") shows the conflict between a beggar father and his prosperous son, in terms which evoke [[class conflict]].<ref name=\"oc350\"/> ''Paltoane \u0219i nimic altceva'' (\"Overcoats and Nothing Else\"), in which Crohm\u0103lniceanu identifies the influence of Soviet author [[Isaak Babel]], is set to the background of the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref name=\"oc350\"/> Another such prose work from the period focused on the communist-led [[Grivi\u021ba Strike of 1933]].<ref name=\"nmromane\"/> The short story ''Pane, d\u0103-mi fata!'' (\"Master, Give Me the Girl!\") was, together with [[Alexandru Sahia]]'s ''\u0218omaj f\u0103r\u0103 ras\u0103'' (\"Unemployment Regardless of Race\"), one of only two such pieces ever to be published by the pro-communist ''Era Nou\u0103'', which also recommended ''Copil\u0103ria unui netrebnic'', together with works by [[George Mihail Zamfirescu]] and [[Stoian Gh. Tudor]], as one of the positive examples in Romania's emerging [[Social Realism]].<ref>Crohm\u0103lniceanu, p.153-154</ref>\n\n===C\u0103lug\u0103ru and Socialist Realism===\nIon C\u0103lug\u0103ru's ultimate affiliation with Socialist Realism was widely interpreted as having produced the weakest section of his work. This critical interpretation was espoused even before the end of communism, during a period of [[liberalization]] and aesthetic reevaluation. In this context, Crohm\u0103lniceanu argued that C\u0103lug\u0103ru's late works \"no longer explore, to their disadvantage, [the] precious lode in Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru's literature.\"<ref name=\"oc350\"/> This is also noted by historian [[Lucian Boia]], who writes: \"To be a leftist used to signify nonconformity; now, quite contrarily, to be a leftist is to show conformism.\" Moreover, Boia writes, there was \"no longer anything specifically Jewish\" in C\u0103lug\u0103ru's attitudes.<ref name=\"lb295\"/>\n\nOther authors have retrospectively questioned C\u0103lug\u0103ru's overall value, taking in view his political status. According to historian and novelist [[Ioan L\u0103cust\u0103]], C\u0103lug\u0103ru owed his promotion \"not so much to his literary talent, but to the fact that he had rushed in, like many other intellectuals, writers, artists etc., to support and popularize the new regime's accomplishments.\"<ref name=\"iluzina\"/> Writing in 2006, Nicolae Manolescu opined: \"Nobody speaks today of Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru [...], who was considered a promise during the 1930s. [...] C\u0103lug\u0103ru's literature was overvalued after 1948 not least of all because of [his] communist sympathies\".<ref name=\"nmromane\"/> He dismissed ''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine'' as \"mere realist-socialist pulp\", and defined ''Copil\u0103ria...'' as C\u0103lug\u0103ru's \"one legible work\".<ref name=\"nmromane\"/> Henri Zalis commented on the mutation of C\u0103lug\u0103ru's \"playful\" spirit into \"diffuse [[proletkult]]\", and suggested that the writer may have thus been seduced by the idea of revenging his own persecution by wartime antisemites.<ref name=\"hzapropieri\"/> ''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine'', Zalis thought, was a \"rudimentary appendix to forceful [[industrialization]]\".<ref name=\"hzapropieri\"/>\n\nLiterary critic Iulia Popovici described the novel as propaganda to legitimize \"the socialist present\", also noting that it was the only such work in which the two dominant themes, \"constructing socialism in the village\" and \"constructing socialism in the city\", overlapped.<ref name=\"ipmanuale\">{{in lang|ro}} Iulia Popovici, [http://www.romlit.ro/literatura_contemporan_n_manualele_anilor_60-80 \"Literatura contemporan\u0103 \u00een manualele anilor '60-'80\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 26/2002</ref> Literary historian [[Ion Simu\u021b]] analyzed the various echoes of C\u0103lug\u0103ru's work in the communist media of his day, and concluded that these make him part of a \"second circle\" of writers accepted by the Socialist Realist establishment, on the same level of approval as [[Mihai Beniuc]], [[Geo Bogza]], [[Cezar Petrescu]] and [[Alexandru Toma]], but ranking below [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] or [[Camil Petrescu]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Ion Simu\u021b]], [http://www.romlit.ro/canonul_literar_proletcultist_ii \"Canonul literar proletcultist (II)\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 28/2008</ref> C\u0103lug\u0103ru himself sparked posthumous controversy for participating in communist-orchestrated attacks on the work and reputation of authors without ideological credentials. In one such situation, he argued that [[Liviu Rebreanu]] \"was no genius, and his books are far from reaching the value of those by [Soviet author] [[Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov|Mikhail Sholokhov]]\"\u2014a claim retrospectively described by [[Al. S\u0103ndulescu]] as \"an enormity\" in terms of \"servility and philosovietism\".<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Al.

In the late 1940s, the writer kept a private diary, which documents his trips to [[Hunedoara]] and shows his skepticism about some aspects of communist politics. Documenting the dire social conditions of this time, C\u0103lug\u0103ru's text includes detail on such aspects as the conspiratorial infiltration of [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic]] opposition centers by PCR operatives, the party's close surveillance of factory workers, and C\u0103lug\u0103ru's own questions about \"labels\" such as the regime's self-designation as a \"[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]\" or about the [[show trial]]s of \"saboteurs\".<ref name=\"iluzina\"/> The author also confesses his dislike for hypocrisy in official discourse and the press, commenting on the \"girlish sincerity\" of dispatches from the Soviet Union, the PCR's tiny membership in 1944, on the \"voluntary work\" demanded by communist leaders and its transformation into a \"''[[corv\u00e9e]]''\", and on intellectuals \"who say something other than what they think.\"<ref name=\"iluzina\"/> Later notes further record the decline of his enthusiasm. Expressing fears that he was being tricked by more senior communists, C\u0103lug\u0103ru accused his ''[[Sc\u00eenteia]]'' colleagues ([[Silviu Brucan]], [[Traian \u0218elmaru]], [[Sorin Toma]]) of not publishing his contributions so that they could later attack him for a displaying lack of motivation.<ref name=\"asistoric\"/> The jaded author came to express a private wish of blocking out the world of politics and dedicating his entire energy to the creative process.<ref name=\"asistoric\"/>\n\nIn 1952, C\u0103lug\u0103ru's name was cited by official novelist and critic [[Petru Dumitriu]] among those of first-generation Socialist Realists who had not shown themselves to be productive enough, and who had isolated themselves from the proletariat.<ref>Selejan, p.35-38</ref> Before that time, ''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine'' was being recommended as a major accomplishment of the new literary school, in articles by Socialist Realist critics such as [[Sami Damian]] or [[Mihai Novicov]].<ref>Selejan, p.59, 133</ref> Late in 1951, Dumitriu himself had publicly pledged to follow up on C\u0103lug\u0103ru's example and write the second-ever Romanian book to deal \"with the basic sector in our economy, heavy industry.\"<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Alex. \u0218tef\u0103nescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/literatur_scris_la_comand \"Literatur\u0103 scris\u0103 la comand\u0103\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 27/2005</ref> In 1953, as the Romanian literary scene reoriented itself in accordance with the guidelines suggested by Soviet politico [[Georgy Malenkov]], the same book was officially criticized, on the behalf of the [[Romanian Writers' Union]], by author [[Eugen Frunz\u0103]]. Frunz\u0103's official report, formed around Malenkov's theories about literary types and naturalness in Socialist Realist literature, argued: \"The reader of Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru's book ''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine'' was for sure able to note that the author is able to individualize certain negative characters. In contrast, the reader will encounter in the same book some six [[Central Committee]] activists, who are nothing other than diagrams, not in any way distinguished one from the other\".<ref>Selejan, p.153</ref> Similar criticism had been voiced a year earlier by communist politician and literary chronicler [[George Macovescu]], in reference to C\u0103lug\u0103ru's contributions in the [[reportage]] genre, particularly his initial piece on the [[Siderurgica Hunedoara|Hunedoara Steel Foundry]]. In Macovescu's opinion, the text \"is not a reportage, but an article not yet woven, or a fragment from a report not so well researched.\"<ref>Selejan, p.333</ref>\n\n===''Casa \u0219oarecilor''===\nThe ''Casa \u0219oarecilor'' pieces, which are the last stories ever published under Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru's name, do not comply with the Socialist Realist canon. The volume's first section, titled ''Schi\u021be f\u0103r\u0103 umor'' (\"Humorless Sketches\"), comprise literary portraits and musings. Critic Simona Vasilache notes that such fragments revolve around the author's subjective perception of the world: \"Not all the phrases make sense, not all the scenes have depth, that being because C\u0103lug\u0103ru's search is not one for clarity but, quite the contrary, for the vapor. The sensation of memory, more precious than the reasoned test of memory.\"<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> The volume, she notes, comprises elements from all the stages in C\u0103lug\u0103ru's early career, from \"the [[Lyricism|lyrical]] exercises of youth\" to \"lively dialogues, written with good craftsmanship\".<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> The stories mark a return to C\u0103lug\u0103ru's preoccupation with rural and suburban life. They introduce characters who live meager existence on the margin of society, such as the [[Tatars of Romania|Tatar]] Mahmud, hanged on cherry tree, and the philosophical Jewish salesman \u0218melche.<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> One piece, believed by Vasilache to echo the sketches of Romania's 19th century classic [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], shows a female shopkeeper on the night of her husband's death, struggling between closing the establishment to mark his death or keeping it open to pay for his funeral.<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> Other fragments resurrect Buiuma\u0219 and some other protagonists of ''Copil\u0103ria...''. The eponymous story begins with the boy and his mother inquiring about a possible inheritance from a relative in Japan, and culminates in describing the hypnotic effect of mice swarming around the local post office.<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> One other short narrative shows Buiuma\u0219 lecturing his playmates about justice and sin, described by Vasilache as a strange outcome: \"A child would have found any other means. That is why the sketches' endings are puzzling, depicting, with stinginess in words and even more stinginess in deeds, a world that is no longer itself.\"<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/>\n\nThe second half of ''Casa \u0219oarecilor'' comprises novellas such as ''Sfin\u021benia lui Veniamin Jidovul'' (\"The Holiness of Veniamin the Jew\")\u2014described by Vasilache as \"a ''[[Vanitas|vanitas vanitatum]]'' just as hasty, just as cruel as is the world of [''Schi\u021be f\u0103r\u0103 umor''], with barbaric shindigs, indifferent to death, living through the pointless momentary torments.\"<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> These stories rely heavily on documenting the person's imaginary universe, as is the case with ''Firi ne\u00een\u021belese'' (\"Misunderstood Characters\") and ''Conflictul meu cu Portugalia'' (\"My Conflict with Portugal\").<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/> Vasilache notes: \"These are merely projected ideas, grouped together by a not so tightly knit web of a narrative. [...] Random matches, over which blows an avant-garde wind.\"<ref name=\"svpoezii\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nIon C\u0103lug\u0103ru's Socialist Realist work, like other writings by his peers, fell out of favor in the 1970s and '80s: [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s [[National communism|national communist]] leadership entirely discarded earlier expressions of socialist literature, and removed most of them from the [[Education in Romania|national curriculum]].<ref name=\"ipmanuale\"/> C\u0103lug\u0103ru's books of the 1950s were reevaluated critically especially following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], with which came the end of Romania's communist period. The 1995 ''Dic\u021bionarul scriitorilor rom\u00e2ni'' (\"Romanian Writers' Dictionary\"), edited by [[Mircea Zaciu]], [[Marian Papahagi]] and [[Aurel Sasu]], noted: \"[Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru] had engaged himself, with short-term profits, but failure in the long run, into an intervention against nature and [...] against the nature of art, but also against his own nature: abruptly moving from eroticism to heroism, he was not recommended for such an enterprise by either his native temperament, his collected life experience, and his artistic means. Together with the other relics of proletkult, ''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine'' is presently interesting at most as a symptomatic study case for an as yet virtual sociology of literature.\"<ref name=\"iluzina\"/> L\u0103cust\u0103 also noted: \"After four and a half decades, [''O\u021bel \u0219i p\u00eeine''] can perhaps only be read as a literary document of its epoch.\"<ref name=\"iluzina\"/> In contrast, others have defended the interwar C\u0103lug\u0103ru as a writer of talent. This is the case of Simu\u021b, who notes that C\u0103lug\u0103ru, like his Jewish cogenerationists [[Ury Benador]] and [[I. Peretz]], is one of the \"interesting\" details \"worthy of an honest literary history.\"<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Ion Simu\u021b]], [http://www.romlit.ro/gelozia_maladiv \"Gelozia maladiv\u0103\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 43/2005</ref> Henri Zalis, who took charge of a project to reedit C\u0103lug\u0103ru's early writings as part of a larger project involving interwar Jewish contributions, complained in 2004 that there was a real danger that writers from C\u0103lug\u0103ru to [[Felix Aderca]], [[Sergiu Dan]] and [[Alexandru Jar]] would be forgotten by the public, \"pulverized\" by literary historians, their work \"degraded by antisemitic hawking\".<ref name=\"hzapropieri\"/>\n\nDuring the Ceau\u0219escu years, C\u0103lug\u0103ru's rival Dumitriu also parted with Socialist Realism and began writing more unconventional stories. Literary historian [[Ion Vartic]], who proposes that Dumitriu built his new career on [[plagiarism]], notes that many of his short stories and novels incorporated real-life stories told by his elder Ion Vinea. Vartic concludes that one such short piece, published by Dumitriu under the title ''Cafin\u00e9'', is an \"erotic farce\" played on Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru at some point during the interwar period.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Ion Vartic]], [http://www.romlit.ro/petru_dumitriu_i_negrul_su_ii \"Petru Dumitriu \u0219i 'negrul' s\u0103u (II)\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 16/2005</ref>\n\nMentions of C\u0103lug\u0103ru's life are also present in [[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''Autobiography'', written during Eliade's self-exile and teaching career at the [[University of Chicago]]. Eliade notably describes his meeting with the ''Cuv\u00e2ntul'' journalist, recalling his surprise that C\u0103lug\u0103ru's everyday vocabulary seemed to be quoting avant-garde stories by [[Urmuz]] or [[Sa\u0219a Pan\u0103]].<ref name=\"ippudriera\"/> Recalling her 1971 meeting with Eliade on American soil, Romanian poet [[Constan\u021ba Buzea]] wrote: \"[Eliade] asks if Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru has an echo among us, today.

The main activity of the Office was to release newsreels about the [[World War II]].

A second film, \"The white squadron\" (Squadriglia bianca), directed by Romanian director [[Ion Sava]] was released in 1944.

Due to the war, the film could be completed only in 1945.

He was arrested for a short time. After his release, he reverted to his second profession and worked for the rest of his life as a psychiatrist at the \"Br\u00e2ncovenesc Hospital\" in Bucharest.\n\nHowever, he did not give up his activities related to the entertainment industry. He translatated various plays for theatrical performances such as [[Eduardo De Filippo]]'s [[Filumena Marturano]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s [[Heartbreak House]].<ref>[http://archweb.cimec.ro/SCRIPTS/TeatreNou/detaliu_premiera.asp?sq=410601116202&sq1=7&sq2=Teatrul%20de%20Comedie%20Bucure%C4%B9%20ti&sq3=410601 cIMeC \u2013 Institutul de Memorie Cultural\u0103 Bucure\u015fti]</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, without abandoning his profession as psychiatrist, Ion Cantacuzino was able to publish again.

{"title_page": "Yield management", "text_new": "'''Yield management''' is a [[variable pricing]] strategy, based on understanding, anticipating and influencing [[consumer]] [[behavior]] in order to maximize [[revenue]] or [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from a fixed, time-limited resource (such as [[airline seat]]s or hotel room reservations or advertising inventory).<ref name =\"Netessine&Shumsky\">Netessine, S. and R.

Yield management is a large revenue generator for several major industries; [[Robert Crandall]], former Chairman and CEO of [[American Airlines]], gave yield management its name and has called it \"the single most important technical development in transportation management since we entered deregulation.\"<ref name=\"Cross\">Cross, R. (1997) Revenue Management: Hard-Core Tactics for Market Domination. New York, NY: Broadway Books.</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nYield management has become part of mainstream business theory and practice over the last fifteen to twenty years. Whether an emerging discipline or a new management science (it has been called both), yield management is a set of yield maximization strategies and tactics to improve the profitability of certain businesses. It is complex because it involves several aspects of management control, including rate management, revenue streams management, and distribution channel management. Yield management is multidisciplinary because it blends elements of marketing, operations, and financial management into a highly successful new approach. Yield management strategists must frequently work with one or more other departments when designing and implementing yield management strategies.<ref>Revenue Management. Maximizing Revenue in Hospitality Operations. Dr. Gabor Forgacs, 2010. Pg. 3. Published by the Americans Hotel and Lodging Educational Institute, [http://www.ahlei.org], {{ISBN|978-0-86612-348-8}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Deregulation]] is generally regarded as the catalyst for yield management in the airline industry, but this tends to overlook the role of [[Global Distribution System]]s (GDs). It is arguable that the fixed pricing paradigm occurs as a result of decentralized consumption. With [[mass production]], pricing became a centralized management activity and customer contact staff focused on [[customer service]] exclusively. [[Electronic commerce]], of which the GDS were the first wave, created an environment where large volumes of sales could be managed without large numbers of customer service staff. They also gave management staff direct access to price at time of consumption and rich data capture for future decision-making.\n\nOn January 17, 1985, [[American Airlines]] launched Ultimate Super Saver fares in an effort to compete with [[low cost carrier]] [[People Express Airlines]]. Donald Burr, the CEO of People Express, is quoted as saying \"We were a vibrant, profitable company from 1981 to 1985, and then we tipped right over into losing $50 million a month... We had been profitable from the day we started until American came at us with Ultimate Super Savers.\" in the book ''Revenue Management'' by Robert G. Cross, Chairman and CEO of [[Revenue Analytics]].  The yield management systems developed at American Airlines were recognized by the Edelman Prize committee of [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|INFORMS]] for contributing $1.4 billion in a three-year period at the airline.\n\nYield management spread to other travel and transportation companies in the early 1990's. Notable was implementation of yield management at National Car Rental. In 1993, [[General Motors]] was forced to take a $744 million charge against earnings related to its ownership of [[National Car Rental]]. In response, National's program expanded the definition of yield management to include [[capacity management]], pricing and reservations control. As a result of this program, General Motors was able to sell National Car Rental for an estimated $1.2 billion. Yield management gave way to the more general practice of revenue management. Whereas revenue management involves predicting consumer behavior by segmenting markets, forecasting demand, and optimizing prices for several different types of products, yield management refers specifically to maximizing revenue through inventory control.<ref name=\"Cross\"/> Some notable revenue management implementations include the [[NBC]] which credits its system with $200 million in improved ad sales from 1996 to 2000, the target pricing initiative at [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], and revenue management at Texas Children's Hospital. Since 2000, much of the dynamic pricing, promotions management and [[dynamic packaging]] that underlie e commerce sites leverage revenue management techniques. In 2002 GMAC launched an early implementation of web based revenue management in the financial services industry.\n\nThere have also been high-profile failures and faux pas. [[Amazon.com]] was criticized for irrational price changes that resulted from a revenue management [[software bug]]. [[The Coca-Cola Company]]'s plans for a dynamic pricing [[vending machine]] were put on hold as a result of negative consumer reactions. Revenue management is also blamed for much of the financial difficulty currently experienced by [[legacy carriers]]. The reliance of the major carriers on high fares in captive markets arguably created the conditions for low-cost carriers to thrive.\n\n==Use by industry==\nThere are three essential conditions for yield management to be applicable:\n* That there is a fixed amount of resources available for sale.\n* That the resources sold are perishable (there is a time limit to selling the resources, after which they cease to be of value).\n* That different customers are willing to pay a different price for using the same amount of resources.\nIf the resources available are not fixed or not perishable, the problem is limited to logistics, i.e. inventory or production management. If all customers would pay the same price for using the same amount of resources, the challenge would perhaps be limited to selling as quickly as possible, e.g. if there are costs for holding inventory.\n\nYield management is of especially high relevance in cases where the constant costs are relatively high compared to the [[variable cost]]s. The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and [[planning horizon]]. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected [[Net profit|net revenue]] contribution and extracting the greatest level of \u2018willingness to pay\u2019 from the entire [[customer base]]. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.\n\nYield management has significantly altered the travel and [[hospitality industry]] since its inception in the mid-1980's. It requires analysts with detailed market knowledge and advanced computing systems who implement sophisticated mathematical techniques to analyze market behavior and capture revenue opportunities. It has evolved from the system airlines invented as a response to deregulation and quickly spread to hotels, [[car rental]] firms, [[cruise line]]s, media, telecommunications and energy to name a few. Its effectiveness in generating incremental revenues from an existing operation and customer base has made it particularly attractive to business leaders that prefer to generate return from revenue growth and enhanced capability rather than downsizing and cost cutting.\n\n===Airlines===\nIn the passenger [[airline]] case, capacity is regarded as fixed because changing what aircraft flies a certain service based on the demand is the exception rather than the rule. When the aircraft departs, the unsold seats cannot generate any revenue and thus can be said to have perished, or have spoiled. Airlines use specialized software to monitor how seats are reserved and react accordingly. There are various inventory controls such as a nested inventory system. For example, airlines can offer discounts on low-demand flights, where the flight will likely not sell out. When there is excess demand, the seats can be sold at a higher price.\n\nAnother way of capturing varying willingness to pay is [[market segmentation]]. A firm may repackage its basic inventory into different products to this end. In the passenger airline case this means implementing purchase restrictions, [[length of stay]] requirements and requiring fees for changing or canceling tickets.\n\nThe airline needs to keep a specific number of seats in reserve to cater to the probable demand for high-fare seats. This process can be managed by inventory controls or by managing the fare rules such as the AP (Advanced Purchase){{clarify|date=October 2016}} restrictions. (30 day advance purchase, 21 day advance purchase, 14 day advance purchase, 7 day advance purchase, day of departure/walk up fares){{clarify|date=October 2016}} The price of each seat varies directly with the number of seats reserved, that is, the fewer seats that are reserved for a particular category, the lower the price of each seat. This will continue until the price of seat in the premium class equals that of those in the concession class. Depending on this, a floor price (lower price) for the next seat to be sold is set.\n\n===Hotels===\nHotels use this system in largely the same way, to calculate the rates.\n\n===Rental===\nIn the rental car industry, yield management deals with the sale of optional insurance, damage waivers and vehicle upgrades. It accounts for a major portion of the rental company's profitability, and is monitored on a daily basis. In the equipment rental industry, yield management is a method to manage rental rates against capacity (available fleet) and demand.<ref>Peterson, Lucy (September 2005).  [http://www.khl-group.com/news/printarticle.asp?articleid=2441 Yield Management: International Rental]</ref>\n\n===Intercity buses===\nYield management has moved into the bus industry with companies such as [[Megabus (United Kingdom)]], [[Megabus (North America)]], [[BoltBus]], and [[easyBus]], which run low-cost networks in the United Kingdom and parts of the United States, and more recently, [[nakedbus.com]] and [[Intercape]], which have networks in New Zealand and South Africa. Now operating and developed in Chile by [[SARCAN]], a Chilean company that provides revenue and yield management systems focused on this industry, with the company [[Turbus]] as principal customer. Finnish low-cost inter-city bus service [[OnniBus]], as well as Polish [[PolskiBus]], bases its revenue flow on yield management.\n\n===Multifamily housing===\nIn the [[multi-family residential]] industry, yield optimization is focused on producing [[supply and demand]] forecasts to determine rent recommendations for profit optimization. However, the use of the yield optimization systems is fairly new to the industry in the late 1990s, with Archstone Smith pioneering its use.<ref>\n{{Cite news\n | first = Joe\n | last = Bousquin\n | title = Revenue Revolution: Pushing Rents Becomes the Norm\n | url = http://www.multifamilyexecutive.com/industry-news.asp?sectionID=550&articleID=656952&refresh=true\n | work = [[Multifamily Executive Magazine]]\n | date = 2008-02-01\n }}\n</ref> The multifamily industry currently has two providers of yield management systems, the LRO (Lease Rent Options) Revenue Management System from Rainmaker, and the YieldStar Asset Optimization System from RealPage. There are new providers that have entered the market and provide extended capabilities in a much more simplified workflow.

The method is widely used by property & casualty insurers and brokers in the UK, Spain and, to a lesser extent, in the US. Several vendors, such as [[Earnix]], EMB, ODG, provide specialized pricing optimization software for the industry.\n\n===Telecommunications===\nOn average, [[Communications service provider]]s utilize an average of just 35 to 40 percent of available network capacity.<ref name=\"Kaul 2009 17\u201319\">{{Citation\n  | last = Kaul\n  | first = Sanjay\n  | title = Yield Management: Getting More Out Of What You Already Have\n  | journal = Ericsson Business Review\n  | volume = No. 2\n  | pages = 17\u201319\n  | year = 2009 }}</ref> Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as [[Telcordia]]<ref>\n{{Citation\n  | last = Smyck\n  | first = Darek\n  | author-link =\n  | title = Applying Yield Management in the Mobile Broadband Market\n  | year = 2011\n  | url = http://www.telcordia.com/collateral/innovation-insight/telecom-yield-management.pdf }}\n</ref> and [[Ericsson]]<ref name=\"Kaul 2009 17\u201319\"/> have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications service providers to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth.<ref>[http://www.telcordia.com/collateral/innovation-insight/telecom-yield-management.pdf Applying Yield Management in the Mobile Broadband Market]</ref> Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last = Humair\n |first = Salal\n |title = Yield management for telecommunication networks : defining a new landscape\n |publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n |year = 2001\n |hdl = 1721.1/8787\n }}</ref> The approach can be more difficult to implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last = Jallat\n |first = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\n |last2 = Ancarani\n |first2 = Fabio\n |title = Yield management, dynamic pricing and CRM in telecommunications\n |journal = Journal of Services Marketing\n |volume = 22\n |issue = 6\n |pages = 465\u2013478\n |year = 2008\n |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1747102&show=pdf\n |issn = 0887-6045\n |doi = 10.1108/08876040810901882}}\n</ref> Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell.<ref name=\"Smyck 2011\">{{Citation\n |last = Smyck\n |first = Darek\n |author-link =\n |title = Applying Yield Management in the Mobile Broadband Market\n |year = 2011\n |url = http://www.telcordia.com/collateral/innovation-insight/telecom-yield-management.pdf\n}}</ref> Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn\u2019t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as [[real time policy]] and [[real-time charging]], and using new marketing channels to target consumers <ref name=\"Kaul 2009 17\u201319\"/><ref name=\"Smyck 2011\"/> with innovative services.\n\n===Online advertising===\nYield management in online ad sales is in essence the same as in other industries above mentioned; managing the publishers supply/inventory (banner impressions) with the market demand, at the best price (CPM/RPM) while assuring highest possible fill rates.\n\n===Railways===\nWhile railways traditionally sold fully flexible tickets that were valid on all trains on a given day or even trains on several days, deregulation and (partial) privatization introduced yield management in the United Kingdom as well as for high speed services in Germany or France. Tickets for the same route can be as cheap as \u20ac19 but also go into the triple digits depending on departure time, demand, and the time the ticket is booked.\n\n===Skiing===\nYield Management has shown increasing popularity in the ski industry, especially in the North American markets. This ranges from non-physical rate fences<ref>{{cite web|last1=Revenue Management in Action|title=Revenue Management at Ski Resorts\n|url=http://blogs.cornell.edu/advancedrevenuemanagement12/2012/03/28/revenue-management-at-ski-resorts/|publisher=Cornell}}</ref>, including age and validity differentiation to fully dynamic prices. Determinants of such variable prices include date-specific expected demand factors (institutional and public holidays, weekends, weather, size and accessibility of the resort, etc.)\n\n===Pet Boarding===\nWith predictable demand far outnumbering fixed supply in the professional pet boarding industry, Yield Management has become an ever-popular practice for this segment of businesses.  Much like the hotel industry, these systems help gauge which restrictions to implement, e.g. length of stay, non-refundable rate, or close to arrival, while also ensuring they are selling rooms and services at the right price, to the right person, at the right time.\n\n==Econometrics==\nYield management and [[econometrics]] center on detailed forecasting and [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical optimization]] of marginal revenue opportunities. The opportunities arise from segmentation of consumer willingness to pay. If the market for a particular good follows the simple straight line Price/Demand relationship illustrated below, a single [[fixed price]] of $50 there is enough demand to sell 50 units of inventory. This results in $2500 in revenues. However the same Price/Demand relationship yields $4000 if consumers are presented with multiple prices.\n\nIn practice, the segmentation approach relies on adequate fences between consumers so that everyone doesn't buy at the lowest price offered. The airlines use time of purchase to create this segmentation, with later booking customers paying the higher fares. The [[Fashion|fashion industry]] uses time in the opposite direction, discounting later in the selling season once the item is out of fashion or inappropriate for the time of year. Other approaches to fences involve attributes that create substantial value to the consumer at little or no cost to the seller. A [[backstage pass]] at a concert is a good example of this. Initially yield management avoided the complexity caused by the interaction of absolute price and price position by using surrogates for price such as booking class. By the mid-1990s, most implementation incorporated some measures of [[elasticity (economics)|price elasticity]]. The airlines were exceptional in this case, preferring to focus on more detailed segmentation by implementing O&D (Origin & Destination) systems.\n\nAt the heart of yield management decision-making process is the [[trade-off]] of marginal yields from segments that are competing for the same inventory. In capacity-constrained cases, there is a bird-in-the-hand decision that forces the seller to reject lower revenue generating customers in the hopes that the inventory can be sold in a higher valued segment. The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the marginal revenue curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for [[inventory control]] decisions. In these cases the intersection of the [[marginal revenue]] curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the lower segment is the point of interest.\n\nIn the case illustrated here, a car rental company must set up protection levels for its higher valued segments. By estimating where the marginal revenue curve of the luxury segment crosses the actual rental value of the midsize car segment the company can decide how many [[Luxury vehicles|luxury cars]] to make available to midsize car renters. Where the [[Vertical bar|vertical line]] from this intersection point crosses the demand (horizontal) axis determines how many luxury cars should be protected for genuine luxury car renters. The need to calculate protection levels has led to a number of heuristic solutions, most notable EMSRa and EMSRb, which stands for [[Expected Marginal Seat Revenue]] version a and b respectively. The balancing [[point of interest]] is found using [[Littlewood's rule]] which states that demand for <math>R_2</math> should be accepted as long as\n\n<math>R</math><sub>2</sub> <math>\\ge R</math><sub>1</sub><math> * Prob( D</math><sub>1</sub><math>>x ) </math>\n\nwhere<br />\n<math>R_2</math> is the value of the lower valued segment<br />\n<math>R_1</math> is the value of the higher valued segment<br />\n<math>D_1</math> is the demand for the higher valued segment and<br />\n<math>x</math> is the capacity left\n\nThis equation is re-arranged to compute protection levels as follows:\n\n<math>y</math><sub>1</sub><math> = Prob</math><sup>\u22121</sup><math>( R</math><sub>2</sub><math>/R</math><sub>1</sub><math> )</math>\n\nIn words, you want to protect <math>y</math><sub>1</sub> units of inventory for the higher valued segment where <math>y</math><sub>1</sub> is equal to the [[inverse probability]] of demand of the revenue ratio of the lower valued segment to the higher valued segment. This equation defines the EMSRa algorithm which handles the two segment case. EMSRb is smarter and handles multiple segments by comparing the revenue of the lower segment to a demand [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] of the revenues of the higher segments. Neither of these heuristics produces the exact right answer and increasingly implementations make use of [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] to find optimal protection levels.\n\nSince the mid-1990's increasingly sophisticated [[mathematical models]] have been developed such as the [[dynamic programming]] formulation pioneered by Talluri and Van Ryzin<ref>Talluri, K. T. and G. J. Van Ryzin (2001). \"Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior.\" Management science</ref> which has led to more accurate estimates of bid prices. Bid prices represent the minimum price a seller should accept for a single piece of inventory and are popular [[Control system|control mechanisms]] for Hotels and Car Rental firms. Models derived from developments in [[financial engineering]] are intriguing but have been unstable and difficult to place the parameters in practice. Yield management tends to focus on environments that are less rational than the [[financial markets]].\n\n==Yield management system==\n[[corporation|Firms]] that engage in yield management usually use [[computer]] yield management systems to do so. The [[Internet]] has greatly facilitated this process.\n\nEnterprises that use yield management periodically review transactions for [[good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] already supplied and for goods or services to be supplied in the future. They may also review information (including statistics) about events (known future events such as holidays, or unexpected past events such as [[List of terrorist incidents|terrorist attacks]]), competitive information (including prices), seasonal patterns, and other pertinent factors that affect sales. The [[model (abstract)|models]] attempt to forecast total demand for all products/services they provide, by market segment and [[price point]]. Since total demand normally exceeds what the particular firm can produce in that period, the [[model (abstract)|models]] attempt to optimize the firm's outputs to maximize revenue.\n\nThe optimization attempts to answer the question: \"Given our operating constraints, what is the best mix of products and/or services for us to produce and sell in the period, and at what prices, to generate the highest expected revenue?\"\n\nOptimization can help the firm adjust prices and to allocate capacity among market segments to maximize expected revenues. This can be done at different levels of detail:\n* by goods (such as a seat on a flight or a seat at an opera production)\n* by group of goods (such as the entire [[opera house]] or all the seats on a flight)\n* by market (such as sales from Seattle and Minneapolis for a flight going Seattle-Minneapolis-Boston)\n* overall (on all the routes an airline flies, or all the seats during an opera production season)\n\nYield management is particularly suitable when selling perishable products, i.e. goods that become unsellable at a point in time (for example air tickets just after a flight takes off). Industries that use yield management include airlines, hotels, stadiums and other venues with a fixed number of seats, and advertising. With an advance forecast of demand and pricing flexibility, buyers will self-sort based on their price sensitivity (using more power in off-peak hours or going to the theater mid-week), their demand sensitivity (must have the higher cost early morning flight or must go to the Saturday night opera) or their time of purchase (usually paying a premium for booking late).\n\nIn this way, yield management's overall aim is to provide an optimal mix of goods at a variety of price points at different points in time or for different baskets of features. The system will try to maintain a [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of purchases over time that is balanced as well as high.\n\nGood yield management maximizes (or at least significantly increases) revenue production for the same number of units, by taking advantage of the forecast of high demand/low demand periods, effectively shifting demand from high demand periods to low demand periods and by charging a premium for late bookings. While yield management systems tend to generate higher revenues, the revenue streams tends to arrive later in the booking horizon as more capacity is held for late sale at premium prices.\n\nFirms faced with lack of [[pricing power]] sometimes turn to yield management as a last resort. After a year or two using yield management, many of them are surprised to discover they have actually lowered prices for the majority of their opera seats or hotel rooms or other products. That is, they offer far higher discounts more frequently for off-peak times, while raising prices only marginally for peak times, resulting in higher revenue overall.\n\nBy doing this, they have actually increased quantity demanded by selectively introducing many more price points, as they learn about and react to the diversity of interests and purchase drivers of their customers.\n\n==Ethical issues and questions of efficacy==\n{{Weasel|date=December 2011}}\nSome consumers are concerned{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} that yield management could penalize them for conditions which cannot be helped and are unethical to penalize. For example, the formulas, algorithms, and [[neural network]]s that determine [[airline ticket]] prices could feasibly consider frequent flyer information, which includes a wealth of [[socioeconomics|socio-economic]] information such as age and home address. The airline then could charge higher prices to consumers who are between certain ages or who live in neighborhoods with higher average wealth, even if those neighborhoods also include poor households. Very few (if any) airlines using yield management are able{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} to employ this level of price discrimination because prices are not set based on characteristics of the purchaser, which are in any case often not known at the time of purchase.\n\nSome consumers may object that it is impossible for them to boycott yield management when buying some goods, such as airline tickets.\n\nYield Management also includes many noncontroversial and more prevalent practices, such as varying prices over time to reflect demand. This level of yield management makes up the majority of yield management in the airline industry. For example, airlines may price a ticket on the Sunday after Thanksgiving at a higher fare than the Sunday a week later. Alternatively, they may make tickets more expensive when bought at the last minute than when bought six months in advance. The goal of this level of yield management is essentially trying to force demand to equal or exceed supply. (SUNY Canton professors choose to teach classes through Wikipedia, nothing against Wikipedia but do your job and teach yourself.)\n\nWhen yield management was introduced in the early 1990's, primarily in the airline industry, many suggested that despite the obvious immediate increase in revenues, it might harm [[customer satisfaction]] and loyalty, interfere with [[relationship marketing]], and drive customers from firms that used yield management to firms that do not. [[Frequent flier]] programs were developed as a response to regain [[Loyalty business model|customer loyalty]] and reward frequent and [[High-yield debt|high yield]] passengers. Today, yield management is nearly universal in many industries, including airlines.\n\nDespite optimizing revenue in theory, introduction of yield management does not always achieve this in practice because of [[corporate image]] problems. In 2002, [[Deutsche Bahn]], the [[Germany|German]] [[National Railway|national railway]] company, experimented with yield management for frequent [[BahnCard|loyalty card]] passengers.<ref name=link>\n{{cite journal\n | first = Heike\n | last = Link\n | title = PEP-A Yield-Management Scheme for Rail Passenger Fares in Germany\n | journal = Japan Railway & Transport Review\n | volume = 38\n |date=March 2004\n\n | pages = 54\n}}\n</ref> The fixed pricing model that had existed for decades was replaced with a more demand-responsive pricing model, but this reform proved highly unpopular with passengers, leading to widespread protests and a decline in passenger numbers.<ref>\n{{cite news\n | first = Klaus-Peter\n | last = Schmid\n | title = Kein sch\u00f6ner Zug\n | url = http://www.zeit.de/2003/22/Kolumne\n | work = [[Die Zeit]]\n | date = 2003-05-22\n | language = German\n }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n | first = Volker\n | last = Franz\n | title = Die Bahnpreisreform: Ein kundenfreundlicher Gegenvorschlag\n | url = http://www.zeit.de/leben/bahn/bahn_sj_19\n | work = [[Die Zeit]]\n | date = 2002-11-01\n | language = German\n }}\n</ref>\n\n==Experimental studies of yield management decisions==\nRecently, people working in the area of [[behavioral operations research]] have begun to study the yield management decisions of actual human decision makers. One question that this research addresses is how much might revenues increase if managers relied on yield management systems rather than their own judgment when making pricing decisions. Using methods from [[experimental economics]], this work has revealed that yield management systems are likely to increase revenues significantly. Further, this research reveals that \"errors\" in yield management decisions tend to be quite systematic. For instance, Bearden, Murphy, and Rappaport showed that with respect to expected revenue maximizing policies, people tend to price too high when they have high levels of inventory and too low when their inventory levels are low.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Geo (marketing)]]\n* [[Variable pricing]]\n* [[Price discrimination]]\n* [[Algorithmic pricing]]\n* [[Last minute advertising]]\n* [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]]\n* [[Behavioral Operations Research]]\n* [[Revenue shortfall]]\n* [[Revenue management]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2008}}\n\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khakifirooz|first1=Marzieh|last2=Chien|first2=Chen Fu|last3=Chen|first3=Ying Jen|title=Bayesian inference for mining semiconductor manufacturing big data for yield enhancement and smart production to empower industry 4.0|journal=Applied Soft Computing|volume=68|pages=990\u2013999|date=2017|doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2017.11.034}}</ref>\n* Mauri, Aurelio G.

Whether an emerging discipline or a new management science (it has been called both), yield management is a set of yield maximization strategies and tactics to improve the profitability of certain businesses. It is complex because it involves several aspects of management control, including rate management, revenue streams management, and distribution channel management. Yield management is multidisciplinary because it blends elements of marketing, operations, and financial management into a highly successful new approach. Yield management strategists must frequently work with one or more other departments when designing and implementing yield management strategies.<ref>Revenue Management. Maximizing Revenue in Hospitality Operations. Dr. Gabor Forgacs, 2010. Pg. 3. Published by the Americans Hotel and Lodging Educational Institute, [http://www.ahlei.org], {{ISBN|978-0-86612-348-8}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Deregulation]] is generally regarded as the catalyst for yield management in the airline industry, but this tends to overlook the role of [[Global Distribution System]]s (GDs). It is arguable that the fixed pricing paradigm occurs as a result of decentralized consumption. With [[mass production]], pricing became a centralized management activity and customer contact staff focused on [[customer service]] exclusively. [[Electronic commerce]], of which the GDS were the first wave, created an environment where large volumes of sales could be managed without large numbers of customer service staff. They also gave management staff direct access to price at time of consumption and rich data capture for future decision-making.\n\nOn January 17, 1985, [[American Airlines]] launched Ultimate Super Saver fares in an effort to compete with [[low cost carrier]] [[People Express Airlines]]. Donald Burr, the CEO of People Express, is quoted as saying \"We were a vibrant, profitable company from 1981 to 1985, and then we tipped right over into losing $50 million a month... We had been profitable from the day we started until American came at us with Ultimate Super Savers.\" in the book ''Revenue Management'' by Robert G. Cross, Chairman and CEO of [[Revenue Analytics]].  The yield management systems developed at American Airlines were recognized by the Edelman Prize committee of [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|INFORMS]] for contributing $1.4 billion in a three-year period at the airline.\n\nYield management spread to other travel and transportation companies in the early 1990's. Notable was implementation of yield management at National Car Rental. In 1993, [[General Motors]] was forced to take a $744 million charge against earnings related to its ownership of [[National Car Rental]]. In response, National's program expanded the definition of yield management to include [[capacity management]], pricing and reservations control. As a result of this program, General Motors was able to sell National Car Rental for an estimated $1.2 billion. Yield management gave way to the more general practice of revenue management. Whereas revenue management involves predicting consumer behavior by segmenting markets, forecasting demand, and optimizing prices for several different types of products, yield management refers specifically to maximizing revenue through inventory control.<ref name=\"Cross\"/> Some notable revenue management implementations include the [[NBC]] which credits its system with $200 million in improved ad sales from 1996 to 2000, the target pricing initiative at [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], and revenue management at Texas Children's Hospital. Since 2000, much of the dynamic pricing, promotions management and [[dynamic packaging]] that underlie e commerce sites leverage revenue management techniques. In 2002 GMAC launched an early implementation of web based revenue management in the financial services industry.\n\nThere have also been high-profile failures and faux pas. [[Amazon.com]] was criticized for irrational price changes that resulted from a revenue management [[software bug]]. [[The Coca-Cola Company]]'s plans for a dynamic pricing [[vending machine]] were put on hold as a result of negative consumer reactions. Revenue management is also blamed for much of the financial difficulty currently experienced by [[legacy carriers]]. The reliance of the major carriers on high fares in captive markets arguably created the conditions for low-cost carriers to thrive.\n\n==Use by industry==\nThere are three essential conditions for yield management to be applicable:\n* That there is a fixed amount of resources available for sale.\n* That the resources sold are perishable (there is a time limit to selling the resources, after which they cease to be of value).\n* That different customers are willing to pay a different price for using the same amount of resources.\nIf the resources available are not fixed or not perishable, the problem is limited to logistics, i.e. inventory or production management. If all customers would pay the same price for using the same amount of resources, the challenge would perhaps be limited to selling as quickly as possible, e.g. if there are costs for holding inventory.\n\nYield management is of especially high relevance in cases where the constant costs are relatively high compared to the [[variable cost]]s. The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and [[planning horizon]]. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected [[Net profit|net revenue]] contribution and extracting the greatest level of \u2018willingness to pay\u2019 from the entire [[customer base]]. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.\n\nYield management has significantly altered the travel and [[hospitality industry]] since its inception in the mid-1980's. It requires analysts with detailed market knowledge and advanced computing systems who implement sophisticated mathematical techniques to analyze market behavior and capture revenue opportunities. It has evolved from the system airlines invented as a response to deregulation and quickly spread to hotels, [[car rental]] firms, [[cruise line]]s, media, telecommunications and energy to name a few. Its effectiveness in generating incremental revenues from an existing operation and customer base has made it particularly attractive to business leaders that prefer to generate return from revenue growth and enhanced capability rather than downsizing and cost cutting.\n\n===Airlines===\nIn the passenger [[airline]] case, capacity is regarded as fixed because changing what aircraft flies a certain service based on the demand is the exception rather than the rule. When the aircraft departs, the unsold seats cannot generate any revenue and thus can be said to have perished, or have spoiled. Airlines use specialized software to monitor how seats are reserved and react accordingly. There are various inventory controls such as a nested inventory system. For example, airlines can offer discounts on low-demand flights, where the flight will likely not sell out. When there is excess demand, the seats can be sold at a higher price.\n\nAnother way of capturing varying willingness to pay is [[market segmentation]]. A firm may repackage its basic inventory into different products to this end. In the passenger airline case this means implementing purchase restrictions, [[length of stay]] requirements and requiring fees for changing or canceling tickets.\n\nThe airline needs to keep a specific number of seats in reserve to cater to the probable demand for high-fare seats. This process can be managed by inventory controls or by managing the fare rules such as the AP (Advanced Purchase){{clarify|date=October 2016}} restrictions. (30 day advance purchase, 21 day advance purchase, 14 day advance purchase, 7 day advance purchase, day of departure/walk up fares){{clarify|date=October 2016}} The price of each seat varies directly with the number of seats reserved, that is, the fewer seats that are reserved for a particular category, the lower the price of each seat. This will continue until the price of seat in the premium class equals that of those in the concession class. Depending on this, a floor price (lower price) for the next seat to be sold is set.\n\n===Hotels===\nHotels use this system in largely the same way, to calculate the rates.\n\n===Rental===\nIn the rental car industry, yield management deals with the sale of optional insurance, damage waivers and vehicle upgrades. It accounts for a major portion of the rental company's profitability, and is monitored on a daily basis. In the equipment rental industry, yield management is a method to manage rental rates against capacity (available fleet) and demand.<ref>Peterson, Lucy (September 2005).  [http://www.khl-group.com/news/printarticle.asp?articleid=2441 Yield Management: International Rental]</ref>\n\n===Intercity buses===\nYield management has moved into the bus industry with companies such as [[Megabus (United Kingdom)]], [[Megabus (North America)]], [[BoltBus]], and [[easyBus]], which run low-cost networks in the United Kingdom and parts of the United States, and more recently, [[nakedbus.com]] and [[Intercape]], which have networks in New Zealand and South Africa. Now operating and developed in Chile by [[SARCAN]], a Chilean company that provides revenue and yield management systems focused on this industry, with the company [[Turbus]] as principal customer. Finnish low-cost inter-city bus service [[OnniBus]], as well as Polish [[PolskiBus]], bases its revenue flow on yield management.\n\n===Multifamily housing===\nIn the [[multi-family residential]] industry, yield optimization is focused on producing [[supply and demand]] forecasts to determine rent recommendations for profit optimization. However, the use of the yield optimization systems is fairly new to the industry in the late 1990s, with Archstone Smith pioneering its use.<ref>\n{{Cite news\n | first = Joe\n | last = Bousquin\n | title = Revenue Revolution: Pushing Rents Becomes the Norm\n | url = http://www.multifamilyexecutive.com/industry-news.asp?sectionID=550&articleID=656952&refresh=true\n | work = [[Multifamily Executive Magazine]]\n | date = 2008-02-01\n }}\n</ref> The multifamily industry currently has two providers of yield management systems, the LRO (Lease Rent Options) Revenue Management System from Rainmaker, and the YieldStar Asset Optimization System from RealPage.

Several vendors, such as [[Earnix]], EMB, ODG, provide specialized pricing optimization software for the industry.\n\n===Telecommunications===\nOn average, [[Communications service provider]]s utilize an average of just 35 to 40 percent of available network capacity.<ref name=\"Kaul 2009 17\u201319\">{{Citation\n  | last = Kaul\n  | first = Sanjay\n  | title = Yield Management: Getting More Out Of What You Already Have\n  | journal = Ericsson Business Review\n  | volume = No. 2\n  | pages = 17\u201319\n  | year = 2009 }}</ref> Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as [[Telcordia]]<ref>\n{{Citation\n  | last = Smyck\n  | first = Darek\n  | author-link =\n  | title = Applying Yield Management in the Mobile Broadband Market\n  | year = 2011\n  | url = http://www.telcordia.com/collateral/innovation-insight/telecom-yield-management.pdf }}\n</ref> and [[Ericsson]]<ref name=\"Kaul 2009 17\u201319\"/> have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications service providers to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth.<ref>[http://www.telcordia.com/collateral/innovation-insight/telecom-yield-management.pdf Applying Yield Management in the Mobile Broadband Market]</ref> Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last = Humair\n |first = Salal\n |title = Yield management for telecommunication networks : defining a new landscape\n |publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n |year = 2001\n |hdl = 1721.1/8787\n }}</ref> The approach can be more difficult to implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last = Jallat\n |first = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\n |last2 = Ancarani\n |first2 = Fabio\n |title = Yield management, dynamic pricing and CRM in telecommunications\n |journal = Journal of Services Marketing\n |volume = 22\n |issue = 6\n |pages = 465\u2013478\n |year = 2008\n |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1747102&show=pdf\n |issn = 0887-6045\n |doi = 10.1108/08876040810901882}}\n</ref> Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell.<ref name=\"Smyck 2011\">{{Citation\n |last = Smyck\n |first = Darek\n |author-link =\n |title = Applying Yield Management in the Mobile Broadband Market\n |year = 2011\n |url = http://www.telcordia.com/collateral/innovation-insight/telecom-yield-management.pdf\n}}</ref> Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn\u2019t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as [[real time policy]] and [[real-time charging]], and using new marketing channels to target consumers <ref name=\"Kaul 2009 17\u201319\"/><ref name=\"Smyck 2011\"/> with innovative services.\n\n===Online advertising===\nYield management in online ad sales is in essence the same as in other industries above mentioned; managing the publishers supply/inventory (banner impressions) with the market demand, at the best price (CPM/RPM) while assuring highest possible fill rates.\n\n===Railways===\nWhile railways traditionally sold fully flexible tickets that were valid on all trains on a given day or even trains on several days, deregulation and (partial) privatization introduced yield management in the United Kingdom as well as for high speed services in Germany or France. Tickets for the same route can be as cheap as \u20ac19 but also go into the triple digits depending on departure time, demand, and the time the ticket is booked.\n\n===Skiing===\nYield Management has shown increasing popularity in the ski industry, especially in the North American markets. This ranges from non-physical rate fences<ref>{{cite web|last1=Revenue Management in Action|title=Revenue Management at Ski Resorts\n|url=http://blogs.cornell.edu/advancedrevenuemanagement12/2012/03/28/revenue-management-at-ski-resorts/|publisher=Cornell}}</ref>, including age and validity differentiation to fully dynamic prices. Determinants of such variable prices include date-specific expected demand factors (institutional and public holidays, weekends, weather, size and accessibility of the resort, etc.)\n\n===Pet Boarding===\nWith predictable demand far outnumbering fixed supply in the professional pet boarding industry, Yield Management has become an ever-popular practice for this segment of businesses.  Much like the hotel industry, these systems help gauge which restrictions to implement, e.g. length of stay, non-refundable rate, or close to arrival, while also ensuring they are selling rooms and services at the right price, to the right person, at the right time.\n\n==Econometrics==\nYield management and [[econometrics]] center on detailed forecasting and [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical optimization]] of marginal revenue opportunities. The opportunities arise from segmentation of consumer willingness to pay. If the market for a particular good follows the simple straight line Price/Demand relationship illustrated below, a single [[fixed price]] of $50 there is enough demand to sell 50 units of inventory. This results in $2500 in revenues. However the same Price/Demand relationship yields $4000 if consumers are presented with multiple prices.\n\nIn practice, the segmentation approach relies on adequate fences between consumers so that everyone doesn't buy at the lowest price offered. The airlines use time of purchase to create this segmentation, with later booking customers paying the higher fares. The [[Fashion|fashion industry]] uses time in the opposite direction, discounting later in the selling season once the item is out of fashion or inappropriate for the time of year. Other approaches to fences involve attributes that create substantial value to the consumer at little or no cost to the seller. A [[backstage pass]] at a concert is a good example of this. Initially yield management avoided the complexity caused by the interaction of absolute price and price position by using surrogates for price such as booking class. By the mid-1990s, most implementation incorporated some measures of [[elasticity (economics)|price elasticity]]. The airlines were exceptional in this case, preferring to focus on more detailed segmentation by implementing O&D (Origin & Destination) systems.\n\nAt the heart of yield management decision-making process is the [[trade-off]] of marginal yields from segments that are competing for the same inventory. In capacity-constrained cases, there is a bird-in-the-hand decision that forces the seller to reject lower revenue generating customers in the hopes that the inventory can be sold in a higher valued segment. The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the marginal revenue curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for [[inventory control]] decisions. In these cases the intersection of the [[marginal revenue]] curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the lower segment is the point of interest.\n\nIn the case illustrated here, a car rental company must set up protection levels for its higher valued segments. By estimating where the marginal revenue curve of the luxury segment crosses the actual rental value of the midsize car segment the company can decide how many [[Luxury vehicles|luxury cars]] to make available to midsize car renters. Where the [[Vertical bar|vertical line]] from this intersection point crosses the demand (horizontal) axis determines how many luxury cars should be protected for genuine luxury car renters. The need to calculate protection levels has led to a number of heuristic solutions, most notable EMSRa and EMSRb, which stands for [[Expected Marginal Seat Revenue]] version a and b respectively. The balancing [[point of interest]] is found using [[Littlewood's rule]] which states that demand for <math>R_2</math> should be accepted as long as\n\n<math>R</math><sub>2</sub> <math>\\ge R</math><sub>1</sub><math> * Prob( D</math><sub>1</sub><math>>x ) </math>\n\nwhere<br />\n<math>R_2</math> is the value of the lower valued segment<br />\n<math>R_1</math> is the value of the higher valued segment<br />\n<math>D_1</math> is the demand for the higher valued segment and<br />\n<math>x</math> is the capacity left\n\nThis equation is re-arranged to compute protection levels as follows:\n\n<math>y</math><sub>1</sub><math> = Prob</math><sup>\u22121</sup><math>( R</math><sub>2</sub><math>/R</math><sub>1</sub><math> )</math>\n\nIn words, you want to protect <math>y</math><sub>1</sub> units of inventory for the higher valued segment where <math>y</math><sub>1</sub> is equal to the [[inverse probability]] of demand of the revenue ratio of the lower valued segment to the higher valued segment. This equation defines the EMSRa algorithm which handles the two segment case. EMSRb is smarter and handles multiple segments by comparing the revenue of the lower segment to a demand [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] of the revenues of the higher segments. Neither of these heuristics produces the exact right answer and increasingly implementations make use of [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] to find optimal protection levels.\n\nSince the mid-1990's increasingly sophisticated [[mathematical models]] have been developed such as the [[dynamic programming]] formulation pioneered by Talluri and Van Ryzin<ref>Talluri, K. T. and G. J. Van Ryzin (2001). \"Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior.\" Management science</ref> which has led to more accurate estimates of bid prices. Bid prices represent the minimum price a seller should accept for a single piece of inventory and are popular [[Control system|control mechanisms]] for Hotels and Car Rental firms. Models derived from developments in [[financial engineering]] are intriguing but have been unstable and difficult to place the parameters in practice. Yield management tends to focus on environments that are less rational than the [[financial markets]].\n\n==Yield management system==\n[[corporation|Firms]] that engage in yield management usually use [[computer]] yield management systems to do so. The [[Internet]] has greatly facilitated this process.\n\nEnterprises that use yield management periodically review transactions for [[good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] already supplied and for goods or services to be supplied in the future. They may also review information (including statistics) about events (known future events such as holidays, or unexpected past events such as [[List of terrorist incidents|terrorist attacks]]), competitive information (including prices), seasonal patterns, and other pertinent factors that affect sales. The [[model (abstract)|models]] attempt to forecast total demand for all products/services they provide, by market segment and [[price point]]. Since total demand normally exceeds what the particular firm can produce in that period, the [[model (abstract)|models]] attempt to optimize the firm's outputs to maximize revenue.\n\nThe optimization attempts to answer the question: \"Given our operating constraints, what is the best mix of products and/or services for us to produce and sell in the period, and at what prices, to generate the highest expected revenue?\"\n\nOptimization can help the firm adjust prices and to allocate capacity among market segments to maximize expected revenues. This can be done at different levels of detail:\n* by goods (such as a seat on a flight or a seat at an opera production)\n* by group of goods (such as the entire [[opera house]] or all the seats on a flight)\n* by market (such as sales from Seattle and Minneapolis for a flight going Seattle-Minneapolis-Boston)\n* overall (on all the routes an airline flies, or all the seats during an opera production season)\n\nYield management is particularly suitable when selling perishable products, i.e. goods that become unsellable at a point in time (for example air tickets just after a flight takes off). Industries that use yield management include airlines, hotels, stadiums and other venues with a fixed number of seats, and advertising. With an advance forecast of demand and pricing flexibility, buyers will self-sort based on their price sensitivity (using more power in off-peak hours or going to the theater mid-week), their demand sensitivity (must have the higher cost early morning flight or must go to the Saturday night opera) or their time of purchase (usually paying a premium for booking late).\n\nIn this way, yield management's overall aim is to provide an optimal mix of goods at a variety of price points at different points in time or for different baskets of features. The system will try to maintain a [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of purchases over time that is balanced as well as high.\n\nGood yield management maximizes (or at least significantly increases) revenue production for the same number of units, by taking advantage of the forecast of high demand/low demand periods, effectively shifting demand from high demand periods to low demand periods and by charging a premium for late bookings. While yield management systems tend to generate higher revenues, the revenue streams tends to arrive later in the booking horizon as more capacity is held for late sale at premium prices.\n\nFirms faced with lack of [[pricing power]] sometimes turn to yield management as a last resort. After a year or two using yield management, many of them are surprised to discover they have actually lowered prices for the majority of their opera seats or hotel rooms or other products. That is, they offer far higher discounts more frequently for off-peak times, while raising prices only marginally for peak times, resulting in higher revenue overall.\n\nBy doing this, they have actually increased quantity demanded by selectively introducing many more price points, as they learn about and react to the diversity of interests and purchase drivers of their customers.\n\n==Ethical issues and questions of efficacy==\n{{Weasel|date=December 2011}}\nSome consumers are concerned{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} that yield management could penalize them for conditions which cannot be helped and are unethical to penalize. For example, the formulas, algorithms, and [[neural network]]s that determine [[airline ticket]] prices could feasibly consider frequent flyer information, which includes a wealth of [[socioeconomics|socio-economic]] information such as age and home address. The airline then could charge higher prices to consumers who are between certain ages or who live in neighborhoods with higher average wealth, even if those neighborhoods also include poor households. Very few (if any) airlines using yield management are able{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} to employ this level of price discrimination because prices are not set based on characteristics of the purchaser, which are in any case often not known at the time of purchase.\n\nSome consumers may object that it is impossible for them to boycott yield management when buying some goods, such as airline tickets.\n\nYield Management also includes many noncontroversial and more prevalent practices, such as varying prices over time to reflect demand. This level of yield management makes up the majority of yield management in the airline industry. For example, airlines may price a ticket on the Sunday after Thanksgiving at a higher fare than the Sunday a week later. Alternatively, they may make tickets more expensive when bought at the last minute than when bought six months in advance. The goal of this level of yield management is essentially trying to force demand to equal or exceed supply.\n\nWhen yield management was introduced in the early 1990's, primarily in the airline industry, many suggested that despite the obvious immediate increase in revenues, it might harm [[customer satisfaction]] and loyalty, interfere with [[relationship marketing]], and drive customers from firms that used yield management to firms that do not. [[Frequent flier]] programs were developed as a response to regain [[Loyalty business model|customer loyalty]] and reward frequent and [[High-yield debt|high yield]] passengers. Today, yield management is nearly universal in many industries, including airlines.\n\nDespite optimizing revenue in theory, introduction of yield management does not always achieve this in practice because of [[corporate image]] problems. In 2002, [[Deutsche Bahn]], the [[Germany|German]] [[National Railway|national railway]] company, experimented with yield management for frequent [[BahnCard|loyalty card]] passengers.<ref name=link>\n{{cite journal\n | first = Heike\n | last = Link\n | title = PEP-A Yield-Management Scheme for Rail Passenger Fares in Germany\n | journal = Japan Railway & Transport Review\n | volume = 38\n |date=March 2004\n\n | pages = 54\n}}\n</ref> The fixed pricing model that had existed for decades was replaced with a more demand-responsive pricing model, but this reform proved highly unpopular with passengers, leading to widespread protests and a decline in passenger numbers.<ref>\n{{cite news\n | first = Klaus-Peter\n | last = Schmid\n | title = Kein sch\u00f6ner Zug\n | url = http://www.zeit.de/2003/22/Kolumne\n | work = [[Die Zeit]]\n | date = 2003-05-22\n | language = German\n }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n | first = Volker\n | last = Franz\n | title = Die Bahnpreisreform: Ein kundenfreundlicher Gegenvorschlag\n | url = http://www.zeit.de/leben/bahn/bahn_sj_19\n | work = [[Die Zeit]]\n | date = 2002-11-01\n | language = German\n }}\n</ref>\n\n==Experimental studies of yield management decisions==\nRecently, people working in the area of [[behavioral operations research]] have begun to study the yield management decisions of actual human decision makers. One question that this research addresses is how much might revenues increase if managers relied on yield management systems rather than their own judgment when making pricing decisions. Using methods from [[experimental economics]], this work has revealed that yield management systems are likely to increase revenues significantly. Further, this research reveals that \"errors\" in yield management decisions tend to be quite systematic. For instance, Bearden, Murphy, and Rappaport showed that with respect to expected revenue maximizing policies, people tend to price too high when they have high levels of inventory and too low when their inventory levels are low.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Geo (marketing)]]\n* [[Variable pricing]]\n* [[Price discrimination]]\n* [[Algorithmic pricing]]\n* [[Last minute advertising]]\n* [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]]\n* [[Behavioral Operations Research]]\n* [[Revenue shortfall]]\n* [[Revenue management]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2008}}\n\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khakifirooz|first1=Marzieh|last2=Chien|first2=Chen Fu|last3=Chen|first3=Ying Jen|title=Bayesian inference for mining semiconductor manufacturing big data for yield enhancement and smart production to empower industry 4.0|journal=Applied Soft Computing|volume=68|pages=990\u2013999|date=2017|doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2017.11.034}}</ref>\n* Mauri, Aurelio G.
