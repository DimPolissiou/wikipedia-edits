Praising Griffiths' approach in describing the \"fluid ambiguities\" of Anglo-Saxon cosmological beliefs, he considered such an approach to be an improvement on British archaeologist [[David M. Wilson]]'s book ''Anglo-Saxon Paganism'' (1992), which he believed had failed to even discuss Anglo-Saxon conceptions of cosmology.

James reviewed the book, praising it as a \"comprehensive\" study of the subject of Anglo-Saxon paganism and magic.

It was first published in 1996 by Anglo-Saxon Books, and later republished in a revised edition in 2003.\n\nDivided into two parts, the first section of the book is devoted to a discussion of Anglo-Saxon paganism and magical beliefs, in doing so drawing evidence from Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Classical sources. It looks at a wide range of different areas, including the Anglo-Saxons conception of gods, the beliefs regarding death and the ancestors, and the ideas about elves and dwarves.\n\n==Background==\nThe use of historical written sources to learn more about the pre-Christian religion of the Anglo-Saxons was something that had been going on for many decades prior to the publication of ''Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic''.\nIn 1948, [[Godfrid Storms]] published ''Anglo-Saxon Magic'', a study of the subject which also contained a complete collection of Anglo-Saxon charms.<ref>[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]].</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Part One===\nIn the first chapter, entitled \"The Up World\", Griffiths discusses the Anglo-Saxons' pre-Christian beliefs about their gods, looking at the veneration of idols and the manner in which the deities were understood by the Anglo-Saxons, in doing so contrasting them with those of the Classical world.<ref>[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 11&ndash;22.</ref> Moving on into the second chapter, \"The Dead World\", Griffiths deals with the role of the ancestors in Anglo-Saxon heathenism before proceeding on to discuss beliefs in an afterlife and the reasons for performing sacrifice,<ref>[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 23&ndash;45.</ref> Chapter three, \"The Around World\", looks into the beliefs regarding those species who were neither god nor humans, such as the elves and dwarves, as well as the Anglo-Saxon magical beliefs regarding medicine and agriculture.<ref>[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 47&ndash;71.</ref>\n\nThe fourth chapter, which is entitled \"The Empty World\", deals with those Anglo-Saxon texts which portray the supernatural world as \"a bleak reality\"\u201d, looking at conceptions of predestination and fate,<ref>[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 73&ndash;79.</ref> whilst the fifth, entitled \"The Rational World\", dealt with the role of [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]] and the wider effect that this had on English society, in particular discussing the significance of [[Bede]],<ref>[[#Gri03|Griffiths 2003]]. pp. 81&ndash;93.</ref>\n\n===Part Two===\nThe second part of the book contains a series of Anglo-Saxon texts pertaining to Anglo-Saxon magical practices.\n\n==Reception and review==\n''Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic'' has not been the subject of any scholarly book reviews.\n\nThe academic archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]] made reference to ''Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic'' in his study of Norse magical beliefs, ''[[The Viking Way (Price book)|The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia]]'' (2002). Praising Griffiths' approach in describing the \"fluid ambiguities\" of Anglo-Saxon cosmological beliefs, he considered such an approach to be an improvement on British archaeologist [[David M. Wilson]]'s book ''Anglo-Saxon Paganism'' (1992), which he believed had failed to even discuss Anglo-Saxon conceptions of cosmology. Price thought that it was pertinent to \"bear [Griffiths'] flexible view of the cosmos in mind\" when studying Norse cosmological beliefs.<ref>[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. pp. 110&ndash;111.</ref>\n\nApart from these mentions in Neil Price's out-of-print PhD thesis, Griffith's book has not made any impact within scholarship in the fields of northern paganism or Anglo-Saxon studies.\n\nWriting on the ''Twisted Tree Bookshelf'' website, [[Paganism (contemporary)|Contemporary Pagan]] D. James reviewed the book, praising it as a \"comprehensive\" study of the subject of Anglo-Saxon paganism and magic. Opining that it was a \"ground breaking\" study, James compared it to [[Brian Bates (psychologist)|Brian Bates]]' ''[[The Way of Wyrd]]'' and recommended it to all practicing Pagans.<ref>[[#Jam08|James 2008]].</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title= Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic ''(Revised edition)'' |last=Griffiths |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Griffiths |year= 2003 |publisher= Anglo-Saxon Books |location= Hockwold-cum-Wilton, Norfolk |isbn=978-1-898281-33-7 |ref=Grif03}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.twistedtree.org.uk/Bookshelf.htm |title=Review of ''Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic'' |last=James |first=D. |year=2008 |work=Twisted Tree Bookshelf |accessdate=8 March 2012 |ref=Jam08}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia |last=Price |first=Neil |year=2002 |publisher=Department of Archaeology and Ancient History, Uppsala University |location=Uppsala |isbn=91-506-1626-9 |ref=Pri02}}\n* {{cite book |title=Anglo-Saxon Magic |last=Storms |first=Godfrid |authorlink=Godfrid Storms |year=1948 |publisher=Martinus |location=The Hague |ref=Sto48}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:1996 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:2003 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Academic studies of ritual and magic]]\n[[Category:Books about paganism]]\n[[Category:History books]]\n[[Category:Religious studies books]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Bill Griffiths\u2192Bill Griffiths (poet)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_of_Anglo-Saxon_Magic"}
