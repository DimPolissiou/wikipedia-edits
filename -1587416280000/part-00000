The song was released on February 8, 2011. It was written by Kesha, along with [[Klas \u00c5hlund]], [[Lukasz Gottwald]], [[Allan Grigg]], [[Benjamin Levin (musician)|Benjamin Levin]] and [[Max Martin]], with production done by [[Dr. Luke]], Max Martin, [[Benny Blanco]] and Kool Kojak. According to Kesha the song's lyrics are representative of herself and her fans. \"Blow\" is dominantly an [[electro (music)|electro]] and [[dance-pop]] song and is described as a party anthem as it portrays a simple message of having a desire to have a good time at a club.\n\nCritical reception of \"Blow\" has been generally positive, with most critics praising the song's [[hook (music)|hook]], opening, and party anthem vibe, though some found the chorus uninspiring and ordinary. Kesha's vocal work throughout the song was met with mixed reaction: some critics felt that she was both sassy and brash, while other critics felt that her personality was missing from the song. Commercially, \"Blow\" reached the top ten in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], becoming her sixth consecutive top-ten hit in both countries as a solo artist. The song also reached the top ten in [[New Zealand]], and the top 20 in [[Canadian Hot 100]] in [[Canada]].\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Chris Marrs Piliero]] and was released February 25, 2011. The video co-stars actor [[James Van Der Beek]], who plays Kesha's nemesis. Piliero and Kesha came up with the video's concept and is intended to be simplistic, a video that is cool and random. Reception of the video by critics were positive, with the mid-video dialogue scene's humor being highlighted.\n\n==Writing and composition==\n{{listen\n  | filename = Ke$ha - Blow.ogg\n  | title       = \"Blow\"\n  | description = \"Blow\" is an electro and dance-pop song that uses a synth-infused beat.

Production of the song was completed by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco and Kool Kojak. According to Kesha the line \"We\u2019re taking over\" is representative of herself and her fans, which she explained during an interview with ''Beatweek Magazine'', \"I love that I say \u2018we\u2019re taking over\u2019 in it because my fans and me have started a cult.

The song was released on February 8, 2011. It was written by Kesha, along with [[Klas \u00c5hlund]], [[Lukasz Gottwald]], [[Allan Grigg]], [[Benjamin Levin (musician)|Benjamin Levin]] and [[Max Martin]], with production done by [[Dr. Luke]], Max Martin, [[Benny Blanco]] and Kool Kojak. According to Kesha the song's lyrics are representative of herself and her fans. \"Blow\" is dominantly an [[electro (music)|electro]] and [[dance-pop]] song and is described as a party anthem as it portrays a simple message of having a desire to have a good time at a club.\n\nCritical reception of \"Blow\" has been generally positive, with most critics praising the song's [[hook (music)|hook]], opening, and party anthem vibe, though some found the chorus uninspiring and ordinary. Kesha's vocal work throughout the song was met with mixed reaction: some critics felt that she was both sassy and brash, while other critics felt that her personality was missing from the song. Commercially, \"Blow\" reached the top ten in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], becoming her sixth consecutive top-ten hit in both countries as a solo artist. The song also reached the top ten in [[New Zealand]], and the top 20 in [[Canadian Hot 100]] in [[Canada]].\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Chris Marrs Piliero]] and was released February 25, 2011. The video co-stars actor [[James Van Der Beek]], who plays Kesha's nemesis. Piliero and Kesha came up with the video's concept and is intended to be simplistic, a video that is cool and random. Reception of the video by critics were positive, with the mid-video dialogue scene's humor being highlighted.\n\n==Writing and composition==\n{{listen\n  | filename = Ke$ha - Blow.ogg\n  | title       = \"Blow\"\n  | description = \"Blow\" is an electro and dance-pop song that uses a synth-infused beat.

Production of the song was completed by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco and Kool Kojak.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n==Racing==\n{{Under construction|section=Description|placedby=HopsonRoad}}\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n | title = Sailing yachts\n\n | image1 = 2013_Ahmanson_Cup_Regatta_yacht_Zapata_II_b_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg\n | alt1 = A cruising yacht\n | caption1 = A {{Convert|50|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} cruising yacht\n\n | image2 = 60feet IMOCA SAFRAN 01.JPG\n | alt2 = A racing yacht\n | caption2 = A {{Convert|60|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[IMOCA 60|IMOCA]] ocean racing yacht\n\n | footer = Cruising and racing yachts embody different tradeoffs between comfort and performance.\n}}\n\nA '''sailing yacht''' (US ship prefixes SY or S/Y), is a leisure craft that uses sails as its primary means of propulsion.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's [[Chartplotter|location on a chart]] and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n==Racing==\n{{Under construction|section=Description|placedby=HopsonRoad}}\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSystems:link.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_yacht"}

He is Assistant Professor in the Teaching Credentials Department of [[California State University]], Sacramento's College of Education; Director of the [[National Council of Teachers of English]]-West located at the [[University of California Berkeley]]\u2019s Graduate School of Education, and the former Executive Director of the Center for Civic Engagement and the [[Bay Area Teachers Center]] based at [[Lick-Wilmerding High School]] and [[San Francisco State University]]. Allender is known for his work on ''Expanding the Canon'', a television series on teaching multicultural literature produced in collaboration with [[Thirteen/WNET]] and AnnenbergCPB.\n\n== Education==\nAllender began his career as a high school English teacher. He earned his PhD at the [[University of Queensland]], Australia and teaches coursework in multicultural literature, urban education, linguistics for educators, and new literacies. In addition to teaching at UC Berkeley, Allender has taught and lectured at a number of other colleges and universities, including [[San Francisco State University]], [[New York University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[Fordham University]], and [[Medgar Evers College]].\n\n== Career==\nThe Center for Civic Engagement is the umbrella office for all of the public purpose programs of Lick-Wilmerding High School. Allender was appointed Interim Executive Director in July 2010.\n\n[[File:Dale1.jpg|thumb|Allender at [[Reading is Fundamental]] gala]]\nThe National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), a professional development organization for English Language Arts educators at all levels, is one of the oldest non-profit institutions in the United States. While serving as Associate Executive Director of NCTE for five years Allender served as Interim Executive Director for the Council. In 2003 he launched NCTE West at the University of California Berkeley.\n\nAs a high-school teacher, Allender taught English by incorporating issues of social justice taught to him by educators who were formerly members of the Black Panther Party and The Young Lords (the Puerto Rican counterpart of the Black Panther Party. This precipitated death threats that garnered national attention because educators and the public wanted to know what he was teaching. After earning a reputation for being progressive and successfully addressing contentious issues in education, Allender was hired by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE).\n\nIn 2004 Allender moderated a conversation between parents and teachers on the use of Mark Twain in the classroom in the Bloomington-Normal, Illinois school district. The dialogue included the Illinois State University English department, the Mayor's office, the NACCP, and school superintendent's office. Since NCTE is opposed to the censorship of literature, the teachers involved felt that Allender would support their stance on the use of Mark Twain in the classroom. But, at the same time, since Allender is African American parents felt that he would support the book's removal for its use of \"the n-word\". Allender was asked to help the parents and teachers work through the impasse by leading them through the process of doing an ethnographic study of their experiences.\n\nIn 2006 NCTE West was the gathering place for the first ever 21st century Literacies Impact Conference sponsored by the [[Verizon]] Foundation, [[Apple Inc.]], and [[The Partnerships for 21st century Schools]], [[E-Luminate Group]]. Allender's work with the Partnership for 21st century Skills on the English Language Arts Literacy Map was the inspiration for the conference which brought together the leading education content area groups: NCTE [http://www.ncte.org], NCTM [http://www.nctm.org], NCSS [http://www.socialstudies.org], and NSTA [http://www.nsta.org]. Working with students from Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, Allender produced a video documenting this conference.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/user/dncte#p/a/u/1/yngUPGZ8c74 NCTE TV] (a web channel created by Allender in 2009)</ref>\n\n[[The Bay Area Teachers Center]] (BATC) is a single-subject teacher credential program created as a partnership between [[San Francisco State University]] and Lick-Wilmerding High School. Allender was appointed Executive Director of BATC in 2007. Under Allender's leadership, BATC expanded partnerships with the [[University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education at UC Berkeley]] and [[Teach Tomorrow Oakland]], a project of the Mayor's office and the Oakland United School District.<ref>[http://web.me.com/mayorrondellums/Mayor_Ron_Dellums_-_My_Thoughts/Teach_Tomorrow_in_Oakland.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Allender also revamped the BATC curriculum to incorporate online courses using NCTE \"Pathways for 21st&nbsp;Century Literacy\" and \"Pathways for Adolescent Literacy\" in the Instructional Technology and content area courses.\n\n== Advisory boards and partnerships ==\nAllender is a founding member of the [[Cable in the Classroom]] Educational Advisory Board and serves on several other boards for a variety of organizations including [[Media Rights]], the [[Center for Black Literature at Medgar Evers College]], Art21, and [[Scenarios USA]]. He has acted in an advisory capacity with many other institutions including The Independent Film Channel/Film School project, the [[Anti Defamation League]]\u2019s Echoes and Reflections, and A World of Difference Online. In addition, Allender served as lead advisor or advisory board member for seven [[Annenberg/CPB]] professional development television series for English language arts educators.\n\n== Awards ==\nAllender's awards include the Summer Institute for Echoes and Reflections Scholars in Jerusalem Fellowship; the Media award from [[National Association for Multicultural Education]] and the Education award from the US International Film and Video Festival for the eight-part professional development television series ''The Expanding Canon''. Allender also received a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] award for the study of American Indian literature. Allender was also awarded an honorary chair at the D.C. area Writers Project 2005 Annual Forum.\n\n== Publications ==\nAllender's publications include ''From San Francisco to Senegal''; ''Academic Being and Becoming''; a forward for ''Included in English Studies: Learning Climates that Cultivate Racial and Ethnic Diversity; Trends and Issues in Secondary English'' published by NCTE and ''Literary Guerillas''; ''Canon Keepers''; and ''Empire Institutions: A Black Teacher\u2019s Narrative'' in Ishmael Reed's [[Konch Magazine]].\n\n== Publications ==\n* Standing on the Border: Issues of Identity and Border Crossing in Young Adult Literature, ''The Alan Review'' ''http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/winter00/niday.html''\n* The Multicultural Library: An Essay.

Allender is known for his work on ''Expanding the Canon'', a television series on teaching multicultural literature produced in collaboration with [[Thirteen/WNET]] and AnnenbergCPB.\n\n== Education==\nAllender began his career as a high school English teacher. He earned his PhD at the [[University of Queensland]], Australia and teaches coursework in multicultural literature, urban education, linguistics for educators, and new literacies. In addition to teaching at UC Berkeley, Allender has taught and lectured at a number of other colleges and universities, including [[San Francisco State University]], [[New York University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[Fordham University]], and [[Medgar Evers College]].\n\n== Career==\nThe Center for Civic Engagement is the umbrella office for all of the public purpose programs of Lick-Wilmerding High School. Allender was appointed Interim Executive Director in July 2010.\n\n[[File:Dale1.jpg|thumb|Allender at [[Reading is Fundamental]] gala]]\nThe National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), a professional development organization for English Language Arts educators at all levels, is one of the oldest non-profit institutions in the United States. While serving as Associate Executive Director of NCTE for five years Allender served as Interim Executive Director for the Council. In 2003 he launched NCTE West at the University of California Berkeley.\n\nAs a high-school teacher, Allender taught English by incorporating issues of social justice taught to him by educators who were formerly members of the Black Panther Party and The Young Lords (the Puerto Rican counterpart of the Black Panther Party. This precipitated death threats that garnered national attention because educators and the public wanted to know what he was teaching. After earning a reputation for being progressive and successfully addressing contentious issues in education, Allender was hired by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE).\n\nIn 2004 Allender moderated a conversation between parents and teachers on the use of Mark Twain in the classroom in the Bloomington-Normal, Illinois school district. The dialogue included the Illinois State University English department, the Mayor's office, the NACCP, and school superintendent's office. Since NCTE is opposed to the censorship of literature, the teachers involved felt that Allender would support their stance on the use of Mark Twain in the classroom. But, at the same time, since Allender is African American parents felt that he would support the book's removal for its use of \"the n-word\". Allender was asked to help the parents and teachers work through the impasse by leading them through the process of doing an ethnographic study of their experiences.\n\nIn 2006 NCTE West was the gathering place for the first ever 21st century Literacies Impact Conference sponsored by the [[Verizon]] Foundation, [[Apple Inc.]], and [[The Partnerships for 21st century Schools]], [[E-Luminate Group]]. Allender's work with the Partnership for 21st century Skills on the English Language Arts Literacy Map was the inspiration for the conference which brought together the leading education content area groups: NCTE [http://www.ncte.org], NCTM [http://www.nctm.org], NCSS [http://www.socialstudies.org], and NSTA [http://www.nsta.org]. Working with students from Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, Allender produced a video documenting this conference.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/user/dncte#p/a/u/1/yngUPGZ8c74 NCTE TV] (a web channel created by Allender in 2009)</ref>\n\n[[The Bay Area Teachers Center]] (BATC) is a single-subject teacher credential program created as a partnership between [[San Francisco State University]] and Lick-Wilmerding High School. Allender was appointed Executive Director of BATC in 2007. Under Allender's leadership, BATC expanded partnerships with the [[University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education at UC Berkeley]] and [[Teach Tomorrow Oakland]], a project of the Mayor's office and the Oakland United School District.<ref>[http://web.me.com/mayorrondellums/Mayor_Ron_Dellums_-_My_Thoughts/Teach_Tomorrow_in_Oakland.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Allender also revamped the BATC curriculum to incorporate online courses using NCTE \"Pathways for 21st&nbsp;Century Literacy\" and \"Pathways for Adolescent Literacy\" in the Instructional Technology and content area courses.\n\n== Advisory boards and partnerships ==\nAllender is a founding member of the [[Cable in the Classroom]] Educational Advisory Board and serves on several other boards for a variety of organizations including [[Media Rights]], the [[Center for Black Literature at Medgar Evers College]], Art21, and [[Scenarios USA]]. He has acted in an advisory capacity with many other institutions including The Independent Film Channel/Film School project, the [[Anti Defamation League]]\u2019s Echoes and Reflections, and A World of Difference Online. In addition, Allender served as lead advisor or advisory board member for seven [[Annenberg/CPB]] professional development television series for English language arts educators.\n\n== Awards ==\nAllender's awards include the Summer Institute for Echoes and Reflections Scholars in Jerusalem Fellowship; the Media award from [[National Association for Multicultural Education]] and the Education award from the US International Film and Video Festival for the eight-part professional development television series ''The Expanding Canon''. Allender also received a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] award for the study of American Indian literature. Allender was also awarded an honorary chair at the D.C. area Writers Project 2005 Annual Forum.\n\n== Publications ==\nAllender's publications include ''From San Francisco to Senegal''; ''Academic Being and Becoming''; a forward for ''Included in English Studies: Learning Climates that Cultivate Racial and Ethnic Diversity; Trends and Issues in Secondary English'' published by NCTE and ''Literary Guerillas''; ''Canon Keepers''; and ''Empire Institutions: A Black Teacher\u2019s Narrative'' in Ishmael Reed's [[Konch Magazine]].\n\n== Publications ==\n* Standing on the Border: Issues of Identity and Border Crossing in Young Adult Literature, ''The Alan Review'' ''http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/winter00/niday.html''\n* The Multicultural Library: An Essay.

On November 6, 2017, Good Mythical Morning became a YouTube Original series. Shortly after, they reverted to their classic format.\n\n== Format ==\n''Good Mythical Morning'' is uploaded to YouTube every weekday morning, at approximately 6:00 AM Eastern Time. Each episode usually consists of Rhett and Link doing antics, playing food-related games, and answering often absurd questions.\n\nDuring the 12th season of GMM, from the 53rd episode, they followed the 4-episode-per-day format, where they upload 4 GMM episodes and make them public at the same time. In the regular 15-minute episodes they made it into 30 minutes of Good Mythical Morning. They continued the 4-episode format until the end of Season 12, as when the 13th season was launched, they reduced it to 3 episodes per week.\n\nAt the announcement of the 14th season, they cut off the 3-episode format and switched back to making only one episode per day, followed by their weekly Saturday morning show, ''Let's Talk About That'' (abbreviated to LTAT) hosted by their executive producer, Stevie Wynne Levine. Following this on Sundays is ''Mythical Kitchen,'' which is hosted by ''Good Mythical Morning''<nowiki/>'s head chef, Josh Scherer.\n\nAt the end of every episode, Rhett and Link spin the \"Wheel of Mythicality\", which can land on categories such as \"6 Degrees of Bacon,\" \"Winface,\" and \"Gifticality.\" The contents of the wheel often change between seasons. The consequences of each wheel spin are determined in ''Good Mythical More,'' a more relaxed after-show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpCc5n9hqiVC7HhPwcIKEg|title=Good Mythical MORE|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=August 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDue to the circumstances of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], beginning on March 30, 2020, ''Good Mythical Morning'' adopted a modified format in which episodes consist of a mix between prerecorded studio episodes and episodes featuring Rhett and Link broadcasting over video call from their own homes. As of April 18, this format is current.\n\n== Let's Talk About That (LTAT) ==\n{{Main|Let's Talk About That}}\nLTAT was a Saturday show that aired at 6:00 Eastern Time hosted by Stevie Wynne Levine. Before LTAT, they had a few other Friday morning shows, including Ear Biscuits (which is still airing), and Good Mythical Crew, continuing.\n\nLTAT was a discussion of the main show's episodes that week (hence the slogan, \"the show about the show\"). The show began with a \"rejected GMM food\", which was usually food that was not selected for a video that week for various reasons but was saved for Rhett, Link, and Stevie to try during LTAT.  Chef Josh often appeared to describe the food.  The show originally began with the \"beverage of the week\", where they drank an odd beverage and talked about how it tasted and then used a segue to transition to the LTAT's main topic.\n\nLTAT was discontinued on December 21, 2019 having completed 54 episodes across two seasons. As a replacement, Rhett & Link began recording vlogs on their original main channel.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of Good Mythical Morning episodes}}\n\nThe third season of ''Good Mythical Morning'' introduced the \"Taste Test\" series which include episodes where the hosts guess the food in blindfolds, challenge themselves to eat something often spicy and disgusting, and compare a particular type of food across different brands. Some of the most popular videos from this series are the \"Bug War Challenge\", the \"Ghost Pepper Challenge\", the \"Carolina Reaper Challenge\" and the \"Sriracha Challenge\". The fifth season brought the \"Will It\" series, in which the hosts try and invent different varieties of a famous type of food with unusual and increasingly disgusting ingredients. The first episode of \"Will It\" was aired on May 5, 2014, on [[Cinco De Mayo]] titled \"Will it Taco\" where Rhett and Link tried tacos made of pine needles, baby shampoo, and congealed pork blood.\n\nMany Internet and other personalities have appeared in the show.

On November 6, 2017, Good Mythical Morning became a YouTube Original series. Shortly after, they reverted to their classic format.\n\n== Format ==\n''Good Mythical Morning'' is uploaded to YouTube every weekday morning, at approximately 6:00 AM Eastern Time. Each episode usually consists of Rhett and Link doing antics, playing food-related games, and answering often absurd questions.\n\nDuring the 12th season of GMM, from the 53rd episode, they followed the 4-episode-per-day format, where they upload 4 GMM episodes and make them public at the same time. In the regular 15-minute episodes they made it into 30 minutes of Good Mythical Morning. They continued the 4-episode format until the end of Season 12, as when the 13th season was launched, they reduced it to 3 episodes per week.\n\nAt the announcement of the 14th season, they cut off the 3-episode format and switched back to making only one episode per day, followed by their weekly Saturday morning show, ''Let's Talk About That'' (abbreviated to LTAT) hosted by their executive producer, Stevie Wynne Levine. Following this on Sundays is ''Mythical Kitchen,'' which is hosted by ''Good Mythical Morning''<nowiki/>'s head chef, Josh Scherer.\n\nAt the end of every episode, Rhett and Link spin the \"Wheel of Mythicality\", which can land on categories such as \"6 Degrees of Bacon,\" \"Winface,\" and \"Gifticality.\" The contents of the wheel often change between seasons. The consequences of each wheel spin are determined in ''Good Mythical More,'' a more relaxed after-show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpCc5n9hqiVC7HhPwcIKEg|title=Good Mythical MORE|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=August 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDue to the circumstances of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], beginning on March 30, 2020, ''Good Mythical Morning'' adopted a modified format in which episodes consist of a mix between prerecorded studio episodes and episodes featuring Rhett and Link broadcasting over video call from their own homes. As of April 18, this format is current.\n\n== Let's Talk About That (LTAT) ==\n{{Main|Let's Talk About That}}\nLTAT was a Saturday show that aired at 6:00 Eastern Time hosted by Stevie Wynne Levine. Before LTAT, they had a few other Friday morning shows, including Ear Biscuits (which is still airing), and Good Mythical Crew, continuing.\n\nLTAT was a discussion of the main show's episodes that week (hence the slogan, \"the show about the show\"). The show began with a \"rejected GMM food\", which was usually food that was not selected for a video that week for various reasons but was saved for Rhett, Link, and Stevie to try during LTAT.  Chef Josh often appeared to describe the food.  The show originally began with the \"beverage of the week\", where they drank an odd beverage and talked about how it tasted and then used a segue to transition to the LTAT's main topic.\n\nLTAT was discontinued on December 21, 2019 having completed 54 episodes across two seasons.
