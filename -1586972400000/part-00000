She wanted to become an air hostess but her family has a tradition that the women in their family will not work and she should marry one of her 'mora cherakan' (fianc\u00e9). To escape from marriage, she lies to her family that she is in love which turns out to be a coach in a college named Sunny Kuruvila ([[Jayaram]]). Anupama's uncle goes to hit him but he hits that uncle back due to loss of his lover of six years, Alphonsa. Anupama changes her lover's name  to Dr. Nandakumar([[Jayaram]]), a stuttering doc whose wife leaves him due to the same misunderstanding. Anupama reveals her fake love to Lalan ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]) a no case lawyer and he tells to the family that Anupama was raped in Goa by a Malayali. This eventually leads to Chandrasenan (Jayaram). Senan sees the remaining two doppelgangers and makes a scheme to know the truth. Senan goes to Anupama's house first to marry her then he entered the house as a tree buyer. When Anupama gets her air hostess job, Senan understands that she did all this to go for that job. She also tells Lalan that she used him to get the job. This angers Lalan, so he and Zenan scheme to prevent her from going to the job. Lalan's scheme works and Anupama gets kidnapped by Mumbai thugs and frames Senan for the kidnapping. Senan tells Sunny to go as Senan as he is the only person to save her. The police arrest Sunny thinking as Senan by Sunny's future brother-in-law. Things turn out good between Alphonsa and Sunny and Senan rescues Anupama. When Anupama proposes to Senan, he turns her down and to get Senan she feigns. Senan goes to Dr. Nandakumar's house as the Dr. and gets the doc's wife and son. On Sunny's engagement day a final fight happens between Manikandan, the Mumbai thugs, the doctor's father-in-law's thugs, etc. In the process they reveal that they are not one, but three identical (Zenan, Sunny, Dr. Nandakumar). Everyone gets their brides and goes to Bengaluru and sees that the real owner of the photo was living all the time in Bengaluru.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=}} \n*[[Jayaram]] as Chandrasenan / Sunny Kuruvilla / Dr Nandakumar / Muslim Man\n*[[Meena (actress)|Meena]] as Anupama \n*[[Divya Unni]] as Viji (voice dubbed by [[Vishalam Ravi]])\n*[[Sangeetha Krish|Sangeetha]] as Alphonsa \n*[[Kushboo]] as Muslim Man's wife (cameo)\n*[[Kalabhavan Mani]] as Chalakkudy Manikantan\n*[[Oduvil Unnikrishnan]] as Achutha Menon\n*[[Baiju (actor)|Baiju]] as Mohanakrishnan \n*[[Kottayam Nazeer]] as Omana Kuttan \n*[[Jagathy Sreekumar]] as Adv.

Karam Lehal, Angad Vir Singh and Smit Singh, teamed up to win gold in the Jr. Team Men's Skeet Event at the 35th National Games, Kerala (2015).\n\nIn the Inter-University 2015 Competitions, held at Punjab University Patiala, in the men's team event Lehal teamed up with Karanvir Singh Sekhon and Jai Dhaliwal  to win the championship by 193 points, leaving behind the teams of Punjabi University Chandigarh and Delhi University with 149 and 120 points respectively.\n\nKaram Lehal, along with skeet shooters Karanvir Sekhon and Gurjot Khangura represented India at the World University Games 2015 (Gwangju Summer Universiade 15'). The team acquired 4th position in the Men's skeet event whereas Russia, Italy and Kazakhstan stood first, second and third respectively.\n\nIn the 59th National Shotgun Championship Competitions 2015, held at Jaipur, Karam Sukhbir Singh along with skeet shooters Gurjoat Singh and Angad Vir Singh Bajwa claimed second position as a team whereas the Uttar Pradesh team led with 6 points, acquiring the gold.\n\nYear 2016 gained Lehal a Bronze in the 36th North Zone Shooting Championship.\n\n2017, seemed an year of comeback for Sukhbir, the young talent ranked 1st at the 27th All India G.V.

The [[Grand Lodge]] claims to be the oldest in the [[United States]], and the third oldest in the world after England (est. 1717) and Ireland (est. 1725), having been originally established as the [[Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania]] in 1731. This claim is disputed by both the [[Grand Lodge of Massachusetts]] and the [[Grand Lodge of Virginia]].\n\n==History==\n\n===The Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania===\n\nTwo English grand lodges erected lodges in [[Pennsylvania]] during the 18th century, the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] (known as the \"Moderns\"), established in [[London]] in 1717, and the [[Ancient Grand Lodge of England]] (known as the \"Antients\" or \"Ancients\"), established in London in 1751. The first of these, the Moderns' Grand Lodge, was first to establish lodges and provincial grand lodges in the American colonies. But by 1785, the Moderns and their lodges had ceased to exist in Pennsylvania, the last of their members having been absorbed by the lodges of the Ancients. The present day Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania descends primarily from the Ancients, with the Moderns having been grafted onto \"Ancient York Masonry.\"<ref name=Coil468>Coil, Henry W. (1961). Article \"Pennsylvania,\" pp. 468. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.</ref>\n\n====The Tun Tavern Lodge====\nThe earliest minute book of any [[Masonic lodge]] on the North American continent is that for [[Tun Tavern]] Lodge No. 3 (of the Moderns) in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>Barrat, Norris S. & Julius Sachse. ''Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, 1727-1907, As Shown by the Records of Lodge No. 2, F. & A.M. of Philadelphia.'' Philadelphia: New Era Printing Company, 1908. p. 3.</ref> The Tun Tavern was the first \"brew house\" in the city, being built in 1685, and was located on the waterfront at the corner of Water Street and Tun Alley. The extant records of the Lodge begin on 24 June 1731, but the lodge may have been older than that. It was reported by [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his ''Gazette'' for 8 December 1730, that there were \"several Lodges of Free Masons erected in this Province....\" The Tun Tavern, being a popular meeting place in [[Philadelphia]], was undoubtedly the first location of a lodge in Philadelphia. Other organizations were formed there, including the [[St. George's Society]] in 1720, and the [[St. Andrew's Society]] in 1747. Even the [[United States Marine Corps]] was founded there on 10 November 1775 by [[Samuel Nicholas]], grandson of a member of the Tun Tavern Lodge. According to Henry Coil, a Freemason from Massachusetts, the Tun Tavern Lodge was never warranted nor issued a charter, being an \"immemorial rights lodge.\"<ref>Coil, Henry W. (1961). Article \"America, Introduction of Freemasonry into,\" pp. 31-33. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.</ref> However, the Librarian of the Masonic Library in Philadelphia believes that, simply because there is no existing evidence, there is no reason to assume that the Tun Tavern Lodge was never warranted since all of the other Lodges at the time had been, and that it must have been warranted prior to 1749 since the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania has in its archives the minute books for the Tun Tavern Lodge from 1749-1755.<ref>Barrat, Norris S. & Julius Sachse. ''Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, 1727-1907, As Shown by the Records of Lodge No. 2, F. & A.M. of Philadelphia.'' Philadelphia: New Era Printing Company, 1908. p. 3-4.</ref>\n\n====The First Provincial Grand Master====\nThe first official act of the Moderns' Grand Lodge regarding the American colonies was the creation of a Provincial Grand Master for [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]], naming one [[Daniel Coxe]], Esq., to that office. This deputation, issued on 5 June 1730, was made by the Grand Master, the [[Duke of Norfolk]], and was to remain in effect for two years from 24 June 1731 to 24 June 1733, at which time, according to the deputation, the members were empowered to elect a Provincial Grand Master. From a letter in the possession of the New York Historical Society dated 31 July 1730 at Trenton we know that Daniel Coxe was already in the colonies.<ref>Borneman, Henry S. ''Early Freemasonry in Pennsylvania''. Philadelphia: The Grand Lodge of Free & Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania, 1931. Facsimile of letter in Appendix D.</ref> Coxe returned to England to attend a meeting of the Grand Lodge in London on 29 January 1731 where he was toasted as the Provincial Grand Master \"of North America.\" Coxe eventually relocated in [[Burlington, New Jersey]], about 20 miles from Philadelphia, where he had been awarded a colonial judgeship.<ref>Coil, Henry W. (1961). Article \"America, Introduction of Freemasonry into,\" pp. 30-31. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.</ref>\n\nThere are no explicit records to show that Daniel Coxe ever organized a Provincial [[Grand Lodge]], nor to have erected any lodges, nor ever exercised his authority in any way as Provincial Grand Master prior to his death on 25 April 1739. In fact, his death, which was reported in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]], a member of [[#The Tun Tavern Lodge|The Tun Tavern Lodge]] in Philadelphia, does not even mention that Coxe was a Freemason, possibly indicating that Franklin and the other members of the Craft in Philadelphia were unaware of his affiliation.<ref>Coil, Henry W. (1961). Article \"Coxe, Daniel,\" pg. 156. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.</ref> However, the Masonic historian Dr. Wilhelm Begeman points out that, \"those who deny Coxe's activity must naturally assume the Provincial Grand Lodge established itself through its own power, which is much less probable than the legal action of Coxe... that his home was in Trenton, was no serious obstacle, for the London Grand Masters nearly all lived at a distance from London, Lord Kingston, for instance, in Ireland.\"<ref>Begemann, Wilhelm. ''Freimauerei in England''. Berlin: E.S. Mittler & Son, 1910, pp. 386-414.</ref> It should also be noted that an entry in \"Liber B,\" the oldest known record of a lodge in the Americas (the second record book, of St. John's Lodge, Philadelphia, from 1731 to 1738), lists William Allen as Grand Master on 24 June 1731. Coxe's deputation clearly allows for the election of a successor in perpetuity.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania|url=http://gwmemorial.org/glotm/glotm201105.php|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Provincial Grand Masters of Pennsylvania====\nAfter his election in 1731, William Allen appointed William Pringle, Deputy Grand Master, and Thomas Boude and [[Benjamin Franklin]], Wardens. Benjamin Franklin would become Provincial Grand Master in 1734\u2014the same year he published Anderson's Constitutions, the first Masonic book printed in America\u2014and again in 1749. The organization of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania was recorded in both \"Liber B\" and the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', which published the names of the sixteen Grand Masters who served from 1731 to 1755. William Allen was Provincial Grand Master eight times. No reports were sent from the Provincial Grand Lodge of Moderns to the Grand Lodge of England, nor were any requested; being independent it apparently had no need to do so.  Yet, the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania affiliated itself with the Grand Lodge of England in that it approved and adopted those Ritual changes made by the GLE after 1730.<ref name=Coil468/>\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Manson|first=Frederic|title=Gould's History of Freemasonry Throughout the World (Vol. 6)|year=1936|publisher=Scribner|pages=\"Freemasonry in Pennsylvania\"}}</ref>\n\n====Provincial Grand Masters at Boston====\nOn 30 April 1733, Henry Price of [[Boston]] was appointed Provincial Grand Master \"of [[New England]]\" by the [[Viscount Montagu]], Grand Master of the Moderns' Grand Lodge in London. Clearly, this appointment would not have included Pennsylvania, except for Price's repeated, but disputed,{{by whom|date=December 2010}} claims that the Grand Master had \"ordered him to extend Freemasonry over all North America.\" Price held this office until December 1736, when he was succeeded by [[Robert Tomlinson]], also of Boston, who held the office until his death in 1740. Tomlinson was succeeded by [[Thomas Oxnard]], who was deputized Provincial Grand Master \"for North America\" on 23 Sept. 1743. He remained in office until his death in 1754. Whether Price's office gave him jurisdiction over Pennsylvania Masonry has always been disputed, but the question, according to those who favor the supremacy of Massachusetts, became a moot point for a brief period with Oxnard's appointment over all of [[North America]]. Historians who argue in favor of Massachuestts' primacy over Pennsylvania also point to an appointment of Benjamin Franklin as Provincial Grand Master for Pennsylvania on 10 July 1749. They argue that Provincial Grand Masters had no authority to appoint other Provincial Grand Masters and Franklin's appointment was void since only grand lodges had authority to do so.<ref name=Coil468/> However, Daniel Coxe's deputation from the Grand Lodge of England did in fact provide the Freemasons in Pennsylvania to elect a Provincial Grand Master every two years in perpetuity.<ref>\"Deputation to Daniel Coxe, Esquire, to be Provincial Grand Master of the Provinces of New York, New Jersey, and Pensilvania [sic], in America.\" Full text on pp. 93-95 of Henry S. Borneman's ''Early Freemasonry in Pennsylvania.'' Philadelphia: The Grand Lodge of Free & Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania, 1931.</ref> Because of this we can assume that all successive Provincial Grand Masters of Pennsylvania were elected under the authority of this deputation.\n\n====The Demise of the Moderns in Pennsylvania====\nThe [[Freemasonry]] of the Moderns Grand Lodge and its daughter lodges in Pennsylvania was eclipsed during the latter half of the 18th century by the rise of the Ancients Grand Lodge and its subordinate lodges. The [[American Revolutionary War]] took a great toll on Pennsylvania Freemasonry, and especially the Moderns' lodges. Beginning before the War some of the Modern Lodges had switched allegiance to the Ancients, e.g. Lodge No. 4 of the Moderns.<ref>Barrat, Norris S. & Julius Sachse. ''Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, 1727-1907, As Shown by the Records of Lodge No. 2, F. & A.M. of Philadelphia.'' Philadelphia: New Era Printing company, 1908. pp. 10-43.</ref> By the end of the Revolution nearly all the lodges in Pennsylvania owed allegiance to the Ancients. It is impossible to determine precisely when the Moderns' Provincial Grand Lodge folded, but it was gone by 1785. The Masonic Hall, built by the Moderns in 1755 was sold, and the proceeds were placed in a charitable trust and became the \"Freemason's Fuel Fund.\"<ref name=Coil468/> Thus, we can say that the \"Modern\" line was grafted onto the \"Ancient.\"\n\n===The Rise of the Ancients===\n'''The Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania:'''  On 15 July 1761, the Ancient Grand Lodge of England issued a warrant for a Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, which appeared as Lodge No. 89 on the Grand Lodge roster. Three years before, the Ancient Grand Lodge had issued a warrant for Lodge No. 69 to a lodge in Philadelphia (later Lodge No. 2 of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania), which had been the first warrant issued to a lodge in North America by that Grand Lodge.<ref name=Coil468/> As noted above, in a process that began before the Revolutionary War, some Modern Lodges had defected to and were absorbed by the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge thus making the Ancients the dominant form of Freemasonry in Pennsylvania.\n\n===The Independent Grand Lodge is Formed===\n[[Image:Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Masonic Temple (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Masonic Temple]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1873), [[James H. Windrim]], architect.]]\nBy 1785, Pennsylvania Freemasonry was entirely Ancient, the Moderns having been fully absorbed into the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.<ref>Barrat, Norris S. & Julius Sachse. ''Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, 1727-1907, As Shown by the Records of Lodge No. 2 F. & A.M. of Philadelphia.'' Philadelphia: New Era Printing Company, 1908. pp. 10-43.</ref> On 25 September 1786, the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania declared itself to be independent of the mother [[Grand Lodge]] and closed itself permanently as a provincial grand lodge. The following day, 26 September, the representatives of 13 Ancient lodges met together and reformed the independent Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, headquartered in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. Though Pennsylvania Masonic ritual is entirely from the Ancients, and not an amalgamation of the two rituals, the Moderns did not simply cease to exist but were rather absorbed into Ancient Masonry and made to conform to their customs and usages.<ref>ibid.</ref> Since its inception, the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania has moved its headquarters from building to building over the last two centuries, and on one occasion even conducted their meetings in [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]].  The current [[Masonic Temple (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Masonic Temple]] in Philadelphia was completed in 1873 and has been the home of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania ever since.\n\n==Charitable Endeavors==\nThe Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania (and its subordinate Lodges) support five charitable entities that offer a range of services.\n\n===The Masonic Temple, Library, and Museum===\nThe headquarters of the Grand Lodge is in the [[Masonic Temple (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Masonic Temple]] at One North Broad Street, directly across from [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. Built in 1873, it is a national historic landmark renowned for its beauty, architectural mastery and historical significance. The Library contains one of the finest collections for the study of American history and Freemasonry, and the Museum displays more than 30,000 treasured artifacts.<ref>[http://www.pamasonictemple.org The Masonic Temple, Library, and Museum]</ref>\n\n===The Masonic Villages of Pennsylvania===\nSince its founding in 1894, the Masonic Home of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, now known as the Masonic Villages of Pennsylvania \n<ref name=\"masonicvillages.org\">[http://www.masonicvillages.org The Masonic Villages of Pennsylvania]</ref> has grown and expanded.\nThe 1400 acres of the Masonic Village at Elizabethtown Campus began as a working farm where the Residents participated in farming chores. Today the farming aspects have been reduced to a prize winning stable of Bulls and a wonderful apple, peach, and cherry orchard. The Elizabethtown campus offers charitable services ranging from a children's home and child care center, to 445 beds of Nursing Home services and 971 units of Retirement living consisting of apartments and cottages.\n\nComprising five continuing care retirement communities across Pennsylvania providing a wide range of care and services, the Masonic Villages\nare committed to caring for residents regardless of their sex, race, creed, Masonic affiliation or ability to pay. The communities extend quality healthcare and outreach services to numerous others through home and community-based services.<ref name=\"masonicvillages.org\"/>\n\n===The Masonic Children's Home===\nThe Masonic Children's Home is just that - a home for children who come from various socio-economic environments that do not provide the security and support necessary for healthy growth and development. The youth receive food, clothing, complete medical care, academic tutoring and opportunities to participate in worship and extracurricular activities of their choosing.<ref>[http://www.masonicchildrenshome.org The Masonic Children's Home]</ref>\n\n===The Pennsylvania Masonic Youth Foundation===\nThe Foundation offers leadership, education and mentoring programs and resources for youth throughout the Commonwealth, and provides numerous resources and opportunities for Masonic youth groups. It supports initiatives to keep children safe from violence, abuse and exploitation, and provides specialized training for adults who provide leadership to young people.<ref>[http://www.pmyf.org The Pennsylvania Masonic Youth Foundation]</ref>\n\n===The Masonic Charities Fund===\nThis special fund supports operations and equipment purchases for The Masonic Library and Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the restoration and preservation of the Masonic Temple. As needs present themselves, the fund supports scholarships and disaster relief across the globe, to Masonic or non-Masonic recipients.<ref>[http://www.masoniccharitiesfund.org The Masonic Charities Fund]</ref>\n\n==Grand Masters==\n\nThe current [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] is Thomas Gamon.<ref>[http://www.pamasons.org/grandmaster Grand Master information]</ref> In Pennsylvania, the Grand Master serves a two-year term. Notably, the regalia of the Grand Master of Pennsylvania is unlike that of any other Masonic Jurisdiction in the United States. The collar is made of velvet and contains no metal save for the bullion thread used to compose the stars. The apron is rounded, both at the base and on the flap, and has no excess ornamentation or fringe.<ref>[http://www.pamasons.org/grandmaster The Right Worshipful Grand Master]</ref>\nThe following men have been Grand Masters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Past Grand Masters|url=https://pamasons.org/pgm/|accessdate=31 December 2017|work=Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania|date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:FranklinByPeale.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin, a [[Founding Father of the United States]] who played a leading role in the [[American Revolution]], was an early Grand Master of Pennsylvania Freemasons.]]\n[[File:George Mifflin Dallas 1848.jpg|thumb|George M.

The [[Grand Lodge]] claims to be the oldest in the [[United States]], and the third oldest in the world after England (est. 1717) and Ireland (est. 1725), having been originally established as the [[Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania]] in 1731. This claim is disputed by both the [[Grand Lodge of Massachusetts]] and the [[Grand Lodge of Virginia]].\n\n==History==\n\n===The Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania===\n\nTwo English grand lodges erected lodges in [[Pennsylvania]] during the 18th century, the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] (known as the \"Moderns\"), established in [[London]] in 1717, and the [[Ancient Grand Lodge of England]] (known as the \"Antients\" or \"Ancients\"), established in London in 1751. The first of these, the Moderns' Grand Lodge, was first to establish lodges and provincial grand lodges in the American colonies. But by 1785, the Moderns and their lodges had ceased to exist in Pennsylvania, the last of their members having been absorbed by the lodges of the Ancients. The present day Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania descends primarily from the Ancients, with the Moderns having been grafted onto \"Ancient York Masonry.\"<ref name=Coil468>Coil, Henry W. (1961). Article \"Pennsylvania,\" pp. 468. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.</ref>\n\n====The Tun Tavern Lodge====\nThe earliest minute book of any [[Masonic lodge]] on the North American continent is that for [[Tun Tavern]] Lodge No. 3 (of the Moderns) in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>Barrat, Norris S. & Julius Sachse. ''Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, 1727-1907, As Shown by the Records of Lodge No. 2, F. & A.M. of Philadelphia.'' Philadelphia: New Era Printing Company, 1908. p. 3.</ref> The Tun Tavern was the first \"brew house\" in the city, being built in 1685, and was located on the waterfront at the corner of Water Street and Tun Alley. The extant records of the Lodge begin on 24 June 1731, but the lodge may have been older than that. It was reported by [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his ''Gazette'' for 8 December 1730, that there were \"several Lodges of Free Masons erected in this Province....\" The Tun Tavern, being a popular meeting place in [[Philadelphia]], was undoubtedly the first location of a lodge in Philadelphia. Other organizations were formed there, including the [[St. George's Society]] in 1720, and the [[St. Andrew's Society]] in 1747. Even the [[United States Marine Corps]] was founded there on 10 November 1775 by [[Samuel Nicholas]], grandson of a member of the Tun Tavern Lodge. According to Henry Coil, a Freemason from Massachusetts, the Tun Tavern Lodge was never warranted nor issued a charter, being an \"immemorial rights lodge.\"<ref>Coil, Henry W. (1961). Article \"America, Introduction of Freemasonry into,\" pp. 31-33. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.</ref> However, the Librarian of the Masonic Library in Philadelphia believes that, simply because there is no existing evidence, there is no reason to assume that the Tun Tavern Lodge was never warranted since all of the other Lodges at the time had been, and that it must have been warranted prior to 1749 since the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania has in its archives the minute books for the Tun Tavern Lodge from 1749-1755.<ref>Barrat, Norris S. & Julius Sachse. ''Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, 1727-1907, As Shown by the Records of Lodge No. 2, F. & A.M. of Philadelphia.'' Philadelphia: New Era Printing Company, 1908. p. 3-4.</ref>\n\n====The First Provincial Grand Master====\nThe first official act of the Moderns' Grand Lodge regarding the American colonies was the creation of a Provincial Grand Master for [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]], naming one [[Daniel Coxe]], Esq., to that office. This deputation, issued on 5 June 1730, was made by the Grand Master, the [[Duke of Norfolk]], and was to remain in effect for two years from 24 June 1731 to 24 June 1733, at which time, according to the deputation, the members were empowered to elect a Provincial Grand Master. From a letter in the possession of the New York Historical Society dated 31 July 1730 at Trenton we know that Daniel Coxe was already in the colonies.<ref>Borneman, Henry S. ''Early Freemasonry in Pennsylvania''. Philadelphia: The Grand Lodge of Free & Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania, 1931. Facsimile of letter in Appendix D.</ref> Coxe returned to England to attend a meeting of the Grand Lodge in London on 29 January 1731 where he was toasted as the Provincial Grand Master \"of North America.\" Coxe eventually relocated in [[Burlington, New Jersey]], about 20 miles from Philadelphia, where he had been awarded a colonial judgeship.<ref>Coil, Henry W. (1961). Article \"America, Introduction of Freemasonry into,\" pp. 30-31. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.</ref>\n\nThere are no explicit records to show that Daniel Coxe ever organized a Provincial [[Grand Lodge]], nor to have erected any lodges, nor ever exercised his authority in any way as Provincial Grand Master prior to his death on 25 April 1739. In fact, his death, which was reported in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]], a member of [[#The Tun Tavern Lodge|The Tun Tavern Lodge]] in Philadelphia, does not even mention that Coxe was a Freemason, possibly indicating that Franklin and the other members of the Craft in Philadelphia were unaware of his affiliation.<ref>Coil, Henry W. (1961). Article \"Coxe, Daniel,\" pg. 156. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.</ref> However, the Masonic historian Dr. Wilhelm Begeman points out that, \"those who deny Coxe's activity must naturally assume the Provincial Grand Lodge established itself through its own power, which is much less probable than the legal action of Coxe... that his home was in Trenton, was no serious obstacle, for the London Grand Masters nearly all lived at a distance from London, Lord Kingston, for instance, in Ireland.\"<ref>Begemann, Wilhelm. ''Freimauerei in England''. Berlin: E.S. Mittler & Son, 1910, pp. 386-414.</ref> It should also be noted that an entry in \"Liber B,\" the oldest known record of a lodge in the Americas (the second record book, of St. John's Lodge, Philadelphia, from 1731 to 1738), lists William Allen as Grand Master on 24 June 1731. Coxe's deputation clearly allows for the election of a successor in perpetuity.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania|url=http://gwmemorial.org/glotm/glotm201105.php|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Provincial Grand Masters of Pennsylvania====\nAfter his election in 1731, William Allen appointed William Pringle, Deputy Grand Master, and Thomas Boude and [[Benjamin Franklin]], Wardens. Benjamin Franklin would become Provincial Grand Master in 1734\u2014the same year he published Anderson's Constitutions, the first Masonic book printed in America\u2014and again in 1749. The organization of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania was recorded in both \"Liber B\" and the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', which published the names of the sixteen Grand Masters who served from 1731 to 1755. William Allen was Provincial Grand Master eight times. No reports were sent from the Provincial Grand Lodge of Moderns to the Grand Lodge of England, nor were any requested; being independent it apparently had no need to do so.  Yet, the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania affiliated itself with the Grand Lodge of England in that it approved and adopted those Ritual changes made by the GLE after 1730.<ref name=Coil468/>\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Manson|first=Frederic|title=Gould's History of Freemasonry Throughout the World (Vol. 6)|year=1936|publisher=Scribner|pages=\"Freemasonry in Pennsylvania\"}}</ref>\n\n====Provincial Grand Masters at Boston====\nOn 30 April 1733, Henry Price of [[Boston]] was appointed Provincial Grand Master \"of [[New England]]\" by the [[Viscount Montagu]], Grand Master of the Moderns' Grand Lodge in London. Clearly, this appointment would not have included Pennsylvania, except for Price's repeated, but disputed,{{by whom|date=December 2010}} claims that the Grand Master had \"ordered him to extend Freemasonry over all North America.\" Price held this office until December 1736, when he was succeeded by [[Robert Tomlinson]], also of Boston, who held the office until his death in 1740. Tomlinson was succeeded by [[Thomas Oxnard]], who was deputized Provincial Grand Master \"for North America\" on 23 Sept. 1743. He remained in office until his death in 1754. Whether Price's office gave him jurisdiction over Pennsylvania Masonry has always been disputed, but the question, according to those who favor the supremacy of Massachusetts, became a moot point for a brief period with Oxnard's appointment over all of [[North America]]. Historians who argue in favor of Massachuestts' primacy over Pennsylvania also point to an appointment of Benjamin Franklin as Provincial Grand Master for Pennsylvania on 10 July 1749. They argue that Provincial Grand Masters had no authority to appoint other Provincial Grand Masters and Franklin's appointment was void since only grand lodges had authority to do so.<ref name=Coil468/> However, Daniel Coxe's deputation from the Grand Lodge of England did in fact provide the Freemasons in Pennsylvania to elect a Provincial Grand Master every two years in perpetuity.<ref>\"Deputation to Daniel Coxe, Esquire, to be Provincial Grand Master of the Provinces of New York, New Jersey, and Pensilvania [sic], in America.\" Full text on pp. 93-95 of Henry S. Borneman's ''Early Freemasonry in Pennsylvania.'' Philadelphia: The Grand Lodge of Free & Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania, 1931.</ref> Because of this we can assume that all successive Provincial Grand Masters of Pennsylvania were elected under the authority of this deputation.\n\n====The Demise of the Moderns in Pennsylvania====\nThe [[Freemasonry]] of the Moderns Grand Lodge and its daughter lodges in Pennsylvania was eclipsed during the latter half of the 18th century by the rise of the Ancients Grand Lodge and its subordinate lodges. The [[American Revolutionary War]] took a great toll on Pennsylvania Freemasonry, and especially the Moderns' lodges. Beginning before the War some of the Modern Lodges had switched allegiance to the Ancients, e.g. Lodge No. 4 of the Moderns.<ref>Barrat, Norris S. & Julius Sachse. ''Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, 1727-1907, As Shown by the Records of Lodge No. 2, F. & A.M. of Philadelphia.'' Philadelphia: New Era Printing company, 1908. pp. 10-43.</ref> By the end of the Revolution nearly all the lodges in Pennsylvania owed allegiance to the Ancients. It is impossible to determine precisely when the Moderns' Provincial Grand Lodge folded, but it was gone by 1785. The Masonic Hall, built by the Moderns in 1755 was sold, and the proceeds were placed in a charitable trust and became the \"Freemason's Fuel Fund.\"<ref name=Coil468/> Thus, we can say that the \"Modern\" line was grafted onto the \"Ancient.\"\n\n===The Rise of the Ancients===\n'''The Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania:'''  On 15 July 1761, the Ancient Grand Lodge of England issued a warrant for a Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, which appeared as Lodge No. 89 on the Grand Lodge roster. Three years before, the Ancient Grand Lodge had issued a warrant for Lodge No. 69 to a lodge in Philadelphia (later Lodge No. 2 of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania), which had been the first warrant issued to a lodge in North America by that Grand Lodge.<ref name=Coil468/> As noted above, in a process that began before the Revolutionary War, some Modern Lodges had defected to and were absorbed by the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge thus making the Ancients the dominant form of Freemasonry in Pennsylvania.\n\n===The Independent Grand Lodge is Formed===\n[[Image:Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Masonic Temple (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Masonic Temple]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1873), [[James H. Windrim]], architect.]]\nBy 1785, Pennsylvania Freemasonry was entirely Ancient, the Moderns having been fully absorbed into the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.<ref>Barrat, Norris S. & Julius Sachse. ''Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, 1727-1907, As Shown by the Records of Lodge No. 2 F. & A.M. of Philadelphia.'' Philadelphia: New Era Printing Company, 1908. pp. 10-43.</ref> On 25 September 1786, the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania declared itself to be independent of the mother [[Grand Lodge]] and closed itself permanently as a provincial grand lodge. The following day, 26 September, the representatives of 13 Ancient lodges met together and reformed the independent Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, headquartered in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. Though Pennsylvania Masonic ritual is entirely from the Ancients, and not an amalgamation of the two rituals, the Moderns did not simply cease to exist but were rather absorbed into Ancient Masonry and made to conform to their customs and usages.<ref>ibid.</ref> Since its inception, the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania has moved its headquarters from building to building over the last two centuries, and on one occasion even conducted their meetings in [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]].  The current [[Masonic Temple (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Masonic Temple]] in Philadelphia was completed in 1873 and has been the home of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania ever since.\n\n==Charitable Endeavors==\nThe Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania (and its subordinate Lodges) support five charitable entities that offer a range of services.\n\n===The Masonic Temple, Library, and Museum===\nThe headquarters of the Grand Lodge is in the [[Masonic Temple (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Masonic Temple]] at One North Broad Street, directly across from [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. Built in 1873, it is a national historic landmark renowned for its beauty, architectural mastery and historical significance. The Library contains one of the finest collections for the study of American history and Freemasonry, and the Museum displays more than 30,000 treasured artifacts.<ref>[http://www.pamasonictemple.org The Masonic Temple, Library, and Museum]</ref>\n\n===The Masonic Villages of Pennsylvania===\nSince its founding in 1894, the Masonic Home of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, now known as the Masonic Villages of Pennsylvania \n<ref name=\"masonicvillages.org\">[http://www.masonicvillages.org The Masonic Villages of Pennsylvania]</ref> has grown and expanded.\nThe 1400 acres of the Masonic Village at Elizabethtown Campus began as a working farm where the Residents participated in farming chores. Today the farming aspects have been reduced to a prize winning stable of Bulls and a wonderful apple, peach, and cherry orchard. The Elizabethtown campus offers charitable services ranging from a children's home and child care center, to 445 beds of Nursing Home services and 971 units of Retirement living consisting of apartments and cottages.\n\nComprising five continuing care retirement communities across Pennsylvania providing a wide range of care and services, the Masonic Villages\nare committed to caring for residents regardless of their sex, race, creed, Masonic affiliation or ability to pay. The communities extend quality healthcare and outreach services to numerous others through home and community-based services.<ref name=\"masonicvillages.org\"/>\n\n===The Masonic Children's Home===\nThe Masonic Children's Home is just that - a home for children who come from various socio-economic environments that do not provide the security and support necessary for healthy growth and development. The youth receive food, clothing, complete medical care, academic tutoring and opportunities to participate in worship and extracurricular activities of their choosing.<ref>[http://www.masonicchildrenshome.org The Masonic Children's Home]</ref>\n\n===The Pennsylvania Masonic Youth Foundation===\nThe Foundation offers leadership, education and mentoring programs and resources for youth throughout the Commonwealth, and provides numerous resources and opportunities for Masonic youth groups. It supports initiatives to keep children safe from violence, abuse and exploitation, and provides specialized training for adults who provide leadership to young people.<ref>[http://www.pmyf.org The Pennsylvania Masonic Youth Foundation]</ref>\n\n===The Masonic Charities Fund===\nThis special fund supports operations and equipment purchases for The Masonic Library and Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the restoration and preservation of the Masonic Temple. As needs present themselves, the fund supports scholarships and disaster relief across the globe, to Masonic or non-Masonic recipients.<ref>[http://www.masoniccharitiesfund.org The Masonic Charities Fund]</ref>\n\n==Grand Masters==\n\nThe current [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] is Thomas Gamon.<ref>[http://www.pamasons.org/grandmaster Grand Master information]</ref> In Pennsylvania, the Grand Master serves a two-year term. Notably, the regalia of the Grand Master of Pennsylvania is unlike that of any other Masonic Jurisdiction in the United States. The collar is made of velvet and contains no metal save for the bullion thread used to compose the stars. The apron is rounded, both at the base and on the flap, and has no excess ornamentation or fringe.<ref>[http://www.pamasons.org/grandmaster The Right Worshipful Grand Master]</ref>\nThe following men have been Grand Masters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Past Grand Masters|url=https://pamasons.org/pgm/|accessdate=31 December 2017|work=Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania|date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:FranklinByPeale.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin, a [[Founding Father of the United States]] who played a leading role in the [[American Revolution]], was an early Grand Master of Pennsylvania Freemasons.]]\n[[File:George Mifflin Dallas 1848.jpg|thumb|George M.

Runners are made of iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails, as they develop [[Forces on sails|propulsive lift]]. Given their low forward resistance, iceboats can sail up to ten times the speed of the true wind.

The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the ''[[Parzival]]'' of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] and its sequel ''[[Lohengrin]]'', itself inspired by the epic of ''[[Garin le Loherain]]''. It is part of the [[Knight of the Swan]] legend.\n\nThe opera has inspired other works of art. King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] named his castle [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig's patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to compose, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring of the Nibelung]]''.\n\nThe most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the [[Bridal Chorus]], better known as \"Here Comes the Bride\", often played as a processional at weddings in the West. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces.\n\n== Literary background ==\nThe literary figure of [[Lohengrin]] first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem [[Parzival]] of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. The Grail Knight Lohengrin, son of the [[Grail King]] Parzival, is sent to the duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to defend her. His protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name. If she violates this requirement, he will be forced to leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/germanica/Chronologie/13Jh/Wolfram/wol_pa16.html|title=Text from Wolfram von Eschenbach: Parzival, book XVI|website=bibliotheca Augustana|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref> Wagner took up these characters and set the \"forbidden question\" theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the godly and the mundane, and between [[Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Age]] [[Christendom]] and [[Germanic paganism]]. Wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of [[Greek tragedy]] into the plot. He wrote the following in ''Mitteilungen an meine Freunde'' about his Lohengrin plans:<blockquote>Who doesn't know \"[[Zeus]] and [[Semele]]\"? The god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form. The lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form, and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known. Zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self. He suffers in this awareness, suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love. He will seal his own doom when the gleam of his godly form destroys his lover. Is the man who craves for God not destroyed?<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |page=334 |language=English |translator-first1=William Ashton |translator-last1=Ellis |chapter=A Communication To My Friends}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Composition ==\n''Lohengrin'' was written and composed between 1845-1848 when Wagner worked as Kappelmeister at the Royal Dresden court. The opera's genesis, however, starts some years earlier when Wagner was living and working in Paris. By late 1841, Wagner had conceived a five-act historical opera based on the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty entitled ''Die Sarazein'' (The Saracen Woman) <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Projected or unfinished dramatic works |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=321 |chapter=The Music}}</ref> and, although he lavished on it all the trappings of Grand Opera, his attention was soon distracted by a [[Volksbuch]] that he obtained through his friendship with the philologist [[Das Judenthum in der Musik#Wagner and the Jews|Samuel Lehrs]].

In the summer of 1845 Wagner with his wife Minna planned their annual hydrotherapy visit to Marienbad. Putting his work as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court out of his mind, Wagner's intention was to abandon himself to a life of the utmost leisure, and he had chosen his summer reading with care: the poems of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the anonymous epic of Lohengrin with an introduction by [[Joseph von G\u00f6rres]]. His plan to lie beside a brook communing with Titurel and Parzival didn\u2019t last long and the longing to create was overpowering:\n\n<blockquote>Lohengrin stood suddenly revealed before me in full armour at the centre of a comprehensive dramatic adaptation of the whole material. ... I struggled manfully against the temptation to put down the plan on paper. But I was fooling myself: no sooner had I stepped into the noonday bath than I was seized by such desire to write Lohengrin that, incapable of lingering in the bath for the prescribed hour, I leapt out after only a few minutes, scarcely took the time to clothe myself again properly, and ran like a madman to my quarters to put what was obsessing me on paper. This went on for several days, until the entire dramatic plan for Lohengrin had been set down in full detail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Whittall |editor1-first=Mary |title=My Life |date=1992 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-80481-6 |page=303 |language=English |translator-first1=Andrew |translator-last1=Gray |chapter=Part Two: 1842-50}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 3rd August 1845 he had worked out the prose draft. Wagner, with his head in a whirl, wrote to his brother, Albert, the following day, 4th August 1845:\n\n<blockquote>...it was in this frame of mind yesterday that I finished writing out a very full & detailed scenario for Lohengrin; I am delighted with the result, indeed I freely admit that it fills me with a feeling of proud contentment. \u2026 the more familiar I have become with my new subject  & the more profoundly I have grasped its central idea, the more it has dawned upon me how rich & luxurious the seed of this new idea is, a seed which has grown into so full & burgeoning a flower that I feel happy indeed. ...In creating this work, my powers of invention & sense of formal structure have played their biggest part to date: the medieval poem which has preserved this highly poetical legend contains the most inadequate & pedestrian account to have come down to us, and I feel very fortunate to have satisfied my desire to rescue what by now is an almost unrecognizable legend from the rubble & decay to which the medieval poet has reduced the poem as a result of his inferior & prosaic treatment of it, & to have restored it to its rich & highly poetical potential by dint of my own inventiveness & reworking of it. - But quite apart from all this, how felicitous a libretto it has turned out to be! Effective, attractive, impressive & affecting in all its parts! - Johanna]'s role in it (Albert's daughter - see illustration below) - which is very important & in point of fact the principal role in the work - is bound to turn out the most charming & most moving in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Coterminously, Wagner began work on a second-draft of the poem, beginning with Act III. The complete draft of Act III was completed before the second-draft of Acts I and II. This has sometime led to the erroneous conclusion that the entire work was completed from the end to the front. On 9th September 1846 Wagner began to elaborate the instrumental and choral parts which along with the Prelude was completed on 29 August 1847. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Operas |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=284 |chapter=The Music}}</ref>\n\nNumerous changes to the poem, particularly Act III, took place during work on the second-draft. At this time Wagner was still trying to clarify the precise nature of the tragedy, and the extent to which he needed to spell out the mechanics of the tragedy to the audience. On 30 May 1846 Wagner wrote to the journalist [[Hermann Franck]] regarding the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Wagner uses the letter firstly to argue in favour of his version and secondly to expand upon the more general mythical structure underpinning the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa - a theme he would publicly develop in his 1851 autobiographical essay A Communication To My Friends.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |pages=333-334 |language=English |translator-first1=William Ashton |translator-last1=Ellis |chapter=A Communication To My Friends}}</ref> Elsa's punishment, Wagner argues, cannot be chastisement or death but that her separation from Lohengrin: 'this idea of separation- which, if it were left out, would require a total transformation of the subject and probably allow no more than its most superficial externals to be retained'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

To this end, Wagner decided not to alter Act I or II but to write new lines in Act III:\n\nO Elsa! Was hast du mir angethan?<br>\nAls meine Augen dich zuerst ersah'n,<br>\nzu dir f\u00fchlt' ich in Liebe mich entbrannt,<br>\n(Wagner wrote five additional lines here but they were rejected in the final draft). \n\nLater, in the same Act, when Elsa calls on Lohengrin to punish her, the latter replies:\n\nNur eine Strafe giebt's f\u00fcr dein Vergeh'n<br>\nach, mich wie dich trifft ihre herbe Pein!<br>\nGetrennt, geschieden sollen wir uns seh'n<br>\ndiess muss die Strafe, diess die S\u00fchne sein!<br>\n\nWagner asks Franck if he should explicitly mention the specific rule associated with the Grail which, although not expressly forbidding the Grail knights from committing such excesses, nevertheless, discourages them from acting in this way. Wagner's opinion is that it should be sufficient for the audience to deduce the Grail's advice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

The second complete draft of Act II was started on 18th June and complete on 2nd August 1847.

The composition is not divided into individual numbers but played from scene to scene without any interruption. This style of composition contrasts with the conventional [[number opera]], which is divided into [[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, and [[Choir|choral sections]]. Nevertheless, ''Lohengrin'' still contains lengthy performances\u2014for example, Elsa's \"Alone in dark days\" and Lohengrin's Grail aria\u2014which harken back to the classical solo aria form.\n\nWagner made extensive use of [[Leitmotif|leitmotifs]] in his composition. Examples include the Grail motif first revealed in the prelude and the \"question\" motif first sung by Lohengrin to Elsa in Act I. These motifs allowed Wagner to precisely narrate the inner thoughts of the characters on stage, even without speech.\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe first production of ''Lohengrin'' was in [[Weimar]], Germany, on 28 August 1850 at the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Staatskapelle Weimar]] under the direction of [[Franz Liszt]], a close friend and early supporter of Wagner. Liszt chose the date in honour of Weimar's most famous citizen, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who was born on 28 August 1749.<ref>''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed., 1954</ref> Despite the inadequacies of the lead tenor [[Karl Beck (tenor)|Karl Beck]],<ref>Wagner had written the act 3 tenor monologue ''In fernem Land'' (the \"Grail Narration\") in two parts, however, he asked Liszt to cut the second part from the premiere performance, as he felt Karl Beck could not do it justice and it would result in an anticlimax. That unfortunate circumstance established the tradition of performing only the first part of the Narration.(see [http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf Peter Bassett, \"An Introduction to Wagner's ''Lohengrin'': A paper given to the Patrons and Friends of Opera Australia\", Sydney 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410080312/http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf |date=2013-04-10 }}) In fact, the first time the second part was ever sung at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] was by [[Franz V\u00f6lker]] during the lavish 1936 production, which [[Adolf Hitler]] personally ordered and took a close interest in, to demonstrate what a connoisseur of Wagner he was.

Although he conducted various extracts in concert in Zurich, London, Paris and Brussels, it was not until 1861 in Vienna that he was able to attend a full performance.<ref>Cesare Gertonani, writing in Teatro alla Scala programme for Lohengrin, December 2012, p.90</ref>\n\nThe opera's first performance outside German-speaking lands was in [[Riga]] on 5 February 1855.

A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noble woman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.\n\n===Act 1===\n[[File:Lohengrin - Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.png|thumb|upright|Illustration from the London premi\u00e8re]]\nKing [[Henry the Fowler]] has arrived in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], where he has assembled the German tribes in order to expel the marauding [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] from his dominions. He also needs to settle a dispute involving the disappearance of the child-Duke Gottfried of Brabant. The Duke's guardian, Count Friedrich von Telramund, has accused the Duke's older sister, Elsa, of murdering her brother in order to become Duchess of Brabant. Telramund calls upon the King to punish Elsa and to make him the new Duke of Brabant.\n\nThe King calls for Elsa to answer Telramund's accusation. Elsa does not answer the King's inquiries, only lamenting her brother's fate. The King declares that he cannot resolve the matter and will leave it to God's judgment through [[Trial by combat|ordeal by combat]]. Telramund, a strong and seasoned warrior, agrees enthusiastically. When the King asks Elsa who shall be her champion, Elsa describes a knight she has beheld in her dreams (Narrative: \"Alone in dark days\").\n\nTwice the Herald calls for a champion to step forward, but gets no response. Elsa kneels and prays that God may send her champion to her. A boat drawn by a swan appears on the river and in it stands a knight in shining armour. He disembarks, dismisses the swan, respectfully greets the king, and asks Elsa if she will have him as her champion and marry him. Elsa kneels in front of him and places her honour in his keeping. He asks only one thing in return for his service: Elsa must never ask him his name or where he has come from. Elsa agrees to this.\n\nTelramund's supporters advise him to withdraw because he cannot prevail against the Knight's powers, but he proudly refuses. The chorus prays to God (\"Herr und Gott\") for victory for the one whose cause is just. Ortrud, Telramund's wife, does not join the prayer, but privately expresses confidence that Telramund will win. The combat commences. The unknown Knight defeats Telramund but spares his life. Taking Elsa by the hand, he declares her innocent. The crowd exits, cheering and celebrating.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Johanna Jachmann-Wagner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johanna Jachmann-Wagner]] as Ortrud, ca. 1860]]\n''Night in the courtyard outside the cathedral''\n\nTelramund and Ortrud, [[Deportation|banished]] from court, listen unhappily to the distant party-music. Ortrud reveals that she is a pagan witch (daughter of [[Radbod, King of the Frisians|Radbod]] Duke of [[Frisia]]), and tries to revive Telramund's courage, assuring him that her people (and he) are destined to rule the kingdom again. She plots to induce Elsa to violate the mysterious knight's only condition.\n\nWhen Elsa appears on the balcony before dawn, she hears Ortrud lamenting and pities her. As Elsa descends to open the castle door, Ortrud prays to her pagan gods, [[Odin|Wodan]] and [[Freya|Freia]], for malice, guile, and cunning, in order to deceive Elsa and restore pagan rule to the region. Ortrud warns Elsa that since she knows nothing about her rescuer, he could leave at any time as suddenly as he came, but Elsa is sure of the Knight's virtues. The two women go into the castle. Left alone outside, Telramund vows to bring about the Knight's downfall.\n\nThe sun rises and the people assemble. The Herald announces that Telramund is now banished, and that anyone who follows Telramund shall be considered an [[outlaw]] by the law of the land. In addition, he announces that the King has offered to make the unnamed knight the Duke of Brabant; however, the Knight has declined the title, and prefers to be known only as \"[[Protectorate|Protector]] of Brabant\".<ref>The title ''F\u00fchrer'' von Brabant is often altered to ''Sch\u00fctzer'' in performances since 1945, because the former title has acquired meanings unforeseen by Wagner. ''F\u00fchrer'' formerly meant 'Leader' or 'Guide'.</ref> The Herald further announces that the Knight will lead the people to glorious new conquests, and will celebrate the marriage of himself and Elsa. In the back of the crowd, four noblemen quietly express misgivings to each other because the Knight has rescinded their privileges and is calling them to arms. Telramund secretly draws the four noblemen aside and assures them that he will regain his position and stop the Knight, by accusing him of sorcery.\n\nAs Elsa and her attendants are about to enter the church, Ortrud rushes to the front of the procession and challenges Elsa to explain who the Knight is and why anyone should follow him. Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the King with the Knight. Elsa tells both of them that Ortrud was interrupting the ceremony. The King tells Ortrud to step aside, then leads Elsa and the Knight toward the church. Just as they are about to enter the church, Telramund enters. He claims that his defeat in combat was invalid because the Knight did not give his name (trial by combat traditionally being open only to established citizens), then accuses the Knight of sorcery. He demands that the Knight must reveal his name; otherwise the King should rule the trial by combat invalid. The Knight refuses to reveal his identity and claims that only one person in the world has the right to make him do so: his beloved Elsa, and she has pledged not to exercise that right. Elsa, though visibly shaken and uncertain, assures him of her confidence. King Henry refuses Telramund's questions, and the nobles of Brabant and Saxony praise and honor the Knight. Elsa falls back into the crowd where Ortrud and Telramund try to intimidate her, but the Knight forces them both to leave the ceremony, and consoles Elsa. Elsa takes one last look at the banished Ortrud, then enters the church with the wedding procession.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Omaraaslohengrin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph O'Mara]] in the title role, 1894\u20131895]]\n''Scene 1: The bridal chamber''\n\nElsa and her new husband are ushered in with the well-known [[Bridal Chorus|bridal chorus]], and they express their love for each other. Ortrud's words, however, have made an impression on Elsa; she laments that her name sounds so sweet on her husband's lips but she cannot utter his name. She asks him to tell her his name when no one else is around, but at all instances he refuses. Finally, despite his warnings, she asks the Knight the fatal questions. Before the Knight can answer, Telramund and his four recruits rush into the room in order to attack him. The Knight defeats and kills Telramund. Then, he sorrowfully turns to Elsa and asks her to follow him to the King, to whom he will now reveal his secrets.\n\n''Scene 2: On the banks of the Scheldt (as in Act 1)''\n\nThe troops arrive equipped for war. Telramund's corpse is brought in. Elsa comes forward, then the Knight. He tells the King that Elsa has broken her promise, and discloses his identity (\"In fernem Land\") by recounting the story of the [[Holy Grail]] and of [[Monsalvat]]. He reveals himself as Lohengrin, Knight of the Grail and son of King [[Parsifal]], sent to protect an unjustly accused woman. The laws of the Holy Grail say that Knights of the Grail must remain anonymous. If their identity is revealed, they must return home.\n\nAs Lohengrin sadly bids farewell to Elsa, the swan-boat reappears. Lohengrin tells Elsa that if she had kept her promise, she could have recovered her lost brother, and gives her his sword, horn and ring, for he is to become the future leader of Brabant. As Lohengrin tries to get in the boat, Ortrud appears. She tells Elsa that the swan is actually Gottfried, Elsa's brother, whom she cursed to become a swan. The people consider Ortrud guilty of witchcraft. Lohengrin prays and the swan turns back into young Gottfried. Lohengrin declares him the Duke of Brabant. Ortrud sinks as she sees her plans thwarted.\n\nA dove descends from heaven and, taking the place of the swan at the head of the boat, leads Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. Elsa is stricken with grief and falls to the ground dead.<ref>Plot taken from ''The Opera Goer's Complete Guide'' by Leo Melitz, 1921 version.</ref>\n\n==Notable arias and excerpts==\n*Act 1\n**[[Prelude (music)|Prelude]]\n**\"{{Lang|de|Einsam in tr\u00fcben Tage|italic=no}}\" (Elsa's Narrative)\n**Scene \"{{Lang|de|Wenn ich im Kampfe f\u00fcr dich siege|italic=no}}\"\n* Act 2\n**\"{{Lang|de|Durch dich musst' ich verlieren|italic=no}}\" (Telramund)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Euch l\u00fcften, die mein Klagen|italic=no}}\" (Elsa)\n**Scene 4 opening, \"Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral\"\n* Act 3\n**Prelude\n**[[Bridal Chorus]] \"{{Lang|de|Treulich gef\u00fchrt|italic=no}}\"\n**\"{{Lang|de|Das s\u00fcsse Lied verhallt|italic=no}}\" (Love duet)\n**\"{{Lang|de|H\u00f6chstes Vertrau'n|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Declaration to Elsa)\n**Entry of King Henry\n**\"{{Lang|de|In fernem Land|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Narration)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Mein lieber Schwan...

The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the ''[[Parzival]]'' of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] and its sequel ''[[Lohengrin]]'', itself inspired by the epic of ''[[Garin le Loherain]]''. It is part of the [[Knight of the Swan]] legend.\n\nThe opera has inspired other works of art. King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] named his castle [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig's patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to compose, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring of the Nibelung]]''.\n\nThe most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the [[Bridal Chorus]], better known as \"Here Comes the Bride\", often played as a processional at weddings in the West. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces.\n\n== Literary background ==\nThe literary figure of [[Lohengrin]] first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem [[Parzival]] of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. The Grail Knight Lohengrin, son of the [[Grail King]] Parzival, is sent to the duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to defend her. His protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name. If she violates this requirement, he will be forced to leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/germanica/Chronologie/13Jh/Wolfram/wol_pa16.html|title=Text from Wolfram von Eschenbach: Parzival, book XVI|website=bibliotheca Augustana|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref> Wagner took up these characters and set the \"forbidden question\" theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the godly and the mundane, and between [[Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Age]] [[Christendom]] and [[Germanic paganism]]. Wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of [[Greek tragedy]] into the plot. He wrote the following in ''Mitteilungen an meine Freunde'' about his Lohengrin plans:<blockquote>Who doesn't know \"[[Zeus]] and [[Semele]]\"? The god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form. The lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form, and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known. Zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self. He suffers in this awareness, suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love. He will seal his own doom when the gleam of his godly form destroys his lover. Is the man who craves for God not destroyed?<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |page=334 |language=English Tr.

The opera's genesis, however, starts some years earlier when Wagner was living and working in Paris. By late 1841, Wagner had conceived a five-act historical opera based on the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty entitled ''Die Sarazein'' (The Saracen Woman) <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Projected or unfinished dramatic works |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=321 |chapter=The Music}}</ref> and, although he lavished on it all the trappings of Grand Opera, his attention was soon distracted by a [[Volksbuch]] that he obtained through his friendship with the philologist [[Das Judenthum in der Musik#Wagner and the Jews|Samuel Lehrs]].

Lucas]]'s critical study of the \"Wartburg war\" but also included a piece of criticism about the poem ''Lohengrin'', together with a lengthy narrative of the rambling epic's principal content.

The \"Romantic operas\" and the turn to myth}}</ref> It would be nearly four years before Wagner's image of Lohengrin would again manifest itself to his creative imagination.\n\nWriting retrospectively in his compulsively readable 1865 biography (even if its royal patronage diminishes its reliability), Wagner tells the story of how ''Lohengrin'''s libretto's was written. In the summer of 1845 Wagner with his wife Minna planned their annual hydrotherapy visit to Marienbad. Putting his work as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court out of his mind, Wagner's intention was to abandon himself to a life of the utmost leisure, and he had chosen his summer reading with care: the poems of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the anonymous epic of Lohengrin with an introduction by [[Joseph von G\u00f6rres]]. His plan to lie beside a brook communing with Titurel and Parzival didn\u2019t last long and the longing to create was overpowering:\n\n<blockquote>Lohengrin stood suddenly revealed before me in full armour at the centre of a comprehensive dramatic adaptation of the whole material. ... I struggled manfully against the temptation to put down the plan on paper. But I was fooling myself: no sooner had I stepped into the noonday bath than I was seized by such desire to write Lohengrin that, incapable of lingering in the bath for the prescribed hour, I leapt out after only a few minutes, scarcely took the time to clothe myself again properly, and ran like a madman to my quarters to put what was obsessing me on paper. This went on for several days, until the entire dramatic plan for Lohengrin had been set down in full detail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Whittall |editor1-first=Mary |title=My Life |date=1992 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-80481-6 |page=303 |language=English Tr. Andrew Gray |chapter=Part Two: 1842-50}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 3rd August 1845 he had worked out the prose draft. Wagner, with his head in a whirl, wrote to his brother, Albert, the following day, 4th August 1845:\n\n<blockquote>...it was in this frame of mind yesterday that I finished writing out a very full & detailed scenario for Lohengrin; I am delighted with the result, indeed I freely admit that it fills me with a feeling of proud contentment. \u2026 the more familiar I have become with my new subject  & the more profoundly I have grasped its central idea, the more it has dawned upon me how rich & luxurious the seed of this new idea is, a seed which has grown into so full & burgeoning a flower that I feel happy indeed. ...In creating this work, my powers of invention & sense of formal structure have played their biggest part to date: the medieval poem which has preserved this highly poetical legend contains the most inadequate & pedestrian account to have come down to us, and I feel very fortunate to have satisfied my desire to rescue what by now is an almost unrecognizable legend from the rubble & decay to which the medieval poet has reduced the poem as a result of his inferior & prosaic treatment of it, & to have restored it to its rich & highly poetical potential by dint of my own inventiveness & reworking of it. - But quite apart from all this, how felicitous a libretto it has turned out to be! Effective, attractive, impressive & affecting in all its parts! - Johanna]'s role in it (Albert's daughter - see illustration below) - which is very important & in point of fact the principal role in the work - is bound to turn out the most charming & most moving in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd |location=London |page=124 |language=English Tr. Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 70}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween May and June 1846, Wagner made a through-composed draft for the whole work that consisted of only two staves: one for the voice, the other just indicating the harmonies. Coterminously, Wagner began work on a second-draft of the poem, beginning with Act III. The complete draft of Act III was completed before the second-draft of Acts I and II. This has sometime led to the erroneous conclusion that the entire work was completed from the end to the front. On 9th September 1846 Wagner began to elaborate the instrumental and choral parts which along with the Prelude was completed on 29 August 1847. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Operas |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=284 |chapter=The Music}}</ref>\n\nNumerous changes to the poem, particularly Act III, took place during work on the second-draft. At this time Wagner was still trying to clarify the precise nature of the tragedy, and the extent to which he needed to spell out the mechanics of the tragedy to the audience. On 30 May 1846 Wagner wrote to the journalist [[Hermann Franck]] regarding the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd |location=London |pages=129-132 |language=English Tr. Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> It is apparent from the letter that Wagner and Franck had been discussing Lohengrin for some time, and Wagner refers back to an earlier argument about the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa, and in particular whether Elsa's punishment of separation from Lohengrin at the end of the opera is justifiable. Wagner uses the letter firstly to argue in favour of his version and secondly to expand upon the more general mythical structure underpinning the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa - a theme he would publicly develop in his 1851 autobiographical essay A Communication To My Friends.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |pages=333-334 |language=English Tr. William Ashton Ellis |chapter=A Communication To My Friends}}</ref> Elsa's punishment, Wagner argues, cannot be chastisement or death but that her separation from Lohengrin: 'this idea of separation- which, if it were left out, would require a total transformation of the subject and probably allow no more than its most superficial externals to be retained'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd |location=London |pages=129 |language=English Tr.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> Wagner confesses that Franck's concerns have forced him to look objectively at the poem and to consider ways of making Lohengrin's involvement in the tragic outcome clearer than had previously been the case. To this end, Wagner decided not to alter Act I or II but to write new lines in Act III:\n\nO Elsa! Was hast du mir angethan?<br>\nAls meine Augen dich zuerst ersah'n,<br>\nzu dir f\u00fchlt' ich in Liebe mich entbrannt,<br>\n(Wagner wrote five additional lines here but they were rejected in the final draft). \n\nLater, in the same Act, when Elsa calls on Lohengrin to punish her, the latter replies:\n\nNur eine Strafe giebt's f\u00fcr dein Vergeh'n<br>\nach, mich wie dich trifft ihre herbe Pein!<br>\nGetrennt, geschieden sollen wir uns seh'n<br>\ndiess muss die Strafe, diess die S\u00fchne sein!<br>\n\nWagner asks Franck if he should explicitly mention the specific rule associated with the Grail which, although not expressly forbidding the Grail knights from committing such excesses, nevertheless, discourages them from acting in this way. Wagner's opinion is that it should be sufficient for the audience to deduce the Grail's advice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

The second complete draft of Act II was started on 18th June and complete on 2nd August 1847. In a letter to Ferdinand Heine dated 6 August 1847, Wagner announced that he had completed the ''Lohengrin'' opera:\n\n<blockquote>I feel pleased and happy as a result, since I am well satisfied with what I have done.</blockquote>\n\nAs outlined to Heine, Wagner's plan was to build on the success of the premiere of Rienzi in Berlin on 24 October 1847 with a follow up performance of ''Lohengrin''. As it turned out ''Rienzi'' in Berlin was not a success and ''Lohengrin'' was not performed there until 1859.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

The composition is not divided into individual numbers but played from scene to scene without any interruption. This style of composition contrasts with the conventional [[number opera]], which is divided into [[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, and [[Choir|choral sections]]. Nevertheless, ''Lohengrin'' still contains lengthy performances\u2014for example, Elsa's \"Alone in dark days\" and Lohengrin's Grail aria\u2014which harken back to the classical solo aria form.\n\nWagner made extensive use of [[Leitmotif|leitmotifs]] in his composition. Examples include the Grail motif first revealed in the prelude and the \"question\" motif first sung by Lohengrin to Elsa in Act I. These motifs allowed Wagner to precisely narrate the inner thoughts of the characters on stage, even without speech.\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe first production of ''Lohengrin'' was in [[Weimar]], Germany, on 28 August 1850 at the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Staatskapelle Weimar]] under the direction of [[Franz Liszt]], a close friend and early supporter of Wagner. Liszt chose the date in honour of Weimar's most famous citizen, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who was born on 28 August 1749.<ref>''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed., 1954</ref> Despite the inadequacies of the lead tenor [[Karl Beck (tenor)|Karl Beck]],<ref>Wagner had written the act 3 tenor monologue ''In fernem Land'' (the \"Grail Narration\") in two parts, however, he asked Liszt to cut the second part from the premiere performance, as he felt Karl Beck could not do it justice and it would result in an anticlimax. That unfortunate circumstance established the tradition of performing only the first part of the Narration.(see [http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf Peter Bassett, \"An Introduction to Wagner's ''Lohengrin'': A paper given to the Patrons and Friends of Opera Australia\", Sydney 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410080312/http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf |date=2013-04-10 }}) In fact, the first time the second part was ever sung at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] was by [[Franz V\u00f6lker]] during the lavish 1936 production, which [[Adolf Hitler]] personally ordered and took a close interest in, to demonstrate what a connoisseur of Wagner he was.

A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noble woman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.\n\n===Act 1===\n[[File:Lohengrin - Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.png|thumb|upright|Illustration from the London premi\u00e8re]]\nKing [[Henry the Fowler]] has arrived in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], where he has assembled the German tribes in order to expel the marauding [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] from his dominions. He also needs to settle a dispute involving the disappearance of the child-Duke Gottfried of Brabant. The Duke's guardian, Count Friedrich von Telramund, has accused the Duke's older sister, Elsa, of murdering her brother in order to become Duchess of Brabant. Telramund calls upon the King to punish Elsa and to make him the new Duke of Brabant.\n\nThe King calls for Elsa to answer Telramund's accusation. Elsa does not answer the King's inquiries, only lamenting her brother's fate. The King declares that he cannot resolve the matter and will leave it to God's judgment through [[Trial by combat|ordeal by combat]]. Telramund, a strong and seasoned warrior, agrees enthusiastically. When the King asks Elsa who shall be her champion, Elsa describes a knight she has beheld in her dreams (Narrative: \"Alone in dark days\").\n\nTwice the Herald calls for a champion to step forward, but gets no response. Elsa kneels and prays that God may send her champion to her. A boat drawn by a swan appears on the river and in it stands a knight in shining armour. He disembarks, dismisses the swan, respectfully greets the king, and asks Elsa if she will have him as her champion and marry him. Elsa kneels in front of him and places her honour in his keeping. He asks only one thing in return for his service: Elsa must never ask him his name or where he has come from. Elsa agrees to this.\n\nTelramund's supporters advise him to withdraw because he cannot prevail against the Knight's powers, but he proudly refuses. The chorus prays to God (\"Herr und Gott\") for victory for the one whose cause is just. Ortrud, Telramund's wife, does not join the prayer, but privately expresses confidence that Telramund will win. The combat commences. The unknown Knight defeats Telramund but spares his life. Taking Elsa by the hand, he declares her innocent. The crowd exits, cheering and celebrating.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Johanna Jachmann-Wagner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johanna Jachmann-Wagner]] as Ortrud, ca. 1860]]\n''Night in the courtyard outside the cathedral''\n\nTelramund and Ortrud, [[Deportation|banished]] from court, listen unhappily to the distant party-music. Ortrud reveals that she is a pagan witch (daughter of [[Radbod, King of the Frisians|Radbod]] Duke of [[Frisia]]), and tries to revive Telramund's courage, assuring him that her people (and he) are destined to rule the kingdom again. She plots to induce Elsa to violate the mysterious knight's only condition.\n\nWhen Elsa appears on the balcony before dawn, she hears Ortrud lamenting and pities her. As Elsa descends to open the castle door, Ortrud prays to her pagan gods, [[Odin|Wodan]] and [[Freya|Freia]], for malice, guile, and cunning, in order to deceive Elsa and restore pagan rule to the region. Ortrud warns Elsa that since she knows nothing about her rescuer, he could leave at any time as suddenly as he came, but Elsa is sure of the Knight's virtues. The two women go into the castle. Left alone outside, Telramund vows to bring about the Knight's downfall.\n\nThe sun rises and the people assemble. The Herald announces that Telramund is now banished, and that anyone who follows Telramund shall be considered an [[outlaw]] by the law of the land. In addition, he announces that the King has offered to make the unnamed knight the Duke of Brabant; however, the Knight has declined the title, and prefers to be known only as \"[[Protectorate|Protector]] of Brabant\".<ref>The title ''F\u00fchrer'' von Brabant is often altered to ''Sch\u00fctzer'' in performances since 1945, because the former title has acquired meanings unforeseen by Wagner. ''F\u00fchrer'' formerly meant 'Leader' or 'Guide'.</ref> The Herald further announces that the Knight will lead the people to glorious new conquests, and will celebrate the marriage of himself and Elsa. In the back of the crowd, four noblemen quietly express misgivings to each other because the Knight has rescinded their privileges and is calling them to arms. Telramund secretly draws the four noblemen aside and assures them that he will regain his position and stop the Knight, by accusing him of sorcery.\n\nAs Elsa and her attendants are about to enter the church, Ortrud rushes to the front of the procession and challenges Elsa to explain who the Knight is and why anyone should follow him. Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the King with the Knight. Elsa tells both of them that Ortrud was interrupting the ceremony. The King tells Ortrud to step aside, then leads Elsa and the Knight toward the church. Just as they are about to enter the church, Telramund enters. He claims that his defeat in combat was invalid because the Knight did not give his name (trial by combat traditionally being open only to established citizens), then accuses the Knight of sorcery. He demands that the Knight must reveal his name; otherwise the King should rule the trial by combat invalid. The Knight refuses to reveal his identity and claims that only one person in the world has the right to make him do so: his beloved Elsa, and she has pledged not to exercise that right. Elsa, though visibly shaken and uncertain, assures him of her confidence. King Henry refuses Telramund's questions, and the nobles of Brabant and Saxony praise and honor the Knight. Elsa falls back into the crowd where Ortrud and Telramund try to intimidate her, but the Knight forces them both to leave the ceremony, and consoles Elsa. Elsa takes one last look at the banished Ortrud, then enters the church with the wedding procession.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Omaraaslohengrin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph O'Mara]] in the title role, 1894\u20131895]]\n''Scene 1: The bridal chamber''\n\nElsa and her new husband are ushered in with the well-known [[Bridal Chorus|bridal chorus]], and they express their love for each other. Ortrud's words, however, have made an impression on Elsa; she laments that her name sounds so sweet on her husband's lips but she cannot utter his name. She asks him to tell her his name when no one else is around, but at all instances he refuses. Finally, despite his warnings, she asks the Knight the fatal questions. Before the Knight can answer, Telramund and his four recruits rush into the room in order to attack him. The Knight defeats and kills Telramund. Then, he sorrowfully turns to Elsa and asks her to follow him to the King, to whom he will now reveal his secrets.\n\n''Scene 2: On the banks of the Scheldt (as in Act 1)''\n\nThe troops arrive equipped for war. Telramund's corpse is brought in. Elsa comes forward, then the Knight. He tells the King that Elsa has broken her promise, and discloses his identity (\"In fernem Land\") by recounting the story of the [[Holy Grail]] and of [[Monsalvat]]. He reveals himself as Lohengrin, Knight of the Grail and son of King [[Parsifal]], sent to protect an unjustly accused woman. The laws of the Holy Grail say that Knights of the Grail must remain anonymous. If their identity is revealed, they must return home.\n\nAs Lohengrin sadly bids farewell to Elsa, the swan-boat reappears. Lohengrin tells Elsa that if she had kept her promise, she could have recovered her lost brother, and gives her his sword, horn and ring, for he is to become the future leader of Brabant. As Lohengrin tries to get in the boat, Ortrud appears. She tells Elsa that the swan is actually Gottfried, Elsa's brother, whom she cursed to become a swan. The people consider Ortrud guilty of witchcraft. Lohengrin prays and the swan turns back into young Gottfried. Lohengrin declares him the Duke of Brabant. Ortrud sinks as she sees her plans thwarted.\n\nA dove descends from heaven and, taking the place of the swan at the head of the boat, leads Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. Elsa is stricken with grief and falls to the ground dead.<ref>Plot taken from ''The Opera Goer's Complete Guide'' by Leo Melitz, 1921 version.</ref>\n\n==Notable arias and excerpts==\n*Act 1\n**[[Prelude (music)|Prelude]]\n**\"{{Lang|de|Einsam in tr\u00fcben Tage|italic=no}}\" (Elsa's Narrative)\n**Scene \"{{Lang|de|Wenn ich im Kampfe f\u00fcr dich siege|italic=no}}\"\n* Act 2\n**\"{{Lang|de|Durch dich musst' ich verlieren|italic=no}}\" (Telramund)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Euch l\u00fcften, die mein Klagen|italic=no}}\" (Elsa)\n**Scene 4 opening, \"Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral\"\n* Act 3\n**Prelude\n**[[Bridal Chorus]] \"{{Lang|de|Treulich gef\u00fchrt|italic=no}}\"\n**\"{{Lang|de|Das s\u00fcsse Lied verhallt|italic=no}}\" (Love duet)\n**\"{{Lang|de|H\u00f6chstes Vertrau'n|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Declaration to Elsa)\n**Entry of King Henry\n**\"{{Lang|de|In fernem Land|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Narration)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Mein lieber Schwan...

The game was restarted, with the USA team fielding only two players against Italy's three players. Despite the handicap, the USA team took the game to overtime, but lost in the sudden death period.<ref name=\"2011 U18 3x3\"/> The team was scheduled to play against Japan for the bronze medal, but forfeited due to the injuries and finished in fourth place.
