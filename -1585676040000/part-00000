Uncrewed programs launched the first American artificial [[satellite]]s into Earth orbit for scientific and [[communications satellite|communications]] purposes, and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting with [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], and including \"[[Voyager program|grand tours]]\" of the outer planets. Crewed programs sent the first Americans into [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), won the [[Space Race]] with the [[Soviet Union]] by landing twelve men on the Moon from 1969 to 1972 in the [[Apollo program]], developed a semi-reusable LEO [[Space Shuttle]], and developed LEO [[space station]] capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-Soviet [[Russia]]. Some missions include both crewed and uncrewed aspects, such as the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]], which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent uncrewed to Jupiter.\n\n=== Crewed programs ===\nThe experimental [[rocket-powered aircraft]] programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for crewed spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man [[space capsule]] program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and [[national security|security]] fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the [[Soviet Union]], in 1961 President [[John F. Kennedy]] proposed the ambitious goal \"of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth.\" This goal was met in 1969 by the [[Apollo program]], and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a [[human mission to Mars]]. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital [[space station]] in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet [[Russia]]. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 crewed space missions on rockets, and thirteen [[X-15]] rocket flights above the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] definition of spaceflight altitude, {{convert|80|km|ft|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref>The Air Force definition of outer space differs from that of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|International Aeronautical Federation]], which is {{convert|100|km|ft|sp=us}}.</ref>\n\n==== X-15 rocket plane (1959\u20131968) ====\n{{main|North American X-15}}\n[[File:X-15 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 in powered flight]]\n\nThe [[North American X-15]] was an NACA experimental rocket-powered [[hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy.

Typically, the major directives had the intervention of the science advisory, political, funding, and public interest that synergized into various waves of effort often heavily swayed by technical, funding, and worldwide events. For example, there was a major push to build [[Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'']] in the 1980s, but when the Cold War ended, the Russians, the Americans and other international partners came together to build the [[International Space Station]].\n\nIn the 2010s, the major shift was the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the development of a new crewed heavy lift rocket, the [[Space Launch System]]. Missions for the new System have varied but overall, they were similar as it primarily involved the desire to send a human into the space. The [[Space Exploration Initiative]] of the 1980s opened newer avenues of galaxy exploration.\n\nIn the coming decades, the focus is gradually shifting towards exploration of planet Mars; however, some differences exist over the technologies to develop and focus on for the exploration.<ref name=\"space.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|title=President Trump Directs NASA to Return to the Moon, Then Aim for Mars|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109040720/https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|archive-date=January 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the options considered was the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] (ARM).<ref name=\"space.com\" /> ARM had largely been defunded in 2017, but the key technologies developed for ARM would be utilized for future exploration, especially on a solar electric propulsion system.<ref name=\"defunded\">{{cite news |last1=Jeff Foust |title=NASA closing out Asteroid Redirect Mission |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-closing-out-asteroid-redirect-mission/ |accessdate=September 9, 2017 |work=Space News |date=June 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"space.com\" />\n\nLonger project execution timelines means it is up to future officials to execute on a directive, which often leads to directional mismanagement. For example, a Shuttle replacement has numerous components involved, each making some headway before being called off for various reasons including the National Aerospace Plane, Venture Star, Orbital Space Plane, Ares I, and others. The asteroid mission was not a major directive in the 2010s. Instead, the general support rested with the long-term goal of getting humans to Mars. The Space Shuttle was retired and much of the existing road map was shelved including the then planned Lunar Return and Ares I human launch vehicle.\n\nPreviously, in the early 2000s, there was a plan called the [[Constellation Program]] but this was defunded in the early 2010s.<ref name=\"BBC cancels Moon return\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8489097.stm|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Obama cancels Moon return project|work=BBC News|date=February 1, 2010|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821102845/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8489097.stm|archive-date=August 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"FY2011_budget\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Terminations, Reductions, and Savings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811185822/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf|archivedate=August 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"WashPost eliminates funds\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|title=NASA budget for 2011 eliminates funds for manned lunar missions|work=Washington Post|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010|first=Joel|last=Achenbach|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321220708/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|archive-date=March 21, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Estimates|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201191410/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf|archivedate=February 1, 2010}}</ref> In the 1990s, there was a plan called \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/misc/fbctask.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120031500/http://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/misc/fbctask.pdf |archive-date=January 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the 1980s, there was a directive to build a crewed space station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|title=Reagan ISS|first=Todd Messer, Claire Rojstaczer, and Steve|last=Garber|website=history.nasa.gov|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225231131/https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|archive-date=December 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== NASA Authorization Act of 2017 ===\n[[File:Orion ISS 1 (05-2007).jpg|thumb|Orion at ISS artwork]]\n\nThe NASA Authorization Act of 2017, which included $19.5 billion in funding for that fiscal year, directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early 2030s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://futurism.com/us-government-issues-nasa-demand-get-humans-to-mars-by-2033/|title=US Government Issues NASA Demand, 'Get Humans to Mars By 2033'|date=March 9, 2017|work=Futurism|access-date=February 16, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217082516/https://futurism.com/us-government-issues-nasa-demand-get-humans-to-mars-by-2033/|archive-date=February 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.<ref name=\":00\" />\n\n=== Space Policy Directive 1 ===\nIn December 2017, on the 45th anniversary of the last crewed mission to the Lunar surface, President [[Donald Trump]] approved a directive that includes a lunar mission on the pathway to Mars and beyond.<ref name=\"space.com\" />\n\n{{quote|We'll learn.

Some missions include both crewed and uncrewed aspects, such as the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]], which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent uncrewed to Jupiter.\n\n=== Crewed programs ===\nThe experimental [[rocket-powered aircraft]] programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for crewed spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man [[space capsule]] program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and [[national security|security]] fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the [[Soviet Union]], in 1961 President [[John F. Kennedy]] proposed the ambitious goal \"of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth.\" This goal was met in 1969 by the [[Apollo program]], and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a [[human mission to Mars]]. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital [[space station]] in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet [[Russia]]. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 crewed space missions on rockets, and thirteen [[X-15]] rocket flights above the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] definition of spaceflight altitude, {{convert|80|km|ft|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref>The Air Force definition of outer space differs from that of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|International Aeronautical Federation]], which is {{convert|100|km|ft|sp=us}}.</ref>\n\n==== X-15 rocket plane (1959\u20131968) ====\n{{main|North American X-15}}\n[[File:X-15 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 in powered flight]]\n\nThe [[North American X-15]] was an NACA experimental rocket-powered [[hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy.

Typically, the major directives had the intervention of the science advisory, political, funding, and public interest that synergized into various waves of effort often heavily swayed by technical, funding, and worldwide events. For example, there was a major push to build [[Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'']] in the 1980s, but when the Cold War ended, the Russians, the Americans and other international partners came together to build the [[International Space Station]].\n\nIn the 2010s, the major shift was the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the development of a new crewed heavy lift rocket, the [[Space Launch System]]. Missions for the new System have varied but overall, they were similar as it primarily involved the desire to send a human into the space. The [[Space Exploration Initiative]] of the 1980s opened newer avenues of galaxy exploration.\n\nIn the coming decades, the focus is gradually shifting towards exploration of planet Mars; however, some differences exist over the technologies to develop and focus on for the exploration.<ref name=\"space.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|title=President Trump Directs NASA to Return to the Moon, Then Aim for Mars|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109040720/https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|archive-date=January 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the options considered was the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] (ARM).<ref name=\"space.com\" /> ARM had largely been defunded in 2017, but the key technologies developed for ARM would be utilized for future exploration, especially on a solar electric propulsion system.<ref name=\"defunded\">{{cite news |last1=Jeff Foust |title=NASA closing out Asteroid Redirect Mission |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-closing-out-asteroid-redirect-mission/ |accessdate=September 9, 2017 |work=Space News |date=June 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"space.com\" />\n\nLonger project execution timelines means it is up to future officials to execute on a directive, which often leads to directional mismanagement. For example, a Shuttle replacement has numerous components involved, each making some headway before being called off for various reasons including the National Aerospace Plane, Venture Star, Orbital Space Plane, Ares I, and others. The asteroid mission was not a major directive in the 2010s. Instead, the general support rested with the long-term goal of getting humans to Mars. The Space Shuttle was retired and much of the existing road map was shelved including the then planned Lunar Return and Ares I human launch vehicle.\n\nPreviously, in the early 2000s, there was a plan called the [[Constellation Program]] but this was defunded in the early 2010s.<ref name=\"BBC cancels Moon return\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8489097.stm|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Obama cancels Moon return project|work=BBC News|date=February 1, 2010|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821102845/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8489097.stm|archive-date=August 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"FY2011_budget\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Terminations, Reductions, and Savings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811185822/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf|archivedate=August 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"WashPost eliminates funds\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|title=NASA budget for 2011 eliminates funds for manned lunar missions|work=Washington Post|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010|first=Joel|last=Achenbach|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321220708/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|archive-date=March 21, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Estimates|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201191410/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf|archivedate=February 1, 2010}}</ref> In the 1990s, there was a plan called \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/misc/fbctask.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120031500/http://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/misc/fbctask.pdf |archive-date=January 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the 1980s, there was a directive to build a crewed space station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|title=Reagan ISS|first=Todd Messer, Claire Rojstaczer, and Steve|last=Garber|website=history.nasa.gov|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225231131/https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|archive-date=December 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== NASA Authorization Act of 2017 ===\n[[File:Orion ISS 1 (05-2007).jpg|thumb|Orion at ISS artwork]]\n\nThe NASA Authorization Act of 2017, which included $19.5 billion in funding for that fiscal year, directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early 2030s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://futurism.com/us-government-issues-nasa-demand-get-humans-to-mars-by-2033/|title=US Government Issues NASA Demand, 'Get Humans to Mars By 2033'|date=March 9, 2017|work=Futurism|access-date=February 16, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217082516/https://futurism.com/us-government-issues-nasa-demand-get-humans-to-mars-by-2033/|archive-date=February 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.<ref name=\":00\" />\n\n=== Space Policy Directive 1 ===\nIn December 2017, on the 45th anniversary of the last crewed mission to the Lunar surface, President [[Donald Trump]] approved a directive that includes a lunar mission on the pathway to Mars and beyond.<ref name=\"space.com\" />\n\n{{quote|We'll learn.

D. Tippit''' (September 18, 1924 \u2013 November 22, 1963) was an American [[police officer]] who served as an 11-year veteran with the [[Dallas Police Department]]. About 45 minutes after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, Tippit was shot dead in a residential neighborhood in the [[Oak Cliff]] section of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was initially arrested for the murder of Tippit and was subsequently arrested for the killing of President Kennedy. Oswald was charged with both crimes shortly after his arrest. However, Oswald denied involvement in either of the cases. Because Oswald was shot and killed by nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]] two days after the killings, he could not be prosecuted for either crime.\n\n==Early life==\nTippit was born near the town of [[Annona, Texas|Annona]], [[Texas]], in [[Red River County, Texas|Red River County]].<ref name=volume26>{{cite book |title= Investigation of the Assassination of President John F.

D. Tippit''' (September 18, 1924 \u2013 November 22, 1963) was an American [[police officer]] who served as an 11-year veteran with the [[Dallas Police Department]]. About 45 minutes after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, Tippit was shot dead in a residential neighborhood in the [[Oak Cliff]] section of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was initially arrested for the murder of Tippit and was subsequently arrested for the killing of President Kennedy. Oswald was charged with both crimes shortly after his arrest. However, Oswald denied involvement in either of the cases. Because Oswald was shot and killed by nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]] two days after the killings, he could not be prosecuted for either crime.\n\n==Early life==\nTippit was born near the town of [[Annona, Texas|Annona]], [[Texas]], in [[Red River County, Texas|Red River County]].<ref name=volume26>{{cite book |title= Investigation of the Assassination of President John F.
