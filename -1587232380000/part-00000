As heir to the French throne, his older brothers having died before he was born, Charles held the title [[Dauphin of France]].\n\n==King of France==\n===Regency===\nAt his father's death on 16 September 1380, he inherited the throne of France. His coronation took place on 4 November 1380, at [[Reims Cathedral]].<ref>Jonathan Sumption, ''The Hundred Years War: Divided Houses'', Vol. III, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009), 397.</ref> Charles VI was only 11 years old when he was crowned King of France.  During his minority, France was ruled by Charles' uncles, as regents. Although the royal [[age of majority]] was 14 (the \"[[age of accountability]]\" under Roman Catholic [[canon law]]), Charles terminated the regency only at the age of 21.\n\nThe regents were [[Philip the Bold|Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy]], [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou]], and [[John, Duke of Berry]] \u2013 all brothers of Charles V \u2013 along with [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]], Charles VI's maternal uncle. Philip took the dominant role during the regency. Louis of Anjou was fighting for his claim to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] after 1382, dying in 1384; John of Berry was interested mainly in the [[Languedoc]],<ref>Vaughan, 40\u201341</ref> and not particularly interested in politics; and Louis of Bourbon was a largely unimportant figure, owing to his personality (showing signs of mental instability) and status (since he was not the son of a king).\n\nDuring the rule of his uncles, the financial resources of the kingdom, painstakingly built up by his father, were squandered for the personal profit of the dukes, whose interests were frequently divergent or even opposing. During that time, the power of the royal administration was strengthened and taxes re-established. The latter policy represented a reversal of the deathbed decision of the king's father Charles V to repeal taxes, and led to tax revolts, known as the [[Harelle]]. Increased tax revenues were needed to support the self-serving policies of the king's uncles, whose interests were frequently in conflict with those of the crown and with each other.  The [[Battle of Roosebeke]] (1382), for example, brilliantly won by the royal troops, was prosecuted solely for the benefit of Philip of Burgundy. The treasury surplus carefully accumulated by Charles V was quickly squandered.\n\nCharles VI brought the regency to an end in 1388, taking up personal rule. He restored to power the highly competent advisors of Charles V, known as the [[Marmousets]],<ref>Vaughn, 42.</ref> who ushered in a new period of high esteem for the crown. Charles VI was widely referred to as ''Charles the Beloved'' by his subjects.\n\n===Wife and children===\n\nHe married [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] on 17 July 1385,<ref>Tracy Adams, ''The Life and Afterlife of Isabeau of Bavaria'', (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), 5.</ref> when he was 17 and she 14 (and considered an adult at the time). Isabeau had 12 children, most of whom died young. Isabeau's first child, named Charles, was born in 1386, and was [[Dauphin of Viennois]] (heir apparent), but survived only 3 months. Her second child, Joan, was born on 14 June 1388, but died in 1390. Her third child, [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]], was born in 1389. She was married to [[Richard II of England|Richard II, King of England]] in 1396, at the age of 6, and became Queen of England. Richard died in 1400 and they had no children. Richard's successor, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], wanted Isabella then to marry his son, 14-year-old future king [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], but she refused. She was married again in 1406, this time to her cousin, [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], at the age of 17. She died in childbirth at the age of 19.\n\nIsabeau's fourth child, [[Joan of France, Duchess of Brittany|Joan]], was born in 1391, and was married to [[John VI, Duke of Brittany]] in 1396, at an age of 5; they had children. Isabeau's fifth child born in 1392 was also named Charles, and was Dauphin. The young Charles was betrothed to [[Margaret of Burgundy, Dauphine of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] in 1396, but died at the age of 9. Isabeau's sixth child, [[Marie of Valois, Prioress of Poissy|Mary]], was born in 1393. She was never married, and had no children. Isabeau's seventh child, [[Michelle of Valois|Michelle]], was born in 1395. She was engaged to [[Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]], son of [[John the Fearless]], Duke of Burgundy, in 1404 (both were then aged 8) and they were married in 1409, aged 14. She had one child who died in infancy, before she died in 1422, aged 27.\n\nIsabeau's eighth child, [[Louis, Dauphin of France and Duke of Guyenne|Louis]], was born in 1397, and was also Dauphin. He married Margaret of Burgundy, who had previously been betrothed to his brother Charles. The marriage produced no children by the time of Louis's death in 1415, aged 18.\n\nIsabeau's ninth child, [[John, Dauphin of France and Duke of Touraine|John]], was born in 1398, and was also Dauphin from 1415, after the death of his brother Louis. He was married to [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]] in 1415, then aged 17, but they did not have any children before he died in 1417, aged 19. Isabeau's tenth child, [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], was born in 1401. She was married firstly to [[Henry V of England|Henry V, King of England]] in 1420, and they had one child, who became [[Henry VI of England]]. Henry V died suddenly in 1422. Catherine may then have secretly married [[Owen Tudor]] in 1429 and had additional children, including [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund Tudor]], the father of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. She died in 1437, aged 36.{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Couronnement de Charles VI le Bien-Aim\u00e9.jpg\n| width1 = 150px\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The coronation of Charles VI\n| image2 = Madness of Charles VI.jpg\n| width2 = 200px\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Charles seized by madness in the forest near Le Mans\n| footer = \n}}\n\nIsabeau's eleventh child, also named [[Charles VII of France|Charles]], was born in 1403. In 1413, Queen Isabeau and [[Yolande of Aragon]] finalized a marriage contract between Charles and Yolande's daughter [[Marie of Anjou]], Charles' second cousin. Since both Dauphin Louis and then Dauphin John died while in the care of [[John the Fearless]], the Duke of Burgundy and regent for Charles, Yolande became Charles' guardian. Charles became the new Dauphin in 1417 upon the death of his brother John. Now with the heir to the throne of France under her protection, Yolande refused Queen Isabeau's orders to return Charles to the French Court, reportedly replying, \"We have not nurtured and cherished this one for you to make him die like his brothers or to go mad like his father, or to become English like you. I keep him for my own. Come and take him away, if you dare.\" After the death of Charles VI in 1422, the English regents claimed the crown of France for Henry VI, then aged 1, according to the terms of the Treaty of Troyes. However, Charles, aged 19, repudiated the treaty and claimed the throne for himself as King Charles VII, sparking fresh fighting with the English. His marriage to Marie of Anjou in 1422 produced many children, most of whom died at a very early age. Charles VII died in 1461 at age 58, the most long-lived of Isabeau's children.\n\nIsabeau's twelfth and the last child, Philip, was born in 1407, but died shortly after.\n\n==Reign==\n===Mental illness===\n[[File:Charles VI double d'or La Rochelle 1420.jpg|thumb|A coin of Charles VI, a \"double d'or\", minted in [[La Rochelle]] in 1420]]\n\nCharles VI's early successes with the Marmousets as his counselors quickly dissipated as a result of the bouts of [[psychosis]] he experienced from his mid-twenties.  Mental illness may have been passed on for several generations through his mother, [[Joanna of Bourbon]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://eprints.utas.edu.au/11741/2/alger_whole_thesis.pdf|title=The Politics of Madness: Government in the Reigns of Charles VI and Henry V|last=Alger|first=Sarah|year=2001|pages=24}}</ref> Although still called by his subjects ''Charles the Beloved'', he became known also as ''Charles the Mad''.\n\nCharles's first known episode occurred in 1392 when his friend and advisor, [[Olivier de Clisson]], was the victim of an attempted murder. Although Clisson survived, Charles was determined to punish the would-be assassin, [[Pierre de Craon]], who had taken refuge in [[Brittany]]. [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] was unwilling to hand him over, so Charles prepared a military expedition.\n\nContemporaries said Charles appeared to be in a \"fever\" to begin the campaign and disconnected in his speech. Charles set off with an army on 1 July 1392. The progress of the army was slow, driving Charles into a frenzy of impatience. As the king and his escort were traveling through the forest near [[Le Mans]] on a hot August morning, a barefoot leper dressed in rags rushed up to the King's horse and grabbed his bridle. \"Ride no further, noble King!\" he yelled: \"Turn back! You are betrayed!\" The king's escorts beat the man back, but did not arrest him, and he followed the procession for half an hour, repeating his cries.<ref>W.H. Jervis, ''A History of France: from the Earliest Times to the Fall of the Second Empire in 1870'', (London: John Murray, 1884), 228, \u00a75; Jean Juvenal des Ursins, ''Histoire de Charles VI, Roy de France'', (Paris: A.

Michaud, 1813), 8:114 sub Charles VI.</ref> The company emerged from the forest at noon. A page who was drowsy from the sun dropped the king's lance, which clanged loudly against a steel helmet carried by another page. Charles shuddered, drew his sword and yelled \"Forward against the traitors! They wish to deliver me to the enemy!\" The king spurred his horse and began swinging his sword at his companions, fighting until one of his chamberlains and a group of soldiers were able to grab him from his mount and lay him on the ground. He lay still and did not react, but then fell into a coma. The king had killed a knight known as \"The Bastard of Polignac\" and several other men.<ref>M. Guizot, ''The History of France from the Earliest Times to the Year 1789'', Vol. 2, transl. Robert Black, (P.F. Collier & son, 1902), 189.</ref>\n\nPeriods of mental illness continued throughout the king's life. During one in 1393, he could not remember his name and did not know he was king. When his wife came to visit, he asked his servants who she was and ordered them to take care of what she required so that she would leave him alone.<ref>R.C. Famiglietti, ''Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392\u20131420'', New York, 1986, p. 4, citing the chronicle of the Religieux de Saint-Denis, ed. Bellaguet, II, pp. 86\u201388.</ref> During an episode in 1395\u201396 he claimed he was [[Saint George]] and that his coat of arms was a lion with a sword thrust through it.<ref>R.C. Famiglietti, ''Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392\u20131420'', New York, 1986, p. 5, citing the chronicle of the Religieux de Saint-Denis, ed. Bellaguet, II, pp. 404\u201305.</ref> At this time, he recognized all the officers of his household, but did not know his wife nor his children. Sometimes he ran wildly through the corridors of his Parisian residence, the [[H\u00f4tel Saint-Pol]], and to keep him inside, the entrances were walled up. In 1405, he refused to bathe or change his clothes for five months.<ref>R.C. Famiglietti, ''Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392\u20131420'', New York, 1986, p. 6, citing the chronicle of the Religieux de Saint-Denis, ed. Bellaguet, III, p. 348</ref> His later psychotic episodes were not described in detail, perhaps because of the similarity of his behavior and delusions. [[Pope Pius II]], who was born during the reign of Charles VI, wrote in his ''Commentaries'' that there were times when Charles thought that he was made of glass, and thus tried to protect himself in various ways so that he would not break. He reportedly had iron rods sewn into his clothes so that he would not shatter if he came into contact with another person.<ref>Enea Silvio Piccolomini (Papa Pio II), ''I Commentarii'', ed. L. Totaro, Milano, 1984, I, p. 1056.</ref> This condition has come to be known as [[glass delusion]].\n\nCharles VI's secretary, Pierre Salmon, spent much time in discussions with the king while he was intermittently psychotic. In an effort to find a cure for the king's illness, stabilize the turbulent political situation, and secure his own future, Salmon supervised the production of two distinct versions of the beautifully illuminated guidebooks to good kingship known as Pierre Salmon's ''Dialogues''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dialogues_de_Pierre_Salmon|title=Pierre Salmon's Dialogues \u2013 Wikicommons}}</ref>\n\n===''Bal des Ardents''===\n{{main|Bal des Ardents}}\n[[File:Le Bal des Ardents.jpg|thumb|The [[Bal des Ardents]], miniature of 1450\u201380 showing the dancers' costumes on fire.]]\n\nOn 29 January 1393, a masked ball, which later became known as the ''Bal des Ardents'' (\"Ball of the Burning Men\"), had been organized by Isabeau of Bavaria to celebrate the wedding of one of her ladies-in-waiting at the ''H\u00f4tel Saint-Pol''. At the suggestion of Huguet de Guisay, the king and four other lords<ref name=\"Froissart Chronicles .p.550\">[[Froissart's Chronicles]], ed. T. Johnes, II (1855), p.550</ref> dressed up as [[Woodwose|wild men]] and they were dancing around. They were dressed \"in costumes of linen cloth sewn onto their bodies and soaked in resinous wax or pitch to hold a covering of frazzled hemp, so that they appeared shaggy & hairy from head to foot\".<ref>Barbara Tuchman, A Distant Mirror, 1978, Alfred A Knopf Ltd. See the chronicle of the Religieux de Saint-Denis, ed. Bellaguet, II, pp. 64\u201371, where the squire's name is given correctly as de Guisay.</ref> At the suggestion of one Yvain de Foix, the king commanded that the torch-bearers were to stand at the side of the room. Nonetheless, the king's brother [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], who had arrived late, approached with a lighted torch in order to discover the identity of the masqueraders, and accidentally set one of them on fire. There was panic as the flames spread. The [[Joanna II of Auvergne|Duchess of Berry]] threw the train of her gown over the king in order to protect him.<ref>[[Froissart's Chronicles]], ed. T. Johnes, II (1855), pp.550\u20132</ref> Several knights who tried to put out the flames were severely burned. Four of the wild men perished: Charles de Poitiers, son of the [[Count of Valentinois]]; Huguet de Guisay; Yvain de [[County of Foix|Foix]]; and the Count of [[Joigny]]. Another \u2013 Jean, son of the Lord of [[Nantouillet]] \u2013 saved himself by jumping into a dishwater tub.<ref>[[Froissart's Chronicles]], ed. T. Johnes, II (1855), p.550. Note that Froissart and the Religieux de Saint-Denis differ as to when the four men died. Huguet de Guisay had held the office of cupbearer of the king.</ref>\n\n===Expulsion of the Jews, 1394===\nOn 17 September 1394, Charles suddenly published an ordinance in which he declared, in substance, that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors of the [[Jews]] against [[Christians]], and that the [[prosecutor]]s had made several investigations and discovered that the Jews broke the agreement with the king on many occasions. Therefore, he decreed, as an irrevocable law and statute, that no Jew should dwell in his domains (\"Ordonnances\", vii. 675). According to the [[Michel Pintoin|Religieux de St. Denis]], the king signed this decree at the insistence of the queen (\"Chron. de Charles VI.\" ii. 119).<ref>History of the reign of Charles VI, titled ''Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422'', encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852.</ref> The decree was not immediately enforced, a respite being granted to the Jews in order that they have enough time to sell their property and pay their debts. Those indebted to them were enjoined to redeem their obligations within a set time; otherwise their pledges held in pawn were to be sold by the Jews. The provost was to escort the Jews to the frontier of the kingdom. Subsequently, the king released the Christians from their debts.\n\n===Struggles for power===\n{{House of Valois}}\nWith Charles VI mentally ill, from 1393 his wife Isabeau presided over a regency counsel, on which sat the grandees of the kingdom. Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who acted as regent during the king's minority (from 1380 to 1388), was a great influence on the queen (he had organized the royal marriage during his regency). Influence progressively shifted to [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], the king's brother, another contender for power, and it was suspected, the queen's lover.<ref name=\"Dignat\">Alban Dignat, ''23 novembre 1407: Assassinat dans la rue Vieille du Temple'', [http://www.herodote.net/histoire11230.htm herodote.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211173924/http://www.herodote.net/histoire11230.htm |date=11 December 2006 }}</ref> Charles VI's other uncles were less influential during the regency: [[Louis II of Naples]] was still engaged managing the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and [[John, Duke of Berry]], served as a mediator between the Orl\u00e9ans party (what would become the ''Armagnacs'') and the Burgundy party (''Bourguignons''). The rivalry would increase bit by bit and in the end result in outright civil war.\n\nThe new regents dismissed the various advisers and officials Charles had appointed. On the death of Philip the Bold in April 1404, his son John the Fearless took over the political aims of his father, and the feud with Louis escalated. John, who was less linked to Isabeau, again lost influence at court.\n\n===Wars with Burgundy and England===\nIn 1407, Louis of Orl\u00e9ans was murdered in the ''rue Vieille du Temple'' in Paris. John did not deny responsibility, claiming that Louis was a tyrant who squandered money. Louis' son [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Charles]], the new Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, turned to his father-in-law, [[Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac]], for support against John the Fearless. This resulted in the [[Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War]], which lasted from 1407 until 1435, beyond Charles' reign, though the war with the English was still in progress.\n\nWith the English taking over much of the country, John the Fearless sought to end the feud with the royal family by negotiating with the Dauphin [[Charles VII of France|Charles]], the king's heir. They met at the bridge at [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne|Montereau]] on 10 September 1419, but during the meeting, John was killed by [[Tanneguy du Chastel]], a follower of the Dauphin. John's successor, [[Philip the Good]], the new Duke of Burgundy, threw in his lot with the English.\n\n===English invasion and death===\nCharles VI's reign was marked by the continuing conflict with the English, known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. An early attempt at peace occurred in 1396 when Charles' daughter, the almost seven-year-old [[Isabella of Valois]], married the 29-year-old [[Richard II of England]]. By 1415, however, the feud between the French royal family and the House of Burgundy led to chaos and anarchy throughout France that [[Henry V of England]] was eager to take advantage of. [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry led an invasion]] that culminated in the defeat of the French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in October.\n\nIn May 1420, Henry V and Charles VI signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], which named Henry as Charles' successor, and stipulated that Henry's heirs would succeed him on the throne of France. It disinherited the Dauphin Charles, then only 17 years old. (In 1421, it was further claimed that the young Charles was illegitimate.) The treaty also betrothed Charles VI's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]], to Henry (see [[English Kings of France]]). Disinheriting the Dauphin in favor of Henry was a blatant act against the interests of the French aristocracy.\n\nThe Dauphin responded by declaring himself regent for his father. He seized royal authority, and defied his father's order to return to Paris. He established a court at [[Bourges]].<ref>R.C. Famiglietti, ''Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392\u20131420'', New York, 1986, Chapter X.</ref>\n\nCharles VI died on 21 October 1422 in Paris, at the ''H\u00f4tel Saint-Pol''. He was interred in [[Saint Denis Basilica]], where his wife Isabeau of Bavaria would join him after her death in September 1435.\n\nHenry V had died in August 1422, leaving an infant son, who was [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI of England]]. Therefore, according to the Treaty of Troyes, with the death of Charles VI, little Henry became King of France. His coronation as such was in Paris (held by the English since 1418) at the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] on 26 December 1431.\n\nThe disinherited Dauphin Charles remained at Bourges until 1429, when [[Joan of Arc]] arrived. After she led his forces to victory, he was crowned in [[Reims Cathedral]] as King [[Charles VII of France]] on 17 July 1429. He became known as \"Charles the Victorious\".<ref>Chartier, Jean, ''Chronique de Charles VII, Roi de France'', publi\u00e9 avec notes par Vallet de Viriville, Paris 1858</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Ancestors===\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

As heir to the French throne, his older brothers having died before he was born, Charles held the title [[Dauphin of France]].\n\n==King of France==\n===Regency===\nAt his father's death on 16 September 1380, he inherited the throne of France. His coronation took place on 4 November 1380, at [[Reims Cathedral]].<ref>Jonathan Sumption, ''The Hundred Years War: Divided Houses'', Vol. III, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009), 397.</ref> Charles VI was only 11 years old when he was crowned King of France.  During his minority, France was ruled by Charles' uncles, as regents. Although the royal [[age of majority]] was 14 (the \"[[age of accountability]]\" under Roman Catholic [[canon law]]), Charles terminated the regency only at the age of 21.\n\nThe regents were [[Philip the Bold|Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy]], [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou]], and [[John, Duke of Berry]] \u2013 all brothers of Charles V \u2013 along with [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]], Charles VI's maternal uncle. Philip took the dominant role during the regency. Louis of Anjou was fighting for his claim to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] after 1382, dying in 1384; John of Berry was interested mainly in the [[Languedoc]],<ref>Vaughan, 40\u201341</ref> and not particularly interested in politics; and Louis of Bourbon was a largely unimportant figure, owing to his personality (showing signs of mental instability) and status (since he was not the son of a king).\n\nDuring the rule of his uncles, the financial resources of the kingdom, painstakingly built up by his father, were squandered for the personal profit of the dukes, whose interests were frequently divergent or even opposing. During that time, the power of the royal administration was strengthened and taxes re-established. The latter policy represented a reversal of the deathbed decision of the king's father Charles V to repeal taxes, and led to tax revolts, known as the [[Harelle]]. Increased tax revenues were needed to support the self-serving policies of the king's uncles, whose interests were frequently in conflict with those of the crown and with each other.  The [[Battle of Roosebeke]] (1382), for example, brilliantly won by the royal troops, was prosecuted solely for the benefit of Philip of Burgundy. The treasury surplus carefully accumulated by Charles V was quickly squandered.\n\nCharles VI brought the regency to an end in 1388, taking up personal rule. He restored to power the highly competent advisors of Charles V, known as the [[Marmousets]],<ref>Vaughn, 42.</ref> who ushered in a new period of high esteem for the crown. Charles VI was widely referred to as ''Charles the Beloved'' by his subjects.\n\n===Wife and children===\n\nHe married [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] on 17 July 1385,<ref>Tracy Adams, ''The Life and Afterlife of Isabeau of Bavaria'', (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), 5.</ref> when he was 17 and she 14 (and considered an adult at the time). Isabeau had 12 children, most of whom died young. Isabeau's first child, named Charles, was born in 1386, and was [[Dauphin of Viennois]] (heir apparent), but survived only 3 months. Her second child, Joan, was born on 14 June 1388, but died in 1390. Her third child, [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]], was born in 1389. She was married to [[Richard II of England|Richard II, King of England]] in 1396, at the age of 6, and became Queen of England. Richard died in 1400 and they had no children. Richard's successor, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], wanted Isabella then to marry his son, 14-year-old future king [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], but she refused. She was married again in 1406, this time to her cousin, [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], at the age of 17. She died in childbirth at the age of 19.\n\nIsabeau's fourth child, [[Joan of France, Duchess of Brittany|Joan]], was born in 1391, and was married to [[John VI, Duke of Brittany]] in 1396, at an age of 5; they had children. Isabeau's fifth child born in 1392 was also named Charles, and was Dauphin. The young Charles was betrothed to [[Margaret of Burgundy, Dauphine of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] in 1396, but died at the age of 9. Isabeau's sixth child, [[Marie of Valois, Prioress of Poissy|Mary]], was born in 1393. She was never married, and had no children. Isabeau's seventh child, [[Michelle of Valois|Michelle]], was born in 1395. She was engaged to [[Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]], son of [[John the Fearless]], Duke of Burgundy, in 1404 (both were then aged 8) and they were married in 1409, aged 14. She had one child who died in infancy, before she died in 1422, aged 27.\n\nIsabeau's eighth child, [[Louis, Dauphin of France and Duke of Guyenne|Louis]], was born in 1397, and was also Dauphin. He married Margaret of Burgundy, who had previously been betrothed to his brother Charles. The marriage produced no children by the time of Louis's death in 1415, aged 18.\n\nIsabeau's ninth child, [[John, Dauphin of France and Duke of Touraine|John]], was born in 1398, and was also Dauphin from 1415, after the death of his brother Louis. He was married to [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]] in 1415, then aged 17, but they did not have any children before he died in 1417, aged 19. Isabeau's tenth child, [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], was born in 1401. She was married firstly to [[Henry V of England|Henry V, King of England]] in 1420, and they had one child, who became [[Henry VI of England]]. Henry V died suddenly in 1422. Catherine may then have secretly married [[Owen Tudor]] in 1429 and had additional children, including [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund Tudor]], the father of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. She died in 1437, aged 36.{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Couronnement de Charles VI le Bien-Aim\u00e9.jpg\n| width1 = 150px\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The coronation of Charles VI\n| image2 = Madness of Charles VI.jpg\n| width2 = 200px\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Charles seized by madness in the forest near Le Mans\n| footer = \n}}\n\nIsabeau's eleventh child, also named [[Charles VII of France|Charles]], was born in 1403. In 1413, Queen Isabeau and [[Yolande of Aragon]] finalized a marriage contract between Charles and Yolande's daughter [[Marie of Anjou]], Charles' second cousin. Since both Dauphin Louis and then Dauphin John died while in the care of [[John the Fearless]], the Duke of Burgundy and regent for Charles, Yolande became Charles' guardian. Charles became the new Dauphin in 1417 upon the death of his brother John. Now with the heir to the throne of France under her protection, Yolande refused Queen Isabeau's orders to return Charles to the French Court, reportedly replying, \"We have not nurtured and cherished this one for you to make him die like his brothers or to go mad like his father, or to become English like you. I keep him for my own. Come and take him away, if you dare.\" After the death of Charles VI in 1422, the English regents claimed the crown of France for Henry VI, then aged 1, according to the terms of the Treaty of Troyes. However, Charles, aged 19, repudiated the treaty and claimed the throne for himself as King Charles VII, sparking fresh fighting with the English. His marriage to Marie of Anjou in 1422 produced many children, most of whom died at a very early age. Charles VII died in 1461 at age 58, the most long-lived of Isabeau's children.\n\nIsabeau's twelfth and the last child, Philip, was born in 1407, but died shortly after.\n\n==Reign==\n===Mental illness===\n[[File:Charles VI double d'or La Rochelle 1420.jpg|thumb|A coin of Charles VI, a \"double d'or\", minted in [[La Rochelle]] in 1420]]\n\nCharles VI's early successes with the Marmousets as his counselors quickly dissipated as a result of the bouts of [[psychosis]] he experienced from his mid-twenties.  Mental illness may have been passed on for several generations through his mother, [[Joanna of Bourbon]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://eprints.utas.edu.au/11741/2/alger_whole_thesis.pdf|title=The Politics of Madness: Government in the Reigns of Charles VI and Henry V|last=Alger|first=Sarah|year=2001|pages=24}}</ref> Although still called by his subjects ''Charles the Beloved'', he became known also as ''Charles the Mad''.\n\nCharles's first known episode occurred in 1392 when his friend and advisor, [[Olivier de Clisson]], was the victim of an attempted murder. Although Clisson survived, Charles was determined to punish the would-be assassin, [[Pierre de Craon]], who had taken refuge in [[Brittany]]. [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] was unwilling to hand him over, so Charles prepared a military expedition.\n\nContemporaries said Charles appeared to be in a \"fever\" to begin the campaign and disconnected in his speech. Charles set off with an army on 1 July 1392. The progress of the army was slow, driving Charles into a frenzy of impatience. As the king and his escort were traveling through the forest near [[Le Mans]] on a hot August morning, a barefoot leper dressed in rags rushed up to the King's horse and grabbed his bridle. \"Ride no further, noble King!\" he yelled: \"Turn back! You are betrayed!\" The king's escorts beat the man back, but did not arrest him, and he followed the procession for half an hour, repeating his cries.<ref>W.H. Jervis, ''A History of France: from the Earliest Times to the Fall of the Second Empire in 1870'', (London: John Murray, 1884), 228, \u00a75; Jean Juvenal des Ursins, ''Histoire de Charles VI, Roy de France'', (Paris: A.

Michaud, 1813), 8:114 sub Charles VI.</ref> The company emerged from the forest at noon. A page who was drowsy from the sun dropped the king's lance, which clanged loudly against a steel helmet carried by another page. Charles shuddered, drew his sword and yelled \"Forward against the traitors! They wish to deliver me to the enemy!\" The king spurred his horse and began swinging his sword at his companions, fighting until one of his chamberlains and a group of soldiers were able to grab him from his mount and lay him on the ground. He lay still and did not react, but then fell into a coma. The king had killed a knight known as \"The Bastard of Polignac\" and several other men.<ref>M. Guizot, ''The History of France from the Earliest Times to the Year 1789'', Vol. 2, transl. Robert Black, (P.F. Collier & son, 1902), 189.</ref>\n\nPeriods of mental illness continued throughout the king's life. During one in 1393, he could not remember his name and did not know he was king. When his wife came to visit, he asked his servants who she was and ordered them to take care of what she required so that she would leave him alone.<ref>R.C. Famiglietti, ''Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392\u20131420'', New York, 1986, p. 4, citing the chronicle of the Religieux de Saint-Denis, ed. Bellaguet, II, pp. 86\u201388.</ref> During an episode in 1395\u201396 he claimed he was [[Saint George]] and that his coat of arms was a lion with a sword thrust through it.<ref>R.C. Famiglietti, ''Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392\u20131420'', New York, 1986, p. 5, citing the chronicle of the Religieux de Saint-Denis, ed. Bellaguet, II, pp. 404\u201305.</ref> At this time, he recognized all the officers of his household, but did not know his wife nor his children. Sometimes he ran wildly through the corridors of his Parisian residence, the [[H\u00f4tel Saint-Pol]], and to keep him inside, the entrances were walled up. In 1405, he refused to bathe or change his clothes for five months.<ref>R.C. Famiglietti, ''Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392\u20131420'', New York, 1986, p. 6, citing the chronicle of the Religieux de Saint-Denis, ed. Bellaguet, III, p. 348</ref> His later psychotic episodes were not described in detail, perhaps because of the similarity of his behavior and delusions. [[Pope Pius II]], who was born during the reign of Charles VI, wrote in his ''Commentaries'' that there were times when Charles thought that he was made of glass, and thus tried to protect himself in various ways so that he would not break. He reportedly had iron rods sewn into his clothes so that he would not shatter if he came into contact with another person.<ref>Enea Silvio Piccolomini (Papa Pio II), ''I Commentarii'', ed. L. Totaro, Milano, 1984, I, p. 1056.</ref> This condition has come to be known as [[glass delusion]].\n\nCharles VI's secretary, Pierre Salmon, spent much time in discussions with the king while he was intermittently psychotic. In an effort to find a cure for the king's illness, stabilize the turbulent political situation, and secure his own future, Salmon supervised the production of two distinct versions of the beautifully illuminated guidebooks to good kingship known as Pierre Salmon's ''Dialogues''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dialogues_de_Pierre_Salmon|title=Pierre Salmon's Dialogues \u2013 Wikicommons}}</ref>\n\n===''Bal des Ardents''===\n{{main|Bal des Ardents}}\n[[File:Le Bal des Ardents.jpg|thumb|The [[Bal des Ardents]], miniature of 1450\u201380 showing the dancers' costumes on fire.]]\n\nOn 29 January 1393, a masked ball, which later became known as the ''Bal des Ardents'' (\"Ball of the Burning Men\"), had been organized by Isabeau of Bavaria to celebrate the wedding of one of her ladies-in-waiting at the ''H\u00f4tel Saint-Pol''.

Nonetheless, the king's brother [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], who had arrived late, approached with a lighted torch in order to discover the identity of the masqueraders, and accidentally set one of them on fire. There was panic as the flames spread. The [[Joanna II of Auvergne|Duchess of Berry]] threw the train of her gown over the king in order to protect him.<ref>[[Froissart's Chronicles]], ed. T.

Another \u2013 Jean, son of the Lord of [[Nantouillet]] \u2013 saved himself by jumping into a dishwater tub.<ref>[[Froissart's Chronicles]], ed. T. Johnes, II (1855), p.550. Note that Froissart and the Religieux de Saint-Denis differ as to when the four men died. Huguet de Guisay had held the office of cupbearer of the king.</ref>\n\n===Expulsion of the Jews, 1394===\nOn 17 September 1394, Charles suddenly published an ordinance in which he declared, in substance, that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors of the [[Jews]] against [[Christians]], and that the [[prosecutor]]s had made several investigations and discovered that the Jews broke the agreement with the king on many occasions. Therefore, he decreed, as an irrevocable law and statute, that no Jew should dwell in his domains (\"Ordonnances\", vii. 675). According to the [[Michel Pintoin|Religieux de St. Denis]], the king signed this decree at the insistence of the queen (\"Chron. de Charles VI.\" ii. 119).<ref>History of the reign of Charles VI, titled ''Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422'', encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852.</ref> The decree was not immediately enforced, a respite being granted to the Jews in order that they have enough time to sell their property and pay their debts. Those indebted to them were enjoined to redeem their obligations within a set time; otherwise their pledges held in pawn were to be sold by the Jews. The provost was to escort the Jews to the frontier of the kingdom. Subsequently, the king released the Christians from their debts.\n\n===Struggles for power===\n{{House of Valois}}\nWith Charles VI mentally ill, from 1393 his wife Isabeau presided over a regency counsel, on which sat the grandees of the kingdom. Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who acted as regent during the king's minority (from 1380 to 1388), was a great influence on the queen (he had organized the royal marriage during his regency). Influence progressively shifted to [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], the king's brother, another contender for power, and it was suspected, the queen's lover.<ref name=\"Dignat\">Alban Dignat, ''23 novembre 1407: Assassinat dans la rue Vieille du Temple'', [http://www.herodote.net/histoire11230.htm herodote.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211173924/http://www.herodote.net/histoire11230.htm |date=11 December 2006 }}</ref> Charles VI's other uncles were less influential during the regency: [[Louis II of Naples]] was still engaged managing the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and [[John, Duke of Berry]], served as a mediator between the Orl\u00e9ans party (what would become the ''Armagnacs'') and the Burgundy party (''Bourguignons''). The rivalry would increase bit by bit and in the end result in outright civil war.\n\nThe new regents dismissed the various advisers and officials Charles had appointed. On the death of Philip the Bold in April 1404, his son John the Fearless took over the political aims of his father, and the feud with Louis escalated. John, who was less linked to Isabeau, again lost influence at court.\n\n===Wars with Burgundy and England===\nIn 1407, Louis of Orl\u00e9ans was murdered in the ''rue Vieille du Temple'' in Paris. John did not deny responsibility, claiming that Louis was a tyrant who squandered money. Louis' son [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Charles]], the new Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, turned to his father-in-law, [[Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac]], for support against John the Fearless. This resulted in the [[Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War]], which lasted from 1407 until 1435, beyond Charles' reign, though the war with the English was still in progress.\n\nWith the English taking over much of the country, John the Fearless sought to end the feud with the royal family by negotiating with the Dauphin [[Charles VII of France|Charles]], the king's heir. They met at the bridge at [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne|Montereau]] on 10 September 1419, but during the meeting, John was killed by [[Tanneguy du Chastel]], a follower of the Dauphin. John's successor, [[Philip the Good]], the new Duke of Burgundy, threw in his lot with the English.\n\n===English invasion and death===\nCharles VI's reign was marked by the continuing conflict with the English, known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. An early attempt at peace occurred in 1396 when Charles' daughter, the almost seven-year-old [[Isabella of Valois]], married the 29-year-old [[Richard II of England]]. By 1415, however, the feud between the French royal family and the House of Burgundy led to chaos and anarchy throughout France that [[Henry V of England]] was eager to take advantage of. [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry led an invasion]] that culminated in the defeat of the French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in October.\n\nIn May 1420, Henry V and Charles VI signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], which named Henry as Charles' successor, and stipulated that Henry's heirs would succeed him on the throne of France. It disinherited the Dauphin Charles, then only 17 years old. (In 1421, it was further claimed that the young Charles was illegitimate.) The treaty also betrothed Charles VI's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]], to Henry (see [[English Kings of France]]). Disinheriting the Dauphin in favor of Henry was a blatant act against the interests of the French aristocracy.\n\nThe Dauphin responded by declaring himself regent for his father. He seized royal authority, and defied his father's order to return to Paris. He established a court at [[Bourges]].<ref>R.C. Famiglietti, ''Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392\u20131420'', New York, 1986, Chapter X.</ref>\n\nCharles VI died on 21 October 1422 in Paris, at the ''H\u00f4tel Saint-Pol''. He was interred in [[Saint Denis Basilica]], where his wife Isabeau of Bavaria would join him after her death in September 1435.\n\nHenry V had died in August 1422, leaving an infant son, who was [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI of England]]. Therefore, according to the Treaty of Troyes, with the death of Charles VI, little Henry became King of France. His coronation as such was in Paris (held by the English since 1418) at the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] on 26 December 1431.\n\nThe disinherited Dauphin Charles remained at Bourges until 1429, when [[Joan of Arc]] arrived. After she led his forces to victory, he was crowned in [[Reims Cathedral]] as King [[Charles VII of France]] on 17 July 1429. He became known as \"Charles the Victorious\".<ref>Chartier, Jean, ''Chronique de Charles VII, Roi de France'', publi\u00e9 avec notes par Vallet de Viriville, Paris 1858</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Ancestors===\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Due to concerns caused by [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], most major networks and cable network groups have cancelled their public upfront events due to both public health concerns, and [[stay-at-home order]]s which effectively disallow them to go forward. It is expected most of the upfront announcements will be either [[press release]]s or virtual video events via [[videotelephony]], and may be delayed due to [[television pilot|pilots]] being unable to be produced, along with an overall decline in advertising overall.<ref>[https://deadline.com/2020/03/coronavirus-tv-networks-upfronts-canceled-nbc-cbs-abc-1202881244/ Disney Axes Upfronts Over Coronavirus; NBC, CBS, Fox, CW & WarnerMedia Already Canceled \u2013 UPDATE], ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'', 12 March 2020.

Nonetheless, a chain of Russian pickets was established on the [[Bukhtarma River]], north of Lake Zaysan.<ref>{{harvnb|Abramof|1865|p=66}}</ref> Thus the border between the two empires in the Irtysh basin became roughly delineated, with a (sparse) chain of guard posts on both sides.\n\nThe situation on the Zaysan in the mid-19th century is described in a report by A.Abramof (1865). Even though the Zaysan region was recognized by both parties as part of the Qing Empire, it had been annually used by fishing expeditions sent by the [[Siberian Cossacks|Siberian Cossack Host]]. These summer expeditions started in 1803, and in 1822-25 their range was expanded through the entire Lake Zaysan and to the mouth of the Black Irtysh. Through the mid-19th century, the Qing presence on the upper Irtysh was mostly limited to the annual visit of the Qing ''[[amban]]'' from [[Chuguchak]] to one of the Cossacks' fishing stations (''Batavski Piket'').<ref>{{harvnb|Abramof|1865|pp=62\u201363}}; see also the border shown on the map before p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was established along the line fairly similar to China's modern border with Russia and Kazakhstan by the [[Convention of Peking]] of 1860.<ref>Articles 2 and 3 in the [[:ru:s:\u041f\u0435\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 (1860)|Russian text of the treaty]]</ref> The actual border line pursuant to the convention was drawn by the Protocol of [[Chuguchak]] (1864), leaving Lake Zaysan on the Russian side.<ref>(See [[:File:China-Russia border - protocol of Chuguchak 1864.jpg|the map]])</ref><ref>[http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh98/frontier/en2.html The Lost Frontier: the treaty maps that changed Qing's northwestern boundaries]</ref> The Qing Empire's military presence in the Irtysh basin crumbled during the [[Dungan revolt (1862\u201377)]].

Through the mid-19th century, the Qing presence on the upper Irtysh was mostly limited to the annual visit of the Qing ''[[amban]]'' from [[Chuguchak]] to one of the Cossacks' fishing stations (''Batavski Piket'').<ref>{{harvnb|Abramof|1865|pp=62\u201363}}; see also the border shown on the map before p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was established along the line fairly similar to China's modern border with Russia and Kazakhstan by the [[Convention of Peking]] of 1860.<ref>Articles 2 and 3 in the [[:ru:s:\u041f\u0435\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 (1860)|Russian text of the treaty]]</ref> The actual border line pursuant to the convention was drawn by the Protocol of [[Chuguchak]] (1864), leaving Lake Zaysan on the Russian side.<ref>(See [[:File:China-Russia border - protocol of Chuguchak 1864.jpg|the map]])</ref><ref>[http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh98/frontier/en2.html The Lost Frontier: the treaty maps that changed Qing's northwestern boundaries]</ref> The Qing Empire's military presence in the Irtysh basin crumbled during the [[Dungan revolt (1862\u201377)]].

The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of [[Telephone booth | public phone boxes]] in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's [[Premier of Victoria | Premier]]; [[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing and was made a prime suspect. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed in [[St. Albans, Victoria | St. Albans]]. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997, matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue Brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided an house of an associate known to both Reed and the Minogue Brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the associate's home matched to the components used in the construction of the bomb. Under police questioning, the associate stated that he saw Craig Minogue drive the Commodore identical to the Commodore used in the bombing into the garage of the associate's home. The associate also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for the associate and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney before the bombing with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. The associate then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney, he saw the Minogue Brothers moving from the associate's home.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing [[fingerprint]]s belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before His Honour Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.  Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing [[fingerprint]]s belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before His Honour Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.  Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. Although Minogue thus became eligible for parole in 2016, the Victorian Parliament has twice legislated to keep him in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/new-laws-set-to-keep-russell-street-bomber-craig-minogue-behind-bars-for-life-20180723-p4zt6b.html|title=New laws set to keep Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue behind bars for life|last=Cunningham|first=Melissa|date=2018-07-23|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> Minogue and Reed have both been recently charged with sexual assault offences that allegedly occurred just prior to the bombing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-23/russell-street-bomber-and-acquitted-man-charged-over-1980s-rapes/11143542|title=Police charge Russell Street bomber over cold case gang rape|last=Asher|first=Nicole|last2=staff|date=2019-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn 1995, police headquarters moved to the Victoria Police Centre with the old headquarters many years later redeveloped into an apartment complex.{{cn|date=August 2016}} Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie, who was shot by Reed, later recovered from his wounds, but eventually left the police force; in July 2014, he died by suicide, aged 61.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/russell-street-bombing-claims-last-victim-20140718-3c6k4.html|title=Russell Street Bombing claims last victim|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2014-07-19|work=The Age|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n* ''[[Phoenix (TV series)|Phoenix]]'' \u2013 a 1992\u20131993 13-part Australian police drama television series loosely based on the Russell Street bombing\n* The case was covered by ''[[Casefile True Crime Podcast]]'' on 2 and 9 July 2016.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Explosions in 1986]]\n[[Category:March 1986 events in Oceania]]\n[[Category:History of Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1986 crimes in Australia]]\n[[Category:Murder in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Car and truck bombings in Australia]]\n[[Category:Organised crime events in Australia]]\n[[Category:Attacks on police stations]]\n[[Category:1980s in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1980s murders in Australia]]\n[[Category:1986 murders in Oceania]]\n[[Category:Terrorist incidents in Australia in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Terrorist incidents in Oceania in 1986]]\n[[Category:Murdered Australian police officers]]\n", "name_user": "Jpts1107", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eArrests", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Street_bombing"}

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = \n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], United States\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show'' (also known as ''The Island of Sanity'')\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = {{CAN}}\n|prevshow    =Greenline \n|website     = \n|spouse=Deborah Green|awards=}}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[radio personality]], [[journalist]], and [[author]], best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHonours and awards:Rearranged paragraph.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

The [[Conservative Party of Quebec (historical)|Quebec Conservative Party]], led by Premier [[Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau]], defeated the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] led by [[Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini\u00e8re]].\n\n== Creation of Quebec ==\n\nThe province of Quebec was created on July 1, 1867, with the proclamation of the ''British North America Act, 1867''.  That Act united the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] into [[Canada]].  The Province of Canada was split into two provinces, with [[Canada East]] (formerly [[Lower Canada]]) becoming the new province of Quebec.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-6.html ''British North America Act, 1867'', s. 6 &#91;now known as the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''&#93;.]</ref> The [[Legislature of Quebec]] was composed of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec|Lieutenant Governor]], representing the Queen;  the elected [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec|Legislative Assembly]], with sixty-five seats;  and the appointed [[Legislative Council]].<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-71.html ''British North America Act, 1867'', s. 71.]</ref><ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-80.html ''British North America Act, 1867'', s. 80.]</ref>\n\nBecause the old Province of Canada was dissolved on July 1, 1867, the former government ceased to exist, with no formal provisions for the creation of the government of Quebec.  The first prime minister of Canada, [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]], had planned to have the experienced Quebec politician, [[Joseph-\u00c9douard Cauchon]], appointed as the first premier.  However, the proposal met strong opposition from Montreal anglophones, based on Cauchon's position on public and religious schools, which was a major political issue at the time.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cauchon_joseph_edouard_11E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'':  \"Cauchon, Joseph-\u00c9douard\".]</ref>  As a compromise candidate, the Quebec Conservatives proposed [[Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau]], who had political experience in the Province of Canada but had been out of electoral politics for twelve years.  Chauveau was generally acceptable to Quebec Conservatives, and on July 15, 1867, the Lieutenant Governor appointed him as the first premier of Quebec.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/chauveau_pierre_joseph_olivier_11E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'':  \"Chauveau, Pierre-Joseph-Olivier\".]</ref><ref>[http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/patrimoine/pm.html Quebec National Assembly:  Premiers ministres du Qu\u00e9bec depuis 1867.]</ref>\n\n== Franchise and candidacy ==\n\n=== Right to vote ===\n\nThe right to vote in elections to the Legislative Assembly was not universal.  Only male British subjects (by birth or naturalisation), aged 21 and older, were eligible to vote, and only if they met a property qualification. For residents of cities and towns, the qualification was being the owner, tenant or occupant of real property assessed at three hundred dollars, or at an assessed yearly value of thirty dollars.  For residents of townships and parishes, the requirements were either an assessment of two hundred dollars, or an assessed yearly value of twenty dollars.<ref name=BNA67-84>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-84.html#h-12 ''British North America Act, 1867'', s. 84.]</ref><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/75?r=0&s=1 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 1859, c. 6, s. 4.]</ref>\n\nWomen were expressly prohibited from voting, \"for any Electoral Division whatever\".<ref name=BNA67-84/><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/75?r=0&s=1 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 3.]</ref>\n\nJudges and many municipal and provincial officials were also barred from voting, particularly officials with duties relating to public revenue. Election officials were also barred from voting.<ref name = BNA67-84/><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/75?r=0&s=1 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', ss. 1 and 2.]</ref>\n\n=== Qualification for the Legislative Assembly ===\n\nCandidates for the Legislative Assembly had to meet a significant property qualification.  A candidate had to own real property in the Province of Canada, worth at least \u00a3500 in [[Pound sterling|British sterling]], over and above any encumbrances on the property.<ref name=BNA67-84/><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/24?r=0&s=1 ''Act of Union 1840'' (UK), c. 35, s. 27.]</ref><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/97?r=0&s=1 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 36.]</ref>\n\n== Party structure ==\n\nChauveau appointed the first Cabinet, and then called the first general election for Quebec.  Chauveau had been a member of the [[Parti Bleu]] when he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, and the Bleus were transitioning into the new Conservative party of Quebec. The Bleus had been well-organised under the leadership of [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], and the new Conservative party inherited that structure.\n\nOn the other hand, the liberals in the new province were not well-organised.  The old [[Parti Rouge]] had opposed the confederation project, and had tended to split on that issue.  Transitioning into the [[Liberal Party of Quebec]], they did not have a strong party structure going into the election.  They did not field a complete slate of candidates, and did not even have a leader, as many of their influential leaders had opted for federal politics and were now in Ottawa.  [[Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini\u00e8re]] was the informal leader of the Liberals, because of his political experience in the former Province of Canada.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/joly_de_lotbiniere_henri_gustave_13E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography:''  \"Joly de Lotbini\u00e8re, Sir Henri-Gustave\".]</ref>\n\n==  Electoral map ==\n\nThe Legislative Assembly was composed of sixty-five [[single-member district|single-member constituencies]] or \"ridings\".  The 1867 election was conducted under the pre-Confederation electoral map of the former [[Province of Canada]].  That map had set the boundaries for the sixty-five constituencies of [[Canada East]], which became Quebec. The ''British North America Act, 1867'' provided that the pre-Confederation electoral map would continue to be used for Quebec elections until altered by the Legislature of Quebec.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-80.html#h-12 ''Constitution Act, 1867'', s. 80.]</ref>  The map of the sixty-five constituencies was also to be used in federal elections, until altered by Parliament.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-40.html#h-6 ''Constitution Act, 1867'', s. 40.]</ref>\n\n== Conduct of the election ==\n\nThe 1867 election was conducted under the election laws of the Province of Canada, which had been continued until altered by the Legislature of Quebec.<ref name =BNA67-84/> The electoral process of the Province of Canada in turn had been based on the traditional British electoral process, without a secret ballot. Instead, elections were public affairs, with each voter publicly stating the name of the candidate they voted for.\n\nThe election process began with writs of election issued by the [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery#Canadian Clerks of the Crown in Chancery|Clerk of the Crown in Chancery]], one for each constituency (also called a \"riding\").  The writ was directed to the [[Returning Officer]] for each constituency and required the Returning Officer to hold a public nomination of candidates, and if necessary a poll, on days to be chosen by the Returning Officer.<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/93?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 31.]</ref>\n\nOn the nomination day, the Returning Officer held a public meeting \"in the open air\", at a central place in the constituency, and in a place where the public had access, such as in front of a town hall or church in the constituency.  The Returning Officer addressed the assembled members of the public from a platform, called a \"[[husting]]\", and called for nominations.  If only one person was nominated, the Returning Officer would close the nominations and declare that person elected.  If more than one person was nominated, the Returning Officer would grant a poll, to be held at a future date, chosen by the Returning Officer.<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/96?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 34.]</ref>\n\nOn polling day, polls would be held across the constituency.  The polls were in held in the open air, or in buildings close to the highways, with free access by the public.  It was prohibited to hold a poll in a \"tavern or place of public entertainment\".<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/99?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 38.]</ref>  The Returning Officer would appoint a Deputy Returning Officer for each polling place, normally the town clerk or other municipal official.  Each Deputy Returning Officer would have a poll book.  Qualified voters would appear before the Deputy Returning Officer and declare how they voted. The Deputy Returning Officer would record each voter's vote in the poll book.<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/107?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', ss. 51, 52.]</ref> At the close of the polls, the Deputy Returning Officers would deliver the poll books to the Returning Officer.

That Act united the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] into [[Canada]].  The Province of Canada was split into two provinces, with [[Canada East]] (formerly [[Lower Canada]]) becoming the new province of Quebec.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-6.html ''British North America Act, 1867'', s. 6 &#91;now known as the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''&#93;.]</ref> The [[Legislature of Quebec]] was composed of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec|Lieutenant Governor]], representing the Queen;  the elected [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec|Legislative Assembly]], with sixty-five seats;  and the appointed [[Legislative Council]].<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-71.html ''British North America Act, 1867'', s. 71.]</ref><ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-80.html ''British North America Act, 1867'', s. 80.]</ref>\n\nBecause the old Province of Canada was dissolved on July 1, 1867, the former government ceased to exist, with no formal provisions for the creation of the government of Quebec.  The first prime minister of Canada, [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]], had planned to have the experienced Quebec politician, [[Joseph-\u00c9douard Cauchon]], appointed as the first premier.  However, the proposal met strong opposition from Montreal anglophones, based on Cauchon's position on public and religious schools, which was a major political issue at the time.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cauchon_joseph_edouard_11E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'':  \"Cauchon, Joseph-\u00c9douard\".]</ref>  As a compromise candidate, the Quebec Conservatives proposed [[Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau]], who had political experience in the Province of Canada but had been out of electoral politics for twelve years.  Chauveau was generally acceptable to Quebec Conservatives, and on July 15, 1867, the Lieutenant Governor appointed him as the first premier of Quebec.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/chauveau_pierre_joseph_olivier_11E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'':  \"Chauveau, Pierre-Joseph-Olivier\".]</ref><ref>[http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/patrimoine/pm.html Quebec National Assembly:  Premiers ministres du Qu\u00e9bec depuis 1867.]</ref>\n\n== Franchise and candidacy ==\n\n=== Right to vote ===\n\nThe right to vote in elections to the Legislative Assembly was not universal.  Only male British subjects (by birth or naturalisation), aged 21 and older, were eligible to vote, and only if they met a property qualification. For residents of cities and towns, the qualification was being the owner, tenant or occupant of real property assessed at three hundred dollars, or at an assessed yearly value of thirty dollars.  For residents of townships and parishes, the requirements were either an assessment of two hundred dollars, or an assessed yearly value of twenty dollars.<ref name=BNA67-84>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-84.html#h-12 ''British North America Act, 1867'', s. 84.]</ref><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/75?r=0&s=1 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 1859, c. 6, s. 4.]</ref>\n\nWomen were expressly prohibited from voting, \"for any Electoral Division whatever\".<ref name=BNA67-84/><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/75?r=0&s=1 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 3.]</ref>\n\nJudges and many municipal and provincial officials were also barred from voting, particularly officials with duties relating to public revenue.

A candidate had to own real property in the Province of Canada, worth at least \u00a3500 in [[Pound sterling|British sterling]], over and above any encumbrances on the property.<ref name=BNA67-84/><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/24?r=0&s=1 ''Act of Union 1840'' (UK), c. 35, s. 27.]</ref><ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/97?r=0&s=1 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 36.]</ref>\n\n== Party structure ==\n\nChauveau appointed the first Cabinet, and then called the first general election for Quebec.  Chauveau had been a member of the [[Parti Bleu]] when he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, and the Bleus were transitioning into the new Conservative party of Quebec. The Bleus had been well-organised under the leadership of [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], and the new Conservative party inherited that structure.\n\nOn the other hand, the liberals in the new province were not well-organised.  The old [[Parti Rouge]] had opposed the confederation project, and had tended to split on that issue.  Transitioning into the [[Liberal Party of Quebec]], they did not have a strong party structure going into the election.  They did not field a complete slate of candidates, and did not even have a leader, as many of their influential leaders had opted for federal politics and were now in Ottawa.  [[Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini\u00e8re]] was the informal leader of the Liberals, because of his political experience in the former Province of Canada.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/joly_de_lotbiniere_henri_gustave_13E.html ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography:''  \"Joly de Lotbini\u00e8re, Sir Henri-Gustave\".]</ref>\n\n==  Electoral map ==\n\nThe Legislative Assembly was composed of sixty-five [[single-member district|single-member constituencies]] or \"ridings\".  The 1867 election was conducted under the pre-Confederation electoral map of the former [[Province of Canada]].  That map had set the boundaries for the sixty-five constituencies of [[Canada East]], which became Quebec. The ''British North America Act, 1867'' provided that the pre-Confederation electoral map would continue to be used for Quebec elections until altered by the Legislature of Quebec.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-80.html#h-12 ''Constitution Act, 1867'', s. 80.]</ref>  The map of the sixty-five constituencies was also to be used in federal elections, until altered by Parliament.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/section-40.html#h-6 ''Constitution Act, 1867'', s. 40.]</ref>\n\n== Conduct of the election ==\n\nThe 1867 election was conducted under the election laws of the Province of Canada, which had been continued until altered by the Legislature of Quebec.<ref name =BNA67-84/> The electoral process of the Province of Canada in turn had been based on the traditional British electoral process, without a secret ballot. Instead, elections were public affairs, with each voter publicly stating the name of the candidate they voted for.\n\nThe election process began with writs of election issued by the [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery#Canadian Clerks of the Crown in Chancery|Clerk of the Crown in Chancery]], one for each constituency (also called a \"riding\").  The writ was directed to the [[Returning Officer]] for each constituency and required the Returning Officer to hold a public nomination of candidates, and if necessary a poll, on days to be chosen by the Returning Officer.<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/93?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 31.]</ref>\n\nOn the nomination day, the Returning Officer held a public meeting \"in the open air\", at a central place in the constituency, and in a place where the public had access, such as in front of a town hall or church in the constituency.  The Returning Officer addressed the assembled members of the public from a platform, called a \"[[husting]]\", and called for nominations.  If only one person was nominated, the Returning Officer would close the nominations and declare that person elected.  If more than one person was nominated, the Returning Officer would grant a poll, to be held at a future date, chosen by the Returning Officer.<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/96?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 34.]</ref>\n\nOn polling day, polls would be held across the constituency.  The polls were in held in the open air, or in buildings close to the highways, with free access by the public.  It was prohibited to hold a poll in a \"tavern or place of public entertainment\".<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/99?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 38.]</ref>  The Returning Officer would appoint a Deputy Returning Officer for each polling place, normally the town clerk or other municipal official.  Each Deputy Returning Officer would have a poll book.  Qualified voters would appear before the Deputy Returning Officer and declare how they voted. The Deputy Returning Officer would record each voter's vote in the poll book.<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/107?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', ss. 51, 52.]</ref> At the close of the polls, the Deputy Returning Officers would deliver the poll books to the Returning Officer.  The Returning Officer would then total all of the polls in public, at the place where the nominations had occurred, declare which candidate was elected, and issue a proclamation declaring the election closed.<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/111?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', ss. 64, 65.]</ref>  The Returning Officer would then send a report of the election with the return of the writ to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, within fifteen days after the closing of the election.<ref>[http://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_00918/112?r=undefined&s=2 ''An Act respecting Elections of Members of the Legislature'', s. 67.]</ref>\n\nThe elections for the sixty-five provincial constituencies were not all conducted on the same day.

There are a total of four yugas\u2014''[[Satya Yuga]]'', ''[[Treta Yuga]],'' ''[[Dvapara Yuga]], and'' ''[[Kali Yuga]]''\u2014each having 1/4 less duration and [[dharma]] than the previous (''Satya'' most, ''Kali'' least).\n\nA '''Maha Yuga''' ({{lang-sa|\u092e\u0939\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0917|mah\u0101yuga|great age}}), also known as a '''Chatur Yuga''' ({{lang-sa|\u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0917|caturyuga|four ages}}), is an [[unit of time|epoch]] or [[era]] much larger than any one yuga. A ''Maha Yuga'' is cyclical and contains a cycle of the four yugas. Each ''Maha Yuga'' consists of a descending set of the yugas: (S,T,D,K) (S,T,D,K). Some modern scholars believe each ''Maha Yuga'' consists of much shorter descending and ascending sets of the yugas: (S,T,D,K,K,D,T,S) (S,T,D,K,K,D,T,S). \n\nMost accept that the current yuga is ''Kali Yuga''. (See [[Kali Yuga]]). Amongst the modern scholars, some believe we are in ascending ''Kali Yuga'',<ref name=\"PTIAscendKaliYuga\"></ref> while others believe we are in ascending ''Dvapara Yuga''.<ref name=\"HSAscendDvaparaYuga\"></ref>\n\n== Yuga characteristics ==\n\nThere are a total of four yugas\u2014''[[Satya Yuga]]'', ''[[Treta Yuga]],'' ''[[Dvapara Yuga]], and'' ''[[Kali Yuga]]''\u2014each having 1/4 less duration and [[dharma]] than the previous (''Satya'' most, ''Kali'' least). The descending yugas see a '''gradual decline''' of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, lifespan, emotional and physical strength.\n\nWithin each yuga, there is a starting ''Sandhya'' and ending ''Sandhyansa'' which lasts 1/10<sup>th</sup> the duration of their respective yugas.{{Citation needed}} Most of the characteristic changes can happen in these ''Sandhyas'' and ''Sandhyansas'', especially when the change is from ''Kali Yuga'' to ''Satya Yuga''.{{Citation needed}}\n\n* '''[[Satya Yuga]]''' (''Krita Yuga'', \"The age of truth\" or \"[[Golden Age#Hindu|Golden Age]]\"): The first and best yuga. It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The ''Krita Yuga'' was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Virtue reigns supreme. Human stature was 21 cubits (33 ft 6 inches). Average human lifespan was 100,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n* '''[[Treta Yuga]]''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} There was 3 quarter virtue and 1 quarter sin. Normal human stature was 14 cubits (22 ft 4 inches). Average human lifespan was 10,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n* '''[[Dvapara Yuga]]''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} There was 1 half virtue and 1 half sin. Normal human stature was 7 cubits (11 ft 2 inches). Average human lifespan was 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n* '''[[Kali Yuga]]''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance.

{"title_page": "Official versions of Doom", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Official versions of ''Doom''}}\n''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' is one of the most widely [[Porting|ported]] [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]]s. Starting with the original [[MS-DOS]] [[Personal computer|PC]] version (released as [[shareware]] on December 10, 1993), it has been released officially for a number of [[operating system]]s, [[video game console]]s, [[handheld game console]]s, and other devices. Some of the ports are replications of the MS-DOS version, while others differ considerably, including modifications to the level designs and monsters, with some ports offering content not included in the original MS-DOS version.\n\nAfter ''Doom''{{'}}s [[source code]] was released to the public on December 23, 1997, several [[List of Doom source ports|source ports]] were created by fans to allow the original PC version to run on modern operating systems.\n\n==Personal computers==\n\n===MS-DOS===\n\n====Original version====\n''Doom''{{'}}s initial release on December 10, 1993 was for MS-DOS and had 320x200 pixel resolution. The releases include:\n\n* 1.0 (December 10, 1993) - Initial release. The internal program number reads v0.99.\n* 1.1 (December 16, 1993) - Fixed some bugs in the 1.0 release.\n* 1.2 (February 17, 1994) - Added support for modem play and new difficulty level called ''Nightmare''.\n* 1.4 (June 28, 1994), 1.5 (July 8, 1994), and 1.6 (August 3, 1994) were minor updates, and only available to testers.\n* 1.666 (September 1, 1994) - Contained improved network code and a new version of deathmatch called ''Deathmatch 2.0''. In addition, the [[swastika]] pattern in episode 1, map 4 was altered.<ref>[http://rome.ro/lee_killough/memorabilia/swastika.shtml Photos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720230535/http://www.rome.ro/lee_killough/memorabilia/swastika.shtml |date=2008-07-20 }} at John Romero's website.</ref>\n* 1.7 (October 11, 1994) - Contained IWAD changes and lacked the ''DeathManager!'' front end multiplayer game launcher.\n* 1.7a (November 8, 1994) - Contained sound code changes and included version 1.1 of the ''DeathManager!'' front end multiplayer game launcher.\n* 1.8 (January 23, 1995) - Updated the ''Doom'' FAQ.\n* 1.9 (February 1, 1995) - Final release.\n\n====''The Ultimate Doom''====\nOn April 30, 1995, an upgraded version of the game, ''The Ultimate Doom'', was released, which contained an additional fourth episode, entitled \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", in addition to the original three episodes, which are \"Knee Deep In The Dead\", \"The Shores Of Hell\", and \"Inferno\".\n\n===NeXTSTEP===\nThis was the version that the MS-DOS product emerged from, since, at the time, [[id Software]] was using a [[NeXTcube]] for its graphic-engine development. This version is sluggish on anything below an 040 NeXTstation/cube (though it runs smoother with a higher amount of memory), and is missing sound, which was added on the PC side. With NeXT-Step based on i486 architecture, it ran smoothly under all conditions up to screen sizes of 400% with newer hardware. The version running on NeXT is 1.2, programmed by John Carmack, John Romero, and Dave Taylor.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===OS/2===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[OS/2]] by an independent contractor, Jim Thomas, who was hired by [[IBM]] to port it and ''SimCity''.<ref>http://stuff.mit.edu/activities/os2/diverepo.html</ref> A successful version was demoed in 1994 running in an OS/2 [[Presentation Manager|PM]] window, and the last version, 2.19 beta, was released in 1997.<ref>http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-viewer.php?dir=/pub/os2/games/action/doom&file=dmos219s.zip</ref>\n\n===IRIX===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[IRIX]] during the summer of 1994 by [[Dave D. Taylor]]. It was designed to run on IRIX 5.2 and later. IRIX ''Doom'' was originally based on the unreleased MS-DOS version 1.5, though later updates were based on versions 1.6 and 1.8. No effort was made to take advantage of [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]'s advanced graphics hardware, and like many other ports the game was rendered entirely in [[software rendering]] mode.\n\n===Solaris===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] in late 1994, and was designed to run with game files from ''Doom'' 1.8. In the readme, the port is credited to \"Dave Taylor and the rest of the folks at id Software\".  It runs on Solaris 2.4 and later. The distribution contained two versions: one for regular X11, and another for Sun DGA.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Mac OS===\n''Doom'' for Mac was released on November 4, 1994. ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'' were ported by Lion Entertainment and released by GT Interactive using a Mac OS launcher application to run original PC WADs. The Mac version runs on [[System 7]] through [[Mac OS 9]] and requires a [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[PowerPC]] processor. Although it can run in [[Classic Environment|Classic]] under [[OS X|Mac OS X]] on [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]; [[Mac OS X Panther|Panther]] and [[Mac OS X Tiger|Tiger]] cause graphic artifacts due to the later version of Classic having a double-buffered screen. In addition to an adjustable viewport, it supports rendering at low or high resolutions, and allows network play over [[AppleTalk]] as well as IPX.\n\n===Linux===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[Linux]] by [[id Software]] programmer Dave Taylor in 1994. The last Linux ''Doom'' binaries were provided by id Software on October 13, 1996 through the company's ftp-server.\n\nThe source code to the Linux version of ''Doom'' was released by [[id Software]] on December 23, 1997 under a non-profit [[End user license agreement]]; it was re-released on October 3, 1999 under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. The source code to the [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions of the game was not released. This was due to copyright issues concerning the sound library used by original MS-DOS version and id Software having no access to the source code of the Microsoft Windows port.<ref>John Carmack.

It was compatible with [[Windows 95]] and up, and was able to use WADs from the MS-DOS versions. It also allowed users to set up multiplayer games much easier than in DOS. It was included with ''[[Final Doom]]''. The port was project-led by [[Gabe Newell]] and other later founders of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]].<ref>[http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/167253-gabe-newell-made-windows-a-viable-gaming-platform-and-linux-is-next Gabe Newell made Windows a viable gaming platform, and Linux is next - Extreme Tech, September 24, 2013 (article by Sebastian Anthony)]</ref>\n\nOn September 26, 2001, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom Collector's Edition]]'' was released, containing ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth|Doom II]]'', and ''[[Final Doom]]''. It was re-released on January 1, 2004<ref>[http://pc.ign.com/objects/691/691517.html IGN: Doom (Collector's Edition)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with added preview content for ''[[Doom 3]]''. Some early versions of ''Doom 3'' included the Collector's Edition and a small demon figurine as a bonus. The ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition|BFG Edition]]'' of ''Doom 3'', released on October 15, 2012, includes ''The Ultimate Doom'' as well as ''Doom II''.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'' were released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. This release runs the original MS-DOS versions of the game using [[DOSBox]], an MS-DOS emulator.\n\n===Acorn RISC OS===\n''Doom'' was released for the [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[Risc PC]] by R-Comp Interactive in 1998. Within a few months, a significantly enhanced version was delivered as an update called ''Doom+''. That version runs on the older [[Acorn Archimedes]] computers and, apart from speed improvements, adds several features not present in the original DOS release.<ref>[http://gerph.org/riscos/ramble/doomplus.html Justin Fletcher, author of Doom+. December 20, 2012]</ref> It was made available including ''Doom'', ''Doom II'', ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Master Levels for Doom II'', and approximately 3000 user levels released into the [[Public Domain]].\n\n==Consoles==\n\n===Sega 32X===\nThe [[32X]] version of ''Doom'' was developed and published by [[Sega]] and was released on November 21, 1994.<ref>{{cite web | title=Sega unleashes arcade power for the home; Genesis 32X delivers 40 times the power of 16-bit systems | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1994_Nov_21/ai_15891848/ |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=November 21, 1994 |accessdate=2011-05-13}}</ref> It features 17 of the 18 levels from the first two episodes, but none from episode three. This version lacks multiplayer support, does not play in a full screen, and only has the front sprites for the monsters. 10 levels are missing from the original version (twice as many missing levels as any other version of the game). A [[COMMAND.COM|DOS prompt]] shows up after the credits roll if the player finishes the game either using cheats or starting from any level other than the first level, locking up the game.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Buyers Beware|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=82|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1995|page=112}}</ref> Similarly, the secret level cannot be accessed in these scenarios. Due to the lack of the third episode, the [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]] can only be obtained through the use of cheats. Due to poor use of the Mega Drive/Genesis [[YM2612]] sound chip, this version's soundtrack is considered inferior to that of other versions, and many of the sound effects are missing. As with most mid-90s console ports, the levels come from the Atari Jaguar version. This version does not feature the Cyberdemon, the Spider Mastermind, or the Spectre. There is a level select option that allows the player to start on any of the first fifteen levels, although there is no way to save the game or settings.\n\nIn 1995, the 32X version of the game was given a score of 30 out of 40 by ''[[Famicom Ts\u016bshin]]''.<ref>\u304a\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1!! \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8 \u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0!!: DOOM ~\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30e0~.

It features 22 of the PC version's 27 levels, though many of them are simplified, and two levels (\"Tower of Babel\" and \"Hell Keep\") are entirely different from the PC levels of the same names.<ref>[http://classicdoom.com/doomcomp.htm Doom Comparison Guide], ClassicDOOM.com. Refer to \"PC Doom/Ultimate Doom and Atari Jaguar Doom map level comparison\".</ref> Unlike the 32X, SNES, and 3DO versions, this version of the game display occupies the full screen, albeit with an opaque status bar at the bottom. The game runs at a fairly constant and fluid frame-rate. The levels use more complex lighting effects, but have less variation in floor depth and ceiling height. It lacks the Cyberdemon, the Spider Mastermind, and the Spectre. It is compatible with the JagLink 2-console networking device for two players to play deathmatch.<ref name=\"EGM65\">{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Doom|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|page=348}}</ref> The Jaguar version does not have any music during gameplay, but plays the title theme and intermission music with new instruments. Game settings and progress through the levels are saved automatically, and the player can start a new game anywhere up to the last level reached. Instead of having to cycle through the selection of weapons, the player can select a weapon by pressing its corresponding button on the controller's number pad.<ref name=\"EGM65\"/>\n\n''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' gave it four out of five stars and called it \"Definitely the best Jaguar title we've seen so far.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=January 1995|page=92}}</ref>\n\n===Super NES===\nThe Super NES version of ''Doom'' was published by Williams Entertainment and developed by [[Sculptured Software]] and released on September 1, 1995. Randy Linden, the head programmer, created a new game engine called the Reality engine for the port. The game makes use of the [[Super FX]] powered GSU-2 chip (often referred to as the Super FX 2 chip), and was one of the few SNES games to feature a colored cartridge: ''Doom'' came in a red cartridge in the United States; a black or standard gray cartridge in Europe; and a red, black, or gray cartridge in Australia.\n\nThe SNES version of ''Doom'' features all five of the PC version levels that were missing from the Atari Jaguar version, but is missing a different set of five levels instead, and, like the Sega 32X version, does not have any console exclusive levels. The levels included resemble the PC levels more so than other ports. This was also the only home console port of ''Doom'' released in the 1990s to feature all three of the original secret levels and boss levels from the PC version. Like the Sega 32X version, the player's [[heads-up display]] does not utilize the whole screen, and enemies are only animated from the front, which means that they always face the player. This renders [[monster infighting]] impossible, although it is possible for monsters of the same type to damage each other with projectiles. The floors and ceilings are not texture mapped, and this version of the game also lacks both battery back-up saves and a password system, meaning that each episode must be finished from the beginning. Multiplayer was only available if an [[XBAND]] modem was used, which included support for two player deathmatch. This version lacks the Spectre enemy (replaced with regular Demon monsters), though it does feature the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind boss monsters that the Atari Jaguar, Sega 32X, and 3DO versions lack. In the North American and PAL versions, episode two cannot be played on the \"I'm Too Young to Die\" and \"Hey, Not Too Rough\" difficulties, and episode three can only be played on \"Ultra-Violence\" and \"Nightmare\" difficulties if one is selected from the game's episode select menu, though it is possible to play episode three on the \"Hurt Me Plenty\" difficulty if the player beats episode two on that difficulty setting. In the Japanese version, however, all three episodes can be played on any difficulty level.\n\nThe automap display takes advantage of the rotating and scaling abilities of the Super FX 2 chip, with the entire map spinning around the player's position rather than the player being portrayed with an arrow. Due to hardware limitations, no particles such as blood impacts, smoke, or bullet sparks are present. The chaingun is capable of single fire (although emptying one bullet still produces a doubled sound effect). Moreover, the shotgun does not fire seven individual shots as it does in the PC version, but rather functions like a hunting rifle. This allows the player to shoot (and be shot) from a distance using the shotgun with no decrease in power. This version of ''Doom'' features support for the [[SNES Mouse]] peripheral.\n\nReviews for the Super NES version were mostly negative. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave this version a score of 5.375 out of 10. Two of their reviewers said that it was \"decent\" but clearly inferior to other versions of ''Doom'', while the other two felt it to be a poor game even without comparing it to other versions. They particularly criticized that enemies at a distance are too pixelated to be seen, making it \"seem like you are getting hit for no reason at all\". They cited the \"outstanding\" music as the one strong point.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Doom|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=74|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 1995|page=34}}</ref> A critic for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' similarly complained that enemies are so pixelated at mid-distance or farther that they blend in with the backgrounds. He also criticized the graphics in general as requiring \"constant squinting\" to discern what is going on and called the controls \"poor and sluggish.\" While acknowledging that creating a port of Doom for a last generation console at all was an impressive technical accomplishment, he concluded the port to be not worthwhile and gave it two out of five stars.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Doom|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|pages=126, 128}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s The Axe Grinder instead stated that distant objects appear sharp and clear, and that it is objects which are close up which appear extremely pixelated. He gave the Super NES version a generally negative assessment, saying that the game is almost unplayable due to the unresponsive controls.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Doom|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=85|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=October 1995|page=66}}</ref>\n\n===PlayStation===\nThe [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version of ''Doom'' was published and developed by [[Midway Games|Williams Entertainment]] and released on November 16, 1995. This version spent six months in development.<ref name=\"Max2\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Doom: The Ultimate Version of the Greatest Gore Blast Ever!|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=2 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=November 1995|pages=56\u201360}}</ref> It is one of the best selling versions of the game after the original PC version. It was re-released several times, first on the \"[[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]]\" range in the U.S., which requires that games have sold at least 150,000 copies there, and on the \"[[Platinum Range]]\" in [[PAL region]]s, which indicates that it sold over 600,000 copies in those territories.\n\nChanges from the PC original include the removal of the \"Nightmare\" difficulty level, and the fact that progress is saved via passwords (given at the end of each level). The passwords also save ammo and health stats, but the numbers for them are rounded. This version features 59 levels in total; 23 levels from the PC version of ''Doom'' (edited much like the Jaguar and 32X versions), both of the levels designed for the Jaguar version, six new levels designed by the Midway team, five levels from ''The Ultimate Doom''{{'}}s fourth episode, and 23 levels from ''Doom II''. Unlike the other 1990s ''Doom'' ports, all of the enemies from the PC version of ''Doom'' are included. However, the Arch-vile monster from ''Doom II'' is not present; according to one of the game's designers, Harry Teasley, this was because he had twice as many frames as any other monster, and the team felt that they \"just couldn't do him justice\" on the PlayStation.<ref>http://5years.doomworld.com/interviews/harryteasley/page3.shtml Harry Teasley interview</ref> There is, however, one new monster, the Nightmare Spectre. According to Teasley, this was included to add variety, and to take advantage of the PlayStation's capabilities. Two player [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] and co-operative multiplayer modes are available on the PlayStation if two consoles are linked using the original Serial I/O port, and each console has its own controller and ''Doom'' disc inserted.\n\nMany textures were reduced in size due to technical limitations. As a result, the mug shot appears to be different from the one in the PC version; in fact, it is the same animated sprite, but squashed in from the sides. A small selection of new graphics and visual effects were introduced. These include sector-based coloured lighting, an animated, flame-filled sky, and a new animation for the player's mug shot, which shows the [[Doomguy]]'s head exploding if the player character is [[gib (video gaming)|gib]]bed.<ref name=\"Max2\"/> For the first time, translucent Spectres are drawn without the cascade effect (including the darker-shaded Nightmare Spectres). The original music by Bobby Prince was replaced by a new score by [[Aubrey Hodges]]. The sound effects and voice-overs were also completely redone by Hodges, and, in parts of certain levels, echo effects were added. All of the story text is cut, save for the ending and second intermission from ''Doom II'', the latter of which appears at the end of ''Ultimate Doom'' instead. A bonus level presented a level 'club doom' - with a nightclub filled with health potions and demons attacking on a dance floor and dance-cages.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNpho45LnhE</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1996, a port containing levels from ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth#Master Levels for Doom II|Master Levels for Doom II]]'' and ''[[Final Doom]]'' was released for the PlayStation under the name ''Final Doom''. The PlayStation version of ''Final Doom'' has thirteen levels from ''Master Levels for Doom II'', eleven levels from ''TNT: Evilution'', and six levels from ''The Plutonia Experiment''. Like the PlayStation version of ''Doom'', ''Final Doom'' uses passwords. Unlike the PlayStation version of ''Doom'', support for the [[PlayStation Mouse]] peripheral is available for ''Final Doom''.\n\nThe PlayStation version was met with critical acclaim, with critics concurring it to be by far the best console version of the game to date. Major Mike of ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a perfect score in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), noting that it was not just a straight conversion but a drastically reworked and comprehensive edition with \"enough new twists and turns to surprise even the most battle-weary ''Doom'' player\". He applauded the inclusion of ''Doom II'', the added levels, the much smoother graphics when compared to previous console ports, the clear sound effects, the \"chilling\" music, and the precise controls.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Doom: Special PlayStation Edition|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=87 |publisher=[[IDG]]|date=December 1995|pages=58\u201359}}</ref> A reviewer for ''Maximum'' found the port's most worthwhile aspects to be the huge number of levels, the use of the shoulder buttons for strafing, and the \"vastly improved\" audio.

He complained that the walls are \"sticky\" and that he was feeling burnt out on reviewing ports of ''Doom'', and gave it four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Doom|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=78}}</ref> ''Next Generation''{{'}}s 1996 overview of PlayStation games raised the score to a perfect five stars.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Every PlayStation Game Played, Reviewed, and Rated|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=57}}</ref> [[IGN]] gave it a 7 out of 10, citing the high frame rate, impressive lighting effects, use of the PlayStation Link Cable, and inclusion of ''Doom II'' content.

This version runs in a small screen at a low frame rate, though it includes the option to shrink the screen size further, which allows the game to run faster and smoother. It lacks some effects found in other versions but has an updated soundtrack that features remixed and original music. The Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind are missing, though the Spectre (which is absent from the Jaguar, SNES, and 32X versions) is included. The 3DO version was originally a more ambitious project, intended to surpass the PC version, but after it was mired in [[development hell]] for two years, the programmer was contracted to create a basic port in ten weeks.<ref>{{cite news | last = Matthews | first= Will | date = December 2013 | title = Ahead of its Time: A 3DO Retrospective | work = [[Retro Gamer]] | issue = 122 | pages = 26\u201329 | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref> In December 2014, the source code for the 3DO version was released to the public.<ref name=\"3do-sourcecode\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/doom3do|title=The complete archive for DOOM for the 3DO|last=Heineman|first=Rebecca Ann|date=December 2014|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Maximum'' thoroughly panned this version for its lack of [[PAL]] optimization, large borders, choppy frame rate even on the smallest possible screen size, bland color palette, music which is lacking in atmosphere, and load times. They added that the frame rate and slowdown make the game too easy: \"When large amounts of monsters arrive to beat the crap out of you, the game slows down to such an extent that you have ages to line up your shots and fire\". With their only praise being for the intuitive and effective control configuration, they gave it one out of five stars.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Maximum Reviews: Doom|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=4 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1996|pages=160\u20131}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]'' called it \"the worst console version of ''Doom'' so far\", chiefly due to the choppy frame rate.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Quick Hits: Doom|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=92|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1996|page=72}}</ref>\n\n===Sega Saturn===\nBased on the PlayStation version, ''Doom'' was ported to the Sega Saturn by [[Rage Software]] and published by [[GT Interactive]] in 1997.<ref name=SSM16/> Though containing the same levels, enemies, structures, and most of the sounds effects and music from the PlayStation version, this port suffers a number of differences and setbacks; the frame rate is significantly lower, the animation is slower, the echoed sound effects and sector-based lighting are missing, the Spectre and Nightmare Spectre monsters do not have the translucent textures and instead are drawn in see-through sprites of regular Demon enemies, and the animated fiery skyline in certain levels is gone, usually replaced with ''Doom II''{{'}}s city skyline. The lead programmer on this port, Jim Bagley, later explained that he originally programmed a hardware-accelerated engine that would have performed on par with high-end PCs of the time, but id Software disallowed usage of the engine due to texture distortion caused by the rendering process, resulting in the final version using an entirely software-based renderer.\n\nThis version is compatible with the Saturn analog controller<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Preview: Doom|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=15|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=January 1997|pages=28\u201329}}</ref> and the Saturn [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]. However, the mouse cannot be used to strafe, access the automap, or manually change weapons (though as in all versions of ''Doom'', the player character automatically equips a weapon when it is first acquired and switches to a different weapon if the current one is depleted of ammunition).\n\nThe packaging for the U.S. release contains a few errors, such as the game screen shots on the back actually being from the PC version of ''Final Doom'', and it claims to be \"deathmatch ready\", when it is in fact only one player (the deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer modes are only in the Japanese and PAL releases, despite the fact that the Saturn link cable needed to play these modes had not been released in PAL regions<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Q&A |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=18 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=April 1997|pages=32}}</ref>).\n\nThe Japanese release of the game has a slightly smoother frame rate compared to the North American and European versions, though still considerably lower than that of the PlayStation version.\n\nThe Saturn port was met with a generally negative reception, with most reviewers considering it far below the quality of the PlayStation version. The most common criticisms were the low frame rate<ref name=SSM16/><ref name=GSSat/><ref name=GPro103/> and lack of certain graphical elements seen in the PlayStation version.<ref name=SSM16/><ref name=GPro103/> Reviewer fatigue with ''Doom'' ports also continued to play a role; [[Jeff Gerstmann]], rating it a 3.1 out of 10 in ''[[GameSpot]]'', commented that \"If I see one more Doom game released on any platform, I'm going to hunt down the people responsible and kill them slowly.\"<ref name=GSSat>{{cite web |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann |title=Doom Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-review/1900-2532876/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=29 July 2018 |date=April 22, 1997}}</ref> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' awarded the port a score of 56%, with the reviewer describing it as a \"breath-takingly bad conversion of a classic game\", judging the game's poor performance to be inexcusable considering the Saturn's 2D rendering capabilities, and feeling that even the earlier 32X and Jaguar versions played much better, despite being released on less powerful systems.<ref name=SSM16>{{cite magazine|last=Leadbetter |first=Rich |title=Review: Doom|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=16 |publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=February 1997|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]'' was less outraged, judging that while the Saturn port is clearly inferior to the PC and PlayStation versions, it is enjoyable in absolute terms and \"successfully mimics the PlayStation version in most categories - with the crucial exception of speed.\"<ref name=GPro103>{{cite magazine |title=Saturn ProReview: Doom|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=103 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=April 1997|page=87}}</ref>\n\n===Game Boy Advance===\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version of ''Doom'' was developed by David A.

These were the first ports of ''Doom'' on a [[handheld game console|handheld device]]. Both ''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' received a much larger amount of censoring than other ports (monsters bleed green instead of red, and monster corpses disappear a few seconds after initial death; in both secret levels for ''Doom II'', swastika flags and walls were replaced by stylized double-headed eagles reminiscent of ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s picture art was replaced by Wilhelm Strasse's picture art; no bleeding of the status bar face), and, because of this, received a [[Teen]] rating by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].\n\n===Xbox===\nThe Limited Collector's Edition of ''Doom 3'', released in 2005, features ports of ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II'', including two new levels, \"Sewers\" and \"Betray\". They feature the same multiplayer as the PC version, however not through [[Xbox Live]]. All the PC levels for both games are included; however, the eight console-only levels which appeared on the Jaguar, PlayStation, 3DO, and Saturn versions are omitted. This port was programmed by [[Vicarious Visions]]. The expansion pack \"Resurrection of Evil\" also contained ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II'', as well as ''Master Levels for Doom II''.\n\n===Xbox 360===\nOn September 27, 2006, ''Doom'' was released for download on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game has all 4 episodes from ''The Ultimate Doom'' plus online cooperative and deathmatch modes through [[Xbox Live]]. Like the Xbox version, it does not include any of the console-only levels which appeared in earlier ports. Supports 11 screen sizes, and has higher graphics resolution than any earlier console port. Due to a bug, the music plays at a slower speed. This port, programmed by [[Nerve Software]], also credits [[Vicarious Visions]] and likely shares code with the Xbox version. There are no cheats in this version of the game.\n\nIn 2010, the game was pulled from the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] because [[Activision]], the game's publisher, no longer has the rights to maintain the game on the Marketplace, but as of January 20, 2012, it has been republished by [[Bethesda Softworks]],<ref>[http://www.platformnation.com/2012/01/18/doom-available-on-xbla-again/ Doom Relisted on XBLA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120184640/http://www.platformnation.com/2012/01/18/doom-available-on-xbla-again/ |date=2012-01-20 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/10/doom_mysteriously_removed_from.php |title=Doom Removed From Xbox Live Arcade, Back Up Soon - Joystick Division<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724091905/http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/10/doom_mysteriously_removed_from.php |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the same company that published the Xbox Live Arcade version of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''.\n\nBoth games are backwards-compatible with the [[Xbox One]] and can be purchased from the Xbox Store. They are also downloaded if the disc for ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition]]'' is inserted into the console in lieu of the pack-in versions of the games included with that title, though the disc is required to play. They were also offered as a preorder incentive for [[Doom (2016 video game)|the 2016 reboot]].\n\n===PlayStation 3===\n''Doom 3 BFG Edition'' contains ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II: Hell on Earth''. Later, ''Doom Classic Complete'' was released on the [[PlayStation Network]] which includes ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II: Hell on Earth'', ''Master Levels for Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'', the last two appearing for the first time in their entirety on a console.\n\n===25th anniversary release===\n''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' were released for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] on July 26, 2019 during [[QuakeCon]], in honor of the franchise's 25th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/doom-doom-ii-and-doom-3-out-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one-and-smartphones/|title=Doom, Doom II and Doom 3 out for Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One and smartphones|last=Gonzalez|first=Oscar|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\nBethesda received criticism for allegations that it included additional [[digital rights management]] in this version, as the initial releases required that users sign into a Bethesda.net account in order to play.

This version includes all 32 levels from the original PC version, along with all the original enemies, music, weapons, etc. It also retains the option of switching between nine different screen sizes, including one which expands the first person view to fill the entire screen, and is the first console version of ''Doom'' to include respawning monsters in \"Nightmare\" difficulty mode.<ref>[http://classicdoom.com/doomcomp.htm Doom Comparison Guide], ClassicDOOM.com.

Starting with the original [[MS-DOS]] [[Personal computer|PC]] version (released as [[shareware]] on December 10, 1993), it has been released officially for a number of [[operating system]]s, [[video game console]]s, [[handheld game console]]s, and other devices. Some of the ports are replications of the MS-DOS version, while others differ considerably, including modifications to the level designs and monsters, with some ports offering content not included in the original MS-DOS version.\n\nAfter ''Doom''{{'}}s [[source code]] was released to the public on December 23, 1997, several [[List of Doom source ports|source ports]] were created by fans to allow the original PC version to run on modern operating systems.\n\n==Personal computers==\n\n===MS-DOS===\n\n====Original version====\n''Doom''{{'}}s initial release on December 10, 1993 was for MS-DOS and had 320x200 pixel resolution.

The internal program number reads v0.99.\n* 1.1 (December 16, 1993) - Fixed some bugs in the 1.0 release.\n* 1.2 (February 17, 1994) - Added support for modem play and new difficulty level called ''Nightmare''.\n* 1.4 (June 28, 1994), 1.5 (July 8, 1994), and 1.6 (August 3, 1994) were minor updates, and only available to testers.\n* 1.666 (September 1, 1994) - Contained improved network code and a new version of deathmatch called ''Deathmatch 2.0''. In addition, the [[swastika]] pattern in episode 1, map 4 was altered.<ref>[http://rome.ro/lee_killough/memorabilia/swastika.shtml Photos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720230535/http://www.rome.ro/lee_killough/memorabilia/swastika.shtml |date=2008-07-20 }} at John Romero's website.</ref>\n* 1.7 (October 11, 1994) - Contained IWAD changes and lacked the ''DeathManager!'' front end multiplayer game launcher.\n* 1.7a (November 8, 1994) - Contained sound code changes and included version 1.1 of the ''DeathManager!'' front end multiplayer game launcher.\n* 1.8 (January 23, 1995) - Updated the ''Doom'' FAQ.\n* 1.9 (February 1, 1995) - Final release.\n\n====''The Ultimate Doom''====\nOn April 30, 1995, an upgraded version of the game, ''The Ultimate Doom'', was released, which contained an additional fourth episode, entitled \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", in addition to the original three episodes, which are \"Knee Deep In The Dead\", \"The Shores Of Hell\", and \"Inferno\".\n\n===NeXTSTEP===\nThis was the version that the MS-DOS product emerged from, since, at the time, [[id Software]] was using a [[NeXTcube]] for its graphic-engine development. This version is sluggish on anything below an 040 NeXTstation/cube (though it runs smoother with a higher amount of memory), and is missing sound, which was added on the PC side. With NeXT-Step based on i486 architecture, it ran smoothly under all conditions up to screen sizes of 400% with newer hardware. The version running on NeXT is 1.2, programmed by John Carmack, John Romero, and Dave Taylor.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===OS/2===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[OS/2]] by an independent contractor, Jim Thomas, who was hired by [[IBM]] to port it and ''SimCity''.<ref>http://stuff.mit.edu/activities/os2/diverepo.html</ref> A successful version was demoed in 1994 running in an OS/2 [[Presentation Manager|PM]] window, and the last version, 2.19 beta, was released in 1997.<ref>http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-viewer.php?dir=/pub/os2/games/action/doom&file=dmos219s.zip</ref>\n\n===IRIX===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[IRIX]] during the summer of 1994 by [[Dave D. Taylor]]. It was designed to run on IRIX 5.2 and later. IRIX ''Doom'' was originally based on the unreleased MS-DOS version 1.5, though later updates were based on versions 1.6 and 1.8. No effort was made to take advantage of [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]'s advanced graphics hardware, and like many other ports the game was rendered entirely in [[software rendering]] mode.\n\n===Solaris===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] in late 1994, and was designed to run with game files from ''Doom'' 1.8. In the readme, the port is credited to \"Dave Taylor and the rest of the folks at id Software\".  It runs on Solaris 2.4 and later. The distribution contained two versions: one for regular X11, and another for Sun DGA.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Mac OS===\n''Doom'' for Mac was released on November 4, 1994. ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'' were ported by Lion Entertainment and released by GT Interactive using a Mac OS launcher application to run original PC WADs. The Mac version runs on [[System 7]] through [[Mac OS 9]] and requires a [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[PowerPC]] processor. Although it can run in [[Classic Environment|Classic]] under [[OS X|Mac OS X]] on [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]; [[Mac OS X Panther|Panther]] and [[Mac OS X Tiger|Tiger]] cause graphic artifacts due to the later version of Classic having a double-buffered screen. In addition to an adjustable viewport, it supports rendering at low or high resolutions, and allows network play over [[AppleTalk]] as well as IPX.\n\n===Linux===\n''Doom'' was ported to [[Linux]] by [[id Software]] programmer Dave Taylor in 1994. The last Linux ''Doom'' binaries were provided by id Software on October 13, 1996 through the company's ftp-server.\n\nThe source code to the Linux version of ''Doom'' was released by [[id Software]] on December 23, 1997 under a non-profit [[End user license agreement]]; it was re-released on October 3, 1999 under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. The source code to the [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions of the game was not released. This was due to copyright issues concerning the sound library used by original MS-DOS version and id Software having no access to the source code of the Microsoft Windows port.<ref>John Carmack.

It was compatible with [[Windows 95]] and up, and was able to use WADs from the MS-DOS versions. It also allowed users to set up multiplayer games much easier than in DOS. It was included with ''[[Final Doom]]''.

Some early versions of ''Doom 3'' included the Collector's Edition and a small demon figurine as a bonus. The ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition|BFG Edition]]'' of ''Doom 3'', released on October 15, 2012, includes ''The Ultimate Doom'' as well as ''Doom II''.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, ''The Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II'', and ''Final Doom'' were released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. This release runs the original MS-DOS versions of the game using [[DOSBox]], an MS-DOS emulator.\n\n===Acorn RISC OS===\n''Doom'' was released for the [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[Risc PC]] by R-Comp Interactive in 1998. Within a few months, a significantly enhanced version was delivered as an update called ''Doom+''. That version runs on the older [[Acorn Archimedes]] computers and, apart from speed improvements, adds several features not present in the original DOS release.<ref>[http://gerph.org/riscos/ramble/doomplus.html Justin Fletcher, author of Doom+.

Due to the lack of the third episode, the [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]] can only be obtained through the use of cheats. Due to poor use of the Mega Drive/Genesis [[YM2612]] sound chip, this version's soundtrack is considered inferior to that of other versions, and many of the sound effects are missing. As with most mid-90s console ports, the levels come from the Atari Jaguar version. This version does not feature the Cyberdemon, the Spider Mastermind, or the Spectre. There is a level select option that allows the player to start on any of the first fifteen levels, although there is no way to save the game or settings.\n\nIn 1995, the 32X version of the game was given a score of 30 out of 40 by ''[[Famicom Ts\u016bshin]]''.<ref>\u304a\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1!! \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8 \u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0!!: DOOM ~\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30e0~.

Randy Linden, the head programmer, created a new game engine called the Reality engine for the port. The game makes use of the [[Super FX]] powered GSU-2 chip (often referred to as the Super FX 2 chip), and was one of the few SNES games to feature a colored cartridge: ''Doom'' came in a red cartridge in the United States; a black or standard gray cartridge in Europe; and a red, black, or gray cartridge in Australia.\n\nThe SNES version of ''Doom'' features all five of the PC version levels that were missing from the Atari Jaguar version, but is missing a different set of five levels instead, and, like the Sega 32X version, does not have any console exclusive levels. The levels included resemble the PC levels more so than other ports. This was also the only home console port of ''Doom'' released in the 1990s to feature all three of the original secret levels and boss levels from the PC version. Like the Sega 32X version, the player's [[heads-up display]] does not utilize the whole screen, and enemies are only animated from the front, which means that they always face the player. This renders [[monster infighting]] impossible, although it is possible for monsters of the same type to damage each other with projectiles. The floors and ceilings are not texture mapped, and this version of the game also lacks both battery back-up saves and a password system, meaning that each episode must be finished from the beginning. Multiplayer was only available if an [[XBAND]] modem was used, which included support for two player deathmatch. This version lacks the Spectre enemy (replaced with regular Demon monsters), though it does feature the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind boss monsters that the Atari Jaguar, Sega 32X, and 3DO versions lack. In the North American and PAL versions, episode two cannot be played on the \"I'm Too Young to Die\" and \"Hey, Not Too Rough\" difficulties, and episode three can only be played on \"Ultra-Violence\" and \"Nightmare\" difficulties if one is selected from the game's episode select menu, though it is possible to play episode three on the \"Hurt Me Plenty\" difficulty if the player beats episode two on that difficulty setting. In the Japanese version, however, all three episodes can be played on any difficulty level.\n\nThe automap display takes advantage of the rotating and scaling abilities of the Super FX 2 chip, with the entire map spinning around the player's position rather than the player being portrayed with an arrow. Due to hardware limitations, no particles such as blood impacts, smoke, or bullet sparks are present. The chaingun is capable of single fire (although emptying one bullet still produces a doubled sound effect). Moreover, the shotgun does not fire seven individual shots as it does in the PC version, but rather functions like a hunting rifle. This allows the player to shoot (and be shot) from a distance using the shotgun with no decrease in power. This version of ''Doom'' features support for the [[SNES Mouse]] peripheral.\n\nReviews for the Super NES version were mostly negative. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave this version a score of 5.375 out of 10. Two of their reviewers said that it was \"decent\" but clearly inferior to other versions of ''Doom'', while the other two felt it to be a poor game even without comparing it to other versions. They particularly criticized that enemies at a distance are too pixelated to be seen, making it \"seem like you are getting hit for no reason at all\". They cited the \"outstanding\" music as the one strong point.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Doom|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=74|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 1995|page=34}}</ref> A critic for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' similarly complained that enemies are so pixelated at mid-distance or farther that they blend in with the backgrounds. He also criticized the graphics in general as requiring \"constant squinting\" to discern what is going on and called the controls \"poor and sluggish.\" While acknowledging that creating a port of Doom for a last generation console at all was an impressive technical accomplishment, he concluded the port to be not worthwhile and gave it two out of five stars.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Doom|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|pages=126, 128}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s The Axe Grinder instead stated that distant objects appear sharp and clear, and that it is objects which are close up which appear extremely pixelated. He gave the Super NES version a generally negative assessment, saying that the game is almost unplayable due to the unresponsive controls.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Doom|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=85|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=October 1995|page=66}}</ref>\n\n===PlayStation===\nThe [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version of ''Doom'' was published and developed by [[Midway Games|Williams Entertainment]] and released on November 16, 1995. This version spent six months in development.<ref name=\"Max2\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Doom: The Ultimate Version of the Greatest Gore Blast Ever!|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=2 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=November 1995|pages=56\u201360}}</ref> It is one of the best selling versions of the game after the original PC version. It was re-released several times, first on the \"[[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]]\" range in the U.S., which requires that games have sold at least 150,000 copies there, and on the \"[[Platinum Range]]\" in [[PAL region]]s, which indicates that it sold over 600,000 copies in those territories.\n\nChanges from the PC original include the removal of the \"Nightmare\" difficulty level, and the fact that progress is saved via passwords (given at the end of each level). The passwords also save ammo and health stats, but the numbers for them are rounded. This version features 59 levels in total; 23 levels from the PC version of ''Doom'' (edited much like the Jaguar and 32X versions), both of the levels designed for the Jaguar version, six new levels designed by the Midway team, five levels from ''The Ultimate Doom''{{'}}s fourth episode, and 23 levels from ''Doom II''. Unlike the other 1990s ''Doom'' ports, all of the enemies from the PC version of ''Doom'' are included. However, the Arch-vile monster from ''Doom II'' is not present; according to one of the game's designers, Harry Teasley, this was because he had twice as many frames as any other monster, and the team felt that they \"just couldn't do him justice\" on the PlayStation.<ref>http://5years.doomworld.com/interviews/harryteasley/page3.shtml Harry Teasley interview</ref> There is, however, one new monster, the Nightmare Spectre. According to Teasley, this was included to add variety, and to take advantage of the PlayStation's capabilities. Two player [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] and co-operative multiplayer modes are available on the PlayStation if two consoles are linked using the original Serial I/O port, and each console has its own controller and ''Doom'' disc inserted.\n\nMany textures were reduced in size due to technical limitations. As a result, the mug shot appears to be different from the one in the PC version; in fact, it is the same animated sprite, but squashed in from the sides. A small selection of new graphics and visual effects were introduced. These include sector-based coloured lighting, an animated, flame-filled sky, and a new animation for the player's mug shot, which shows the [[Doomguy]]'s head exploding if the player character is [[gib (video gaming)|gib]]bed.<ref name=\"Max2\"/> For the first time, translucent Spectres are drawn without the cascade effect (including the darker-shaded Nightmare Spectres). The original music by Bobby Prince was replaced by a new score by [[Aubrey Hodges]]. The sound effects and voice-overs were also completely redone by Hodges, and, in parts of certain levels, echo effects were added. All of the story text is cut, save for the ending and second intermission from ''Doom II'', the latter of which appears at the end of ''Ultimate Doom'' instead. A bonus level presented a level 'club doom' - with a nightclub filled with health potions and demons attacking on a dance floor and dance-cages.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNpho45LnhE</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1996, a port containing levels from ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth#Master Levels for Doom II|Master Levels for Doom II]]'' and ''[[Final Doom]]'' was released for the PlayStation under the name ''Final Doom''. The PlayStation version of ''Final Doom'' has thirteen levels from ''Master Levels for Doom II'', eleven levels from ''TNT: Evilution'', and six levels from ''The Plutonia Experiment''. Like the PlayStation version of ''Doom'', ''Final Doom'' uses passwords. Unlike the PlayStation version of ''Doom'', support for the [[PlayStation Mouse]] peripheral is available for ''Final Doom''.\n\nThe PlayStation version was met with critical acclaim, with critics concurring it to be by far the best console version of the game to date. Major Mike of ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a perfect score in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), noting that it was not just a straight conversion but a drastically reworked and comprehensive edition with \"enough new twists and turns to surprise even the most battle-weary ''Doom'' player\". He applauded the inclusion of ''Doom II'', the added levels, the much smoother graphics when compared to previous console ports, the clear sound effects, the \"chilling\" music, and the precise controls.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Doom: Special PlayStation Edition|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=87 |publisher=[[IDG]]|date=December 1995|pages=58\u201359}}</ref> A reviewer for ''Maximum'' found the port's most worthwhile aspects to be the huge number of levels, the use of the shoulder buttons for strafing, and the \"vastly improved\" audio.

He complained that the walls are \"sticky\" and that he was feeling burnt out on reviewing ports of ''Doom'', and gave it four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Doom|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=78}}</ref> ''Next Generation''{{'}}s 1996 overview of PlayStation games raised the score to a perfect five stars.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Every PlayStation Game Played, Reviewed, and Rated|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=57}}</ref> [[IGN]] gave it a 7 out of 10, citing the high frame rate, impressive lighting effects, use of the PlayStation Link Cable, and inclusion of ''Doom II'' content.

This version runs in a small screen at a low frame rate, though it includes the option to shrink the screen size further, which allows the game to run faster and smoother. It lacks some effects found in other versions but has an updated soundtrack that features remixed and original music. The Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind are missing, though the Spectre (which is absent from the Jaguar, SNES, and 32X versions) is included. The 3DO version was originally a more ambitious project, intended to surpass the PC version, but after it was mired in [[development hell]] for two years, the programmer was contracted to create a basic port in ten weeks.<ref>{{cite news | last = Matthews | first= Will | date = December 2013 | title = Ahead of its Time: A 3DO Retrospective | work = [[Retro Gamer]] | issue = 122 | pages = 26\u201329 | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref> In December 2014, the source code for the 3DO version was released to the public.<ref name=\"3do-sourcecode\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/doom3do|title=The complete archive for DOOM for the 3DO|last=Heineman|first=Rebecca Ann|date=December 2014|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Maximum'' thoroughly panned this version for its lack of [[PAL]] optimization, large borders, choppy frame rate even on the smallest possible screen size, bland color palette, music which is lacking in atmosphere, and load times. They added that the frame rate and slowdown make the game too easy: \"When large amounts of monsters arrive to beat the crap out of you, the game slows down to such an extent that you have ages to line up your shots and fire\". With their only praise being for the intuitive and effective control configuration, they gave it one out of five stars.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Maximum Reviews: Doom|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=4 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1996|pages=160\u20131}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]'' called it \"the worst console version of ''Doom'' so far\", chiefly due to the choppy frame rate.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Quick Hits: Doom|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=92|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1996|page=72}}</ref>\n\n===Sega Saturn===\nBased on the PlayStation version, ''Doom'' was ported to the Sega Saturn by [[Rage Software]] and published by [[GT Interactive]] in 1997.<ref name=SSM16/> Though containing the same levels, enemies, structures, and most of the sounds effects and music from the PlayStation version, this port suffers a number of differences and setbacks; the frame rate is significantly lower, the animation is slower, the echoed sound effects and sector-based lighting are missing, the Spectre and Nightmare Spectre monsters do not have the translucent textures and instead are drawn in see-through sprites of regular Demon enemies, and the animated fiery skyline in certain levels is gone, usually replaced with ''Doom II''{{'}}s city skyline. The lead programmer on this port, Jim Bagley, later explained that he originally programmed a hardware-accelerated engine that would have performed on par with high-end PCs of the time, but id Software disallowed usage of the engine due to texture distortion caused by the rendering process, resulting in the final version using an entirely software-based renderer.\n\nThis version is compatible with the Saturn analog controller<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Preview: Doom|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=15|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=January 1997|pages=28\u201329}}</ref> and the Saturn [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]. However, the mouse cannot be used to strafe, access the automap, or manually change weapons (though as in all versions of ''Doom'', the player character automatically equips a weapon when it is first acquired and switches to a different weapon if the current one is depleted of ammunition).\n\nThe packaging for the U.S. release contains a few errors, such as the game screen shots on the back actually being from the PC version of ''Final Doom'', and it claims to be \"deathmatch ready\", when it is in fact only one player (the deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer modes are only in the Japanese and PAL releases, despite the fact that the Saturn link cable needed to play these modes had not been released in PAL regions<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Q&A |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=18 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=April 1997|pages=32}}</ref>).\n\nThe Japanese release of the game has a slightly smoother frame rate compared to the North American and European versions, though still considerably lower than that of the PlayStation version.\n\nThe Saturn port was met with a generally negative reception, with most reviewers considering it far below the quality of the PlayStation version.

These were the first ports of ''Doom'' on a [[handheld game console|handheld device]]. Both ''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' received a much larger amount of censoring than other ports (monsters bleed green instead of red, and monster corpses disappear a few seconds after initial death; in both secret levels for ''Doom II'', swastika flags and walls were replaced by stylized double-headed eagles reminiscent of ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s picture art was replaced by Wilhelm Strasse's picture art; no bleeding of the status bar face), and, because of this, received a [[Teen]] rating by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].\n\n===Xbox===\nThe Limited Collector's Edition of ''Doom 3'', released in 2005, features ports of ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II'', including two new levels, \"Sewers\" and \"Betray\". They feature the same multiplayer as the PC version, however not through [[Xbox Live]]. All the PC levels for both games are included; however, the eight console-only levels which appeared on the Jaguar, PlayStation, 3DO, and Saturn versions are omitted. This port was programmed by [[Vicarious Visions]]. The expansion pack \"Resurrection of Evil\" also contained ''The Ultimate Doom'' and ''Doom II'', as well as ''Master Levels for Doom II''.\n\n===Xbox 360===\nOn September 27, 2006, ''Doom'' was released for download on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game has all 4 episodes from ''The Ultimate Doom'' plus online cooperative and deathmatch modes through [[Xbox Live]]. Like the Xbox version, it does not include any of the console-only levels which appeared in earlier ports. Supports 11 screen sizes, and has higher graphics resolution than any earlier console port. Due to a bug, the music plays at a slower speed. This port, programmed by [[Nerve Software]], also credits [[Vicarious Visions]] and likely shares code with the Xbox version. There are no cheats in this version of the game.\n\nIn 2010, the game was pulled from the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] because [[Activision]], the game's publisher, no longer has the rights to maintain the game on the Marketplace, but as of January 20, 2012, it has been republished by [[Bethesda Softworks]],<ref>[http://www.platformnation.com/2012/01/18/doom-available-on-xbla-again/ Doom Relisted on XBLA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120184640/http://www.platformnation.com/2012/01/18/doom-available-on-xbla-again/ |date=2012-01-20 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/10/doom_mysteriously_removed_from.php |title=Doom Removed From Xbox Live Arcade, Back Up Soon - Joystick Division<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724091905/http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/10/doom_mysteriously_removed_from.php |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the same company that published the Xbox Live Arcade version of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''.\n\nBoth games are backwards-compatible with the [[Xbox One]] and can be purchased from the Xbox Store.

In 1995, actor Joe Vincent took over the theater's artistic direction, serving till 1999.\n\nIn 2000, [[Jonathan Moscone]] was appointed its Artistic Director. In his first season at Cal Shakes, Moscone directed a production of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead''; the company continued to produce one non-Shakespeare play a year until 2005, when its productions of ''The Life and Adventures of [[Nicholas Nickleby]], Parts One & Two'' ([[Charles Dickens]], adapted by [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]]) began a tradition of two Shakespeare plays and two non-Shakespeare plays each season.

The camps have continued, in one form or another, to this day, going under several different names (Camp, Conservatory, Summer Theater Programs). In 2009, the camps were offered to ages 8\u201318 in two- and five-week increments, with locations in Lafayette, Oakland, Orinda, and El Cerrito. Participants study acting, physical comedy, [[stage combat]], movement, improvisation, and text, and the camps still culminate in a Shakespeare performance by each age group.\n\nAlso in 1979, the festival began holding fall classes, a training program in all facets of classical theater including voice and movement, period style, scansion, stage combat, and other production aspects. Also offered was an introduction to classical drama in both its literary and theatrical aspects. Fall and spring classes for youth and adults were offered as recently as spring of 2009.\n\nCalifornia Shakespeare Theater also presents Student Discovery Matinees, afternoon performances of Shakespeare productions for school groups that include pre-show activities geared toward youth. In 2001, they began teaching pre- and post\u2013show workshops wherein Cal Shakes teaching artists visit classrooms in order to enrich and support the Student Discovery Matinee experience. That same year, Berkeley\u2019s Malcolm X Arts Magnet Elementary School and Pinole Valley High School hosted playwright Karen Hartman in Cal Shakes residencies; Hartman taught creative writing and storytelling in both residencies, and each one culminated in a presentation of the students\u2019 works directed by Jonathan Moscone. In 2007, Cal Shakes received the first of several grants from the NEA's Shakespeare in American Communities initiative to expand its residency program and Student Discovery Matinee activities.<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=Spotlight on a New Generation: 2007-2008 Season | url=http://www.shakespeareinamericancommunities.org/spotlight/calshakes.shtml | publisher=Shakespeare in American Communities}}</ref>  The theater now offers classroom residencies, after school programs, and home school programs throughout the Bay Area.\n<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=California Shakespeare Theater Arts Education Listing | url=http://www.tcg.org/tools/education/protected/search_detail.cfm?id=1908 | publisher=Theater Communications Group | access-date=2009-11-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062654/http://www.tcg.org/tools/education/protected/search_detail.cfm?id=1908 | archive-date=2011-09-28 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | title=Page to Stage: California Shakespeare Theater | url=http://uw.kqed.org/edresources/plan.php?id=166 | publisher=KQED Education Curriculum Bank | access-date=2009-11-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727000736/http://uw.kqed.org/edresources/plan.php?id=166 | archive-date=2011-07-27 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=Cal Shakes Artistic Learning programs | url=http://www.calshakes.org/v4/educ/ | publisher=California Shakespeare Theater | access-date=2009-10-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106141845/http://www.calshakes.org/v4/educ/ | archive-date=2009-11-06 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==New Works/New Communities (2003-2010)==\nIn 2003, Cal Shakes launched New Works/New Communities (NW/NC) with the aim of engaging marginalized communities while creating new works of theater based on the classics. ''Hamlet: Blood in the Brain'' was the first major NW/NC project, partnering Cal Shakes with playwright [[Naomi Iizuka]] and San Francisco's Campo Santo, resident theater company at [[Intersection for the Arts]]  to relocate Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' to the 1980s-era drug-ravaged streets of East Oakland. The two-year process (2004\u20132006) included interviews with former drug lords and Shakespearean scholars; writing workshops in schools, juvenile halls, and churches; and Q&A panels attended by the public. It culminated in a sold-out, eight-week run of the play directed by Moscone at [[Intersection for the Arts]].<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=A Hamlet of One's Own | url=http://www.calshakes.org/v4/newworks/hamlet/Hamlet_AmericanTheaterMag.pdf | publisher=American Theater Magazine | date=Nov 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=The Marquez Factor | url=http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/Sept07/exec.cfm | publisher=American Theater Magazine | date=Sep 2007 | access-date=2009-10-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619180827/http://tcg.org/publications/at/Sept07/exec.cfm | archive-date=2010-06-19 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2010, the Advanced Drama Department at Oakland Technical High School revisited ''Hamlet: Blood in the Brain'', choosing the play as their entry in the American High School Theatre Festival, which they won. The Oakland Tech students then performed their production at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2010.\n\nFrom 2005-2007, the NW/NC program developed ''King of Shadows'', an adaptation of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] that took place in San Francisco, with gay urban youth at its center. Cal Shakes partnered with MFA students at [[American Conservatory Theater]] and community organizations such as Larkin Street Youth Services, Guerrero House, and LYRIC (Lavender Youth Recreation and Information Center) for discussions, workshops, and field trips.\n\nIn 2005 Cal Shakes began a partnership with Write to Read, a juvenile hall literacy program run by the Alameda County Library, holding writing workshops based on ''Hamlet: Blood in the Brain''. In 2007, actor and Cal Shakes Associate Artist Andy Murray began to teach workshops and extended residencies using Shakespeare to develop the public speaking, leadership, and cooperation skills of the juvenile hall residents.\n\nIn 2007, Cal Shakes commissioned San Francisco playwright Octavio Solis to adapt ''[[The Pastures of Heaven]]'', an early novel of interconnected stories about farm life in the Salinas Valley by [[John Steinbeck]]. The project partnered Cal Shakes with Word for Word Performing Arts Company for a series of development workshops; community partners include the [[National Steinbeck Center]] and Alisal Center for Fine Arts, both located in Salinas. The adapted work is the first play specifically commissioned for California Shakespeare's Main Stage, and had its world premiere in June 2010, directed by Jonathan Moscone.\n\n== New Classics Initiative ==\nThe aim of the New Classics Initiative is to explore what it means to be a classical theater in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and to allow living writers with the same vision and scope of Shakespeare to expand the classical canon and by extension, what is thought of as universal.\nPiloted in 2017 with Marcus Gardley's ''black odyssey'' and officially launched with 2018's ''Quixote Nuevo'' by [[Octavio Solis]], the New Classics Initiative continues in 2019 with the world premiere of ''House of Joy'' by Madhuri Shekar. Future NCI productions will reimagine classic Western drama through a diversity of form and content, cultural and gender perspectives, and adaptation and reinvention.\n==The Bruns Amphitheater==\nIn 1988, philanthropist Clarence Woodard led a capital campaign that resulted in the building of the 545-seat Lt. G.H. Bruns III Memorial Amphitheater in Orinda's Siesta Valley in 1991. It was named in memory of the late son of George and Sue Bruns of Lafayette, CA, who was killed on June 26, 1967, in an automobile accident just before he was due to ship out for service in Vietnam. The Bruns grounds feature an annual sculpture installation, Art in the Groves, multiple picnicking groves, pre-show performance talks by dramaturges, and on-site cafe. The stage itself has the Orinda hills as its backdrop, and patrons are encouraged to bring their food and drink into the amphitheater for the performance.\n\nIn 2009, Cal Shakes announced a second capital campaign, titled Building for the Future, to renovate the Bruns Amphitheater&mdash;including its grounds, backstage area, technical facilities, and the theater itself&mdash;using sustainable practices.\n<ref>{{cite news | author= | title=Cal Shakes to break ground on major renovation | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/22/DDCG19QGCV.DTL | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt | date=25 October 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=Curtain Calls: Cal Shakes' dream soon to be reality | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/theater-and-arts/ci_13402006 | publisher=Oakland Tribune}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=Building for the Future: The Cal Shakes Campaign | url=http://www.calshakes.org/future | publisher=California Shakespeare Theater}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.calshakes.org/}}\n\n[[Category:Shakespeare festivals]]\n[[Category:Theatre festivals in the United States]]\n[[Category:Regional theatre in the United States]]\n[[Category:Theatre companies in California]]\n[[Category:Performing groups established in 1974]]\n[[Category:1974 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Theatre in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film festival\n| name              = California Shakespeare Theater\n| image             = Cal_Shakes_logo.png\n| image_alt         = \n| image_size        = \n| caption           = \n| location          = [[Orinda, California]]\n| founded           = 1974\n| founders          = Mikel Clifford<br/>Peter Fisher<br/>Jerry Landis<br/>Rolf Saxon<br/>Robert Eldred Schneider<br/>Myron Schreck<br/>Vince Tolman\n| artistic_director = Eric Ting\n| editor_in_chief   = \n| selector          = \n| play_type         = Shakespeare, Classics, New Classical Adaptations\n| date              = \n| website           = http://www.calshakes.org/\n}}\n'''California Shakespeare Theater''' (\"Cal Shakes\") is a regional theater located in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of California.

The award was created to recognize an outstanding director or choreographer who is transforming the regional arts landscape through his singular creativity and artistry in theater.<ref>{{cite news | author= | title=California Shakespeare Theater's Jonathan Moscone wins first Fichandler Award | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/12/california-shakespeare-theater-jonathan-moscone-wins-first-fichandler-award.html | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=December 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, [[Jonathan Moscone]] stepped down as Artistic Director after 15 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/01/16/jonathan-moscone-to-leave-cal-shakes-artistic-director-post/|title=Jonathan Moscone to Leave Cal Shakes Artistic Director Post|last=Editors|first=American Theatre|date=2015-01-16|website=AMERICAN THEATRE|access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref> His final production was [[Charles Ludlam|Charles Ludham]]'s ''[[The Mystery of Irma Vep]]'' in August/September of the same year''.'' \n\nEric Ting was chosen as its new Artistic Director joining in the fall of 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2015/08/19/new-artistic-director-for-cal-shakes/|title=Cal Shakes Chooses New Artistic Director|language=en-us|access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>His first production was 2016's ''Othello'', produced with minimal sets and costumes in service of a community tour of the same production that fall. In 2017, Ting directed Cal Shakes' record-smashing hit ''black odyssey'' by [[Marcus Gardley]], which featured music and choral direction by [[Linda Tillery]] and Molly Holm, and was remounted in 2018 with members of the original cast. In 2018, Cal Shakes presented ''The War of the Roses'', a supercut of William Shakespeare's minor tetralogy ([[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI]] parts 1, 2, and 3 and [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]), co-adapted by Ting and resident dramaturg Philippa Kelly.\n\n==Participants in Cal Shakes productions==\n*directors: Karin Coonrod, Daniel Fish, Timothy Near, Lisa Peterson, Aaron Posner, Mark Rucker, Joel Sass, and [[Kate Whoriskey]];\n*designers: [[Christopher Akerlind]], Riccardo Hernandez, [[Brian Sidney Bembridge]], Christine Jones, Meg Neville, [[Todd Rosenthal]], Annie Smart, and Stephen Strawbridge;\n*composers: Gina Leishman and Andre Pleuss;\n*choreographers: Joe Goode and K.T.

The camps have continued, in one form or another, to this day, going under several different names (Camp, Conservatory, Summer Theater Programs). In 2009, the camps were offered to ages 8\u201318 in two- and five-week increments, with locations in Lafayette, Oakland, Orinda, and El Cerrito. Participants study acting, physical comedy, [[stage combat]], movement, improvisation, and text, and the camps still culminate in a Shakespeare performance by each age group.\n\nAlso in 1979, the festival began holding fall classes, a training program in all facets of classical theater including voice and movement, period style, scansion, stage combat, and other production aspects. Also offered was an introduction to classical drama in both its literary and theatrical aspects. Fall and spring classes for youth and adults were offered as recently as spring of 2009.\n\nCalifornia Shakespeare Theater also presents Student Discovery Matinees, afternoon performances of Shakespeare productions for school groups that include pre-show activities geared toward youth. In 2001, they began teaching pre- and post\u2013show workshops wherein Cal Shakes teaching artists visit classrooms in order to enrich and support the Student Discovery Matinee experience. That same year, Berkeley\u2019s Malcolm X Arts Magnet Elementary School and Pinole Valley High School hosted playwright Karen Hartman in Cal Shakes residencies; Hartman taught creative writing and storytelling in both residencies, and each one culminated in a presentation of the students\u2019 works directed by Jonathan Moscone. In 2007, Cal Shakes received the first of several grants from the NEA's Shakespeare in American Communities initiative to expand its residency program and Student Discovery Matinee activities.<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=Spotlight on a New Generation: 2007-2008 Season | url=http://www.shakespeareinamericancommunities.org/spotlight/calshakes.shtml | publisher=Shakespeare in American Communities}}</ref>  The theater now offers classroom residencies, after school programs, and home school programs throughout the Bay Area.\n<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=California Shakespeare Theater Arts Education Listing | url=http://www.tcg.org/tools/education/protected/search_detail.cfm?id=1908 | publisher=Theater Communications Group | access-date=2009-11-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062654/http://www.tcg.org/tools/education/protected/search_detail.cfm?id=1908 | archive-date=2011-09-28 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | title=Page to Stage: California Shakespeare Theater | url=http://uw.kqed.org/edresources/plan.php?id=166 | publisher=KQED Education Curriculum Bank | access-date=2009-11-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727000736/http://uw.kqed.org/edresources/plan.php?id=166 | archive-date=2011-07-27 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=Cal Shakes Artistic Learning programs | url=http://www.calshakes.org/v4/educ/ | publisher=California Shakespeare Theater | access-date=2009-10-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106141845/http://www.calshakes.org/v4/educ/ | archive-date=2009-11-06 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==New Works/New Communities (2003-2010)==\nIn 2003, Cal Shakes launched New Works/New Communities (NW/NC) with the aim of engaging marginalized communities while creating new works of theater based on the classics. ''Hamlet: Blood in the Brain'' was the first major NW/NC project, partnering Cal Shakes with playwright [[Naomi Iizuka]] and San Francisco's Campo Santo, resident theater company at [[Intersection for the Arts]]  to relocate Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' to the 1980s-era drug-ravaged streets of East Oakland. The two-year process (2004\u20132006) included interviews with former drug lords and Shakespearean scholars; writing workshops in schools, juvenile halls, and churches; and Q&A panels attended by the public. It culminated in a sold-out, eight-week run of the play directed by Moscone at [[Intersection for the Arts]].<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=A Hamlet of One's Own | url=http://www.calshakes.org/v4/newworks/hamlet/Hamlet_AmericanTheaterMag.pdf | publisher=American Theater Magazine | date=Nov 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=The Marquez Factor | url=http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/Sept07/exec.cfm | publisher=American Theater Magazine | date=Sep 2007 | access-date=2009-10-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619180827/http://tcg.org/publications/at/Sept07/exec.cfm | archive-date=2010-06-19 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2010, the Advanced Drama Department at Oakland Technical High School revisited ''Hamlet: Blood in the Brain'', choosing the play as their entry in the American High School Theatre Festival, which they won. The Oakland Tech students then performed their production at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2010.\n\nFrom 2005-2007, the NW/NC program developed ''King of Shadows'', an adaptation of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] that took place in San Francisco, with gay urban youth at its center. Cal Shakes partnered with MFA students at [[American Conservatory Theater]] and community organizations such as Larkin Street Youth Services, Guerrero House, and LYRIC (Lavender Youth Recreation and Information Center) for discussions, workshops, and field trips.\n\nIn 2005 Cal Shakes began a partnership with Write to Read, a juvenile hall literacy program run by the Alameda County Library, holding writing workshops based on ''Hamlet: Blood in the Brain''. In 2007, actor and Cal Shakes Associate Artist Andy Murray began to teach workshops and extended residencies using Shakespeare to develop the public speaking, leadership, and cooperation skills of the juvenile hall residents.\n\nIn 2007, Cal Shakes commissioned San Francisco playwright Octavio Solis to adapt ''[[The Pastures of Heaven]]'', an early novel of interconnected stories about farm life in the Salinas Valley by [[John Steinbeck]]. The project partnered Cal Shakes with Word for Word Performing Arts Company for a series of development workshops; community partners include the [[National Steinbeck Center]] and Alisal Center for Fine Arts, both located in Salinas. The adapted work is the first play specifically commissioned for California Shakespeare's Main Stage, and had its world premiere in June 2010, directed by Jonathan Moscone.\n\n== New Classics Initiative ==\nThe aim of the New Classics Initiative is to explore what it means to be a classical theater in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and to allow living writers with the same vision and scope of Shakespeare to expand the classical canon and by extension, what is thought of as universal.\nPiloted in 2017 with Marcus Gardley's ''black odyssey'' and officially launched with 2018's ''Quixote Nuevo'' by [[Octavio Solis]], the New Classics Initiative continues in 2019 with the world premiere of ''House of Joy'' by Madhuri Shekar. Future NCI productions will reimagine classic Western drama through a diversity of form and content, cultural and gender perspectives, and adaptation and reinvention.\n==The Bruns Amphitheater==\nIn 1988, philanthropist Clarence Woodard led a capital campaign that resulted in the building of the 545-seat Lt. G.H. Bruns III Memorial Amphitheater in Orinda's Siesta Valley in 1991. It was named in memory of the late son of George and Sue Bruns of Lafayette, CA, who was killed on June 26, 1967, in an automobile accident just before he was due to ship out for service in Vietnam. The Bruns grounds feature an annual sculpture installation, Art in the Groves, multiple picnicking groves, pre-show performance talks by dramaturges, and on-site cafe. The stage itself has the Orinda hills as its backdrop, and patrons are encouraged to bring their food and drink into the amphitheater for the performance.\n\nIn 2009, Cal Shakes announced a second capital campaign, titled Building for the Future, to renovate the Bruns Amphitheater&mdash;including its grounds, backstage area, technical facilities, and the theater itself&mdash;using sustainable practices.\n<ref>{{cite news | author= | title=Cal Shakes to break ground on major renovation | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/22/DDCG19QGCV.DTL | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt | date=25 October 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=Curtain Calls: Cal Shakes' dream soon to be reality | url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/theater-and-arts/ci_13402006 | publisher=Oakland Tribune}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | author= | title=Building for the Future: The Cal Shakes Campaign | url=http://www.calshakes.org/future | publisher=California Shakespeare Theater}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.calshakes.org/}}\n\n[[Category:Shakespeare festivals]]\n[[Category:Theatre festivals in the United States]]\n[[Category:Regional theatre in the United States]]\n[[Category:Theatre companies in California]]\n[[Category:Performing groups established in 1974]]\n[[Category:1974 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Theatre in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n", "name_user": "Aristophenes201", "label": "safe", "comment": "Roger Grunwald was a founding ensemble member (1974) of the then Emeryville Shakespeare Company.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Shakespeare_Theater"}
