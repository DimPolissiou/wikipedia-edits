{"title_page": "Patrol boat", "text_new": "{Usssduddnd{short description|Small naval vessel}}\n{{about|the naval vessel|the Australian TV series|Patrol Boat (TV series)}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\nA '''patrol boat''' (also referred to as a patrol craft, patrol ship or patrol vessel) is a relatively small [[naval ship|naval vessel]] generally designed for coastal defence duties. There have been many designs for patrol boats. They may be operated by a nation's [[navy]], [[coast guard]], [[police]] force or [[customs]] and may be intended for marine ([[Maritime geography|blue water]]) or [[estuary|estuarine]] or river (\"[[brown water]]\") environments. They are commonly found engaged in various border protection roles, including anti-[[smuggling]], anti-[[piracy]], [[fisheries]] patrols, and [[immigration law]] [[enforcement]]. They are also often called upon to participate in [[rescue]] operations. Vessels of this type include the original [[yacht]] (from Dutch/Low German ''jacht'' meaning hunting or hunt), a light, fast-sailing vessel used by the [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch navy]] to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into shallow waters.\n\n==Classification==\nThey may be broadly classified as inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) and offshore patrol vessels (OPVs). They are warships typically smaller in size than a [[corvette]] and can include [[fast attack craft]], [[torpedo boat]]s and [[missile boat]]s, although some are as large as a [[frigate]]. The offshore patrol vessels are usually the smallest ship in a navy's fleet that is large and seaworthy enough to patrol off-shore in the open [[ocean]]. In larger militaries, such as in the [[United States armed forces|United States military]], offshore patrol vessels usually serve in the coast guard, but many smaller nations navies operate these type of ships.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Pce-872c.jpg|thumb|left|''PCE-872'', a [[World War II]] patrol craft escort of the [[US Navy]] ]]\nDuring both World Wars in order to rapidly build up numbers, all sides created auxiliary patrol boats by arming [[motorboat]]s and seagoing [[fishing trawler]]s with machine guns and [[Obsolescence|obsolescent]] naval weapons. Some modern patrol vessels are still based on fishing and leisure boats. Seagoing patrol boats are typically around 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) in length and usually carry a single medium caliber [[Naval artillery|artillery gun]] as main armament, and a variety of lighter secondary armament such as machine guns or a [[close-in weapon system]]. Depending on role, vessels in this class may also have more sophisticated sensors and [[Fire-control system|fire control]] systems that would enable them to carry [[torpedo]]es, [[Anti-ship missile|anti-ship]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s.\n\nMost modern designs are powered by [[gas turbine]] arrangements such as [[Combined diesel and gas|CODAG]], and speeds are generally in the {{convert|25|\u2013|30|kn}} range. They are primarily used for patrol in a country's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]. Common tasks are [[Fisheries management|fisheries inspection]], [[smuggling|anti-smuggling]] (usually [[Prohibition (drugs)|anti-narcotics]]) duties, [[illegal immigration]] patrols, anti-[[piracy]] patrols and [[search and rescue]] (law enforcement-type of work). The largest OPVs might also have a [[flight deck]] and [[helicopter]] embarked. In times of crisis or war, these vessels are expected to support the larger vessels in the navy.\n\nTheir small size and relatively low cost make them one of the most common type of warship in the world. Almost all navies operate at least a few offshore patrol vessels, especially those with only \"[[Green-water navy|green water]]\" capabilities. They are useful in smaller seas such as the [[North Sea]] as well as in open oceans. Similar vessels for exclusively military duties include [[torpedo boat]]s and [[missile boat]]s. The [[United States Navy]] operated the {{sclass-|Pegasus|hydrofoil|4}} of armed hydrofoils for years, in a patrol boat role. The [[Patrol Boat, River|River Patrol Boat]] (PBR, sometimes called \"Riverine\" and \"Pibber\") is a U.S. design of small patrol boat type designed to patrol waters of large rivers.\n\n==Specific nations==\n\n===Albania===\n[[Image:Patrol Boat Iliria.jpg|thumb|{{ship|Albanian patrol vessel|Iliria|P 131|2}}, an example of a modern Patrol boat of the [[Albanian Naval Force]]]]\n*{{ship|Albanian patrol vessel|Iliria|P 131|2}} ([[Albanian Navy Brigade]])\n\n===Argentina===\n[[Image:Rio Uruguay garde cote argentin.jpg|thumb| [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]]'s ''GC67'' patrol vessel]]\n* {{sclass-|Mantilla|patrol vessel|1}}, [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]]\n* Z-28-class patrol vessel, Argentine Naval Prefecture\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:HMAS Armidale Darling Harbour.jpg|thumb|HMAS ''Armidale'' of the [[Royal Australian Navy]]]]\n* {{sclass-|Attack|patrol boat|1}}, ([[Royal Australian Navy]]) \u2013 1967 to 1985\n* {{sclass-|Fremantle|patrol boat|1}}, (Royal Australian Navy) \u2013 1979 to 2007\n* {{sclass2-|Pacific|patrol boat|1}}, (Australian built, gifted by Australian government to 12 [[Pacific Islands Forum|Pacific Island]] countries), 1987\u2013present\n* {{Sclass-|Armidale|patrol boat|1}}, (Royal Australian Navy) \u2013 2005 to present\n* {{sclass-|Arafura|offshore patrol vessel|1}}, ([[Royal Australian Navy]]) \u2013 Expected to enter service in 2021\n* {{sclass2-|Bay|patrol boat|1}}, ([[Customs Marine Unit (Australia)|Australian Border Force Marine Unit]]) \u2013 1999 to present\n* [[RV Triton#Australian Customs|Australian Customs Vessel ''Triton'']], (Australian Border Force Marine Unit) \u2013 2000 to 2016\n* {{sclass2-|Cape|patrol boat|1}}, (Australian Border Force Marine Unit) \u2013 Bay class replacement from 2013\n\n===Bahamas===\n* {{sclass2-|Bahamas|patrol vessel|1}}, ([[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]])\n* {{sclass2-|Protector|patrol boat|1}}\n\n===Bangladesh===\n[[File:BNS Nirmul.jpg|thumb|{{ship|BNS|Nirmul}}, a {{sclass-|Durjoy|patrol craft|1}} of the [[Bangladesh Navy]]]]\n* {{sclass-|Durjoy|patrol craft|1}}\n* {{sclass2-|Island|patrol vessel|1}}\n* [[BNS Madhumati|Sea Dragon-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Padma|patrol vessel|0}} offshore patrol vessel ([[Bangladesh Navy]])\n* {{sclass-|Meghna|patrol boat|1}} ([[Bangladesh Navy]])\n* [[Type 037 corvette|Hainan-class]] submarine chaser\n* [[BNS Karnafuli|Kraljevica-class patrol boat]]\n* [[Type 062 gunboat#Haizhui-class submarine chaser|Barkat (Haizhui)-class patrol boat]]\n* {{sclass-|Ajay|patrol boat|1}}\n* [[Type 062 gunboat|Shaheed (Shanghai II)-class patrol boat]]\n\n===Brazil===\n* [[Brazilian patrol boat Graja\u00fa (P40)|''Graja\u00fa''-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* ''Bracu\u00ed''-class patrol vessel (ex-{{sclass2-|River|minesweeper|1}})\n* [[Brazilian corvette Caboclo (V19)|''Imperial Marinheiro''-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* ''Piratini''-class patrol vessel\n* ''J''-class patrol vessel\n* ''Roraima''-class river patrol vessel\n* ''Pedro Teixeira''-class river patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Maca\u00e9|patrol vessel|0}} offshore patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Amazonas|corvette|1}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Brazil_getting_armored_vehicles_boats_999.html|title=Brazil getting armored vehicles, boats|last=<!--Staff-->|first=|date=10 August 2012|work=Space War|access-date=19 August 2017<!--in archive.is; excluded from archive.org by robots.txt-->|publisher=Space Media Network|agency=UPI|quote=The first-of-class Amazonas was constructed at BAE Systems' Portsmouth facility.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baesystems.com/product/BAES_027244|title=Offshore Patrol Vessels|last=<!--Staff-->|date=n.d.|publisher=BAE Systems|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117145345/http://www.baesystems.com/product/BAES_027244?_afrLoop=4642021291097000&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null&baeSessionId=yqLmQ4QhyVS3gJm1FF1L2wHGZV8R2MzT7CKnpT11mcyNBQ5PNhby!791695071|archive-date=17 January 2013|url-status=dead|quote=We are supplying three Ocean Patrol Vessels and ancillary support services to the Brazilian Navy, as well as a manufacturing licence to enable further vessels of the same class to be constructed in Brazil.

Boat (TV series)}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\nA '''patrol boat''' (also referred to as a patrol craft, patrol ship or patrol vessel) is a relatively small [[naval ship|naval vessel]] generally designed for coastal defence duties. There have been many designs for patrol boats. They may be operated by a nation's [[navy]], [[coast guard]], [[police]] force or [[customs]] and may be intended for marine ([[Maritime geography|blue water]]) or [[estuary|estuarine]] or river (\"[[brown water]]\") environments. They are commonly found engaged in various border protection roles, including anti-[[smuggling]], anti-[[piracy]], [[fisheries]] patrols, and [[immigration law]] [[enforcement]]. They are also often called upon to participate in [[rescue]] operations. Vessels of this type include the original [[yacht]] (from Dutch/Low German ''jacht'' meaning hunting or hunt), a light, fast-sailing vessel used by the [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch navy]] to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into shallow waters.\n\n==Classification==\nThey may be broadly classified as inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) and offshore patrol vessels (OPVs). They are warships typically smaller in size than a [[corvette]] and can include [[fast attack craft]], [[torpedo boat]]s and [[missile boat]]s, although some are as large as a [[frigate]]. The offshore patrol vessels are usually the smallest ship in a navy's fleet that is large and seaworthy enough to patrol off-shore in the open [[ocean]]. In larger militaries, such as in the [[United States armed forces|United States military]], offshore patrol vessels usually serve in the coast guard, but many smaller nations navies operate these type of ships.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Pce-872c.jpg|thumb|left|''PCE-872'', a [[World War II]] patrol craft escort of the [[US Navy]] ]]\nDuring both World Wars in order to rapidly build up numbers, all sides created auxiliary patrol boats by arming [[motorboat]]s and seagoing [[fishing trawler]]s with machine guns and [[Obsolescence|obsolescent]] naval weapons. Some modern patrol vessels are still based on fishing and leisure boats. Seagoing patrol boats are typically around 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) in length and usually carry a single medium caliber [[Naval artillery|artillery gun]] as main armament, and a variety of lighter secondary armament such as machine guns or a [[close-in weapon system]]. Depending on role, vessels in this class may also have more sophisticated sensors and [[Fire-control system|fire control]] systems that would enable them to carry [[torpedo]]es, [[Anti-ship missile|anti-ship]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s.\n\nMost modern designs are powered by [[gas turbine]] arrangements such as [[Combined diesel and gas|CODAG]], and speeds are generally in the {{convert|25|\u2013|30|kn}} range. They are primarily used for patrol in a country's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]. Common tasks are [[Fisheries management|fisheries inspection]], [[smuggling|anti-smuggling]] (usually [[Prohibition (drugs)|anti-narcotics]]) duties, [[illegal immigration]] patrols, anti-[[piracy]] patrols and [[search and rescue]] (law enforcement-type of work). The largest OPVs might also have a [[flight deck]] and [[helicopter]] embarked. In times of crisis or war, these vessels are expected to support the larger vessels in the navy.\n\nTheir small size and relatively low cost make them one of the most common type of warship in the world. Almost all navies operate at least a few offshore patrol vessels, especially those with only \"[[Green-water navy|green water]]\" capabilities. They are useful in smaller seas such as the [[North Sea]] as well as in open oceans. Similar vessels for exclusively military duties include [[torpedo boat]]s and [[missile boat]]s. The [[United States Navy]] operated the {{sclass-|Pegasus|hydrofoil|4}} of armed hydrofoils for years, in a patrol boat role. The [[Patrol Boat, River|River Patrol Boat]] (PBR, sometimes called \"Riverine\" and \"Pibber\") is a U.S. design of small patrol boat type designed to patrol waters of large rivers.\n\n==Specific nations==\n\n===Albania===\n[[Image:Patrol Boat Iliria.jpg|thumb|{{ship|Albanian patrol vessel|Iliria|P 131|2}}, an example of a modern Patrol boat of the [[Albanian Naval Force]]]]\n*{{ship|Albanian patrol vessel|Iliria|P 131|2}} ([[Albanian Navy Brigade]])\n\n===Argentina===\n[[Image:Rio Uruguay garde cote argentin.jpg|thumb| [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]]'s ''GC67'' patrol vessel]]\n* {{sclass-|Mantilla|patrol vessel|1}}, [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]]\n* Z-28-class patrol vessel, Argentine Naval Prefecture\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:HMAS Armidale Darling Harbour.jpg|thumb|HMAS ''Armidale'' of the [[Royal Australian Navy]]]]\n* {{sclass-|Attack|patrol boat|1}}, ([[Royal Australian Navy]]) \u2013 1967 to 1985\n* {{sclass-|Fremantle|patrol boat|1}}, (Royal Australian Navy) \u2013 1979 to 2007\n* {{sclass2-|Pacific|patrol boat|1}}, (Australian built, gifted by Australian government to 12 [[Pacific Islands Forum|Pacific Island]] countries), 1987\u2013present\n* {{Sclass-|Armidale|patrol boat|1}}, (Royal Australian Navy) \u2013 2005 to present\n* {{sclass-|Arafura|offshore patrol vessel|1}}, ([[Royal Australian Navy]]) \u2013 Expected to enter service in 2021\n* {{sclass2-|Bay|patrol boat|1}}, ([[Customs Marine Unit (Australia)|Australian Border Force Marine Unit]]) \u2013 1999 to present\n* [[RV Triton#Australian Customs|Australian Customs Vessel ''Triton'']], (Australian Border Force Marine Unit) \u2013 2000 to 2016\n* {{sclass2-|Cape|patrol boat|1}}, (Australian Border Force Marine Unit) \u2013 Bay class replacement from 2013\n\n===Bahamas===\n* {{sclass2-|Bahamas|patrol vessel|1}}, ([[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]])\n* {{sclass2-|Protector|patrol boat|1}}\n\n===Bangladesh===\n[[File:BNS Nirmul.jpg|thumb|{{ship|BNS|Nirmul}}, a {{sclass-|Durjoy|patrol craft|1}} of the [[Bangladesh Navy]]]]\n* {{sclass-|Durjoy|patrol craft|1}}\n* {{sclass2-|Island|patrol vessel|1}}\n* [[BNS Madhumati|Sea Dragon-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Padma|patrol vessel|0}} offshore patrol vessel ([[Bangladesh Navy]])\n* {{sclass-|Meghna|patrol boat|1}} ([[Bangladesh Navy]])\n* [[Type 037 corvette|Hainan-class]] submarine chaser\n* [[BNS Karnafuli|Kraljevica-class patrol boat]]\n* [[Type 062 gunboat#Haizhui-class submarine chaser|Barkat (Haizhui)-class patrol boat]]\n* {{sclass-|Ajay|patrol boat|1}}\n* [[Type 062 gunboat|Shaheed (Shanghai II)-class patrol boat]]\n\n===Brazil===\n* [[Brazilian patrol boat Graja\u00fa (P40)|''Graja\u00fa''-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* ''Bracu\u00ed''-class patrol vessel (ex-{{sclass2-|River|minesweeper|1}})\n* [[Brazilian corvette Caboclo (V19)|''Imperial Marinheiro''-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* ''Piratini''-class patrol vessel\n* ''J''-class patrol vessel\n* ''Roraima''-class river patrol vessel\n* ''Pedro Teixeira''-class river patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Maca\u00e9|patrol vessel|0}} offshore patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Amazonas|corvette|1}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Brazil_getting_armored_vehicles_boats_999.html|title=Brazil getting armored vehicles, boats|last=<!--Staff-->|first=|date=10 August 2012|work=Space War|access-date=19 August 2017<!--in archive.is; excluded from archive.org by robots.txt-->|publisher=Space Media Network|agency=UPI|quote=The first-of-class Amazonas was constructed at BAE Systems' Portsmouth facility.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baesystems.com/product/BAES_027244|title=Offshore Patrol Vessels|last=<!--Staff-->|date=n.d.|publisher=BAE Systems|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117145345/http://www.baesystems.com/product/BAES_027244?_afrLoop=4642021291097000&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null&baeSessionId=yqLmQ4QhyVS3gJm1FF1L2wHGZV8R2MzT7CKnpT11mcyNBQ5PNhby!791695071|archive-date=17 January 2013|url-status=dead|quote=We are supplying three Ocean Patrol Vessels and ancillary support services to the Brazilian Navy, as well as a manufacturing licence to enable further vessels of the same class to be constructed in Brazil.

{"title_page": "Ragnhild of T\u00e4lje", "text_new": "'''Ragnhild of T\u00e4lje''' (11th century \u2013 c. 1117) is a [[saint]] whose [[veneration]] is attested in [[late medieval Sweden]] and whose name is especially associated with the church in [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]] in the province of [[S\u00f6dermanland]] and the [[diocese of Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s]]. A year given for her death is 1117. According to mentions in various literature a few centuries later, she was also [[queen consort of Sweden|Queen of Sweden]] as the wife of King [[Inge the Younger]].  Some historians have introduced a possiblity, refuted by others, that Ragnhild's father was Alstan, a son of [[Folke Filbyter]], and that she thus belonged to the early [[House of Bjelbo]] of subsequent Swedish and Norwegian kings.  \n\nRagnhild is said to have founded the church in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje and be buried there. If she is a historical person, she probably lived during the late 11th or early 12th century, but no sources that mention her can be dated earlier than the 15th century. An epitaph in the church, probably dating from that period, was later copied by the late 17th century antiquarian [[Elias Palmski\u00f6ld]]. In various 15th century literary sources, she is claimed to have been a queen, the daughter of a certain ''Halsten'' (it is uncertain whether the king [[Halsten Stenkilsson]] is intended) and wife of either [[Inge the Elder]] or [[Inge the Younger]] (either of which would for genealogical and chronological reasons contradict her being the daughter of King Halsten). 14th and 15th century wall paintings depicting Ragnhild can be found in the churches of [[B\u00f6rje Church|B\u00f6rje]] and [[Viksta Church|Viksta]] in [[Uppland]], and [[En\u00e5nger]] in [[H\u00e4lsingland]], all three in the [[archdiocese of Uppsala]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje vapen.svg|thumb|left||100px|Queen Ragnhild stylized in the arms of [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]]]]\n[[File:Ragenilda of Sweden c 1350.jpg|right|200px|thumb|14th-century wall painting at [[En\u00e5nger]] of Queen Ragnhild]]\nInterest in Ragnhild (as in some other medieval local saints) was revived long after the [[Protestant Reformation]] through the general interest in Swedish antiquities that flourished in 17th century Sweden. In her case, the publication of ''Vitis aquilonia'' by [[Johannes Vastovius]] in 1623 had already caused a re-interpretation of the human figure in the seal of the City of S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje to be a stylistic depiction of Ragenilda.\n\nHer cult image includes a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem where she was undressed by bandits and left naked, but by angels was sent a magnificent cloak. It also mentions her marriage to King Inge and her virtues as queen, but that he left her. She could then devote herself to caring for the ill.\n\nDuring the introduction of Christianity in S\u00f6dermanland in the decades around 1100, Ragnhild has been supposed to be one of the three instrumental people, the earlier being [[Saint Eskil]] and later [[Saint Botvid]]. Eskil's and Botvid's legends, however, were contemporary (12th century). Ragnhild is not mentioned specifically until the 1450s in the ''Little Rhyme Chronicles'', and then in the newer preface of a 1520s reissue of the ''[[Eric Chronicle]]'' from 1335. [[Johan Peringski\u00f6ld|Peringski\u00f6ld]] provided evidence that the original epitaph on Ragnhlid's grave, describing her as a queen, had been transcribed correctly in subsequent centuries. Obvious similarities in style between Ragnhild's epitaph and that of the early 12th century sarcophagus of St. Botvid's brother Beorn in [[Botkyrka]] have led to an additional theory of the authenticity of the former. \n\nFrom that epitaph:\n{{quotation|Ragnhild, ruler of the Swedes, a flower with no thorn, a queen for a realm, she goes out on a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem to assure herself of graceful hope and to bear the Cross's victorious and for-all-collective tag of honor. Through service she desires to acquire for herself the merciful laurel wreath of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]. Oh, pious Madame, the patron saint of T\u00e4lje residents, pray for us for the good, heavenly gifts of Christ.}}\nA legend about her by King [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]]'s librarian and court priest has Ragnhild brought up from childhood fearing God, then married to Inge, living an angelic life on earth, dead of old age in 1120 and buried in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje.\n\nWhen S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje got a new city hall in 1965, a memorial plaque to Queen Ragnhild, authored by the town's mayor in 1753, was moved to the new bulding and placed in its courtroom.\n\n==References==\n*Fr\u00f6jmark, Anders, \"Ragnhild\", ''Svenskt biografiskt lexikon'' (Swedish Biographical Dictionary), vol. 29 (1995\u20131997), pp.&nbsp;613\u2013615. {{in lang|sv}}\n*[http://runeberg.org/sqvinnor/0343.html ''Anteqningar om Svenska quinnor'' at Projekt Runeberg] (Notes on Swedish Women) {{in lang|sv}}\n*''Drottning Ragnhild och hennes gravskrift i T\u00e4lje'' by Henrik Alm, [https://libris.kb.se/bib/2490548 Libris #2490548], Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s 1931\n\n{{Swedish consorts}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ragnhild Talje}}\n[[Category:Medieval Swedish saints]]\n[[Category:S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Municipality]]\n[[Category:Swedish queens]]\n[[Category:11th-century births]]\n[[Category:1117 deaths]]\n[[Category:12th-century Swedish people]]\n[[Category:12th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Female saints of medieval Sweden]]\n[[Category:12th-century Swedish women]]\n", "text_old": "'''Ragnhild of T\u00e4lje''' (11th century \u2013 c. 1117) is a [[saint]] whose [[veneration]] is attested in [[late medieval Sweden]] and whose name is especially associated with the church in [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]] in the province of [[S\u00f6dermanland]] and the [[diocese of Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s]].

An epitaph in the church, probably dating from that period, was later copied by the late 17th century antiquarian [[Elias Palmski\u00f6ld]]. In various 15th century literary sources, she is claimed to have been a queen, the daughter of a certain ''Halsten'' (it is uncertain whether the king [[Halsten Stenkilsson]] is intended) and wife of either [[Inge the Elder]] or [[Inge the Younger]] (either of which would for genealogical and chronological reasons contradict her being the daughter of King Halsten). 14th and 15th century wall paintings depicting Ragnhild can be found in the churches of [[B\u00f6rje Church|B\u00f6rje]] and [[Viksta Church|Viksta]] in [[Uppland]], and [[En\u00e5nger]] in [[H\u00e4lsingland]], all three in the [[archdiocese of Uppsala]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje vapen.svg|thumb|left||100px|Queen Ragnhild stylized in the arms of [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]]]]\n[[File:Ragenilda of Sweden c 1350.jpg|right|200px|thumb|14th-century wall painting at [[En\u00e5nger]] of Queen Ragnhild]]\nInterest in Ragnhild (as in some other medieval local saints) was revived long after the [[Protestant Reformation]] through the general interest in Swedish antiquities that flourished in 17th century Sweden. In her case, the publication of ''Vitis aquilonia'' by [[Johannes Vastovius]] in 1623 had already caused a re-interpretation of the human figure in the seal of the City of S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje to be a stylistic depiction of Ragenilda.\n\nHer cult image includes a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem where she was undressed by bandits and left naked, but by angels was sent a magnificent cloak. It also mentions her marriage to King Inge and her virtues as queen, but that he left her. She could then devote herself to caring for the ill.\n\nDuring the introduction of Christianity in S\u00f6dermanland in the decades around 1100, Ragnhild has been supposed to be one of the three instrumental people, the earlier being [[Saint Eskil]] and later [[Saint Botvid]]. Eskil's and Botvid's legends, however, were contemporary (12th century). Ragnhild is not mentioned specifically until the 1450s in the ''Little Rhyme Chronicles'', and then in the newer preface of a 1520s reissue of the ''[[Eric Chronicle]]'' from 1335. [[Johan Peringski\u00f6ld|Peringski\u00f6ld]] provided evidence that the original epitaph on Ragnhlid's grave, describing her as a queen, had been transcribed correctly in subsequent centuries. Obvious similarities in style between Ragnhild's epitaph and that of the early 12th century sarcophagus of St. Botvid's brother Beorn in [[Botkyrka]] have led to to an additional theory of the authenticity of the former. \n\nFrom that epitaph:\n{{quotation|Ragnhild, ruler of the Swedes, a flower with no thorn, a queen for a realm, she goes out on a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem to assure herself of graceful hope and to bear the Cross's victorious and for-all-collective tag of honor. Through service she desires to acquire for herself the merciful laurel wreath of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]. Oh, pious Madame, the patron saint of T\u00e4lje residents, pray for us for the good, heavenly gifts of Christ.}}\nA legend about her by King [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]]'s librarian and court priest has Ragnhild brought up from childhood fearing God, then married to Inge, living an angelic life on earth, dead of old age in 1120 and buried in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje.\n\nWhen S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje got a new city hall in 1965, a memorial plaque to Queen Ragnhild, authored by the town's mayor in 1753, was moved to the new bulding and placed in its courtroom.\n\n==References==\n*Fr\u00f6jmark, Anders, \"Ragnhild\", ''Svenskt biografiskt lexikon'' (Swedish Biographical Dictionary), vol. 29 (1995\u20131997), pp.&nbsp;613\u2013615. {{in lang|sv}}\n*[http://runeberg.org/sqvinnor/0343.html ''Anteqningar om Svenska quinnor'' at Projekt Runeberg] (Notes on Swedish Women) {{in lang|sv}}\n*''Drottning Ragnhild och hennes gravskrift i T\u00e4lje'' by Henrik Alm, [https://libris.kb.se/bib/2490548 Libris #2490548], Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s 1931\n\n{{Swedish consorts}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ragnhild Talje}}\n[[Category:Medieval Swedish saints]]\n[[Category:S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Municipality]]\n[[Category:Swedish queens]]\n[[Category:11th-century births]]\n[[Category:1117 deaths]]\n[[Category:12th-century Swedish people]]\n[[Category:12th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Female saints of medieval Sweden]]\n[[Category:12th-century Swedish women]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnhild_of_T%C3%A4lje"}

He was the son of an unnamed sister of his predecessor, [[Kaloyan]]. After Kaloyan died unexpectedly in October 1207, Boril married his widow, a [[Kumankata|Cuman princess]], to seize the throne. His cousin, [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen]], fled from Bulgaria, enabling Boril to strengthen his position. His other kinsmen, [[Strez]] and [[Alexius Slav]],  refused to acknowledge him as the lawful monarch. Strez took possession of the land between the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and [[Vardar]] rivers with the support of [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan Nemanji\u0107 of Serbia]]. Alexius Slav secured his rule in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] with the assistance of [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], the [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]].\n\nBoril launched unsuccessful military campaigns against the Latin Empire and the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] during the first years of his reign. He convoked the [[synod]] of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Church]] in early 1211. At the assembly, the bishops condemned the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] for heresy. After an uprising broke out against him in [[Vidin]] between 1211 and 1214, he sought assistance from [[Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary]], who sent reinforcements to suppress the riot. He made peace with the Latin Empire in late 1213 or early 1214. After Henry died in 1216 and Andrew&nbsp;II left Hungary for a crusade, Ivan Asen returned to Bulgaria. He defeated Boril, who was captured and blinded in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] in 1218.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBoril was the son of a sister of [[Peter II of Bulgaria|Peter&nbsp;II]], [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen&nbsp;I]] and [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]], who were emperors (or [[tsars]]) of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|restored Bulgarian Empire]].{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=53}} The etymology of his name is uncertain, because it may be connected either to the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] verb ''boriti'' (\"to fight\"), or to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] noun ''b\u00f6ri'' (\"wolf\").{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=177}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barbolova |first=Zoya |title=\u0422\u044e\u0440\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0410\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0446\u0438 ''[Turkic elements of the names of the tsars of the Asenid dynasty]'' |journal=\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 LiterNet |volume=3 |issue=196 |publisher=LiterNet |date=25 March 2016 |language=bg |url=https://liternet.bg/publish28/zoia-barbolova/asenevci.htm |access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref> Historian Alexandru Madgearu says most recorded variants of the name ''(Boril\u01d4, Burile, Borilus, Burillus)'' suggest that \"it was pronounced Boril\u01ce, as in Romanian\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\nKaloyan died suddenly during the siege of [[Thessaloniki]] in October 1207.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=87}} Rumours started to spread claiming that the [[patron saint]] of the besieged town, [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], killed him.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}} A version of these stories names one Manastras as the murderer.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}} The [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]], [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], stated in one of his letters that Boril \"had imposed his will by violence and usurped the imperial name and insignia\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=171}} Henri de Valenciennes (who continued the chronicle of [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] after 1207) likewise described Boril as a renegade who unlawfully seized the imperial crown.{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=5, 171}} According to Madgearu, both reports suggest that Boril had his uncle murdered, most probably in cooperation with [[Kumankata|Kaloyan's wife]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=170\u2013171}} Historian [[John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.|John V.

He was the son of an unnamed sister of his predecessor, [[Kaloyan]]. After Kaloyan died unexpectedly in October 1207, Boril married his widow, a [[Kumankata|Cuman princess]], to seize the throne. His cousin, [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen]], fled from Bulgaria, enabling Boril to strengthen his position. His other kinsmen, [[Strez]] and [[Alexius Slav]],  refused to acknowledge him as the lawful monarch. Strez took possession of the land between the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and [[Vardar]] rivers with the support of [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan Nemanji\u0107 of Serbia]]. Alexius Slav secured his rule in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] with the assistance of [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], the [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]].\n\nBoril launched unsuccessful military campaigns against the Latin Empire and the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] during the first years of his reign. He convoked the [[synod]] of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Church]] in early 1211. At the assembly, the bishops condemned the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] for heresy. After an uprising broke out against him in [[Vidin]] between 1211 and 1214, he sought assistance from [[Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary]], who sent reinforcements to suppress the riot. He made peace with the Latin Empire in late 1213 or early 1214. After Henry died in 1216 and Andrew&nbsp;II left Hungary for a crusade, Ivan Asen returned to Bulgaria. He defeated Boril, who was captured and blinded in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] in 1218.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBoril was the son of a sister of [[Peter II of Bulgaria|Peter&nbsp;II]], [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen&nbsp;I]] and [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]], who were emperors (or [[tsars]]) of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|restored Bulgarian Empire]].{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=53}} The etymology of his name is uncertain, because it may be connected either to the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] verb ''boriti'' (\"to fight\"), or to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] noun ''b\u00f6ri'' (\"wolf\").{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=177}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barbolova |first=Zoya |title=\u0422\u044e\u0440\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0410\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0446\u0438 ''[Turkic elements of the names of the tsars of the Asenid dynasty]'' |journal=\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 LiterNet |volume=3 |issue=196 |publisher=LiterNet |date=25 March 2016 |language=bg |url=https://liternet.bg/publish28/zoia-barbolova/asenevci.htm |access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref> Historian Alexandru Madgearu says most recorded variants of the name ''(Boril\u01d4, Burile, Borilus, Burillus)'' suggest that \"it was pronounced Boril\u01ce, as in Romanian\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\nKaloyan died suddenly during the siege of [[Thessaloniki]] in October 1207.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=87}} Rumours started to spread claiming that the [[patron saint]] of the besieged town, [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], killed him.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}} A version of these stories names one Manastras as the murderer.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}} The [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]], [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], stated in one of his letters that Boril \"had imposed his will by violence and usurped the imperial name and insignia\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=171}} Henri de Valenciennes (who continued the chronicle of [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] after 1207) likewise described Boril as a renegade who unlawfully seized the imperial crown.{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=5, 171}} According to Madgearu, both reports suggest that Boril had his uncle murdered, most probably in cooperation with [[Kumankata|Kaloyan's wife]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|pp=170\u2013171}} Historian [[John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.|John V. A. Fine]], however, emphasises that \"there is no evidence against Boril\".{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=91}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Disintegration ===\n\nBoril married Kaloyan's widow either to strengthen his claim to the throne,{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=57}} or to secure the Cumans' support.{{sfn|Levin|1989|p=155}} However, many noblemen (among them members of his family) always regarded him as an usurper.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=92}} [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen's minor son and namesake]] soon fled to the [[Cumans]] and later to the \"lands of the Russians\"<ref name='George_Akropolites_ch20_p161'>George Akropolites: ''The History'' (ch. 20.), p. 161.</ref> (that is to [[Principality of Halych|Halych]] or

him, [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan Nemanji\u0107 of Serbia]] granted him the fortress of [[Prosek]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=182}} A third relative, [[Alexius Slav]], took possession of the region of his castle at [[Tsepina]] in the [[Rhodope Mountains]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=178}}\n\n=== War with the Latins ===\n\n[[File:Bulgaria under Boril.png|right|thumb|Bulgaria under Boril (1207-1218)]]\n\nThe Greek noblemen of eastern [[Thrace (region)|Thrace]] had risen up already and sought assistance from the Latin Empire during the reign of Kaloyan.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=93}} Boril left for Thrace to reconquer the region in May 1208.{{sfn|Madgearu|2016|p=178}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=93}} During his march, he seized parts of Alexius Slav's territory before stopping at [[Stara Zagora]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=178}} The Latin Emperor personally led his army against Boril, forcing him to withdraw to [[Plovdiv]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=178}} Although Boril's army outnumbered the Latin troops, Henry [[Battle of Plovdiv (1208)|defeated him near the town]] on 8&nbsp;July.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=178}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=385}} The Latins captured Plovdiv{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=385}} and Alexius Slav paid homage to Henry.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=178}} While Boril was waging war against the Latins, Stefan Nemanji\u0107 broke into Macedonia and occupied the land between the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and [[Vardar]] rivers.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=183}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=95}} He granted the occupied territories to Strez but left Serbian troops in the region to secure his loyalty.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=96}}\n\nThe Greek burghers of [[Serres]] in the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] sent envoys to Boril's commander in [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]], seeking his assistance against their lord in early 1209.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=97}} Henry intervened and made his own supporter the ruler of Serres.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=97}} Boril concluded an alliance with [[Theodore&nbsp;I Laskaris]], [[Empire of Nicaea|Emperor of Nicaea]], and [[Michael&nbsp;I Komnenos Doukas]], the [[Despotate of Epirus|Greek ruler of Epirus]], against the Latins.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=97}} He also made peace with Strez who had turned against Nemanji\u0107.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=183}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=96}}\n\nBoril convened a [[synod]] of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Church of his realm]] in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] in early 1211.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}} The bishops confirmed the Orthodox confession adopted at the [[Feast of Orthodoxy|synod of Constantinople]] in 843 and condemned the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], ordering their persecution as heretics.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} The synod established the [[date of Easter]] in accordance with the Catholic calendar.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}} Boril, who had presided over the synod, ordered the [[Book of Boril|publication of its decisions]] in Bulgarian on 11&nbsp;February 1211.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=184}}\n\nBoril sent an army to a mountain pass to prepare an ambush for the Latin Emperor Henry who was returning from Thessaloniki to Constantinople in April 1211.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=98}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=186}} Having been informed of Boril's plan, Henry gathered his troops from the nearby Latin fortresses and forced Boril to withdraw his army.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=186}} Strez invaded the Kingdom of Thessalonica, but Michael of Epirus, who had made peace with the Latins, broke into his realm.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}} Boril intervened in the conflict on Strez's behalf, but their united armies were defeated near [[Bitola]] in early summer.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}} He launched an assault on Thessaloniki in October, but [[Eustace of Flanders]], who administered the kingdom as regent, forced him to lift the siege with the assistance of Alexius Slav.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|pp=186\u2013187}} Alexius Slav also captured Melnik.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=99}}\n\n=== Uprising ===\n\nFine says Boril held the Church synod to secure the support of the clergy for himself, because \"popular dissatisfaction with his reign may still have existed\" in 1211.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} An uprising which broke out in [[Vidin]] between 1211 and 1214 demonstrated the existence of popular discontent with him.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=385}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} The exact circumstances of the movement are uncertain, because the only source of information about these events are in fragmentary data preserved in a Hungarian royal charter issued in 1250.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} \n\nBoril was unable to suppress the rebellion without external assistance.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}} He turned to [[Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary]], reminding him of \"their reliable friendship\".{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=191}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=58}} Andrew dispatched [[Joachim T\u00fcrje|Joachim]], [[Count of Hermannstadt]] (now Sibiu in Romania), to Bulgaria at the head of an army of [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]], Vlach, [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Sz\u00e9kely]] and [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg]] troops.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=385}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=58}} Joachim first routed three Cuman chieftains who tried to halt his invasion, then captured Vidin and handed it over to Boril.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|pp=191\u2013192}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|pp=58\u201359}}\n\n=== Reconciliation ===\n\n[[File:Eppignoc.jpg|right|thumb|Seal of [[Henry of Flanders]], [[Latin Emperor of Constantinople]]]]\n\nA papal legate (identified as [[Pelagio Galvani|Pelagius of Albano]]) came to Bulgaria in the summer of 1213.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} He continued his journey towards [[Constantinople]], implying that his mediation contributed to the subsequent reconciliation between Boril and Henry.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Boril had already realised that he would be unable to regain the Thracian territories lost to the Latin Empire.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}} However, Henry wanted to resume the war against Theodor&nbsp;I Laskaris, to put an end to his conflict with Bulgaria.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=100}} After lengthy negotiations, Henry married [[Maria of Bulgaria, Latin Empress|Boril's stepdaughter]] (whom modern historians wrongly call Maria) in late 1213 or early 1214.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nIn early 1214, Boril proposed the hand of his daughter to Andrew&nbsp;II of Hungary's son and heir, [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=192}} Madgearu says he also renounced the lands that Andrew had claimed from Bulgaria (including [[Brani\u010devo (Golubac)|Brani\u010devo]]).{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} Henry sent reinforcements to Boril who invaded Serbia and laid siege to [[Ni\u0161]] in 1214.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}} Strez also invaded Serbia from the south, but he was killed during the campaign.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=103}} Conflicts between Boril and the Latin troops prevented them from capturing the town.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=190}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=104}}\n\n=== Fall ===\n\nThe Latin Emperor Henry died in July 1216; Andrew&nbsp;II left Hungary to lead a crusade to the Holy Land in 1217.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=194}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=106}} Being deprived of his two principal allies, Boril's position weakened, which enabled his cousin, Ivan Asen, to return to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=386}} Boril was defeated and forced to withdraw to Tarnovo.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} The Byzantine historian, [[George Akropolites]], stated that the siege lasted \"for seven years\",<ref name='George_Akropolites_ch20_p161'/> but he must have confused months for years, according to most historians.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}} After Ivan Asen's troops entered the town, Boril tried to flee, but he was captured and blinded.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=106}}{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=193}}\n\n== Family ==\n\nAkropolites described Boril's first wife (the widow of his uncle) as a \"Scythian\" (or Cuman).{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=147}} Boril's marriage to her violated canon law, but the Church did not protest against it.{{sfn|Levin|1989|p=155}} [[Baldwin of Avesnes]], the ''Chronicle of Flanders'' and other Western European chronicles say that an unnamed niece of the Latin Emperor Henry (the daughter of his sister, [[Yolanda of Flanders]], and [[Peter&nbsp;II of Courtenay]]) was given in marriage to \"Johannis\", who is associated with Boril.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Historians who accept the reliability of this report{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} say that Boril married Henry's niece after their peace treaty in 1213 or 1214.{{sfn|Levin|1989|p=155}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=101}}{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=61}} If this theory is valid, Boril's first wife either had died or had been sent to a monastery.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=188}} Boril's daughter was engaged to the Hungarian crown prince, B\u00e9la, in 1214, but the marriage never took place.{{sfn|Madgearu|2017|p=192}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n=== Primary sources ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* George Akropolites: ''The History'' (Translated with and Introduction
