Its contrasting movements were reportedly composed separately by Clapton and Gordon. The piano part has also been controversially credited to [[Rita Coolidge]], Gordon's girlfriend at the time.\n\nThe song was inspired by a love story that originated in 7th-century [[Arabia]] and later formed the basis of ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'' by the 12th-century Persian poet [[Nizami Ganjavi]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem |title=Leyli o Majnun |last=Seyed-Gohrab |first=A.

Two versions have achieved chart success, the first in 1972 and the second (without the piano coda) 20 years later as an acoustic ''[[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]]'' performance by Clapton. In 2004, \"Layla\" was ranked number 27 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\", and the acoustic version won the 1993 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966, [[The Beatles|Beatles]] guitarist [[George Harrison]] married [[Pattie Boyd]], a model he met during the filming of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. During the late 1960s, Clapton and Harrison became close friends. Clapton contributed uncredited guitar work on Harrison's song \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" on [[the Beatles]]' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'', and Harrison co-wrote and played guitar [[pseudonym]]ously (as [[L'Angelo Misterioso]]) on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\" from ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|''Goodbye'']]''.

Dowd said of their guitar-playing chemistry: \"There had to be some sort of telepathy going on because I've never seen spontaneous inspiration happen at that rate and level. One of them would play something, and the other reacted instantaneously. Never once did either of them have to say, 'Could you play that again, please?' It was like two hands in a glove.

The recording of the first section consisted of sixteen tracks of which six were guitar tracks: a rhythm track by Clapton, three tracks of harmonies played by Clapton (the main power chord riff on both channels and two harmonies against that main riff, one on the left channel and one on the right channel), a track of solos by Allman (fretted solos with bent notes during the verses and a slide solo during the outro<ref name=\"gp\" />), and one track with both Allman and Clapton playing duplicate solos (the 7-note \"signature\" riff doubled in two octaves and the 12-note \"signature\" riff doubled in unison).<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /><ref name=\"Orig Track Chart\"/> According to Clapton, Allman played the first seven notes of the 12-note \"signature\" riff fretted and the last five notes on slide in standard tuning.<ref name=\"gp\">''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1985, pp. 71\u201372</ref> Each player used one input of the same two-input [[Fender Champ]] amplifier.<ref name=\"gp&tqr\">''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1985, pp. 71\u201372, ToneQuest Report, January\u2013February 2010, Vol. 11, No. 3.</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Clapton returned to the studio, where he heard Jim Gordon playing a piano piece he had composed separately. Clapton, impressed by the piece, convinced Gordon to allow it to be used as part of the song.<ref name=\"uncut\" /> Though only Gordon has been credited with this part, according to Whitlock, \"Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend [[Rita Coolidge]]. I know because in the D&B days I lived in [[John Garfield]]'s old house in the [[Hollywood Hills]] and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called 'Time'. ... Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with [[Booker T. Jones]]. ... Jim took the melody from Rita's song and didn't give her credit for writing it. Her boyfriend ripped her off.\"<ref name=whitlock>{{cite web|title=Layla\u2019s 40th: The Where's Eric!

Whitlock's story was echoed by Coolidge herself in her 2016 autobiography. The claim is also substantiated in [[Graham Nash]]'s 2014 autobiography ''Wild Tales''.\n\n\"Layla's\" second movement (the \"Piano Exit\") was recorded roughly a week after the first, with Gordon playing his piano part, Clapton playing [[acoustic guitar]] and slide guitar, and Allman playing electric and bottleneck slide guitar.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /><ref name=\"Orig Track Chart\">Original Criteria studio Track Identification Chart</ref> After Dowd spliced the two movements together,<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /> \"Layla\" was complete.\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n<score vorbis midi>\n \\relative a' {\n   \\key f \\major\n   \\time 4/4\n\nr2 r8 a16 c16 d16 f16 (d16) c16 d1~ d2~ d8\na16 c16 d16 f16 (d16) c16 d1~ d2~ d8 \na' 16 c16 d16 f16 d16 c16    \n}\n</score>\n\nThe opening five bars to the guitar part of \"Layla\"\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\nDue to the circumstances of its composition, \"Layla\" is defined by two [[Movement (music)|movements]], each marked by a riff. The first movement, which was recorded in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[D minor]] for choruses and [[C-sharp minor]] for verses,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perrin|first1=Jeff|last2=Clapton|first2=Eric|title=The Best of Eric Clapton: A Step-by-Step Breakdown of His Playing Technique|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7935-5801-8}}</ref> is centred around the \"signature riff\", a guitar piece utilising [[hammer-on]]s, [[pull-off]]s, and [[power chord]]s. The first section contains the [[Overdubbing|overdub]]-heavy slide guitar solo, played by Allman. By placing his slide at points beyond the end of the [[fretboard]], Allman was able to play notes at a higher pitch than could be played with standard technique. Dowd referred to this as \"notes that aren't on the instrument!\"<ref name=\"tomdowd\"/>{{time needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe second movement, the contribution from Jim Gordon or Rita Coolidge, is commonly referred to as the \"Piano Exit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/layla.shtml | title= Sold on Song Top 100: Layla|publisher=[[BBC Radio 2]] |accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref> Originally played in [[C major]], the tape speed of the coda was increased slightly during mixing. The resulting pitch is somewhere between C and C sharp. The piano [[break (music)|interlude]] at the end of the song is augmented by an acoustic guitar, and is also the accompaniment to the [[outro-solo]]. The same melody is also played on Allman's slide guitar an octave higher. Gordon does not improvise or deviate from the piano part; Clapton and Allman are the ones who improvise the melody. The song ends with Allman playing his signature high-pitched \"bird call\" on his slide guitar.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" />  This portion is featured prominently in the film ''[[Goodfellas]]''.\n\nAs Clapton commented on the song:<ref>{{cite web|last=Hrano|first=Mike|url=http://www.eric-clapton.co.uk/interviewsandarticles/reptileinterview.htm | title=Eric Clapton&nbsp;\u2013 The Mike Hrano Interview|accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|'Layla' is a difficult one, because it's a difficult song to perform live. You have to have a good complement of musicians to get all of the ingredients going, but when you've got that. ... It's difficult to do as a quartet, for instance, because there are some parts you have to play and sing completely opposing lines, which is almost impossible to do. If you've got a big band, which I will have on the tour, then it will be easy to do something like 'Layla'\u2014and I'm very proud of it. I love to hear it. It's almost like it's not me. It's like I'm listening to someone that I really like. Derek and The Dominos was a band I really liked\u2014and it's almost like I wasn't in that band. It's just a band that I'm a fan of. Sometimes, my own music can be like that. When it's served its purpose to being good music, I don't associate myself with it any more. It's like someone else.

In addition, the song's length proved prohibitive for radio airplay.<ref name=\"gambaccini\"/> As a result, a shortened version of the song, consisting of the first 2:43 of Part I, was released as a single in March 1971 by [[Atco Records]] in the United States. The version peaked at number 51 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart. When \"Layla\" was re-released on the 1972 compilations ''[[The History of Eric Clapton]]'' and Duane Allman's ''[[An Anthology (Duane Allman album)|An Anthology]]'' and then released the full 7:10 version (including the \"Piano Exit\" that formed Part II) as a single, it charted at number seven in the United Kingdom and reached number 10 in the United States. With good sales figures, the ''Billboard'' magazine was able to rank the Rock single as the 60th best-selling song in 1972.\n\nIn 1982, \"Layla\" was re-released as a single in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number four. This time the whole seven-minute single charted, containing the trailing two-thirds which is [[instrumental]] only. Critical opinion since has been overwhelmingly positive. [[Dave Marsh]], in ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', wrote that \"there are few moments in the repertoire of recorded rock where a singer or writer has reached so deeply into himself that the effect of hearing them is akin to witnessing a murder or a suicide... to me 'Layla' is the greatest of them.\"<ref name=\"gambaccini\"/> Marsh listed \"Layla\" at number 156 in his ''The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Marsh|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Marsh|title=The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made|publisher=DaCapo Press|year=1999|location=New York|pages=109\u201310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7czBOcRDlkC&pg=PA109|isbn=978-0-306-80901-9}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1980, \"Layla\" was covered by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], but without the lyrics, being recorded at [[EMI]] Studio One, [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]], London.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urWqOOox-Qg |title=London symphony orchestra \u2013 Layla (1981) |publisher=YouTube |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> A similar version has been performed by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYihP5qQ04A |title=The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra \u2013 Layla |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> On 20 September 1983, a benefit show called the [[ARMS Charity Concert]] for Multiple Sclerosis at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London featured a jam with Eric Clapton, [[Jeff Beck]], and [[Jimmy Page]] performing \"Layla\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/3x9kW9b3zkw/search/ronnie-lane-with-eric-clapton|title=Free Music Videos, Video Interviews, Music Video News, Live Sessions and Clips - NME.COM - - NME.COM|work=NME.COM}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Clapton, Beck, and Page were [[the Yardbirds]]' successive lead guitarists from 1963 to 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyardbirds.com/bio.html|title=The Yardbirds: Happenings 35 Years Time Later|accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the Allman Brothers Band began playing the song in concert.

Finally, Clapton agreed to release the album in a limited edition. When ''Unplugged'' sold out, Clapton gave Warner Bros. and Reprise Records the permission to delete the limited album production. For the album, Clapton decided to record both new material like \"[[Tears in Heaven]]\" and \"Lonely Stranger\" and old songs he grew up with such as \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\" or enjoyed listening to or had written as an adult, like \"[[San Francisco Bay Blues]]\" and \"Layla\".{{sfn|Clapton|2007|p=266}} Clapton, who plays acoustic guitar and sings on the live track, was backed by [[Andy Fairweather Low]] who played acoustic rhythm guitar, [[Nathan East]] on acoustic bass guitar and background vocals, [[Ray Cooper]] on percussion, [[Steve Ferrone]] on drums, [[Mac and Katie Kissoon|Katie Kissoon]] and [[Tessa Niles]] on background vocals as well as [[Chuck Leavell]] on piano.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0000081583/credits|title=MTV Unplugged \u2013 Eric Clapton &#124; Credits &#124; AllMusic|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref> Pianist Chuck Leavell recalled that recording the acoustic version of \"Layla\" felt natural to him and liked that the band was given some space to play during the body of the song and not just during the reprise like it is on the original recording. \"It gave us a chance to interpret the song in our way and it did work out well and it gave it a re-birth I think.\", Leavell said.<ref name=\"BBC4\"/> The acoustic version of \"Layla\" was produced by [[Russ Titelman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Eric-Clapton-Layla-Acoustic/release/2224951|title=Eric Clapton \u2013 Layla (Acoustic) (Vinyl) at Discogs|publisher=Discogs.com|work=Discogs|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nClapton recorded the acoustic version of \"Layla\" on a [[C.F. Martin & Co.]] steel-string acoustic guitar in OOO-42 style from 1939 which was hand built in [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania]] (No. OOO-42/73234). Clapton called this guitar one of the finest instruments he has ever used and called its sound \"incredible\". The auction house [[Christie's]] noted, \"the guitar became one of the most enduring images of recent music history\" being a part of the ''Unplugged'' album cover.{{sfn|Keane|2004|p=52}} Christie's expert for the musical department Kerry Keane called the instrument \"in the hands of Eric Clapton singly responsible for the repolarization of playing acoustic guitar today\". When Keane played the guitar, he also remarked an \"amazing\" sound as the acoustic guitar seems to have a \"wonderfully balanced tone [which is] loud and sweet at the same time with an incredible bass note.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9u8GKQWY4k|title=Eric Clapton \u2013 Christie's Guitar Auction Part 2 of 3|work=Auction Adventures|publisher=YouTube.com|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref> The vintage instrument was estimated to sell between $60,000 to $80,000 but was in the end sold for $791,500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3837649.stm|title=Clapton's guitar smashes record|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC MMIX|date=25 June 2004|location=United Kingdom|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Arrangement===\nRhythm acoustic guitar player Andy Fairweather Low was invited by Clapton to his flat in Chelsea, London to work out the songs to be recorded for the ''Unplugged'' album in January 1992. During the process, Clapton suggested that it would be a good idea to do another version of \"Layla\". Fairweather Low agreed because he had wanted to release one himself as a big Derek and the Dominos fan. Clapton thought that the perfect arrangement for the rock anthem would be a shuffle because he always liked changing the tempo of a song and looking at something from a different angle.<ref name=\"BBC4\">{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Gambaccini|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n5z2x|title=For One Night Only \u2013 Series 7, Episode 1|work=BBC Radio 4|publisher=British Broadcasting Company|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen Clapton was asked about the acoustic version of the song by the MTV Network, he replied: \"'Layla' sort of mystified me. I have done it the same all these years and never ever considered trying to revamp it. And a lot of artists do that, you know? [[Bob Dylan]] for instance changes everything everytime he plays it and I thought this was another great opportunity to just take it off on a different path, to put it to a shuffle and for a start, making it acoustic denied all the riffs, really. They would have sounded a bit weak, I think, on the acoustic guitar, so it just seemed to become Jazzier somehow. And of course, I'm singing it a whole octave down. So it gives it a nice kind of atmosphere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueT6h6qMtFo|title=Eric Clapton Unplugged EPK|work=Eric Clapton|publisher=YouTube.com|date=26 September 2013|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe song was written in the key of D minor which Clapton recalled pushed him to the top of his singing range. When Clapton slowed it down, Fairweather Low suggested Clapton should sing the track a whole octave down. Clapton was pleased with the result as it sounded \"nice\" and \"sort of Jazzy\" to him.<ref name=\"BBC4\"/> The new arrangement slowed down and re-worked the original riff and dispensed with the piano coda. Because Clapton changed the arrangement of his rock anthem so much, he decided to introduce this version to the unsuspecting live audience by stating: \"See if you can spot this one.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZV7akaSo0s|title=Eric Clapton \u2013 Layla (Unplugged)|work=Warner Bros.

Its contrasting movements were reportedly composed separately by Clapton and Gordon. The piano part has also been controversially credited to [[Rita Coolidge]], Gordon's girlfriend at the time.\n\nThe song was inspired by a love story that originated in 7th-century [[Arabia]] and later formed the basis of ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'' by the 12th-century Persian poet [[Nizami Ganjavi]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem |title=Leyli o Majnun |last=Seyed-Gohrab |first=A.

Two versions have achieved chart success, the first in 1972 and the second (without the piano coda) 20 years later as an acoustic ''[[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]]'' performance by Clapton. In 2004, \"Layla\" was ranked number 27 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\", and the acoustic version won the 1993 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966, [[The Beatles|Beatles]] guitarist [[George Harrison]] married [[Pattie Boyd]], a model he met during the filming of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. During the late 1960s, Clapton and Harrison became close friends. Clapton contributed uncredited guitar work on Harrison's song \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" on [[the Beatles]]' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'', and Harrison co-wrote and played guitar [[pseudonym]]ously (as [[L'Angelo Misterioso]]) on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\" from ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|''Goodbye'']]''.

Dowd said of their guitar-playing chemistry: \"There had to be some sort of telepathy going on because I've never seen spontaneous inspiration happen at that rate and level. One of them would play something, and the other reacted instantaneously. Never once did either of them have to say, 'Could you play that again, please?' It was like two hands in a glove.

The recording of the first section consisted of sixteen tracks of which six were guitar tracks: a rhythm track by Clapton, three tracks of harmonies played by Clapton (the main power chord riff on both channels and two harmonies against that main riff, one on the left channel and one on the right channel), a track of solos by Allman (fretted solos with bent notes during the verses and a slide solo during the outro<ref name=\"gp\" />), and one track with both Allman and Clapton playing duplicate solos (the 7-note \"signature\" riff doubled in two octaves and the 12-note \"signature\" riff doubled in unison).<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /><ref name=\"Orig Track Chart\"/> According to Clapton, Allman played the first seven notes of the 12-note \"signature\" riff fretted and the last five notes on slide in standard tuning.<ref name=\"gp\">''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1985, pp. 71\u201372</ref> Each player used one input of the same two-input [[Fender Champ]] amplifier.<ref name=\"gp&tqr\">''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1985, pp. 71\u201372, ToneQuest Report, January\u2013February 2010, Vol. 11, No. 3.</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Clapton returned to the studio, where he heard Jim Gordon playing a piano piece he had composed separately. Clapton, impressed by the piece, convinced Gordon to allow it to be used as part of the song.<ref name=\"uncut\" /> Though only Gordon has been credited with this part, according to Whitlock, \"Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend [[Rita Coolidge]]. I know because in the D&B days I lived in [[John Garfield]]'s old house in the [[Hollywood Hills]] and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called 'Time'. ... Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with [[Booker T. Jones]]. ...

Whitlock's story was echoed by Coolidge herself in her 2016 autobiography. The claim is also substantiated in [[Graham Nash]]'s 2014 autobiography ''Wild Tales''.\n\n\"Layla's\" second movement (the \"Piano Exit\") was recorded roughly a week after the first, with Gordon playing his piano part, Clapton playing [[acoustic guitar]] and slide guitar, and Allman playing electric and bottleneck slide guitar.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /><ref name=\"Orig Track Chart\">Original Criteria studio Track Identification Chart</ref> After Dowd spliced the two movements together,<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /> \"Layla\" was complete.\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n<score vorbis midi>\n \\relative a' {\n   \\key f \\major\n   \\time 4/4\n\nr2 r8 a16 c16 d16 f16 (d16) c16 d1~ d2~ d8\na16 c16 d16 f16 (d16) c16 d1~ d2~ d8 \na' 16 c16 d16 f16 d16 c16    \n}\n</score>\n\nThe opening five bars to the guitar part of \"Layla\"\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\nDue to the circumstances of its composition, \"Layla\" is defined by two [[Movement (music)|movements]], each marked by a riff. The first movement, which was recorded in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[D minor]] for choruses and [[C-sharp minor]] for verses,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perrin|first1=Jeff|last2=Clapton|first2=Eric|title=The Best of Eric Clapton: A Step-by-Step Breakdown of His Playing Technique|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7935-5801-8}}</ref> is centred around the \"signature riff\", a guitar piece utilising [[hammer-on]]s, [[pull-off]]s, and [[power chord]]s. The first section contains the [[Overdubbing|overdub]]-heavy slide guitar solo, played by Allman. By placing his slide at points beyond the end of the [[fretboard]], Allman was able to play notes at a higher pitch than could be played with standard technique. Dowd referred to this as \"notes that aren't on the instrument!\"<ref name=\"tomdowd\"/>{{time needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe second movement, the contribution from Jim Gordon or Rita Coolidge, is commonly referred to as the \"Piano Exit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/layla.shtml | title= Sold on Song Top 100: Layla|publisher=[[BBC Radio 2]] |accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref> Originally played in [[C major]], the tape speed of the coda was increased slightly during mixing. The resulting pitch is somewhere between C and C sharp. The piano [[break (music)|interlude]] at the end of the song is augmented by an acoustic guitar, and is also the accompaniment to the [[outro-solo]]. The same melody is also played on Allman's slide guitar an octave higher. Gordon does not improvise or deviate from the piano part; Clapton and Allman are the ones who improvise the melody. The song ends with Allman playing his signature high-pitched \"bird call\" on his slide guitar.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" />  This portion is featured prominently in the film ''[[Goodfellas]]''.\n\nAs Clapton commented on the song:<ref>{{cite web|last=Hrano|first=Mike|url=http://www.eric-clapton.co.uk/interviewsandarticles/reptileinterview.htm | title=Eric Clapton&nbsp;\u2013 The Mike Hrano Interview|accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|'Layla' is a difficult one, because it's a difficult song to perform live. You have to have a good complement of musicians to get all of the ingredients going, but when you've got that. ... It's difficult to do as a quartet, for instance, because there are some parts you have to play and sing completely opposing lines, which is almost impossible to do. If you've got a big band, which I will have on the tour, then it will be easy to do something like 'Layla'\u2014and I'm very proud of it. I love to hear it. It's almost like it's not me. It's like I'm listening to someone that I really like. Derek and The Dominos was a band I really liked\u2014and it's almost like I wasn't in that band. It's just a band that I'm a fan of. Sometimes, my own music can be like that. When it's served its purpose to being good music, I don't associate myself with it any more. It's like someone else.

In addition, the song's length proved prohibitive for radio airplay.<ref name=\"gambaccini\"/> As a result, a shortened version of the song, consisting of the first 2:43 of Part I, was released as a single in March 1971 by [[Atco Records]] in the United States. The version peaked at number 51 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart. When \"Layla\" was re-released on the 1972 compilations ''[[The History of Eric Clapton]]'' and Duane Allman's ''[[An Anthology (Duane Allman album)|An Anthology]]'' and then released the full 7:10 version (including the \"Piano Exit\" that formed Part II) as a single, it charted at number seven in the United Kingdom and reached number 10 in the United States. With good sales figures, the ''Billboard'' magazine was able to rank the Rock single as the 60th best-selling song in 1972.\n\nIn 1982, \"Layla\" was re-released as a single in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number four. This time the whole seven-minute single charted, containing the trailing two-thirds which is [[instrumental]] only. Critical opinion since has been overwhelmingly positive. [[Dave Marsh]], in ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', wrote that \"there are few moments in the repertoire of recorded rock where a singer or writer has reached so deeply into himself that the effect of hearing them is akin to witnessing a murder or a suicide... to me 'Layla' is the greatest of them.\"<ref name=\"gambaccini\"/> Marsh listed \"Layla\" at number 156 in his ''The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Marsh|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Marsh|title=The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made|publisher=DaCapo Press|year=1999|location=New York|pages=109\u201310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7czBOcRDlkC&pg=PA109|isbn=978-0-306-80901-9}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1980, \"Layla\" was covered by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], but without the lyrics, being recorded at [[EMI]] Studio One, [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]], London.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urWqOOox-Qg |title=London symphony orchestra \u2013 Layla (1981) |publisher=YouTube |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> A similar version has been performed by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYihP5qQ04A |title=The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra \u2013 Layla |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> On 20 September 1983, a benefit show called the [[ARMS Charity Concert]] for Multiple Sclerosis at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London featured a jam with Eric Clapton, [[Jeff Beck]], and [[Jimmy Page]] performing \"Layla\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/3x9kW9b3zkw/search/ronnie-lane-with-eric-clapton|title=Free Music Videos, Video Interviews, Music Video News, Live Sessions and Clips - NME.COM - - NME.COM|work=NME.COM}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Clapton, Beck, and Page were [[the Yardbirds]]' successive lead guitarists from 1963 to 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyardbirds.com/bio.html|title=The Yardbirds: Happenings 35 Years Time Later|accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the Allman Brothers Band began playing the song in concert.

Finally, Clapton agreed to release the album in a limited edition. When ''Unplugged'' sold out, Clapton gave Warner Bros. and Reprise Records the permission to delete the limited album production. For the album, Clapton decided to record both new material like \"[[Tears in Heaven]]\" and \"Lonely Stranger\" and old songs he grew up with such as \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\" or enjoyed listening to or had written as an adult, like \"[[San Francisco Bay Blues]]\" and \"Layla\".{{sfn|Clapton|2007|p=266}} Clapton, who plays acoustic guitar and sings on the live track, was backed by [[Andy Fairweather Low]] who played acoustic rhythm guitar, [[Nathan East]] on acoustic bass guitar and background vocals, [[Ray Cooper]] on percussion, [[Steve Ferrone]] on drums, [[Mac and Katie Kissoon|Katie Kissoon]] and [[Tessa Niles]] on background vocals as well as [[Chuck Leavell]] on piano.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0000081583/credits|title=MTV Unplugged \u2013 Eric Clapton &#124; Credits &#124; AllMusic|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref> Pianist Chuck Leavell recalled that recording the acoustic version of \"Layla\" felt natural to him and liked that the band was given some space to play during the body of the song and not just during the reprise like it is on the original recording. \"It gave us a chance to interpret the song in our way and it did work out well and it gave it a re-birth I think.\", Leavell said.<ref name=\"BBC4\"/> The acoustic version of \"Layla\" was produced by [[Russ Titelman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Eric-Clapton-Layla-Acoustic/release/2224951|title=Eric Clapton \u2013 Layla (Acoustic) (Vinyl) at Discogs|publisher=Discogs.com|work=Discogs|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nClapton recorded the acoustic version of \"Layla\" on a [[C.F. Martin & Co.]] steel-string acoustic guitar in OOO-42 style from 1939 which was hand built in [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania]] (No. OOO-42/73234). Clapton called this guitar one of the finest instruments he has ever used and called its sound \"incredible\". The auction house [[Christie's]] noted, \"the guitar became one of the most enduring images of recent music history\" being a part of the ''Unplugged'' album cover.{{sfn|Keane|2004|p=52}} Christie's expert for the musical department Kerry Keane called the instrument \"in the hands of Eric Clapton singly responsible for the repolarization of playing acoustic guitar today\". When Keane played the guitar, he also remarked an \"amazing\" sound as the acoustic guitar seems to have a \"wonderfully balanced tone [which is] loud and sweet at the same time with an incredible bass note.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9u8GKQWY4k|title=Eric Clapton \u2013 Christie's Guitar Auction Part 2 of 3|work=Auction Adventures|publisher=YouTube.com|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref> The vintage instrument was estimated to sell between $60,000 to $80,000 but was in the end sold for $791,500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3837649.stm|title=Clapton's guitar smashes record|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC MMIX|date=25 June 2004|location=United Kingdom|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Arrangement===\nRhythm acoustic guitar player Andy Fairweather Low was invited by Clapton to his flat in Chelsea, London to work out the songs to be recorded for the ''Unplugged'' album in January 1992. During the process, Clapton suggested that it would be a good idea to do another version of \"Layla\". Fairweather Low agreed because he had wanted to release one himself as a big Derek and the Dominos fan. Clapton thought that the perfect arrangement for the rock anthem would be a shuffle because he always liked changing the tempo of a song and looking at something from a different angle.<ref name=\"BBC4\">{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Gambaccini|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n5z2x|title=For One Night Only \u2013 Series 7, Episode 1|work=BBC Radio 4|publisher=British Broadcasting Company|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen Clapton was asked about the acoustic version of the song by the MTV Network, he replied: \"'Layla' sort of mystified me. I have done it the same all these years and never ever considered trying to revamp it. And a lot of artists do that, you know? [[Bob Dylan]] for instance changes everything everytime he plays it and I thought this was another great opportunity to just take it off on a different path, to put it to a shuffle and for a start, making it acoustic denied all the riffs, really. They would have sounded a bit weak, I think, on the acoustic guitar, so it just seemed to become Jazzier somehow. And of course, I'm singing it a whole octave down. So it gives it a nice kind of atmosphere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueT6h6qMtFo|title=Eric Clapton Unplugged EPK|work=Eric Clapton|publisher=YouTube.com|date=26 September 2013|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe song was written in the key of D minor which Clapton recalled pushed him to the top of his singing range. When Clapton slowed it down, Fairweather Low suggested Clapton should sing the track a whole octave down. Clapton was pleased with the result as it sounded \"nice\" and \"sort of Jazzy\" to him.<ref name=\"BBC4\"/> The new arrangement slowed down and re-worked the original riff and dispensed with the piano coda. Because Clapton changed the arrangement of his rock anthem so much, he decided to introduce this version to the unsuspecting live audience by stating: \"See if you can spot this one.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZV7akaSo0s|title=Eric Clapton \u2013 Layla (Unplugged)|work=Warner Bros.
