From the very beginning of fuzzy sets, criticism was made about the fact that the membership function of a type-1 fuzzy set has no uncertainty associated with it, something that seems to contradict the word ''fuzzy'', since that word has the connotation of lots of uncertainty. So, what does one do when there is uncertainty about the value of the membership function? The answer to this question was provided in 1975 by the inventor of fuzzy sets, Prof. [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]]<ref name=\"[27]\">L. A. Zadeh, \"The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning\u20131,\" ''Information Sciences'', vol. 8, pp.&nbsp;199\u2013249, 1975.</ref>, when he proposed more sophisticated kinds of fuzzy sets, the first of which he called a '''''type-2 fuzzy set'''''. A type-2 fuzzy set lets us incorporate uncertainty about the membership function into fuzzy set theory, and is a way to address the above criticism of type-1 fuzzy sets head-on. And, if there is no uncertainty, then a type-2 fuzzy set reduces to a type-1 fuzzy set, which is analogous to probability reducing to determinism when unpredictability vanishes.\n\nIn order to symbolically distinguish between a type-1 fuzzy set and a type-2 fuzzy set, a tilde symbol is put over the symbol for the fuzzy set; so, A denotes a type-1 fuzzy set, whereas \u00c3 denotes the comparable type-2 fuzzy set. When the latter is done, the resulting type-2 fuzzy set is called a '''''general type-2 fuzzy set''''' (to distinguish it from the special interval type-2 fuzzy set).\n\nProf. Zadeh didn't stop with type-2 fuzzy sets, because in that 1976 paper<ref name=\"[27]\" /> he also generalized all of this to type-''n'' fuzzy sets. The present article focuses only on type-2 fuzzy sets because they are the ''next step'' in the logical progression from type-1 to type-''n'' fuzzy sets, where ''n'' = 1, 2, \u2026 . Although some researchers are beginning to explore higher than type-2 fuzzy sets, as of early 2009, this work is in its infancy.\n\n[[Image:MF of general T2 FS.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 1. The membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set is three-dimensional. A cross-section of one slice of the third dimension is shown. This cross-section, as well as all others, sits on the FOU. Only the boundary of the cross-section is used to describe the membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set. It is shown filled-in for artistic purposes.]]\nThe membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set, \u00c3, is three-dimensional (Fig. 1), where the third dimension is the value of the membership function at each point on its two-dimensional domain that is called its '''''footprint of uncertainty''''' (FOU).\n\nFor an interval type-2 fuzzy set that third-dimension value is the same (e.g., 1) everywhere, which means that no new information is contained in the third dimension of an interval type-2 fuzzy set. So, for such a set, the third dimension is ignored, and only the FOU is used to describe it. It is for this reason that an interval type-2 fuzzy set is sometimes called a ''first-order uncertainty'' fuzzy set model, whereas a general type-2 fuzzy set (with its useful third-dimension) is sometimes referred to as a ''second-order uncertainty'' fuzzy set model.\n\n[[Image:FOU for IT2 FS.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 2. FOU for an interval type-2 fuzzy set. Many other shapes are possible for the FOU.]]\nThe FOU represents the blurring of a type-1 membership function, and is completely described by its two bounding functions (Fig. 2), a lower membership function (LMF) and an upper membership function (UMF), both of which are type-1 fuzzy sets! Consequently, it is possible to use type-1 fuzzy set mathematics to characterize and work with interval type-2 fuzzy sets. This means that engineers and scientists who already know type-1 fuzzy sets will not have to invest a lot of time learning about general type-2 fuzzy set mathematics in order to understand and use interval type-2 fuzzy sets.\n\nWork on type-2 fuzzy sets languished during the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, although a small number of articles were published about them. People were still trying to figure out what to do with type-1 fuzzy sets, so even though Zadeh proposed type-2 fuzzy sets in 1976, the time was not right for researchers to drop what they were doing with type-1 fuzzy sets to focus on type-2 fuzzy sets. This changed in the latter part of the 1990s as a result of Prof. Jerry Mendel and his student's works on type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.<ref name=\"[12]\">J. M. Mendel, ''Uncertain Rule-Based Fuzzy Logic Systems: Introduction and New Directions'', Prentice-Hall, Upper-Saddle River, NJ, 2001.</ref> Since then, more and more researchers around the world are writing articles about type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.\n\n==Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets==\nInterval type-2 fuzzy sets have received the most attention because the mathematics that is needed for such sets\u2014primarily [[Interval arithmetic]]\u2014is much simpler than the mathematics that is needed for general type-2 fuzzy sets. So, the literature about interval type-2 fuzzy sets is large, whereas the literature about general type-2 fuzzy sets is much smaller. Both kinds of fuzzy sets are being actively researched by an ever-growing number of researchers around the world and have resulted in successful employment in variety of domains such as robot control.<ref name=hassanzadeh>Hassanzadeh, Hamid Reza, et al. \"An interval-valued fuzzy controller for complex dynamical systems with application to a 3-PSP parallel robot.\" Fuzzy sets and systems 235 (2014): 83-100.</ref>\n\nFormilleri for the following have already been worked out for interval type-2 fuzzy sets:\n\n* [[Fuzzy set operations]]: union, intersection and complement<ref name=\"[6]\">N.

A block diagram of a type-2 FLS is depicted in Fig. 3. This kind of FLS is used in fuzzy logic control, fuzzy logic signal processing, rule-based classification, etc., and is sometimes referred to as a ''function approximation'' application of fuzzy sets, because the FLS is designed to minimize an error function.\n\n[[Image:T2 FLS.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3. Type-2 FLS]]\n\nThe following discussions, about the four components in the Fig. 3 rule-based FLS, are given for an interval type-2 FLS, because to-date they are the most popular kind of type-2 FLS; however, most of the discussions are also applicable for a general type-2 FLS.\n\n'''''Rules''''', that are either provided by subject experts or are extracted from numerical data, are expressed as a collection of IF-THEN statements, e.g.,\n\n:IF temperature is ''moderate'' and pressure is ''high'', then rotate the valve ''a bit to the right''.\n\nFuzzy sets are associated with the terms that appear in the antecedents (IF-part) or consequents (THEN-part) of rules, and with the inputs to and the outputs of the FLS. Membership functions are used to describe these fuzzy sets, and in a type-1 FLS they are all type-1 fuzzy sets, whereas in an interval type-2 FLS at least one membership function is an interval type-2 fuzzy set.\n\nAn interval type-2 FLS lets any one or all of the following kinds of uncertainties be quantified:\n\n# Words that are used in antecedents and consequents of rules\u2014because words can mean different things to different people.\n# Uncertain consequents\u2014because when rules are obtained from a group of experts, consequents will often be different for the same rule, i.e. the experts will not necessarily be in agreement.\n# Membership function parameters\u2014because when those parameters are optimized using uncertain (noisy) training data, the parameters become uncertain.\n# Noisy measurements\u2014because very often it is such measurements that activate the FLS.\n\nIn Fig. 3, measured (crisp) inputs are first transformed into fuzzy sets in the '''''Fuzzifier''''' block because it is fuzzy sets and not numbers that activate the rules which are described in terms of fuzzy sets and not numbers. Three kinds of fuzzifiers are possible in an interval type-2 FLS. When measurements are:\n* Perfect, they are modeled as a crisp set;  \n* Noisy, but the noise is stationary, they are modeled as a type-1 fuzzy set; and,\n* Noisy, but the noise is non-stationary, they are modeled as an interval type-2 fuzzy set (this latter kind of fuzzification cannot be done in a type-1 FLS).\n\nIn Fig. 3, after measurements are fuzzified, the resulting input fuzzy sets are mapped into fuzzy output sets by the '''''Inference''''' block. This is accomplished by first quantifying each rule using fuzzy set theory, and by then using the mathematics of fuzzy sets to establish the output of each rule, with the help of an inference mechanism. If there are ''M'' rules then the fuzzy input sets to the Inference block will activate only a subset of those rules, where the subset contains at least one rule and usually way fewer than ''M'' rules. Inference is done one rule at a time. So, at the output of the Inference block, there will be one or more ''fired-rule fuzzy output sets''.\n\nIn most engineering applications of a FLS, a number (and not a fuzzy set) is needed as its final output, e.g., the consequent of the rule given above is \"Rotate the valve a bit to the right.\" No automatic valve will know what this means because \"a bit to the right\" is a linguistic expression, and a valve must be turned by numerical values, i.e. by a certain number of degrees. Consequently, the fired-rule output fuzzy sets have to be converted into a number, and this is done in the Fig. 3 '''''Output Processing''''' block.\n\nIn a type-1 FLS, output processing, called '''''[[Defuzzification]]''''', maps a type-1 fuzzy set into a number. There are many ways for doing this, e.g., compute the union of the fired-rule output fuzzy sets (the result is another type-1 fuzzy set) and then compute the center of gravity of the membership function for that set; compute a weighted average of the center of gravities of each of the fired rule consequent membership functions; etc.\n\nThings are somewhat more complicated for an interval type-2 FLS, because to go from an interval type-2 fuzzy set to a number (usually) requires two steps (Fig. 3). The first step, called '''''type-reduction''''', is where an interval type-2 fuzzy set is reduced to an interval-valued type-1 fuzzy set. There are as many type-reduction methods as there are type-1 defuzzification methods. An algorithm developed by Karnik and Mendel<ref name=\"[7]\" /><ref name=\"[12]\" /> now known as the '''''KM Algorithm''''' is used for type-reduction. Although this algorithm is iterative, it is very fast.\n\nThe second step of Output Processing, which occurs after type-reduction, is still called '''''defuzzification'''''. Because a type-reduced set of an interval type-2 fuzzy set is always a finite interval of numbers, the defuzzified value is just the average of the two end-points of this interval.\n\nIt is clear from Fig. 3 that there can be two outputs to an interval type-2 FLS\u2014crisp numerical values and the type-reduced set. The latter provides a measure of the uncertainties that have flowed through the interval type-2 FLS, due to the (possibly) uncertain input measurements that have activated rules whose antecedents or consequents or both are uncertain. Just as standard deviation is widely used in probability and statistics to provide a measure of unpredictable uncertainty about a mean value, the type-reduced set can provided a measure of uncertainty about the crisp output of an interval type-2 FLS.\n\n==Computing with words==\nAnother application for fuzzy sets has also been inspired by Prof. Zadeh<ref name=\"[28]\">L. A. Zadeh, \"Fuzzy logic = computing with words,\" ''IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy Systems'', vol. 4, pp.&nbsp;103\u2013111, 1996.</ref><ref name=\"[29]\">L. A.

A. Zadeh, \"Toward human level machine intelligence\u2014is it achievable? The need for a new paradigm shift,\" ''IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'', vol. 3, pp.&nbsp;11\u201322, August 2008.</ref> \u2014 '''''Computing With Words'''''. Different acronyms have been used for \"computing with words,\" e.g., CW and CWW. According to Zadeh:\n:CWW is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. [It is] inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. \nOf course, he did not mean that computers would actually compute using words\u2014single words or phrases\u2014rather than numbers. He meant that computers would be activated by words, which would be converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets and that these fuzzy sets would be mapped by a CWW engine into some other fuzzy set after which the latter would be converted back into a word. A natural question to ask is: Which kind of fuzzy set\u2014type-1 or type-2\u2014should be used as a model for a word? Mendel<ref name=\"[13]\">J. M. Mendel, \"Fuzzy Sets for Words: a New Beginning,\" ''Proc. IEEE FUZZ Conference'', St. Louis, MO, May 26\u201328, 2003, pp.&nbsp;37\u201342.</ref><ref name=\"[16]\">J. M. Mendel, \"Computing with words: Zadeh, Turing, Popper and Occam,\" ''IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'', vol. 2, pp.&nbsp;10\u201317, November 2007.</ref> has argued, on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s concept of '''''[[Falsificationism]]''''',<ref name=\"[19]\">K. Popper, ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' (translation of Logik der Forschung), Hutchinson, London, 1959.</ref><ref name=\"[30]\" /> that using a type-1 fuzzy set as a model for a word is scientifically incorrect. An interval type-2 fuzzy set should be used as a (first-order uncertainty) model for a word. Much research is under way about CWW.\n\n== Applications ==\nType-2 fuzzy sets were applied in image processing, video processing and computer vision, as well as [[Failure mode and effects analysis|Failure Mode And Effect Analysis.]]<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Chai K.C.|author2=Tay K.

From the very beginning of fuzzy sets, criticism was made about the fact that the membership function of a type-1 fuzzy set has no uncertainty associated with it, something that seems to contradict the word ''fuzzy'', since that word has the connotation of lots of uncertainty. So, what does one do when there is uncertainty about the value of the membership function? The answer to this question was provided in 1975 by the inventor of fuzzy sets, Prof. [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]]<ref name=\"[27]\">L. A. Zadeh, \"The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning\u20131,\" ''Information Sciences'', vol. 8, pp.&nbsp;199\u2013249, 1975.</ref>, when he proposed more sophisticated kinds of fuzzy sets, the first of which he called a '''''type-2 fuzzy set'''''. A type-2 fuzzy set lets us incorporate uncertainty about the membership function into fuzzy set theory, and is a way to address the above criticism of type-1 fuzzy sets head-on. And, if there is no uncertainty, then a type-2 fuzzy set reduces to a type-1 fuzzy set, which is analogous to probability reducing to determinism when unpredictability vanishes.\n\nIn order to symbolically distinguish between a type-1 fuzzy set and a type-2 fuzzy set, a tilde symbol is put over the symbol for the fuzzy set; so, A denotes a type-1 fuzzy set, whereas \u00c3 denotes the comparable type-2 fuzzy set. When the latter is done, the resulting type-2 fuzzy set is called a '''''general type-2 fuzzy set''''' (to distinguish it from the special interval type-2 fuzzy set).\n\nProf. Zadeh didn't stop with type-2 fuzzy sets, because in that 1976 paper<ref name=\"[27]\" /> he also generalized all of this to type-''n'' fuzzy sets. The present article focuses only on type-2 fuzzy sets because they are the ''next step'' in the logical progression from type-1 to type-''n'' fuzzy sets, where ''n'' = 1, 2, \u2026 . Although some researchers are beginning to explore higher than type-2 fuzzy sets, as of early 2009, this work is in its infancy.\n\n[[Image:MF of general T2 FS.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 1. The membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set is three-dimensional. A cross-section of one slice of the third dimension is shown. This cross-section, as well as all others, sits on the FOU. Only the boundary of the cross-section is used to describe the membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set. It is shown filled-in for artistic purposes.]]\nThe membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set, \u00c3, is three-dimensional (Fig. 1), where the third dimension is the value of the membership function at each point on its two-dimensional domain that is called its '''''footprint of uncertainty''''' (FOU).\n\nFor an interval type-2 fuzzy set that third-dimension value is the same (e.g., 1) everywhere, which means that no new information is contained in the third dimension of an interval type-2 fuzzy set. So, for such a set, the third dimension is ignored, and only the FOU is used to describe it. It is for this reason that an interval type-2 fuzzy set is sometimes called a ''first-order uncertainty'' fuzzy set model, whereas a general type-2 fuzzy set (with its useful third-dimension) is sometimes referred to as a ''second-order uncertainty'' fuzzy set model.\n\n[[Image:FOU for IT2 FS.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 2. FOU for an interval type-2 fuzzy set. Many other shapes are possible for the FOU.]]\nThe FOU represents the blurring of a type-1 membership function, and is completely described by its two bounding functions (Fig. 2), a lower membership function (LMF) and an upper membership function (UMF), both of which are type-1 fuzzy sets! Consequently, it is possible to use type-1 fuzzy set mathematics to characterize and work with interval type-2 fuzzy sets. This means that engineers and scientists who already know type-1 fuzzy sets will not have to invest a lot of time learning about general type-2 fuzzy set mathematics in order to understand and use interval type-2 fuzzy sets.\n\nWork on type-2 fuzzy sets languished during the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990's, although a small number of articles were published about them. People were still trying to figure out what to do with type-1 fuzzy sets, so even though Zadeh proposed type-2 fuzzy sets in 1976, the time was not right for researchers to drop what they were doing with type-1 fuzzy sets to focus on type-2 fuzzy sets. This changed in the latter part of the 1990s as a result of Prof. Jerry Mendel and his student's works on type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.<ref name=\"[12]\">J. M. Mendel, ''Uncertain Rule-Based Fuzzy Logic Systems: Introduction and New Directions'', Prentice-Hall, Upper-Saddle River, NJ, 2001.</ref> Since then, more and more researchers around the world are writing articles about type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.\n\n==Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets==\nInterval type-2 fuzzy sets have received the most attention because the mathematics that is needed for such sets\u2014primarily [[Interval arithmetic]]\u2014is much simpler than the mathematics that is needed for general type-2 fuzzy sets. So, the literature about interval type-2 fuzzy sets is large, whereas the literature about general type-2 fuzzy sets is much smaller. Both kinds of fuzzy sets are being actively researched by an ever-growing number of researchers around the world and have resulted in successful employment in variety of domains such as robot control.<ref name=hassanzadeh>Hassanzadeh, Hamid Reza, et al. \"An interval-valued fuzzy controller for complex dynamical systems with application to a 3-PSP parallel robot.\" Fuzzy sets and systems 235 (2014): 83-100.</ref>\n\nFormilleri for the following have already been worked out for interval type-2 fuzzy sets:\n\n* [[Fuzzy set operations]]: union, intersection and complement<ref name=\"[6]\">N.

A block diagram of a type-2 FLS is depicted in Fig. 3. This kind of FLS is used in fuzzy logic control, fuzzy logic signal processing, rule-based classification, etc., and is sometimes referred to as a ''function approximation'' application of fuzzy sets, because the FLS is designed to minimize an error function.\n\n[[Image:T2 FLS.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3. Type-2 FLS]]\n\nThe following discussions, about the four components in the Fig. 3 rule-based FLS, are given for an interval type-2 FLS, because to-date they are the most popular kind of type-2 FLS; however, most of the discussions are also applicable for a general type-2 FLS.\n\n'''''Rules''''', that are either provided by subject experts or are extracted from numerical data, are expressed as a collection of IF-THEN statements, e.g.,\n\n:IF temperature is ''moderate'' and pressure is ''high'', then rotate the valve ''a bit to the right''.\n\nFuzzy sets are associated with the terms that appear in the antecedents (IF-part) or consequents (THEN-part) of rules, and with the inputs to and the outputs of the FLS. Membership functions are used to describe these fuzzy sets, and in a type-1 FLS they are all type-1 fuzzy sets, whereas in an interval type-2 FLS at least one membership function is an interval type-2 fuzzy set.\n\nAn interval type-2 FLS lets any one or all of the following kinds of uncertainties be quantified:\n\n# Words that are used in antecedents and consequents of rules\u2014because words can mean different things to different people.\n# Uncertain consequents\u2014because when rules are obtained from a group of experts, consequents will often be different for the same rule, i.e. the experts will not necessarily be in agreement.\n# Membership function parameters\u2014because when those parameters are optimized using uncertain (noisy) training data, the parameters become uncertain.\n# Noisy measurements\u2014because very often it is such measurements that activate the FLS.\n\nIn Fig. 3, measured (crisp) inputs are first transformed into fuzzy sets in the '''''Fuzzifier''''' block because it is fuzzy sets and not numbers that activate the rules which are described in terms of fuzzy sets and not numbers. Three kinds of fuzzifiers are possible in an interval type-2 FLS. When measurements are:\n* Perfect, they are modeled as a crisp set;  \n* Noisy, but the noise is stationary, they are modeled as a type-1 fuzzy set; and,\n* Noisy, but the noise is non-stationary, they are modeled as an interval type-2 fuzzy set (this latter kind of fuzzification cannot be done in a type-1 FLS).\n\nIn Fig. 3, after measurements are fuzzified, the resulting input fuzzy sets are mapped into fuzzy output sets by the '''''Inference''''' block. This is accomplished by first quantifying each rule using fuzzy set theory, and by then using the mathematics of fuzzy sets to establish the output of each rule, with the help of an inference mechanism. If there are ''M'' rules then the fuzzy input sets to the Inference block will activate only a subset of those rules, where the subset contains at least one rule and usually way fewer than ''M'' rules. Inference is done one rule at a time. So, at the output of the Inference block, there will be one or more ''fired-rule fuzzy output sets''.\n\nIn most engineering applications of a FLS, a number (and not a fuzzy set) is needed as its final output, e.g., the consequent of the rule given above is \"Rotate the valve a bit to the right.\" No automatic valve will know what this means because \"a bit to the right\" is a linguistic expression, and a valve must be turned by numerical values, i.e. by a certain number of degrees. Consequently, the fired-rule output fuzzy sets have to be converted into a number, and this is done in the Fig. 3 '''''Output Processing''''' block.\n\nIn a type-1 FLS, output processing, called '''''[[Defuzzification]]''''', maps a type-1 fuzzy set into a number. There are many ways for doing this, e.g., compute the union of the fired-rule output fuzzy sets (the result is another type-1 fuzzy set) and then compute the center of gravity of the membership function for that set; compute a weighted average of the center of gravities of each of the fired rule consequent membership functions; etc.\n\nThings are somewhat more complicated for an interval type-2 FLS, because to go from an interval type-2 fuzzy set to a number (usually) requires two steps (Fig. 3). The first step, called '''''type-reduction''''', is where an interval type-2 fuzzy set is reduced to an interval-valued type-1 fuzzy set. There are as many type-reduction methods as there are type-1 defuzzification methods. An algorithm developed by Karnik and Mendel<ref name=\"[7]\" /><ref name=\"[12]\" /> now known as the '''''KM Algorithm''''' is used for type-reduction. Although this algorithm is iterative, it is very fast.\n\nThe second step of Output Processing, which occurs after type-reduction, is still called '''''defuzzification'''''. Because a type-reduced set of an interval type-2 fuzzy set is always a finite interval of numbers, the defuzzified value is just the average of the two end-points of this interval.\n\nIt is clear from Fig. 3 that there can be two outputs to an interval type-2 FLS\u2014crisp numerical values and the type-reduced set. The latter provides a measure of the uncertainties that have flowed through the interval type-2 FLS, due to the (possibly) uncertain input measurements that have activated rules whose antecedents or consequents or both are uncertain. Just as standard deviation is widely used in probability and statistics to provide a measure of unpredictable uncertainty about a mean value, the type-reduced set can provided a measure of uncertainty about the crisp output of an interval type-2 FLS.\n\n==Computing with words==\nAnother application for fuzzy sets has also been inspired by Prof. Zadeh<ref name=\"[28]\">L. A. Zadeh, \"Fuzzy logic = computing with words,\" ''IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy Systems'', vol. 4, pp.&nbsp;103\u2013111, 1996.</ref><ref name=\"[29]\">L. A.

The need for a new paradigm shift,\" ''IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'', vol. 3, pp.&nbsp;11\u201322, August 2008.</ref> \u2014 '''''Computing With Words'''''. Different acronyms have been used for \"computing with words,\" e.g., CW and CWW. According to Zadeh:\n:CWW is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. [It is] inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. \nOf course, he did not mean that computers would actually compute using words\u2014single words or phrases\u2014rather than numbers. He meant that computers would be activated by words, which would be converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets and that these fuzzy sets would be mapped by a CWW engine into some other fuzzy set after which the latter would be converted back into a word. A natural question to ask is: Which kind of fuzzy set\u2014type-1 or type-2\u2014should be used as a model for a word? Mendel<ref name=\"[13]\">J. M.

Mendel, \"Computing with words: Zadeh, Turing, Popper and Occam,\" ''IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'', vol. 2, pp.&nbsp;10\u201317, November 2007.</ref> has argued, on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s concept of '''''[[Falsificationism]]''''',<ref name=\"[19]\">K. Popper, ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' (translation of Logik der Forschung), Hutchinson, London, 1959.</ref><ref name=\"[30]\" /> that using a type-1 fuzzy set as a model for a word is scientifically incorrect. An interval type-2 fuzzy set should be used as a (first-order uncertainty) model for a word. Much research is under way about CWW.\n\n== Applications ==\nType-2 fuzzy sets were applied in image processing, video processing and computer vision, as well as [[Failure mode and effects analysis|Failure Mode And Effect Analysis.]]<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Chai K.C.|author2=Tay K.

{"title_page": "Telephone numbers in Oceania", "text_new": "==Australia==\n{{Main|Telephone numbers in Australia}}\n\n'''[[List of country calling codes|Country Code]]: +61'''<br />\n'''[[List of international call prefixes|International Call Prefix]]: 0011'''<br />\n'''[[Trunk prefix|Trunk Prefix]]''': 0\n\nTelephone numbers in Australia consist of a single-digit area code (prefixed with a '0' when dialing within Australia) and eight-digit local numbers, the first four, five or six of which specify the exchange, and the remaining four, three or two a line at that exchange. (Most exchanges though have several exchange codes.) Within Australia, the area code is only required to call from one area code to another.\n\nAustralia is divided geographically into a small number of large area codes, some of which cover more than one state and territory. Prior to the introduction of eight-digit numbers in the early-to-mid-1990s, telephone numbers were seven digits in the major capital cities, with a double - digit area code, and six digits in other areas with a three - digit area code. There were more than sixty such codes by 1990, with numbers running out, thus spurring the reorganization.\n\nFollowing reorganization of the numbering plan between 1994<ref>Austel: Australia's Telephone Number Plan p. 14\n</ref> and 1998, the following numbering ranges are now used:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''1'''||Domestic number nationwide, e.g. [[Australian telephone numbering plan#Freecall.2C local and premium-rate numbers|1800]], [[Australian telephone numbering plan#Freecall.2C local and premium-rate numbers|1900]], [[Australian telephone numbering plan#Freecall.2C local and premium-rate numbers|1300]], data services\n|-\n|'''02'''||[[New South Wales]] and [[Australian Capital Territory]]\n|-\n|'''03'''||[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]]\n|-\n|'''04'''||[[Mobile phone]] services (National numbers)\n|-\n|'''05'''||New [[mobile phone]] services (National numbers)<ref name='05-numbers'>{{cite news |title=Australia to assign \u201805\u2019 mobile numbers to prevent run out\n|publisher=[[Computerworld]]|date=18 July 2012|url=https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/430957/australia_assign_05_mobile_numbers_prevent_run/|accessdate=2018-12-12}}</ref>\n|-\n|'''07'''||[[Queensland]]\n|-\n|'''08'''||[[Northern Territory]], [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] ''(including [[Christmas Island]] and [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]])''.\n|}\n\nNational numbers have no geographic significance. Other numbers relate to a particular telephone service area.\n\nHowever, allowances are made for regional variations; sometimes the codes do not strictly follow state borders. For example, [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]] uses the '''08''' area code, due to its closer proximity to [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]] than the state capital [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], and [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] area's inclusion in the [[Time in Australia|Australian Central Standard Time]] zone. The previous area code for [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] was (080). Other examples include towns in Southern [[New South Wales]] close to the border with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] that use the '''03''' (Victoria and Tasmania) prefix, including: [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]], [[Wentworth, New South Wales|Wentworth]] and [[Deniliquin, New South Wales|Deniliquin]]).

(Most exchanges though have several exchange codes.) Within Australia, the area code is only required to call from one area code to another.\n\nAustralia is divided geographically into a small number of large area codes, some of which cover more than one state and territory. Prior to the introduction of eight-digit numbers in the early-to-mid-1990's, telephone numbers were seven digits in the major capital cities, with a double - digit area code, and six digits in other areas with a three - digit area code. There were more than sixty such codes by 1990, with numbers running out, thus spurring the reorganization.\n\nFollowing reorganization of the numbering plan between 1994<ref>Austel: Australia's Telephone Number Plan p. 14\n</ref> and 1998, the following numbering ranges are now used:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''1'''||Domestic number nationwide, e.g. [[Australian telephone numbering plan#Freecall.2C local and premium-rate numbers|1800]], [[Australian telephone numbering plan#Freecall.2C local and premium-rate numbers|1900]], [[Australian telephone numbering plan#Freecall.2C local and premium-rate numbers|1300]], data services\n|-\n|'''02'''||[[New South Wales]] and [[Australian Capital Territory]]\n|-\n|'''03'''||[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]]\n|-\n|'''04'''||[[Mobile phone]] services (National numbers)\n|-\n|'''05'''||New [[mobile phone]] services (National numbers)<ref name='05-numbers'>{{cite news |title=Australia to assign \u201805\u2019 mobile numbers to prevent run out\n|publisher=[[Computerworld]]|date=18 July 2012|url=https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/430957/australia_assign_05_mobile_numbers_prevent_run/|accessdate=2018-12-12}}</ref>\n|-\n|'''07'''||[[Queensland]]\n|-\n|'''08'''||[[Northern Territory]], [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] ''(including [[Christmas Island]] and [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]])''.\n|}\n\nNational numbers have no geographic significance. Other numbers relate to a particular telephone service area.\n\nHowever, allowances are made for regional variations; sometimes the codes do not strictly follow state borders. For example, [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]] uses the '''08''' area code, due to its closer proximity to [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]] than the state capital [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], and [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] area's inclusion in the [[Time in Australia|Australian Central Standard Time]] zone. The previous area code for [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] was (080). Other examples include towns in Southern [[New South Wales]] close to the border with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] that use the '''03''' (Victoria and Tasmania) prefix, including: [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]], [[Wentworth, New South Wales|Wentworth]] and [[Deniliquin, New South Wales|Deniliquin]]). Some parts of the Tweed Coast of New South Wales have an area code of 07 followed by a subscriber number of 55xx xxxx (and new numbers 56xx xxxx). This means it is the cost of a local call to phone the Gold Coast in neighbouring Queensland, since the metropolis covers both sides of the NSW/Qld border.

They established the Corsicana Female Literary Institute, a school which operated from 1857 through 1870. The first public library in Corsicana opened in 1901 by effort of the women's clubs of the city. A 1905 library matching gift by [[Andrew Carnegie]] gave the library a permanent home and its first full-time, professionally trained librarian. The library today is housed in a dedicated building downtown and boasts more than 52,283 books, 6,306 audio materials, 783 video materials, and 122 serial subscriptions.<ref>[http://www.ci.corsicana.tx.us/departments/economic/facts.php City of Corsicana<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Corsicana Jewish community dates from 1871; they established the 1898 [[Moorish Revival]] [[Temple Beth-El, Corsicana]].

The community was set apart from the town as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] in 1848. Corning was incorporated as a city in 1890. As the [[glass]] industry developed, Corning became known as the \"Crystal City\" which was supported by companies such as Hawkes, Sinclair, and Hunt - which produced some of the finest American Brilliant Period cut glass between 1880\u20131915.\n\nThe Corning area's first real industry was [[lumber]]. The first settlers used the area's river systems to transport logs and finished lumber in fleets downstream to buyers. This gave rise to large mills which helped to develop the area. Rafting of lumber began to wane as timber was depleted. At one time the mills of the Corning area were reputed to be among the biggest in the world. After the lumber was depleted the great mills moved north to new forests.\n\nEast, across the [[Chemung River]] from Corning, lies [[Gibson, New York|Gibson]], the site of a feeder canal for the [[Chemung Canal]] system. Some of Corning's early prosperity came from the feeder canal system exposure. Canal cargoes from Corning included [[soft coal]], [[timber]], [[tobacco]], [[grain]], and [[whiskey]]. From April 22 to December 11, 1850, the canal season that year, the newspaper reported that 1,116 boats left the port of Corning. Tolls for the year totaled $54,060.39. Among items shipped were 46,572,400 pounds of coal. The canal's best peacetime year was 1854 when 270,978 tons of freight were hauled. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] brought an abnormal amount of business, with a peak of 307,151 tons hauled in one year.<ref>[http://www.corningny.com/history4.shtml Corning, New York - The Crystal City - CorningNY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918130109/http://www.corningny.com/history4.shtml |date=2007-09-18 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, an industrial boom occurred in the region. [[Ingersoll Rand]] opened during this period in [[Painted Post, New York|Painted Post]], just north of Corning.\n\nCorning became a [[railroad town]] in the 1880s, many smaller railroad lines busily weaving webs of tracks connecting the major trunk line to smaller communities. In 1912, the [[Corning train wreck]] three miles east of Corning in Gibson left 39 dead.\n\nThe [[Jenning's Tavern]], [[Corning Armory]], [[Market Street Historic District (Corning, New York)|Market Street Historic District]], [[Southside Historic District (Corning, New York)|Southside Historic District]], [[World War Memorial Library]], and [[United States Post Office (Corning, New York)|United States Post Office]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n\n===The flood of 1972===\nThe flood of 1972 was a major event for the area. On June 22, 1972, the storm that had been [[Hurricane Agnes]] struck the [[Southern Tier]] of New York. The storm combined with a storm system from [[Ohio]] to drop six to eight inches (203&nbsp;mm)  of rain in the [[Chemung River]] basin. This ultimately overwhelmed the flood control systems of the time, and the Chemung River broke through the dam system on Friday, June 23 at 4:00&nbsp;a.m. By 9:00&nbsp;a.m. the river crested and began to recede. In the Corning area, eighteen people were killed and untold millions of dollars of damage was incurred. An example of these expenses took place in the town of Bath, NY, where a local woman, Lila Marano cooked nearly 100 pizzas out of her home kitchen to accommodate students at the Haverling High School graduation reception at the local Maarit Assembly Hall. The river receded within hours, leaving mud which can still be found in basements of homes and businesses in Corning, and there is a section of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] that indicates on the wall how high the flood waters rose.\n\n[[File:Corning Clock Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Corning Clock Tower at Market and Pine Streets in downtown Corning.]]\n\n== Geography ==\nJust upstream from Corning, the [[Cohocton River]] and the [[Tioga River (Chemung River)|Tioga River]] merge to form the [[Chemung River]] which flows through downtown.<ref>''Corning, NY,'' 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1953</ref> The river was an important source of [[water power|power]] in the early history, and is part of the attractiveness of the region today.\n\nThe river is prone to floods, as rain water runs off quickly from the steep hillsides of the area. In 1972 the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] dropped fifteen or more inches of rain in the area within a short time causing extensive flooding. Eighteen people were killed in the immediate Corning-Painted Post area. The entire downtown area was flooded, with severe damage.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Flooding is now controlled by a system of dams upstream from Corning.\n\n[[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] (the [[Southern Tier Expressway]]), [[New York State Route 17]], [[New York State Route 352]], [[New York State Route 414]], and [[New York State Route 415]] are major highways connecting in Corning.

The community was set apart from the town as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] in 1848. Corning was incorporated as a city in 1890. As the [[glass]] industry developed, Corning became known as the \"Crystal City\" which was supported by companies such as Hawkes, Sinclair, and Hunt - which produced some of the finest American Brilliant Period cut glass between 1880-1915.\n\nThe Corning area's first real industry was [[lumber]]. The first settlers used the area's river systems to transport logs and finished lumber in fleets downstream to buyers. This gave rise to large mills which helped to develop the area. Rafting of lumber began to wane as timber was depleted. At one time the mills of the Corning area were reputed to be among the biggest in the world. After the lumber was depleted the great mills moved north to new forests.\n\nEast, across the [[Chemung River]] from Corning, lies [[Gibson, New York|Gibson]], the site of a feeder canal for the [[Chemung Canal]] system. Some of Corning's early prosperity came from the feeder canal system exposure. Canal cargoes from Corning included [[soft coal]], [[timber]], [[tobacco]], [[grain]], and [[whiskey]]. From April 22 to December 11, 1850, the canal season that year, the newspaper reported that 1,116 boats left the port of Corning. Tolls for the year totaled $54,060.39. Among items shipped were 46,572,400 pounds of coal. The canal's best peacetime year was 1854 when 270,978 tons of freight were hauled. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] brought an abnormal amount of business, with a peak of 307,151 tons hauled in one year.<ref>[http://www.corningny.com/history4.shtml Corning, New York - The Crystal City - CorningNY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918130109/http://www.corningny.com/history4.shtml |date=2007-09-18 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, an industrial boom occurred in the region. [[Ingersoll Rand]] opened during this period in [[Painted Post, New York|Painted Post]], just north of Corning.\n\nCorning became a [[railroad town]] in the 1880s, many smaller railroad lines busily weaving webs of tracks connecting the major trunk line to smaller communities. In 1912, the [[Corning train wreck]] three miles east of Corning in Gibson left 39 dead.\n\nThe [[Jenning's Tavern]], [[Corning Armory]], [[Market Street Historic District (Corning, New York)|Market Street Historic District]], [[Southside Historic District (Corning, New York)|Southside Historic District]], [[World War Memorial Library]], and [[United States Post Office (Corning, New York)|United States Post Office]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n\n===The flood of 1972===\nThe flood of 1972 was a major event for the area. On June 22, 1972, the storm that had been [[Hurricane Agnes]] struck the [[Southern Tier]] of New York. The storm combined with a storm system from [[Ohio]] to drop six to eight inches (203&nbsp;mm)  of rain in the [[Chemung River]] basin. This ultimately overwhelmed the flood control systems of the time, and the Chemung River broke through the dam system on Friday, June 23 at 4:00&nbsp;a.m. By 9:00&nbsp;a.m. the river crested and began to recede. In the Corning area, eighteen people were killed and untold millions of dollars of damage was incurred. An example of these expenses took place in the town of Bath, NY, where a local woman, Lila Marano cooked nearly 100 pizzas out of her home kitchen to accommodate students at the Haverling High School graduation reception at the local Maarit Assembly Hall. The river receded within hours, leaving mud which can still be found in basements of homes and businesses in Corning, and there is a section of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] that indicates on the wall how high the flood waters rose.\n\n[[File:Corning Clock Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Corning Clock Tower at Market and Pine Streets in downtown Corning.]]\n\n== Geography ==\nJust upstream from Corning, the [[Cohocton River]] and the [[Tioga River (Chemung River)|Tioga River]] merge to form the [[Chemung River]] which flows through downtown.<ref>''Corning, NY,'' 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1953</ref> The river was an important source of [[water power|power]] in the early history, and is part of the attractiveness of the region today.\n\nThe river is prone to floods, as rain water runs off quickly from the steep hillsides of the area. In 1972 the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] dropped fifteen or more inches of rain in the area within a short time causing extensive flooding. Eighteen people were killed in the immediate Corning-Painted Post area. The entire downtown area was flooded, with severe damage.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Flooding is now controlled by a system of dams upstream from Corning.\n\n[[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] (the [[Southern Tier Expressway]]), [[New York State Route 17]], [[New York State Route 352]], [[New York State Route 414]], and [[New York State Route 415]] are major highways connecting in Corning.
