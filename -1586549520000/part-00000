She played the majority of basketball career in the [[Women's National Basketball League]] (WNBL) in Australia, the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA) in the United States, and the [[Basket Liga Kobiet|Polska Liga Koszyk\u00f3wki Kobiet]] (PLKK) in Poland, winning championships in all three leagues. Phillips also represented Australia on the [[Australia women's national basketball team|women's national basketball team]], winning a gold medal at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship for Women]]. With the launch of the [[AFL Women's|Australian Football League Women]]'s (AFLW) competition in 2017, Phillips began her football career and quickly emerged as the league's best player and one of its biggest stars, winning two premierships and two best and fairest awards in her first three seasons.\n\nPhillips's father [[Greg Phillips|Greg]] played professional Australian rules football for {{AFL Por}}, where he won eight premierships and is a member of the club's Hall of Fame. Phillips only played Australian rules football up until age 13 before switching to basketball because of the lack of professional opportunities for women's footballers at the time. She made her debut in the WNBL for the [[Adelaide Lightning]], her hometown team, at the age of 17 and was named the All-WNBL Team three times by the age of 22, finally winning a WNBL championship in 2008 in her last year with the team. Phillips was drafted into the WNBA in 2005 by the [[Connecticut Sun]]. With the [[Indiana Fever]], she established herself as a starter and won her first WNBA title in 2012. She won another WNBA title two years later with the [[Phoenix Mercury]]. Following her retirement from the WNBA, she was also an assistant coach for the [[Dallas Wings]], the last team she played for in the league.\n\n==Early life and background==\nErin Phillips was born on 19 May 1985 in the [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]] suburb of [[Melbourne]] to Julie and [[Greg Phillips]].<ref name=book>{{cite book |last1=Hayes |first1=Nicole | last2 = Sometimes | first2 = Alicia |title=A Footy Girls Guide to the Stars of 2017 |date=2017 |publisher=Black Inc. |isbn=9781925435535 |page=Erin Phillips}}</ref><ref name=\"voice\">{{cite web |last1=Phillips |first1=Erin |title=It\u2019s time to draw the curtain |url=https://www.athletesvoice.com.au/erin-phillips-time-to-draw-the-curtain/ |publisher=Athlete's Voice |accessdate=21 March 2020 | date= 16 January 2018}}</ref> She grew up with her two older sisters Rachel and Amy in [[Adelaide]].<ref name=\"greg-story\">{{cite news |title=Fathers say: Before my child was a star |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/fathers-say-before-my-child-was-a-star-20180901-p5016h.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=21 March 2020 | date = 1 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"wnba-qa\">{{cite web |title=Get to Know Erin Phillips |url=https://sparks.wnba.com/news/get-to-know-erin-phillips/ |publisher=Los Angeles Sparks |accessdate=21 March 2020 | date = 13 May 2015}}</ref> Her father was a professional [[Australian rules football]] defender who played the majority of his career with the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] in the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL), where he served as captain for three years, won eight premierships, and was named to the club's [[Port Adelaide Football Club#Greatest Team|Greatest Team]] in 2000.

She excels at being able to read plays in order to capitalize on opportunities, such as creating set shots for her teammates off of free kicks. Phillips is capable of kicking goals in a variety of ways. She can kick from long distances such as her 60-metre AFLW Goal of the Year in 2017, or from sharp angles in the pocket. Although Phillips isn't one of the bigger players in the competition, she is tough and physical, skills that are useful for taking marks either in the air or after bodying off defenders to establish positioning. She is not considered one of the faster players in the league due to being one of the older players in the competition.<ref name=thirteen/><ref name=gamechanger/>\n\n===AFLW statistics===\n:''Statistics are correct to the end of the 2020 season.''<ref>{{cite web|title=Erin Phillips|url=http://australianfootball.com/players/playerseason/erin%2Bphillips/19877|work=Australian Football|accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Australian rules football statistics legend}}\n{{Australian rules football statistics FSPW}}\n{{AFLW player statistics start}}\n|- style=\"background:#EAEAEA\"\n| scope=\"row\" text-align:center bgcolor=\"F0E68C\" | '''[[2017 AFL Women's season|2017]]'''\n| {{AFLW Ade}}\n| 13 || 8 || 10 || 8 || bgcolor=\"FFBBFF\" | '''124''' || 36 || bgcolor=\"FFBBFF\" | '''160''' || 23 || 30 || 1.3 || 1.0 || bgcolor=\"FFBBFF\" | '''15.5''' || 4.5 || 20.0 || 2.9 || 3.8 || bgcolor=\"98FB98\" | '''14'''\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" text-align:center | [[2018 AFL Women's season|2018]]\n| {{AFLW Ade}}\n| 13 || 5 || 7 || 3 || 46 || 14 || 60 || 8 || 11 || 1.4 || 0.6 || 9.2 || 2.8 || 12.0 || 1.6 || 2.2 || 3\n|- style=\"background:#EAEAEA\"\n| scope=\"row\" text-align:center bgcolor=\"F0E68C\" | '''[[2019 AFL Women's season|2019]]'''\n| {{AFLW Ade}}\n| 13 || 9 || 11 || bgcolor=\"FA8072\" | '''11''' || 129 || 64 || 193 || 31 || 29 || 1.2 || bgcolor=\"FA8072\" | '''1.2''' || 14.3 || 7.1 || 21.4 || 3.4 || 3.6 || bgcolor=\"98FB98\" | '''19'''\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" text-align:center | [[2020 AFL Women's season|2020]]\n| {{AFLW Ade}}\n| 13 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 21 || 5 || 26 || 4 || 5 || 0.0 || 0.5 || 10.5 || 2.5 || 13.0 || 2.0 || 2.5 || TBD\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3 | Career\n! 24\n! 28\n! 23\n! 320\n! 119\n! 439\n! 66\n! 75\n! 1.2\n! 1.0\n! 13.3\n! 5.0\n! 18.3\n! 2.8\n! 3.1\n! 36\n|}\n\n==Personal life==\nPhillips is married to American former basketball player [[Tracy Gahan]].

Phillips also represented Australia on the [[Australia women's national basketball team|women's national basketball team]], winning a gold medal at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship for Women]]. With the launch of the [[AFL Women's|Australian Football League Women]]'s (AFLW) competition in 2017, Phillips began her football career and quickly emerged as the league's best player and one of its biggest stars, winning two premierships and two best and fairest awards in her first three seasons.\n\nPhillips's father [[Greg Phillips|Greg]] played professional Australian rules football for {{AFL Por}}, where he won eight premierships and is a member of the club's Hall of Fame. Phillips only played Australian rules football up until age 13 before switching to basketball because of the lack of professional opportunities for women's footballers at the time. She made her debut in the WNBL for the [[Adelaide Lightning]], her hometown team, at the age of 17 and was named the All-WNBL Team three times by the age of 22, finally winning a WNBL championship in 2008 in her last year with the team. Phillips was drafted into the WNBA in 2005 by the [[Connecticut Sun]]. With the [[Indiana Fever]], she established herself as a starter and won her first WNBA title in 2012.

Phillips is capable of kicking goals in a variety of ways. She can kick from long distances such as her 60-metre AFLW Goal of the Year in 2017, or from sharp angles in the pocket. Although Phillips isn't one of the bigger players in the competition, she is tough and physical, skills that are useful for taking marks either in the air or after bodying off defenders to establish positioning.

In an interview Jean Paul stated, ''\"''Basically we were in a previous group growing up and never thought to copyright the name because when you're a young local garage band, you don't have the money and don't think it really matters. Well after we signed our first record deal, it kind of did matter.

They came up with the name Cash Cash due to legal issues that arose from not trademarking their previous name 'The Consequence'. In an interview Jean Paul stated, ''\"''Basically we were in a previous group growing up and never thought to copyright the name because when you're a young local garage band, you don't have the money and don't think it really matters. Well after we signed our first record deal, it kind of did matter. We got hit with a ton of legal notices about it from the person who owned the name, and had this old agent trying to screw us over, so when putting the new group together out of frustration, I was like, we should just name this group 'Cash Cash' because every one is after our cash, and we don't have any yet.''\"''<ref name=\"emptylighthouse1\"/><ref>{{cite web |author=Patrick Cason |url=http://goodmusicallday.com/music/cash-cash-brings-lightning-to-edcny-festival-review-interview/ |title=Cash Cash Brings 'Lightning' To EDCNY!
