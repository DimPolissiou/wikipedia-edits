It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]), and extends to the south and west.\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. Modern settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] Peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

County, Washington|Snohomish County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]), and extends to the south and west.\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. Modern settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] Peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

Being descendant of performers-artistes, born and raised in [[Hanoi]], Quoc Trung is considered a late-boomer musically, his musical sensibility only became apparent in his early teens, which is uncommon for a child of similar upbringing.\n\n==Academic Study==\nHis parents wanted Quoc Trung to follow the path of classical music. Despite his father's intent, young Quoc Trung rather played with his friends, and had only begun to seriously study classical piano at age 12. Quoc Trung progressed quickly with high marks. Unlike his father, a reputable tenor in classical and semi-classical, young Quoc Trung revealed an affinity for Pop music and sound-arrangement.  He opted to pursuit his passion and graduated from the Faculty of Composition at the Hanoi Conservatory of Music.  Quoc Trung was then sent for 2 years to National Music Academy of [[Sofia]] in [[Bulgaria]] for advanced learning. The National Music Academy of Sofia was unique and renowned musical institution of the Pop genre, in the then communist/socialist countries.\n\n==Personal and Love life==\nQuoc Trung and his wife Thanh Lam knew each other since childhood. When they fell in love they became the inspirational driving force behind each other's rising,  fame and success. Upon returning to Ha Noi, Vietnam in 1991, Quoc Trung founded a music band with like-minded musicians called The Orient. Within two years of its creation, The Orient reached the top spot in the National Music Band Festival. Through Quoc Trung's leadership he transformed the band into the most popular band in North Vietnam. For over a decade, Quoc Trung and his bandmates produced and propelled singer Thanh Lam to stardom and Queen of Pop status, being the first Vietnamese female singer with own band. As the Diva\u2019s singing performances and career gradually won over public's adulation, so grew the popularity of Quoc Trung and The Orient band from the North Vietnam to South Vietnam over the years.\n\nUnlike their art and collaboration in work that continues until today, the couple separated in 2004, after ten years. Both parted their own ways to collaborate with different entourage and artists. Ex-wife Thanh Lam bears two children s, a boy and a girl 17 and 19 as of 2015. Quoc Trung went on to build a major recording studio, produced most of Vietnam\u2019s biggest singing stars for more than 20 years.\n\nQuoc Trung remained single father for several years after the separation with his first-wife Thanh Lam. He finally found another half and is currently happy in a relationship with a women who can make his heart sings again.\n\n==Influences and Styles==\nThe distinct impression about Quoc Trung is that he possesses the ability to fuse and fine-tuning traditional Vietnamese sounds with modern electronic influences without losing his original pop and folklore identity. Quoc Trung incorporates many Vietnamese traditional strings instruments (Dan Bau, Dan Tranh, Dan Co, etc.), which he blends with digital mixers, samplers, and current Western instruments to create new revitalized tunes. As Quoc Trung gained more experience and exposure over the years in his musical journey, his style evolved and transitioned to what are now considered world/electronic/experimental/ambient/lounge all the while preserving his strong ties to the Vietnamese traditional instruments and sounds.\n\nQuoc Trung has said to be influenced by [[Phil Colins]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Moby]], [[Massive Attack]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Richard Bona]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Air (French band)]] etc.\n\n==Achievements==\nThroughout his lifetime Quoc Trung has received a wide range of honours and awards. His reputation firmly established as the top producer and musical authority in Vietnam's music industry. His opinions are flag-bearers and are well respected by the public, professional musicians, artists and producers. In 2012, Quoc Trung was very vocal about the digital intellectual property copyright issue and the distribution of music on Internet websites, who freely broadcast tracks from new Albums with no regards to the artists and their copyrights in Vietnam. He admitted that this is a worldwide problem for the entertainment industry and not unique to Vietnam. His contestation proved to bring results as the Vietnam government starts to clench, regulate and apply profit sharing barometers between these online websites and recording artists.\n\nBeside working as a producer, arranger, music director for shows and festivals, Quoc Trung has also ventured in to the cinema and TV, composed soundtrack commercials, most notably for the [[Sony]] brand. He has written music for a number of Asian feature films. His music was even played in the official ads for [[Vietnam Airlines]].\n\n==Collaborators==\n[[Thanh Lam]], [[Duong Thu]], [[Niels Lan Doky]], [[Nguyen Le]], Martin Hedin, [[Dhafer Youssef]], Rhani Krija, Hong Nhung, [[Stephan Eicher]], [[T\u00f9ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng]], [[Xavier Desandre Navarre]], Bui Huy Tuan, Manu Katche, Truong Anh Quan,\nBent Bitte Iversen, [[My Linh]], [[Tran Thu Ha]], [[Uyen Linh]] and others.\n\n==Discography==\nThe Roots (2012) - V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n (2011) - Wishing Upon the Moon (2011) - Nh\u01b0 c\u00e1nh v\u1ea1c bay (2006) - Road to Infinity (2005) - Khu v\u01b0\u1eddn y\u00ean t\u0129nh (2004) - M\u1ed9t ng\u00e0y m\u1edbi (2003) and more previous works.\n\n==Conclusion==\nQuoc Trung is also known as a devoted recording studio builder.

He signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as a youth trainee in July 1999 and the following month he signed professional terms with the club. He played numerous times for the youth and [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve]] sides at United and was part of the team that won the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] in  May 2000. He had a short spell on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] in 2001 before returning to United and making his senior debut in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the [[2001\u201302 Manchester United F.C. season|2001\u201302 season]]. He was an England youth international as he progressed from the [[England national under-16 football team|under-16s]] to the [[England national under-20 football team|under-20s]] during his time at [[Old Trafford]].\n\nDavis spent three months on loan with [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in 2002 and scored three goals in 15 appearances. He was a mainstay in the reserves on his return to United; his only involvement with the first team after returning was as an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a league game against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] second group stage match against [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a|Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a]].

It also earned Ocean six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, ''Channel Orange'' featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Funk and electric music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when [[David Bowie]] revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |title=Frank Ocean records another first as Channel Orange is named album of the year |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214144802/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frank Ocean Coachella 2012 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ocean performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in August 2012.]]\n\n''Channel Orange'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 131,000 copies in its first week.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\"/> The majority of its first-week sales were digital copies from iTunes, while approximately 3,000 of the sales were physical copies.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\">{{cite journal|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 18, 2012|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/481282/zac-brown-band-frank-ocean-debut-at-nos-1-2-on-billboard-200|title=Zac Brown Band, Frank Ocean Debut at Nos. 1 & 2 on Billboard 200|journal=Billboard|accessdate=July 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfD79dDQ?url=http://m.billboard.com/v/News/ZacBrownBandFrank/?p=0&KSID=ad102a113cf37fe3c8620e8cc7ba2906&ints_viewed=1|archivedate=September 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  On January 30, ''Channel Orange'' was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

It also earned Ocean six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, ''Channel Orange'' featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Funk and electric music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when [[David Bowie]] revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |title=Frank Ocean records another first as Channel Orange is named album of the year |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214144802/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frank Ocean Coachella 2012 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ocean performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in August 2012.]]\n\n''Channel Orange'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 131,000 copies in its first week.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\"/> The majority of its first-week sales were digital copies from iTunes, while approximately 3,000 of the sales were physical copies.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\">{{cite journal|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 18, 2012|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/481282/zac-brown-band-frank-ocean-debut-at-nos-1-2-on-billboard-200|title=Zac Brown Band, Frank Ocean Debut at Nos. 1 & 2 on Billboard 200|journal=Billboard|accessdate=July 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfD79dDQ?url=http://m.billboard.com/v/News/ZacBrownBandFrank/?p=0&KSID=ad102a113cf37fe3c8620e8cc7ba2906&ints_viewed=1|archivedate=September 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  On January 30, ''Channel Orange'' was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok's invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself.\n\nDevelopment began in 1995 at Millennium Interactive in [[Cambridge]] under the working title of ''Dead Man Dan.'' The visuals are heavily influenced by Tim Burton's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]].'' Originally conceived as an arcade-style shooter for platforms such as [[Windows 95|Windows]] and the [[Sega Saturn]], Sony's purchase of SCE Cambridge Studio evolved the game into a PlayStation title. The game received mostly positive praise from critics upon release, with praise including its blend of [[Halloween]] themed visuals, but was criticised for its controls and cumbersome camera work.\n\nIt was released in Europe and North America in 1998, and in Japan in 1999. It was also re-released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in 2007. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[MediEvil 2]],'' in 2000, and a PlayStation Portable remake in 2005 titled ''[[MediEvil: Resurrection]]''. A [[PlayStation 4]] [[MediEvil (2019 video game)|remake]] was released on 25 October 2019.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:MediEvil gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|The first level]]\nThe game takes place across a variety of levels, many of which require certain objectives to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows.<ref name=IGN2 /> Many can be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks.<ref name=hell>{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Andy|title=MediEvil review and overlook|url=http://www.gamershell.com/psp/medievil/review.html|publisher=GamersHell|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence, but shields have a limited amount of strength and are therefore best used sparingly. Throughout the game, Dan can visit [[gargoyle]] heads of two varieties: green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.<ref>{{cite web|title=E3 2011: MediEvil Moves: Deadmund's Quest Off-Screen Gameplay Part 2|url=http://uk.ign.com/videos/2011/06/08/e3-2011-medievil-moves-deadmunds-quest-off-screen-gameplay-part-2|publisher=IGN|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nDan's health is determined by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end.<ref name=IGN2 /> Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has.<ref>{{cite web|title=MediEvil overview|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/medievil/ps-3950|publisher=IGN|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls which can be collected if the player has dispatched enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). Certain enemies have no soul and therefore do not count while the levels \"The Sleeping Village\" and \"The Haunted Ruins\" include NPCs with \"good souls\" that will reduce the Chalice percentage if killed. If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.<ref name=IGN2 />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the year 1286, an evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to take over the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army.<ref name=Legend /> It is told in legend that the champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led the King of Gallowmere's army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal wounds.<ref name=MediEvil>Strategy Guide, p. 6.</ref><ref name=Legend /> In reality, however, Dan was struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king choosing to cover it up and declare Dan the \"Hero of Gallowmere\".<ref name=Legend>{{cite book|title=MediEvil PlayStation Manual|date=1998|publisher=Sony|page=1|chapter=The Legend of Sir Daniel Fortesque|edition=PAL}}</ref> Zarok, meanwhile, went into hiding.<ref name=Legend /> 100 years later, Zarok reappears, casting a spell over Gallowmere to plunge it into eternal night, awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living.<ref name=MediEvil /> However, in the process, he unwittingly revives Dan, who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw which fell off and the left eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere.<ref name=MediEvil /> Having been unable to ascend to the fabled Hall of Heroes for his ignoble death, Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.<ref name=SG>Strategy Guide, pp. 8-111.</ref>\n\nAs Dan travels across Gallowmere, fighting his way through Zarok's hordes and confronting all manner of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal personal guard using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices.<ref name=SG /> After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, (who also died from being struck in the eye in the battle of Gallowmere by Dan's crossbowman and second in command, Canny Tim) Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but Dan manages to defeat him.<ref>Strategy Guide, pp. 110,111.</ref> As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse in an attempt to take Dan with him (inadvertently crushing himself in the process), Dan escapes and Zarok's magical influence over the land is thwarted, restoring the souls back to the living and putting the dead back to rest.<ref>{{cite video game| title =MediEvil | developer = SCE Cambridge Studio| publisher = Sony | date = 1998 | platform = PlayStation | version = | scene = End| level = Zarok's Lair| language = | quote = }}</ref><ref name=Outro>{{cite video game| title =MediEvil | developer = SCE Cambridge Studio| publisher = Sony | date = 1998 | platform = PlayStation | version = | scene = Outro| level = | language = | quote = }}</ref> With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber.<ref name=Outro /> If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices, Dan will ascend to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.<ref>Strategy Guide, p. 111.</ref>\n\n== Development==\nDevelopment of ''MediEvil'' begun in late 1995 at independent developer [[Millennium Interactive]] in [[Cambridge]].<ref name=BTS>{{cite web|website=[[GamesTM]]|title=Behind the scenes of MediEvil|date=2015|url=https://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/behind-the-scenes-of-medievil/|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref> Chris Sorrell, previously known for the ''[[James Pond]]'' series of games, created the original concept for ''MediEvil'' and served as the game's creative director.<ref name=development>{{cite web|last1=Dutton|first1=Fred|title=Behind the Classics: MediEvil|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/09/07/behind-the-classics-medievil/|website=PlayStation Blog|publisher=PlayStation US|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> Sorrell joined Millennium, with whom he had been working with for a while, after completing ''[[James Pond 3]].'' When asked what he wanted to do, he said he wanted to work with someone on the visual side. Jason Wilson, who would be the designer and a writer for the game, met up with Sorrell and began working on ''MediEvil.''<ref name=BTS />\n\n{{Quote box|quote=Don't care about graphics!

Looking to attract a major publishing deal, Millennium Interactive initially began working on multiple platforms including [[Windows 95|Windows]] and the [[Sega Saturn]] before giving [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony of Europe]] a working demo of the game. Impressed by the progress, Sony signed ''MediEvil'' to be an exclusive PlayStation game and commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio as Sony's second studio in the United Kingdom, after [[Psygnosis]].<ref name=development /> During the production of the demo, there was a programmer for each platform.<ref name=BTS /> Millennium was having financial difficulties and wanted to secure a publisher quickly. Sega and Microsoft were also interested in the game.<ref name=BTS />\n\nSCE Cambridge wanted the game to possess a unique lead character, thus Sorrell worked with script doctor Martin Pond whilst creating an expansive backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque. Pond came up with the idea that Sir Daniel could have been a pompous failure in life whose reincarnation was his one shot at redemption.<ref name=development /><ref name=Making>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|title=The Making Of: MediEvil|url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/medievil_retrogamer.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2015|ISSN=1742-3155|pages=60\u201363}}</ref> This idea, along with the player-character's unusual appearance, turned appealing to some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be endearing, and was considered a [[sex symbol]] in France.<ref name=Making />\n\nSony's acquisition of SCE Cambridge (which occurred within six months of Sony agreeing to publish the game<ref name=BTS />) helped ease financial strain on the project, but did not assist the studio's inexperience with making 3D games.<ref name=Making /> The takeover was also \"quite intimidating\" to Sorrell and Wilson, who had not held conferences. Sorrell stated the concept of conferences was \"totally alien\".<ref name=BTS /> He felt that the game started to feel like a major project after a few meetings.<ref name=BTS />\n\nSorrell admitted in a retrospective interview that ''MediEvil'' presented \"a mountain of challenges\", since they, as many other developers at the time, were new to 3D gaming. He also admitted that some members of the team spent long nights without sleeping in order to finish the game on time.<ref name=Making /> He described it as \"a huge learning project\" for the team.<ref name=BTS /> During development, the Cambridge team played beta versions of successful platformers such as ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' which helped them understand how they might solve some challenges in building a 3D action game for the first time.<ref name=development /><ref name=Making />\n\nSony requested that ''MediEvil'' should support the PlayStation analogue controller, which Sorrell described as a \"particularly fortuitous event\" as it allowed them to capture much more fluidity and intuitiveness within the game. New concepts such as camera and character control presented many drawbacks and required the team to try out a number of approaches before settling on solutions that seemed to work. The team finally settled on the concept that ''MediEvil'' would support both analogue and digital camera-related controls for balance reasons.<ref name=Making /> Sorrell stated that a spline camera view was the first attempt, but he disliked it due to the lack of freedom for the player to feel as if he was exploring. It was then changed to a [[Free-form (video game gameplay)|free-form]] camera view, which \"just worked\".<ref name=BTSBook /> There were also many levels and ideas from the original concept that the team were forced to remove due to time or budget constraints. There was intended to be a platform-oriented section of the game where the player would control the worm that lived in Daniel's skull. Concept art and a separate level was created for this section, but it never materialised into the game.<ref name=q&a>{{cite web|title=MediEvil developers Q&A|url=http://www.sirdanielfortesque.proboards.com/thread/775|website=MediEvil Boards|publisher=ProBoards|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nHumour drove the game forward for Sony Cambridge Studio. Jokes were reflexions on how the team operated. Sorrell explained that the humour was a \"happy accident\", and that he used it only when he thought it appropriate. Wilson said that the team were \"youthful and silly\", and they liked horror films and comedy. He thought the humour was \"a natural extension of our personalities\".<ref name=BTS />\n\n[[Paul_Darrow]] voiced the character of Zarok\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=MediEvil credits.ogg\n|title=MediEvil PlayStation game credits track\n|description=30 second music sample from the MediEvil PlayStation game's final credits sequence}}\n\nThe original soundtrack of the game was composed by [[Paul Arnold (composer)|Paul Arnold]] and [[Andrew Barnabas]], the musical duo more commonly known as \"Bob & Barn\". SCE Cambridge instructed them to compose a [[Danny Elfman]]-influenced score, similar to those of ''[[Beetlejuice]],'' ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Batman Returns (soundtrack)|Batman Returns]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsoundtracks.com/interviews/arnold.htm|title=Interview with composer Paul Arnold|author=Ittensohn, Oliver|publisher=GSoundtracks|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> The music was created using electronic synthesisers to simulate an entire orchestra and [[organ (music)|organ]].<ref name=choir />\n\nThe 2005 PlayStation Portable re-imagining ''[[MediEvil: Resurrection]]'' used parts of the ''MediEvil'' score, along with original elements composed by Bob & Barn that was performed by a live orchestra and [[choir]].<ref name=choir>{{cite web|title=Sumthing Else Music Works Announces Release Of The Original Soundtrack CD For The PSP video game MediEvil Resurrection|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/sumthing-else-music-works-announces-release-of-the-original-soundtrack-cd-for-the-psp-videogame-medievil-resurrection|website=Game Industry|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> An album was made from this music and signed copies can be purchased from the artists' website.<ref>{{cite web|title=MediEvil Resurrection Original Soundtrack Album|url=http://www.bobandbarn.com/shop/soundtrack-cd-medievil|publisher=Bob and Barn|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing and release==\nSorrell explained that, during the marketing campaign, the team were frequently asked to go to graveyards for photo-shoots. These usually went without incident, but on one occasion a vicar asked them why they were filming on church property. They lied by telling him that they were students filming a documentary on churches.<ref name=Making /> Marketing campaigns also incorporated Sony Cambridge Studio's humour.<ref name=BTSBook>{{cite

The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, [[Sir Daniel Fortesque]], as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok's invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself.\n\nDevelopment began in 1995 at Millennium Interactive in [[Cambridge]] under the working title of ''Dead Man Dan.'' The visuals are heavily influenced by Tim Burton's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]].'' Originally conceived as an arcade-style shooter for platforms such as [[Windows 95|Windows]] and the [[Sega Saturn]], Sony's purchase of SCE Cambridge Studio evolved the game into a PlayStation title. The game received mostly positive praise from critics upon release, with praise including its blend of [[Halloween]] themed visuals, but was criticised for its controls and cumbersome camera work.\n\nIt was released in Europe and North America in 1998, and in Japan in 1999. It was also re-released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in 2007. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[MediEvil 2]],'' in 2000, and a PlayStation Portable remake in 2005 titled ''[[MediEvil: Resurrection]]''. A [[PlayStation 4]] [[MediEvil (2019 video game)|remake]] was released on 25 October 2019.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:MediEvil gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|The first level]]\nThe game takes place across a variety of levels, many of which require certain objectives to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows.<ref name=IGN2 /> Many can be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks.<ref name=hell>{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Andy|title=MediEvil review and overlook|url=http://www.gamershell.com/psp/medievil/review.html|publisher=GamersHell|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence, but shields have a limited amount of strength and are therefore best used sparingly. Throughout the game, Dan can visit [[gargoyle]] heads of two varieties: green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.<ref>{{cite web|title=E3 2011: MediEvil Moves: Deadmund's Quest Off-Screen Gameplay Part 2|url=http://uk.ign.com/videos/2011/06/08/e3-2011-medievil-moves-deadmunds-quest-off-screen-gameplay-part-2|publisher=IGN|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nDan's health is determined by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end.<ref name=IGN2 /> Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has.<ref>{{cite web|title=MediEvil overview|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/medievil/ps-3950|publisher=IGN|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls which can be collected if the player has dispatched enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). Certain enemies have no soul and therefore do not count while the levels \"The Sleeping Village\" and \"The Haunted Ruins\" include NPCs with \"good souls\" that will reduce the Chalice percentage if killed. If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.<ref name=IGN2 />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the year 1286, an evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to take over the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army.<ref name=Legend /> It is told in legend that the champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led the King of Gallowmere's army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal wounds.<ref name=MediEvil>Strategy Guide, p. 6.</ref><ref name=Legend /> In reality, however, Dan was struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king choosing to cover it up and declare Dan the \"Hero of Gallowmere\".<ref name=Legend>{{cite book|title=MediEvil PlayStation Manual|date=1998|publisher=Sony|page=1|chapter=The Legend of Sir Daniel Fortesque|edition=PAL}}</ref> Zarok, meanwhile, went into hiding.<ref name=Legend /> 100 years later, Zarok reappears, casting a spell over Gallowmere to plunge it into eternal night, awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living.<ref name=MediEvil /> However, in the process, he unwittingly revives Dan, who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw which fell off and the left eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere.<ref name=MediEvil /> Having been unable to ascend to the fabled Hall of Heroes for his ignoble death, Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.<ref name=SG>Strategy Guide, pp. 8-111.</ref>\n\nAs Dan travels across Gallowmere, fighting his way through Zarok's hordes and confronting all manner of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal personal guard using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices.<ref name=SG /> After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, (who also died from being struck in the eye in the battle of Gallowmere by Dan's crossbowman and second in command, Canny Tim) Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but Dan manages to defeat him.<ref>Strategy Guide, pp. 110,111.</ref> As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse in an attempt to take Dan with him (inadvertently crushing himself in the process), Dan escapes and Zarok's magical influence over the land is thwarted, restoring the souls back to the living and putting the dead back to rest.<ref>{{cite video game| title =MediEvil | developer = SCE Cambridge Studio| publisher = Sony | date = 1998 | platform = PlayStation | version = | scene = End| level = Zarok's Lair| language = | quote = }}</ref><ref name=Outro>{{cite video game| title =MediEvil | developer = SCE Cambridge Studio| publisher = Sony | date = 1998 | platform = PlayStation | version = | scene = Outro| level = | language = | quote = }}</ref> With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber.<ref name=Outro /> If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices, Dan will ascend to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.<ref>Strategy Guide, p. 111.</ref>\n\n== Development==\nDevelopment of ''MediEvil'' begun in late 1995 at independent developer [[Millennium Interactive]] in [[Cambridge]].<ref name=BTS>{{cite web|website=[[GamesTM]]|title=Behind the scenes of MediEvil|date=2015|url=https://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/behind-the-scenes-of-medievil/|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref> Chris Sorrell, previously known for the ''[[James Pond]]'' series of games, created the original concept for ''MediEvil'' and served as the game's creative director.<ref name=development>{{cite web|last1=Dutton|first1=Fred|title=Behind the Classics: MediEvil|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/09/07/behind-the-classics-medievil/|website=PlayStation Blog|publisher=PlayStation US|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> Sorrell joined Millennium, with whom he had been working with for a while, after completing ''[[James Pond 3]].'' When asked what he wanted to do, he said he wanted to work with someone on the visual side. Jason Wilson, who would be the designer and a writer for the game, met up with Sorrell and began working on ''MediEvil.''<ref name=BTS />\n\n{{Quote box|quote=Don't care about graphics!

Looking to attract a major publishing deal, Millennium Interactive initially began working on multiple platforms including [[Windows 95|Windows]] and the [[Sega Saturn]] before giving [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony of Europe]] a working demo of the game. Impressed by the progress, Sony signed ''MediEvil'' to be an exclusive PlayStation game and commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio as Sony's second studio in the United Kingdom, after [[Psygnosis]].<ref name=development /> During the production of the demo, there was a programmer for each platform.<ref name=BTS /> Millennium was having financial difficulties and wanted to secure a publisher quickly. Sega and Microsoft were also interested in the game.<ref name=BTS />\n\nSCE Cambridge wanted the game to possess a unique lead character, thus Sorrell worked with script doctor Martin Pond whilst creating an expansive backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque. Pond came up with the idea that Sir Daniel could have been a pompous failure in life whose reincarnation was his one shot at redemption.<ref name=development /><ref name=Making>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|title=The Making Of: MediEvil|url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/medievil_retrogamer.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2015|ISSN=1742-3155|pages=60\u201363}}</ref> This idea, along with the player-character's unusual appearance, turned appealing to some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be endearing, and was considered a [[sex symbol]] in France.<ref name=Making />\n\nSony's acquisition of SCE Cambridge (which occurred within six months of Sony agreeing to publish the game<ref name=BTS />) helped ease financial strain on the project, but did not assist the studio's inexperience with making 3D games.<ref name=Making /> The takeover was also \"quite intimidating\" to Sorrell and Wilson, who had not held conferences. Sorrell stated the concept of conferences was \"totally alien\".<ref name=BTS /> He felt that the game started to feel like a major project after a few meetings.<ref name=BTS />\n\nSorrell admitted in a retrospective interview that ''MediEvil'' presented \"a mountain of challenges\", since they, as many other developers at the time, were new to 3D gaming. He also admitted that some members of the team spent long nights without sleeping in order to finish the game on time.<ref name=Making /> He described it as \"a huge learning project\" for the team.<ref name=BTS /> During development, the Cambridge team played beta versions of successful platformers such as ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' which helped them understand how they might solve some challenges in building a 3D action game for the first time.<ref name=development /><ref name=Making />\n\nSony requested that ''MediEvil'' should support the PlayStation analogue controller, which Sorrell described as a \"particularly fortuitous event\" as it allowed them to capture much more fluidity and intuitiveness within the game. New concepts such as camera and character control presented many drawbacks and required the team to try out a number of approaches before settling on solutions that seemed to work. The team finally settled on the concept that ''MediEvil'' would support both analogue and digital camera-related controls for balance reasons.<ref name=Making /> Sorrell stated that a spline camera view was the first attempt, but he disliked it due to the lack of freedom for the player to feel as if he was exploring. It was then changed to a [[Free-form (video game gameplay)|free-form]] camera view, which \"just worked\".<ref name=BTSBook /> There were also many levels and ideas from the original concept that the team were forced to remove due to time or budget constraints. There was intended to be a platform-oriented section of the game where the player would control the worm that lived in Daniel's skull. Concept art and a separate level was created for this section, but it never materialised into the game.<ref name=q&a>{{cite web|title=MediEvil developers Q&A|url=http://www.sirdanielfortesque.proboards.com/thread/775|website=MediEvil Boards|publisher=ProBoards|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nHumour drove the game forward for Sony Cambridge Studio. Jokes were reflexions on how the team operated. Sorrell explained that the humour was a \"happy accident\", and that he used it only when he thought it appropriate. Wilson said that the team were \"youthful and silly\", and they liked horror films and comedy. He thought the humour was \"a natural extension of our personalities\".<ref name=BTS />\n\n[[Paul_Darrow]] voiced the character of Zarok\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=MediEvil credits.ogg\n|title=MediEvil PlayStation game credits track\n|description=30 second music sample from the MediEvil PlayStation game's final credits sequence}}\n\nThe original soundtrack of the game was composed by [[Paul Arnold (composer)|Paul Arnold]] and [[Andrew Barnabas]], the musical duo more commonly known as \"Bob & Barn\". SCE Cambridge instructed them to compose a [[Danny Elfman]]-influenced score, similar to those of ''[[Beetlejuice]],'' ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Batman Returns (soundtrack)|Batman Returns]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsoundtracks.com/interviews/arnold.htm|title=Interview with composer Paul Arnold|author=Ittensohn, Oliver|publisher=GSoundtracks|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> The music was created using electronic synthesisers to simulate an entire orchestra and [[organ (music)|organ]].<ref name=choir />\n\nThe 2005 PlayStation Portable re-imagining ''[[MediEvil: Resurrection]]'' used parts of the ''MediEvil'' score, along with original elements composed by Bob & Barn that was performed by a live orchestra and [[choir]].<ref name=choir>{{cite web|title=Sumthing Else Music Works Announces Release Of The Original Soundtrack CD For The PSP video game MediEvil Resurrection|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/sumthing-else-music-works-announces-release-of-the-original-soundtrack-cd-for-the-psp-videogame-medievil-resurrection|website=Game Industry|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> An album was made from this music and signed copies can be purchased from the artists' website.<ref>{{cite web|title=MediEvil Resurrection Original Soundtrack Album|url=http://www.bobandbarn.com/shop/soundtrack-cd-medievil|publisher=Bob and Barn|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing and release==\nSorrell explained that, during the marketing campaign, the team were frequently asked to go to graveyards for photo-shoots.

There are five classes of municipalities in Washington: first class city, second class city, town, unclassified city, and code city.\n\n* ''First class cities'' are the 10 cities with a population over 10,000 at the time of reorganization and operating under a home rule charter.  They are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW ([[Revised Code of Washington]]).\n* ''Second class cities'' are the 9 cities with a population over 1,500 at the time of reorganization and operating without a home rule charter.  Like first class cities, they are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW. \n* ''Towns'' are the 69 municipalities with a population of under 1,500 at the time of reorganization.  Towns are not authorized to operate under a charter.  Like the previously listed cities, they are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW. In 1994, the legislature made 1,500 the minimum population required to incorporate.\n* ''Unclassified cities'' are cities that are not operating under any other class.  Only one city\u2014[[Waitsburg, Washington|Waitsburg]], in [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]]\u2014is unclassified.  It operates under the 1881 territorial charter under which it was organized, eight years before Washington was admitted to the Union in 1889.\n* ''Code cities'' were created by the state legislature in order to grant the greatest degree of local control to municipalities possible under the state constitution and general law. This classification has been adopted by 192 municipalities in Washington. Code cities (shorthand for ''optional municipal code cities'', as encoded by Title 35A RCW) are authorized to perform any function not specifically denied them in the state constitution or by state law.  They may perform any function granted to any other city classification under Title 35 RCW.\n\nA city in Washington can be described by its form of government. Cities and towns are specifically authorized three forms of government: [[City commission government|Commission]], [[Mayor-council government|Mayor-Council]], [[Council-manager government|Council-Manager]]. The last city to use the three-member ''commission'' form of government was Shelton. In a 2017 Proposition, the residents voted to adopt the council-manager structure. Most cities in Washington have the ''mayor-council'' form of government, which calls for an elected [[mayor]] and an elected city council. Cities with a ''council-manager'' system have an elected council and appointed city manager. In addition, if the population of code cites is over 10,000, they may incorporate as ''charter'' code cities. They may then \"set out any plan of government deemed 'suitable for the good government of the city'\" (RCW 35A.08.050), which need not be a commission, mayor-council, or council-manager form. No charter code city has opted for a different type of government {{as of|2012|lc=yes}}.\n\nThe largest municipality by population in Washington is [[Seattle]] with 608,660 residents, and the smallest municipality by population is [[Krupp, Washington|Krupp]] with 48 residents.<ref name=\"Census 2010\" /> The largest municipality by land area is [[Seattle]], which spans

There are five classes of municipalities in Washington: first class city, second class city, town, unclassified city, and code city.\n\n* ''First class cities'' are the 10 cities with a population over 10,000 at the time of reorganization and operating under a home rule charter.  They are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW ([[Revised Code of Washington]]).\n* ''Second class cities'' are the 9 cities with a population over 1,500 at the time of reorganization and operating without a home rule charter.  Like first class cities, they are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW. \n* ''Towns'' are the 69 municipalities with a population of under 1,500 at the time of reorganization.  Towns are not authorized to operate under a charter.  Like the previously listed cities, they are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW. In 1994, the legislature made 1,500 the minimum population required to incorporate.\n* ''Unclassified cities'' are cities that are not operating under any other class.  Only one city\u2014[[Waitsburg, Washington|Waitsburg]], in [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]]\u2014is unclassified.  It operates under the 1881 territorial charter under which it was organized, eight years before Washington was admitted to the Union in 1889.\n* ''Code cities'' were created by the state legislature in order to grant the greatest degree of local control to municipalities possible under the state constitution and general law. This classification has been adopted by 192 municipalities in Washington. Code cities (shorthand for ''optional municipal code cities'', as encoded by Title 35A RCW) are authorized to perform any function not specifically denied them in the state constitution or by state law.  They may perform any function granted to any other city classification under Title 35 RCW.\n\nA city in Washington can be described by its form of government. Cities and towns are specifically authorized three forms of government: [[City commission government|Commission]], [[Mayor-council government|Mayor-Council]], [[Council-manager government|Council-Manager]]. The last city to use the three-member ''commission'' form of government was Shelton. In a 2017 Proposition, the residents voted to adopt the council-manager structure. Most cities in Washington have the ''mayor-council'' form of government, which calls for an elected [[mayor]] and an elected city council. Cities with a ''council-manager'' system have an elected council and appointed city manager. In addition, if the population of code cites is over 10,000, they may incorporate as ''charter'' code cities. They may then \"set out any plan of government deemed 'suitable for the good government of the city'\" (RCW 35A.08.050), which need not be a commission, mayor-council, or council-manager form. No charter code city has opted for a different type of government {{as of|2012|lc=yes}}.\n\nThe largest municipality by population in Washington is [[Seattle]] with 608,660 residents, and the smallest
