In [[Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Islam]]ic, and other [[Middle Eastern]] traditions it is taken to represent a [[Indefinite and fictitious numbers|large, approximate number]], similar to \"[[umpteen]]\".\n\n===Sumerian===\n* [[Enki]] ( /\u02c8\u025b\u014bki/) or Enkil (Sumerian: dEN.KI(G)\ud808\udc97\ud808\udda0) is a god in Sumerian mythology, later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology. He was originally patron god of the city of [[Eridu]], but later the influence of his cult spread throughout [[Mesopotamia]] and to the [[Canaanites]], [[Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]]. He was the deity of crafts (ga\u0161am); mischief; water, seawater, lake water (a, aba, ab), intelligence (gest\u00fa, literally \"ear\") and creation (Nudimmud: nu, likeness, dim mud, make bear). He was associated with the southern band of constellations called stars of Ea, but also with the constellation A\u0160-IKU, the Field ([[Square of Pegasus]]). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for \"40,\" occasionally referred to as his \"sacred number.\"\n\nA large number of myths about Enki have been collected from many sites, stretching from Southern Iraq to the Levantine coast. He figures in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to Hellenistic times.\n\nThe exact meaning of his name is uncertain: the common translation is \"Lord of the Earth\": the Sumerian en is translated as a title equivalent to \"lord\"; it was originally a title given to the High Priest; ki means \"earth\"; but there are theories that ki in this name has another origin, possibly kig of unknown meaning, or kur meaning \"mound\". The name Ea is allegedly Hurrian in origin while others claim that it is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root *hyy meaning \"life\" in this case used for \"spring\", \"running water.\" In Sumerian E-A means \"the house of water\", and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the God at Eridu.\n\n===Judaism===\n* In the [[Hebrew Bible]], forty is often used for time periods, forty days or forty years, which separate \"two distinct epochs\".<ref name=\"coogan\">Michael David Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context'', Oxford, 2008, p. 116</ref>\n* Rain fell for \"forty days and forty nights\" during the Flood (Genesis 7:4).\n* Noah waited for forty days after the tops of mountains were seen after the flood, before releasing a raven (Genesis 8:5-7).\n* Spies were sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (promised to the children of Israel) for \"forty days\" (Numbers 13:2, 25).\n* The Hebrew people lived in the lands outside of the promised land for \"forty years\". This period of years represents the time it takes for a new generation to arise (Numbers 32:13).\n* Several early Hebrew leaders and kings are said to have ruled for \"forty years\", that is, a generation. Examples include Eli (1 Samuel 4:18), Saul (Acts 13:21), David (2 Samuel 5:4), and Solomon (1 Kings 11:42).\n* [[Goliath]] challenged the Israelites twice a day for forty days before [[David]] defeated him (1 Samuel 17:16).\n* [[Moses]] spent three consecutive periods of \"forty days and forty nights\" on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]:\n# He went up on the seventh day of [[Sivan]], after [[God]] gave the Torah to the Jewish people, in order to learn the Torah from God, and came down on the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz|seventeenth day of Tammuz]], when he saw the Jews worshiping the [[Golden Calf]] and broke the tablets (Deuteronomy 9:11).\n# He went up on the eighteenth day of [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] to beg forgiveness for the people's sin and came down without God's atonement on the twenty-ninth day of [[Av]] (Deuteronomy 9:25).\n# He went up on the first day of [[Elul]] and came down on the tenth day of [[Tishrei]], the first [[Yom Kippur]], with God's atonement (Deuteronomy 10:10).\n* A [[mikvah]] consists of 40 ''[[se'ah]]'' (approximately {{Convert|200|USgal|liter|lk=on|abbr=off|sp=us|disp=or}}) of water\n* The prophet [[Elijah]] had to walk 40 days and 40 nights before arriving at mount [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]] (1 Kings 19:8).\n* 40 lashes is one of the punishments meted out by the [[Sanhedrin]] ([[Deuteronomy 25:3]]), though in actual practice only 39 lashes were administered.<ref>https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06574.html</ref>\n* (Numbers 14:33\u201334) alludes to the same{{clarify|date=September 2018}} with ties to the prophecy in The Book of Daniel. \"For forty years\u2014one year for each of the forty days you explored the land\u2014you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.\"\n* One of the prerequisites for a man to study Kabbalah is that he is forty years old.\n* \"The registering of these men was carried on cruelly, zealously, assiduously, from the rising of the sun to its going down, and was not brought to an end in forty days\" (3 Maccabees 4:15).\n\n===Christianity===\nChristianity similarly uses forty to designate important time periods.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\n* Before his [[temptation of Christ|temptation]], Jesus fasted \"forty days and forty nights\" in the [[Judean desert]] (Matthew 4:2, Mark 1:13, Luke 4:2).\n* Forty days was the period from the [[resurrection of Jesus]] to the [[ascension of Jesus]] (Acts 1:3).\n* According to Stephen, Moses' life is divided into three 40-year segments, separated by his growing to adulthood, fleeing from Egypt, and his return to lead his people out (Acts 7:23,30,36).\n* In modern Christian practice, [[Lent]] consists of the 40 days preceding [[Easter]]. In much of Western Christianity, Sundays are excluded from the count; in Eastern Christianity, Sundays are included.\n* The [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]]\n* [[Kirk Kilisse]], \"Forty Churches\" (\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u0395\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2) in Eastern Thrace\n* Rain fell for \"forty days and forty nights\" during the Flood (Genesis 7:4).\n\n===Islam===\n* [[Muhammad]] was forty years old when he first received the revelation delivered by the archangel Gabriel.\n* [[Masih ad-Dajjal]] roams around the Earth in forty days, the first day length is like one year, the second day is like one month, the third day is like one week and the next day (until 40th day) is like one day.\n* God forbade the Israelites from entering the Holy Land for 40 years to separate them from Musa ([[Moses]]) and his brother.<ref>Qur'an 5:25\u201326</ref>\n* Musa ([[Moses]]) spent 40 days on Mount Sinai where he received the 10 commandments.<ref>Qur'an 7:142</ref>\n\n===Yazidism===\n* In the [[Yazidi]] faith, The Chermera Temple (meaning \"40 Men\" in the Yazidi dialect) is so old that no one remembers how it came to have that name but it is believed to derive from the burial of 40 men on the mountaintop site.\n\n===Funerary customs===\n* Some Russians and Serbs believe that [[ghost]]s of the dead linger at the site of their death for forty days. After the forty days, additional prayers are performed at the grave (parastos (\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441) or panihida (\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0434\u0430)), to escort the soul on its way to God's court.\n* Many Christian Filipinos mark the end of the initial mourning period on the fortieth day after death, and have a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] said. They believe that the soul remains on the earthly plane for forty days before entering the afterlife, recalling how Christ [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]] forty days after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].\n\n===Hinduism===\n* In [[Hinduism]], some popular religious prayers consist of forty [[shloka]]s or [[Doha (poetry)|dohas]] (couplets, stanzas). The most common being the [[Hanuman Chalisa]] (''chaalis'' is the Hindi term for 40).\n\nIn the Hindu system some of the popular fasting periods consist 40 days and is called the period One 'Mandala Kalam' Kalam means a period and Mandala Kalam means a period of 40 days. For example, the devotees (male and female) of Swami Ayyappa, the name of a Hindu god very popular in Kerala, India (Sabarimala Swami Ayyappan) strictly observed forty days fasting and visit (since female devotees of a certain biological age group wouldn't be able to perform the continuous 40-day-austerities, they wouldn't enter into the god's temple until September 2018) with their holy submittance or offerings on 41st or a convenient day after a minimum 40 days practice of fasting. The offering is called \"Kaanikka\".\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n\n* [[Anand Sahib]], the fifth and the final of the daily Sikh prayers have 40 paragraphs, and the 40th paragraph is often read when concluding any Sikh ceremony.\n* [[Chali Mukte]] (40 liberated ones) refer to the 40 soldiers in the army of  [[Guru Gobind Singh]].

In [[Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Islam]]ic, and other [[Middle Eastern]] traditions it is taken to represent a [[Indefinite and fictitious numbers|large, approximate number]], similar to \"[[umpteen]]\".\n\n===Sumerian===\n* [[Enki]] ( /\u02c8\u025b\u014bki/) or Enkil (Sumerian: dEN.KI(G)\ud808\udc97\ud808\udda0) is a god in Sumerian mythology, later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology. He was originally patron god of the city of [[Eridu]], but later the influence of his cult spread throughout [[Mesopotamia]] and to the [[Canaanites]], [[Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]]. He was the deity of crafts (ga\u0161am); mischief; water, seawater, lake water (a, aba, ab), intelligence (gest\u00fa, literally \"ear\") and creation (Nudimmud: nu, likeness, dim mud, make bear). He was associated with the southern band of constellations called stars of Ea, but also with the constellation A\u0160-IKU, the Field ([[Square of Pegasus]]). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for \"40,\" occasionally referred to as his \"sacred number.\"\n\nA large number of myths about Enki have been collected from many sites, stretching from Southern Iraq to the Levantine coast. He figures in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to Hellenistic times.\n\nThe exact meaning of his name is uncertain: the common translation is \"Lord of the Earth\": the Sumerian en is translated as a title equivalent to \"lord\"; it was originally a title given to the High Priest; ki means \"earth\"; but there are theories that ki in this name has another origin, possibly kig of unknown meaning, or kur meaning \"mound\". The name Ea is allegedly Hurrian in origin while others claim that it is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root *hyy meaning \"life\" in this case used for \"spring\", \"running water.\" In Sumerian E-A means \"the house of water\", and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the God at Eridu.\n\n===Judaism===\n* In the [[Hebrew Bible]], forty is often used for time periods, forty days or forty years, which separate \"two distinct epochs\".<ref name=\"coogan\">Michael David Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context'', Oxford, 2008, p. 116</ref>\n* Rain fell for \"forty days and forty nights\" during the Flood (Genesis 7:4).\n* Noah waited for forty days after the tops of mountains were seen after the flood, before releasing a raven (Genesis 8:5-7).\n* Spies were sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (promised to the children of Israel) for \"forty days\" (Numbers 13:2, 25).\n* The Hebrew people lived in the lands outside of the promised land for \"forty years\". This period of years represents the time it takes for a new generation to arise (Numbers 32:13).\n* Several early Hebrew leaders and kings are said to have ruled for \"forty years\", that is, a generation. Examples include Eli (1 Samuel 4:18), Saul (Acts 13:21), David (2 Samuel 5:4), and Solomon (1 Kings 11:42).\n* [[Goliath]] challenged the Israelites twice a day for forty days before [[David]] defeated him (1 Samuel 17:16).\n* [[Moses]] spent three consecutive periods of \"forty days and forty nights\" on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]:\n# He went up on the seventh day of [[Sivan]], after [[God]] gave the Torah to the Jewish people, in order to learn the Torah from God, and came down on the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz|seventeenth day of Tammuz]], when he saw the Jews worshiping the [[Golden Calf]] and broke the tablets (Deuteronomy 9:11).\n# He went up on the eighteenth day of [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] to beg forgiveness for the people's sin and came down without God's atonement on the twenty-ninth day of [[Av]] (Deuteronomy 9:25).\n# He went up on the first day of [[Elul]] and came down on the tenth day of [[Tishrei]], the first [[Yom Kippur]], with God's atonement (Deuteronomy 10:10).\n* A [[mikvah]] consists of 40 ''[[se'ah]]'' (approximately {{Convert|200|USgal|liter|lk=on|abbr=off|sp=us|disp=or}}) of water\n* The prophet [[Elijah]] had to walk 40 days and 40 nights before arriving at mount [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]] (1 Kings 19:8).\n* 40 lashes is one of the punishments meted out by the [[Sanhedrin]] ([[Deuteronomy 25:3]]), though in actual practice only 39 lashes were administered.<ref>https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06574.html</ref>\n* (Numbers 14:33\u201334) alludes to the same{{clarify|date=September 2018}} with ties to the prophecy in The Book of Daniel. \"For forty years\u2014one year for each of the forty days you explored the land\u2014you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.\"\n* One of the prerequisites for a man to study Kabbalah is that he is forty years old.\n* \"The registering of these men was carried on cruelly, zealously, assiduously, from the rising of the sun to its going down, and was not brought to an end in forty days\" (3 Maccabees 4:15).\n\n===Christianity===\nChristianity similarly uses forty to designate important time periods.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\n* Before his [[temptation of Christ|temptation]], Jesus fasted \"forty days and forty nights\" in the [[Judean desert]] (Matthew 4:2, Mark 1:13, Luke 4:2).\n* Forty days was the period from the [[resurrection of Jesus]] to the [[ascension of Jesus]] (Acts 1:3).\n* According to Stephen, Moses' life is divided into three 40-year segments, separated by his growing to adulthood, fleeing from Egypt, and his return to lead his people out (Acts 7:23,30,36).\n* In modern Christian practice, [[Lent]] consists of the 40 days preceding [[Easter]]. In much of Western Christianity, Sundays are excluded from the count; in Eastern Christianity, Sundays are included.\n* The [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]]\n* [[Kirk Kilisse]], \"Forty Churches\" (\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u0395\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2) in Eastern Thrace\n* Rain fell for \"forty days and forty nights\" during the Flood (Genesis 7:4).\n\n===Islam===\n* [[Muhammad]] was forty years old when he first received the revelation delivered by the archangel Gabriel.\n* [[Masih ad-Dajjal]] roams around the Earth in forty days, the first day length is like one year, the second day is like one month, the third day is like one week and the next day (until 40th day) is like one day.\n* God forbade the Israelites from entering the Holy Land for 40 years to separate them from Musa ([[Moses]]) and his brother.<ref>Qur'an 5:25\u201326</ref>\n* Musa ([[Moses]]) spent 40 days on Mount Sinai where he received the 10 commandments.<ref>Qur'an 7:142</ref>\n\n===Yazidism===\n* In the [[Yazidi]] faith, The Chermera Temple (meaning \"40 Men\" in the Yazidi dialect) is so old that no one remembers how it came to have that name but it is believed to derive from the burial of 40 men on the mountaintop site.\n\n===Funerary customs===\n* Some Russians and Serbs believe that [[ghost]]s of the dead linger at the site of their death for forty days. After the forty days, additional prayers are performed at the grave (parastos (\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441) or panihida (\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0434\u0430)), to escort the soul on its way to God's court.\n* Many Christian Filipinos mark the end of the initial mourning period on the fortieth day after death, and have a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] said. They believe that the soul remains on the earthly plane for forty days before entering the afterlife, recalling how Christ [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]] forty days after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].\n\n===Hinduism===\n* In [[Hinduism]], some popular religious prayers consist of forty [[shloka]]s or [[Doha (poetry)|dohas]] (couplets, stanzas). The most common being the [[Hanuman Chalisa]] (''chaalis'' is the Hindi term for 40).\n\nIn the Hindu system some of the popular fasting periods consist 40 days and is called the period One 'Mandala Kalam' Kalam means a period and Mandala Kalam means a period of 40 days. For example, the devotees (male and female) of Swami Ayyappa, the name of a Hindu god very popular in Kerala, India (Sabarimala Swami Ayyappan) strictly observed forty days fasting and visit (since female devotees of a certain biological age group wouldn't be able to perform the continuous 40-day-austerities, they wouldn't enter into the god's temple until September 2018) with their holy submittance or offerings on 41st or a convenient day after a minimum 40 days practice of fasting. The offering is called \"Kaanikka\".\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n\n* [[Anand Sahib]], the fifth and the final of the daily Sikh prayers have 40 paragraphs, and the 40th paragraph is often read when concluding any Sikh ceremony.\n* [[Chali Mukte]] (40 liberated ones) refer to the 40 soldiers in the army of  [[Guru Gobind Singh]].

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation, while the gameplay systems remained largely similar to previous entries, with the addition of new elements such as Materia, [[Limit Breaks]] and new [[minigames]]. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success. It remains widely regarded as a landmark title, and as one of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards, and was acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[console role-playing games]] worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an ongoing [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition episodic remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a fixed-width font and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation, while the gameplay systems remained largely similar to previous entries, with the addition of new elements such as Materia, [[Limit Breaks]] and new [[minigames]]. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success. It remains widely regarded as a landmark title, and as one of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards, and was acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[console role-playing games]] worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an ongoing [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition episodic remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, so he redesigned Cloud to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Uematsu then decided that the higher quality audio was not worth the trade-off with performance, and opted instead to use [[MIDI]]-like sounds produced by the console's internal [[sound chip|sound sequencer]], similar to how his soundtracks for the previous games in the series on the [[Super NES]] were implemented.<ref name=\"Hist of FF7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/01/ign-presents-the-history-of-final-fantasy-vii |title=IGN Presents: The History of Final Fantasy VII |page=1 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=News Corporation |first=Rus |last=McLaughlin |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=January 11, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128130134/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/01/ign-presents-the-history-of-final-fantasy-vii |archivedate=January 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"RPGFOST\">{{cite web |author1=Schweitzer, Ben |author2=Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII OST| date=June 17, 2006 | publisher=RPGFan | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html | accessdate=July 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214810/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> While the Super NES only had eight sound channels to work with, the PlayStation had twenty-four.

To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> It was first exhibited to the Western public at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996]] (E3).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|title=PlayStation at E3: 1996|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928230514/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997. Beginning with a television commercial by [[TBWA\\Chiat\\Day]] that ran alongside popular shows including ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', and ''[[Prime Time Sports]]'', the campaign included numerous articles in both gaming and general interest magazines, advertisements in comics from publishers such as [[DC Comics]] and Marvel, a special collaboration with [[Pepsi]], media events, sample discs, and merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|date=August 27, 1997 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PlayStation%27s+Final+Fantasy+VII+Marketing+Blitz+Continues%3b+Consumers...-a019701566 |title=PlayStation's Final Fantasy VII Marketing Blitz Continues |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com|The Free Library]] |work=[[Business Wire]] |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141126191653/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PlayStation's+Final+Fantasy+VII+Marketing+Blitz+Continues;+Consumers...-a019701566 |archivedate=November 26, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to estimations by Takechi, the total worldwide marketing budget came to {{US$|40 million|long=no}};

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a fixed-width font and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

Following the controversy, the authors made severe changes to the book.<ref name=\"paleo\"/>\n\nEvans won the [[Australian Skeptics]]' 2015 Bent Spoon Award for \"his diet promotions, campaigns against [[Water fluoridation|fluoridation]] and support of [[Vaccine controversies|anti-vaccinationists]].\"<ref name=\"spoon\"/> A spokeswoman for Seven Network TV has defended Evans saying: \"Pete is not anti-vaxx. His position on this, and more generally, is to further his own education on all topics regarding health\".<ref name=\"hansen\"/>\n\nIn 2016, Evans gave advice to an [[osteoporosis]] sufferer on Facebook to stop eating dairy products.

The Australian Medical Association dismissed it as a \"fancy light machine\" and Mandy-Lee Noble, a dietician and member of [[Friends of Science in Medicine]] said it \"is a glorified plasma lamp\", adding \"it's probably no threat to people but if people think this in any way will treat or prevent COVID-19 infection, that risks our community response to the pandemic, that is dangerous, it's an

would investigate the product promoted by Evans \"in relation to any illegal advertising of therapeutic products, including advertising on social media\" warning that the advertising of therapeutic

[[southern Ontario|southern]] and central Ontario, and 45 million people in eight U.S. states.\n\nThe blackout's proximate cause was a [[software bug]] in the alarm system at the control room of [[FirstEnergy]], an [[Akron, Ohio]]\u2013based company, which rendered operators unaware of the need to redistribute load after overloaded transmission lines drooped into foliage. What should have been a manageable local blackout cascaded into the collapse of the entire Northeast region.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=4}}\n\n== Immediate impact ==\nAccording to the New York Independent System Operator ([[NYISO]]) \u2013 the [[Independent System Operator|ISO]] responsible for managing the [[New York (state)|New York]] state [[electrical grid|power grid]] \u2013 a 3,500 [[megawatt]] power surge (towards Ontario) affected the transmission grid at 4:10:39&nbsp;p.m. EDT.<ref name=\"NYISO\">{{cite web| url = http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/NYISO.blackout.report.8.Jan.04.pdf| title = Interim Report on the August 14, 2003, Blackout| date = January 8, 2004| publisher = New York Independent System Operator| access-date = September 16, 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080910221454/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/NYISO.blackout.report.8.Jan.04.pdf| archive-date = September 10, 2008| url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nFor the next 30 minutes, to 4:40&nbsp;p.m. EDT, outages were reported in parts of [[Maryland]] ([[Baltimore]]), [[Michigan]] ([[Detroit]]), [[Ohio]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]), [[Ontario]] ([[London, Ontario|London]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]), [[New Jersey]] ([[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]), and [[New York (state)|New York]] ([[New York City]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]]).\n\nThis was followed by outages in other areas initially unaffected, including all of New York City, portions of southern New York state, New Jersey, [[Vermont]], [[Connecticut]], as well as most of the province of [[Ontario]], including [[Toronto]].<ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/08/14/power.outage/ |title=Major power outage hits New York, other large cities |website=[[CNN]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] |access-date=September 16, 2008 |date=August 14, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914184151/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/08/14/power.outage/ |archive-date=September 14, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nEventually, a large, somewhat triangular area bounded by [[Lansing, Michigan]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]], the shore of [[James Bay]], [[Ottawa]], New York, and Toledo was left without power.\n\nAccording to the official analysis of the blackout prepared by the US and Canadian governments, more than 508 generating units at 265 power plants shut down during the outage. In the minutes before the event, the NYISO-managed power system was carrying 28,700 MW of load. At the height of the outage, the load had dropped to 5,716 MW, a loss of 80%.<ref name=\"NYISO\" />\n\nEssential services remained in operation in some of these areas. In others, backup generation systems failed. Telephone networks generally remained operational, but the increased demand triggered by the blackout left many circuits overloaded. Water systems in several cities lost pressure, forcing [[boil-water advisory|boil-water advisories]] to be put into effect. [[Mobile phone|Cellular service]] was interrupted as mobile networks were overloaded with the increase in volume of calls. Major [[List of United States wireless communications service providers|cellular network providers]] lost service until power was restored.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Television and radio stations remained on the air, with the help of [[Emergency power system|backup generators]], although some stations were knocked off the air for periods ranging from several hours to the length of the entire blackout.{{Vague|Which stations? \"Some\" and \"Most\" don't mean anything.|date=June 2010}}\n\nIt was a hot day (over {{convert|31|C|F|disp=x|, or }}) in much of the affected region, and the heat played a role in the initial event that triggered the wider power outage. The high ambient temperature increased energy demand, as people across the region turned on fans and air conditioning. This caused the power lines to sag as higher currents heated the lines.\n\nIn areas where power remained off after nightfall, the [[Milky Way]] and orbiting artificial [[satellite]]s became visible to the naked eye in metropolitan areas where they cannot ordinarily be seen due to the effects of particulate [[air pollution|air]] and [[light pollution]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoislighting.org/loss.html |title=The Costs Of Losing Our Night Skies |publisher=www.illinoislighting.org |date=August 14, 2003 |access-date=June 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618013711/http://www.illinoislighting.org/loss.html |archive-date=June 18, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost of the [[Amtrak]] [[Northeast Corridor]] service was interrupted, as it relies on electric for its signaling and crossing systems; electrified commuter railways also shut down.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> [[Via Rail]] in Canada was able to continue most of its service. All airports in the affected area closed immediately, so there were no take-offs, and incoming flights had to be diverted to airports with power. U.S. financial markets, which are completely power-dependent, were also shut down. The reliability of the electrical grid was called into question, meaning it was deficient, of less value, and required substantial investment to repair its shortcomings.\n\n==Duration==\nMost places restored power by midnight, as early as 6 p.m. on August 14.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> [[New York subways]] resumed limited services around 8 p.m..<ref name=\"CNN\" />.

Half of the affected portions of Ontario regained power by the morning. By early evening of August 15, two airports, [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], were back in service. By August 16, power was fully restored in New York and Toronto.<ref name=\"DGA.Consulting\"/>\n=== Unaffected regions ===\nWithin the area affected, about 200,000 people continued to have power \u2013 in the [[Niagara Peninsula]] of Ontario; the homes on Gill Crescent in Oakville, Ontario, the easternmost corner of Ontario (centered on [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]]); and the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, NY]] area, excluding southern Erie county, along the shore of Lake Huron via a feeder line to Owen Sound from [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]]. Three of the four Bruce B units were able to throttle back their output without a complete shutdown, then reconnect to the grid within five hours: the portion of New York state including parts of Albany and north and west of Albany, a small pocket of mid-east Michigan, the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], and small pockets in New Jersey. The unaffected area was protected by transmission circuit devices at the [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] (coincidentally, the starting point of the [[Northeast blackout of 1965]]) at a switching station of the hydroelectric power station in Cornwall, as well as central New York state. [[Philadelphia]] and the surrounding [[mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] areas were also completely unaffected because [[PJM Interconnection|PJM]] disconnected them.<ref name=\"NYISO\" /> The Saint Clair power plant{{which|date=October 2017}} in [[East China Township, Michigan]], remained online for about 36 hours, and residents were informed that the plant would have to shut down in order to facilitate the reboot of the whole system. [[Orrville, Ohio]], was able to restore power within an hour disconnecting the local utility from the larger grid and restarting the coal-fired generator.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n== Causes ==\n[[File:Northeast blackout 2003.gif|thumb|300px|Satellite imagery of the [[Northeastern United States]] taken before and during the blackout]]\n\n=== Background ===\nThe load on any power network must be immediately matched by its supply and its ability to transmit that power. Any [[overcurrent|overload]] of a power line or generator can cause costly damage, so the affected device is disconnected from the network if an overload is detected.\n\nThe [[electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] of a power line causes it to produce more heat as the [[electric current|current]] it carries increases. If this heat is not sufficiently dissipated, the metal conductor in the line will expand and lengthen, so that it sags between supporting structures. If the line sags too low, a [[electric arc|flash over]] to nearby objects (such as trees) may occur, causing a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] increase in current. Automatic [[protective relay]]s detect the excessively high current and quickly disconnect the line, with the load previously carried by the line transferred to other lines. If the other lines do not have enough spare capacity to accommodate the extra current, their overload protection will react as well, causing a [[cascading failure]].\n\nSystem operators are responsible for ensuring that power supply and loads remain balanced, and for keeping the system within safe operational limits such that no single fault can cause the system to fail. After a failure affecting their system, operators must obtain more power from generators or other regions or \"shed load\" (meaning to intentionally cut power or [[Brownout (electricity)|reduce voltage]] to a given area) until they can be sure that the worst remaining possible failure anywhere in the system will not cause a system collapse. In an emergency, they are expected to immediately shed load as required to bring the system into balance.\n\nTo assist the operators there are computer systems, with backups, which issue alarms when there are faults in the transmission or generation system. [[Power flow study|Power flow modeling tools]] let them analyze the state of their network, predict whether any parts of it may be overloaded, and predict the worst possible failure remaining, so that they can change the distribution of [[Electricity generation|generation]] or reconfigure the transmission system to prevent a failure should this situation occur. If the computer systems and their backups fail, the operators are required to monitor the grid manually, instead of relying on computer alerts. If they cannot interpret the state of the power grid in such an event, they follow a contingency plan, contacting other plant and grid operators by telephone if necessary. If there is a failure, they are also required to notify adjacent areas which may be affected, so those can predict the possible effects on their own systems.\n\n=== Investigation efforts ===\nA joint federal task force was formed by the governments of Canada and the U.S. to oversee the investigation and report directly to Ottawa and Washington. The task force was led by then-Canadian Natural Resource Minister [[Herb Dhaliwal]] and [[United States Secretary of Energy|U.S. Energy Secretary]] [[Spencer Abraham]].\n\nIn addition to determining the initial cause of the cascading failure, the investigation of the incident also included an examination of the failure of safeguards designed to prevent a repetition of the [[Northeast blackout of 1965]]. The [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]], a joint Canada-U.S. council, is responsible for dealing with these issues.\n\nOn November 19, 2003, Abraham said his department would not seek to punish FirstEnergy Corp for its role in the blackout because current U.S. law does not require electric reliability standards. Abraham stated, \"The absence of enforceable reliability standards creates a situation in which there are limits in terms of federal level punishment.\"<ref>{{cite web| title=DOE chief sees no blackout penalty for FirstEnergy| url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2003/11/19/rtr1153863.html|periodical=[[Forbes]]| publisher=Forbes, LLC|access-date=March 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040224080845/http://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2003/11/19/rtr1153863.html|archive-date=February 24, 2004| date=November 19, 2003}}</ref>\n\n=== Findings ===\nIn February 2004, the U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force released their final report, placing the causes of the blackout into four groups:<ref name=taskforcefinal>{{cite report |date=April 2004 |title=Final Report on the August 14, 2003 Blackout in the United States and Canada: Causes and Recommendations |url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/BlackoutFinal-Web.pdf |publisher=U.S./Canada Power System Outage Task Force |website=Energy.gov \u2013 Office of Electricity Delivery & Energy Reliability |format=PDF |agency=[[United States Department of Energy]] |access-date=June 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527210354/https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/BlackoutFinal-Web.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n# [[FirstEnergy]] (FE) and its reliability council \"failed to assess and understand the inadequacies of FE's system, particularly with respect to voltage instability and the vulnerability of the Cleveland-Akron area, and FE did not operate its system with appropriate voltage criteria.\"\n# FirstEnergy \"did not recognize or understand the deteriorating condition of its system.\"\n# FirstEnergy \"failed to manage adequately tree growth in its transmission rights-of-way.\"\n# Finally, the \"failure of the interconnected grid's reliability organizations to provide effective real-time diagnostic support.\"\n\nThe report states that a generating plant in [[Eastlake, Ohio]], a suburb northeast of Cleveland, went offline amid high electrical demand, putting a strain on high-voltage power lines (located in Walton Hills, Ohio, a southeast suburb of Cleveland) which later went out of service when they came in contact with \"overgrown trees\". This trip caused load to transfer to other transmission lines, which were not able to bear the load, tripping their breakers. Once these multiple trips occurred, many generators suddenly lost parts of their loads, so they accelerated out of phase with the grid at different rates, and tripped out to prevent damage. The cascading effect that resulted ultimately forced the shutdown of more than 100 power plants.\n\n==== Computer failure ====\nA [[software bug]] known as a [[race condition]] existed in [[General Electric]] Energy's [[Unix]]-based [http://site.ge-energy.com/prod_serv/products/td_operations/en/xa21.htm XA/21] [[energy management system]].

Then all applications (including the stalled alarm system) were automatically transferred to the backup server, which itself failed at 14:54. The server failures slowed the screen refresh rate of the operators' computer consoles from 1\u20133 seconds to 59 seconds per screen. The lack of alarms led operators to dismiss a call from American Electric Power about the tripping and reclosure of a 345 kV shared line in northeast Ohio.

Suddenly bereft of demand, generating stations go offline, creating a huge power deficit. In seconds, power surges in from the east, overloading east-coast power plants whose generators go offline as a protective measure, and the blackout is on.\n* 4:10:37&nbsp;p.m. The eastern and western Michigan power grids disconnect from each other.

This put much of the nuclear power offline until those plants could be slowly taken out of \"safe mode\". In the meantime, all available hydro-electric plants (as well as many coal- and oil-fired plants) were brought online, bringing some electrical power to the areas immediately surrounding the plants by the morning of August 15. Homes and businesses both in the affected area and in nearby areas were requested to limit power usage until the grid was back to full power.\n\n==== Water supply ====\nSome areas lost water pressure because pumps lacked power. This loss of pressure caused potential contamination of the water supply. Four million customers of the Detroit water system in eight counties were under a [[boil-water advisory]] until August 18, four days after the initial outage. One county, [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]], ordered all 2,300 restaurants closed until they were decontaminated after the advisory was lifted. Twenty people living on the [[St. Clair River]] claim to have been sickened after bathing in the river during the blackout. The accidental release of 140&nbsp;kg (310&nbsp;lb) of [[vinyl chloride]] from a [[Sarnia]], Ontario chemical plant was not revealed until five days later. Cleveland also lost water pressure and instituted a boil water advisory. Cleveland and New York had [[sewage]] spills into waterways, requiring beach closures. [[Newark, New Jersey]], and northern cities had major sewage spills into the [[Passaic River|Passaic]] and [[Hackensack River|Hackensack]] rivers, which flow directly to the Atlantic Ocean. [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] lost power to sewage pumps, causing raw waste to be dumped into the [[Cataraqui River]] at the base of the [[Rideau Canal]].\n\n==== Transportation ====\n[[File:Streetcar Toronto 2003 Blackout.jpg|thumb|A streetcar left stranded by the blackout in [[Toronto]]]]\n\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] railroad service was stopped north of [[Philadelphia]], and all trains running into and out of New York City were shut down, initially including the [[Long Island Rail Road]] and the [[Metro-North Railroad]]; both were able to establish a bare-bones \"all-diesel\" service by the next morning. Canada's [[Via Rail]], which serves Toronto and [[Montreal]], had a few service delays before returning to normal the next morning.\n\nPassenger screenings at affected airports ceased. Regional airports were shut down for this reason. In New York, flights were cancelled even after power had been restored to the airports because of difficulties accessing \"electronic-ticket\" information. [[Air Canada]] flights remained grounded on the morning of August 15 due to reliable power not having been restored to its [[Mississauga]] control center. It expected to resume operations by midday. This problem affected all Air Canada service and canceled the most heavily traveled flights to [[Metropolitan Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Vancouver]]. At [[Chicago]]'s [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway International Airport]], [[Southwest Airlines]] employees spent 48 hours dealing with the disorder caused by the blackout's sudden incidence.<ref>{{cite episode |network=[[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] |series=Airline |series-link=Airline_(American_TV_series) |title=Beyond Their Control |date=January 12, 2004 |season=1}} features Southwest employees dealing with the flight interruptions caused by the blackout</ref>\n\nMany gas stations were unable to pump fuel due to lack of electricity. In [[North Bay, Ontario]], for instance, a long line of [[transport truck]]s was held up, unable to go further west to [[Manitoba]] without refueling. In some cities, traffic problems were compounded by motorists who simply drove until their cars ran out of gas on the highway. Gas stations operating in pockets of [[Burlington, Ontario]], that had power were reported to be charging prices up to $3.78 per US gallon (99.9 cents/Litre) when the going rate prior to the blackout was lower than $2.65/gallon (70\u00a2/L). Customers still lined up for hours to pay prices many people considered [[price gouging]]. Station operators claimed that they had a limited supply of gasoline and did not know when their tanks would be refilled, prompting the drastic price increases.\n\nMany oil refineries on the East Coast of the United States shut down as a result of the blackout, and were slow to resume gasoline production. As a result, gasoline prices were expected to rise approximately 10 cents/gallon (3\u00a2/L) in the United States. In Canada, gasoline [[rationing]] was also considered by the authorities.\n\n==== Communication ====\nCellular communication devices were disrupted. This was mainly due to the loss of backup power at the cellular sites where generators ran out of fuel. Where cell sites remained up, some cell phones still went out of service as their batteries ran out of charge without a power source to recharge from. Wired [[telephone line]]s continued to work, although some systems were overwhelmed by the volume of traffic, and millions of home users had only cordless telephones depending on house current. Most New York and many Ontario radio stations were momentarily knocked off the air before returning with backup power.\n\n[[Cable television]] systems were disabled, and in areas that had power restored (and had power to their television sets), cable subscribers could not receive information until power was restored to the cable provider. Those who relied on the [[Internet]] were similarly disconnected from their news source for the duration of the blackout, with the exception of [[dial-up]] access from [[laptop]] computers, which were widely reported to work until the batteries ran out of charge. Information was available by over-the-air TV and radio reception for those who were equipped to receive TV and/or audio in that way.\n\nThe blackout affected communications well outside the immediate area of power outage. The New Jersey-based internet operations of [[Advance Publications]] were among those knocked out by the blackout. As a result, the internet editions of Advance newspapers as far removed from the blackout area as ''[[The Birmingham News]]'', the New Orleans ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', and ''[[The Oregonian]]'' were offline for days.<ref>\" {{cite news|title=Blackout Stops Presses, Shuts Web Sites|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108017766.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403174020/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108017766.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 3, 2018|periodical=Newsinc|date=August 18, 2003|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Amateur radio]] operators passed emergency communications during the blackout.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=October 2003| author=Rick Lindquist, N1RL| magazine=[[QST]]| title=Hams a Bright Spot during Power Blackout}}</ref>\n\n==== Industry ====\nLarge numbers of factories were closed in the affected area, and others outside the area were forced to close or slow work because of supply problems and the need to conserve energy while the grid was being stabilized. At one point a 7-hour wait developed for trucks crossing the [[Ambassador Bridge]] between [[Detroit]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] due to the lack of electronic border check systems. Freeway congestion in affected areas affected the \"[[Just in time (business)|just in time]]\" (JIT) supply system. Some industries (including the auto industry) did not return to full production until August 22.\n\n=== By region ===\n\n==== New York ====\n{{for|delayed effects at [[Niagara Falls]]|#Ontario}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:2003 New York City blackout.jpg|thumb|250px|People walking across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] in [[New York City]] during the blackout]]\n\nAlmost the entire state of [[New York (state)|New York]] lost power. Exceptions included [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]] and [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]] on [[Long Island]], which relied on localized power plants; the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], where power dipped briefly (a few areas, such as portions of [[Latham, New York]], didn't lose power at all); the southernmost areas of the [[Southern Tier]] of [[Upstate New York]], mostly near [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly]], which relied on power from [[Pennsylvania]]; the city of [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]]; [[Starrett City, Brooklyn]], which has auxiliary power; most of the city of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; and pockets of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]] in the Buffalo area, running off [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|university power]]. There were also some small pockets of power in the suburbs of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], as a few smaller power companies operating in those areas were able to keep running. The [[North Shore Towers]] complex was unaffected by the blackout due to their on-site self-generating power plant. Power was also available at the [[Kodak Park]] facility and its surrounding neighborhood in the city. Power was lost at the [[Oak Hill Country Club]] in nearby [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], where the [[2003 PGA Championship]] was being played, which caused minor interruptions to the tournament. Also, that evening's [[Major League Baseball]] game between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[Shea Stadium]] was postponed. In New York, all prisons were blacked out and switched to generator power. The two [[Indian Point Energy Center|Indian Point nuclear reactors]] on the [[Hudson River]] near [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]], the two reactors at [[Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Station|Nine Mile Point]] nuclear plant, the single reactor at [[Ginna Nuclear Generating Station|Ginna]] nuclear plant near Rochester, and the [[James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant|FitzPatrick]] reactor near [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]] all shut down. With three other nuclear plants shut down in Ohio, Michigan, and New Jersey, a total of nine reactors were affected. The governor of New York, [[George Pataki]], declared a [[state of emergency]].\n\n[[Verizon Communications|Verizon]]'s emergency generators failed several times, leaving the [[emergency services number]] [[9-1-1]] out of service for several periods of about a quarter-hour each. New York City's [[3-1-1|311]] information hotline received over 175,000 calls from concerned residents during the weekend. [[Amateur radio operator]]s attached to New York City [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service|ARES]] provided a backup communications link to emergency shelters and hospitals. Amateur radio [[repeater]]s were supplied with emergency power via [[electric generator|generators]] and batteries and remained functional.\n\nMajor U.S. networks ([[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) and some cable television channels ([[HBO]], [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]]), centered in [[New York City]], were unable to broadcast normally, so backup stations and flagship transmitters in [[Dallas]] were used for prime-time TV. ABC ran their [[ABC News|news broadcasts]] from [[Washington, D.C.]] instead.\n\n===== New York City =====\n[[Manhattan]], including [[Wall Street]] and the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], was completely shut down, as were all area airports (with the exception of [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh's]] [[Stewart International Airport]], which had once been a military airbase and had its own generators), and all New York-area rail transportation including the [[New York City Subway|subway]], the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] lines between Manhattan and New Jersey, [[New Jersey Transit]]'s rail service, [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]], and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], though limited railroad service resumed early Friday morning through the use of diesel trains.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/4349/dot_4349_DS1.pdf|title=Effects of Catastrophic Events on Transportation Systems Management and Operations - August 2003 Blackout Great Lakes Region|last=Volpe|first=John|date=May 2004|website=U.S. Department of Transportation - National Transportation Library|publisher=United States Department of Transportation - Research and Special Programs Administration|page=46|access-date=July 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725033046/https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/4349/dot_4349_DS1.pdf|archive-date=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Hundreds of people were trapped in elevators; by late evening the [[New York City Fire Department]] had reportedly confirmed that all stalled elevators in approximately 800 Manhattan high-rise office and apartment buildings had been cleared. More than 600 subway and commuter rail cars were trapped between stations; New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] and the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (which operates the PATH lines) reported that all passengers were evacuated without serious injury. PATH resumed subway service on Sixth Avenue by 9:45 PM that evening, system-wide service resumed at 11 PM.<ref name=\":0\" /> By comparison, full service on the New York City Subway system returned gradually from Friday through Saturday morning.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWithout traffic lights, [[gridlock]] was reported as people in [[Lower Manhattan|Lower]] and [[Midtown Manhattan]] fled their offices on foot; for hours into the evening the streets, highways, bridges and tunnels were jammed with traffic and pedestrians leaving Manhattan, though many civilians helped direct traffic. The bus journey from Manhattan to [[Washington, D.C.]] (which normally takes four hours) took more than eight hours, with reports that it took four hours just to get out of Manhattan. Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] advised residents to open their windows, drink plenty of liquids to avoid [[heat stroke]] in the heat, and not to forget their pets. Temperatures were {{convert|92|F}} with high [[humidity]], as New York had just experienced a record-breaking rain spell that had started at the end of July. With cell phone operation mostly stalled by circuit overloads, New Yorkers were lining up 10 deep or more at [[pay phone]]s as [[Public switched telephone network|ordinary telephone service]] remained largely unaffected. Many people found themselves with no phone service at home.\n\nWhile some commuters were able to find alternate sleeping arrangements, many were left stranded in New York and slept in parks and on the steps of public buildings. While practically all businesses and retail establishments closed down, many bars and pubs reported a brisk business as many New Yorkers took the opportunity to spend the evening \"enjoying\" the blackout. Tourists' hotel rooms were blacked out except the hallways and most of the restaurants in lobbies gave out free food to guests. Since most perishable items were going to spoil anyway, many restaurants and citizens simply prepared what they could and served it to anyone who wanted it, leading to vast block parties in many New York City neighborhoods. Any ice cream in frozen storage also had to be quickly served to any and all passers by. The [[Indigo Girls]] were scheduled to perform that evening at [[Central Park SummerStage]], and the band took the stage as planned to play one of the only shows in the affected area, using generators that had been filled with fuel that morning. Their performance was not a full-length concert, as they needed to end early to allow all attendees to exit Central Park before dark. The venue also had bathrooms, and vendors cooking food on propane grills.\n\nForty thousand police officers and the entire fire department were called in to maintain order. At least two fatalities were linked to the use of flames to provide light, and many nonfatal fires also resulted from the use of [[candle]]s. New York City's [[New York City Office of Emergency Management|Office of Emergency Management]] activated its Emergency Operations Center, from which more than 70 agencies coordinated response efforts, which included delivery of portable light towers to unlit intersections, generators and diesel fuel to hospitals, and a portable steam generator necessary to power air conditioning units at the [[American Stock Exchange]].\n\n==== New Jersey ====\nAffected areas included most of [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]], [[Union County, New Jersey|Union]], [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]], and [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] counties, including the major cities of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], although some sections of Newark and [[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]] still had power; also, small sections of certain towns in Essex, Hudson, and Union counties had power. Power was returned first to the urban areas because of concerns of safety and unrest. Counties as far south as [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland]] were affected, where power was restored within an hour. Some towns in Bergen County only momentarily lost power, and had wild oscillations in power line voltage, ranging from about 90&nbsp;V to 135&nbsp;V every few minutes for an hour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe day following the blackout, August 15, the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] stopped collecting tolls until 9:00&nbsp;a.m.\n\n==== Maryland ====\nThe Baltimore-Washington area was not affected other than transportation scheduling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2003-08-15-0308150275-story.html|title=In Maryland, most lights stay on|first=Lorraine|last=Mirabella|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=February 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204174401/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2003-08-15-0308150275-story.html|archive-date=February 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Connecticut ====\nParts of [[New London County, Connecticut|New London]], [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], were affected, although most of the state had power all evening, aside from a few momentary interruptions that caused computers to reboot. [[Metro-North]] trains stopped and remained on the tracks for hours, until they could be towed to the nearest station. Generally, most of the state east of [[Interstate 91]], and some places west of I-91, had power during the duration of the blackout, with some of [[New Haven]]'s eastern suburbs being seen as the easternmost extreme of the effects of the blackout.\n\nA local controversy ensued in the days after the blackout, when the federal government ordered power companies to energize the [[HVDC]] [[Cross Sound Cable]] between New Haven and [[Long Island]]. This cable had been installed, but not activated due to environment and fishery concerns. The [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]] of Connecticut (and future U.S. Senator), [[Richard Blumenthal]], and the [[Governor of New York]], [[George Pataki]], traded insults over the cable. Connecticut politicians expressed their outrage that the cable was being turned on, since it did not help anyone in Connecticut, as the cable would transport power from Connecticut to Long Island.\n\n==== Massachusetts ====\nA small area of western [[Massachusetts]] was affected. In [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] the event was of sufficient magnitude to reboot some computers, while in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] the effect of the event was enough to cause the automatic startup of commercial and industrial backup generation facilities. Some areas were subjected to lower-than-normal voltage (as low as 100 volts AC) and [[brownout (electricity)|brownouts]] for periods of up to 24 hours. The [[Boston]] area was spared from the blackout.\n\n==== Michigan ====\nAbout 2.3 million households and businesses were affected, including almost all of [[Metro Detroit]], as well as [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], and surrounding communities in southeast Michigan. The blackout affected three Michigan utilities: [[Detroit Edison]] (whose entire system went down), [[Lansing Board of Water & Light]], and a small portion of [[Consumers Energy]]'s system in the southeastern corner of the state. Word quickly spread to the surrounding areas without power and many flocked to surrounding areas that still had power, resulting in crowded stores, packed restaurants, booked hotels, and long queues for the gas stations in these towns. Locales closest to the affected areas in the northern [[Metro Detroit|Detroit suburbs]] that did not lose power included the areas of [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]] and [[Holly, Michigan|Holly]], communities along [[M-24 (Michigan highway)|M-24]] and [[M-15 (Michigan highway)|M-15]], and into the [[Lapeer, Michigan|Lapeer]] and [[Flint/Tri-Cities]] area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The city limits of [[Brighton, Michigan|Brighton]] and [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]] were unaffected as well, as they received electricity from Consumers Energy via the Genoa-Latson 138&nbsp;kV line which interconnects Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy. Television and radio stations were temporarily knocked off the air and water supplies were disrupted in Detroit due to the failure of electric pumps. Because of the loss of water pressure all water was required to be boiled before use until August 18. Several schools which had planned to begin the school year August 18 were closed until clean water was available.\n\nA [[Marathon Oil]] refinery in [[Melvindale, Michigan|Melvindale]], near Detroit, suffered a small explosion from gas buildup, necessitating an evacuation within {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} around the plant and the closure of [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]]. Officials feared the release of toxic gases. Heavy rains on August 17 coupled with the lack of sewage pumps closed other expressways and prompted urban flood warnings. Untreated sewage flowed into local rivers in Lansing and Metropolitan Detroit as contingency solutions at some sewage treatment plants failed. In the midst of a summer [[heat wave]], [[Michigander]]s were deprived of [[air conditioning]]. Several people, mostly elderly individuals, had to be treated for symptoms of [[heat stroke]]. In the Detroit area, local television stations' news helicopters were told by each station's management to \"stay above the cars' headlights\" at night, and to not venture into Downtown Detroit (due to the hazard of flying into an unlit [[skyscraper]]). During the days immediately after the blackout, many stations were back on the air, with limited resources. (In one case, [[WXYZ-TV]]'s news anchor was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, as opposed to his normal news suit, and apologized to viewers for the \"rather warm conditions\" in the station, as they only had one air conditioner and a couple of fans working.) The [[Downriver]] communities had to contend with basements flooded with sewage-laden water on the weekend immediately after the blackout, with water and sewage pumps off from a lack of power, much to the general annoyance of residents in the areas. News crews of the areas broadcast notices during their coverages of the blackouts to the Downriver residents, explaining why the pumps had shorted out, as well as to limit water usage. (\"Most places have water pressure, some have low pressure...some have none, and some even have ''negative pressure''. That means in the next few hours, people in the downriver communities should expect flooded basements from, so move all your valuables high up and out of the basements,\" as [[WDIV-TV]] warned.) [[West Michigan]], including the communities of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]] were mostly unaffected, although a large portion was within \"seconds\" of joining the blackout according to local U.S. Representative [[Fred Upton]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=Cogswell|title=Area was seconds away from blackout|url=http://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/area-was-seconds-away-from-blackout/article_513f5764-3e16-5ea9-b126-8c953f8ca859.html|newspaper=[[The Herald-Palladium]]|publisher=[[Paxton Media Group]]|date=August 26, 2003|access-date=May 6, 2016}}</ref> Although right across the border from [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]] was unaffected by the outage, as the two cities are not electrically connected.\n\n==== Ohio ====\nOver 540,000 homes and businesses were without power. In [[Cleveland]], water service stopped because the city is supplied by electric pumps and backup electricity was available only on a very limited basis and water had to be boiled for several days afterwards. Portions of the cities of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]], [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]], and [[Ashland, Ohio|Ashland]] were without power. Cleveland declared a [[curfew]] on all persons under the age of 18. At [[Cedar Point]] amusement park in [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], park employees had to help guests walk down the steps of the {{convert|205|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Magnum XL-200]] roller coaster, which had stopped on the lift hill due to the blackout. Several other guests had to be helped off rides as a result of the blackout. In [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], the [[Toledo Mud Hens|Mud Hens]] baseball team postponed the game scheduled for that night. Some parts of the city were unaffected by the blackout, notably the suburb of [[Sylvania, Ohio|Sylvania]]. Other surrounding cities like [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]] only experienced a brief outage.\n\n==== Ontario ====\n[[File:toronto ON 2003 Blackout.jpg|thumb|[[Toronto]], on the evening of August 14]]\n[[File:Jasonp blackout2003 toronto BayAdelaide.jpg|thumb|Volunteers, like Toronto lawyer Peter Carayiannis (pictured), received fluorescent jackets from the police to direct traffic in Toronto during the blackout.

Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. Most of [[Northwestern Ontario]] (including [[Thunder Bay]]) was not affected.\n\n[[Traffic light]]s, which had no backup power, were all knocked out. All intersections were to be considered an [[all-way stop]]. Coupled with the beginning of the evening rush hour, this caused traffic problems. In many major and minor intersections in both large cities, such as Ottawa and Toronto, ordinary citizens began directing traffic until police or others relieved them. Since there were not enough police officers to direct traffic at every intersection during the afternoon rush hour, passing police officers distributed fluorescent jackets to people who were directing traffic. Drivers and pedestrians generally followed the instructions from them even though they were not police officers.<ref name=\"CBC archived news clip\" />\n\nIn Ottawa, the federal government was shut down.

Toronto officials asked residents to curtail unnecessary use of water, as pumps were not working and there was only a 24-hour supply. Entertainment events were canceled for several days. English band [[Radiohead]] rescheduled a planned August 16 concert in Toronto until the following October 15 due to the power outage. The opening of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]], scheduled for August 15, was postponed to August 19. The roof of the [[Skydome]] in Toronto remained open in an effort to conserve power until August 21, when a thunderstorm struck.\n\nLarge disruptions of truck traffic in northeastern Ontario were reported due to the unavailability of fuel, including the backlog near [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]]. The [[Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel|tunnel]] and [[Ambassador Bridge|bridge]] between [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and Detroit were also closed, with the bridge's pillars illuminated by emergency [[High-intensity discharge lamp|floodlights]], as to not pose a [[shipping]] and [[airplane]] hazard.\n\nAbout 140 miners were marooned underground in the [[Falconbridge, Ontario|Falconbridge]] mine in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] when the power went out. Mine officials said they were safe and could be evacuated if necessary, but were not, due to the risks of doing so with no power. They were safely evacuated by the morning. In [[Sarnia]], a [[Refining (metallurgy)|refinery]] scrubber lost power and released above-normal levels of pollution; residents were advised to close their windows.\n\nOn the evening of August 14, [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario premier]] [[Ernie Eves]] declared a state of emergency, instructing nonessential personnel not to go to work the next day and that rolling blackouts could occur for weeks.<ref name=\"Ontario State of Emergency\">{{cite news| last = Van Rijn| first = Nicholaas| title = BLACKOUT: Eves declares state of emergency and warns of rolling power outages for 'weeks to come'| newspaper = Toronto Star| date = August 15, 2003| location = Toronto| edition = Special}}</ref> Residents were asked not to use televisions, washing machines, or air conditioners if possible, and warned that some restored power might go off again.<ref name=\"Ontario State of Emergency\" /> Although the full state of emergency was lifted the next day, residents were warned that the normal amount of power would not be available for days, and were still asked to reduce power consumption.<ref name=\"Ontario State of Emergency\" />\n\nFor two days of this recovery period, diversion of water from the [[Niagara River]] for [[hydroelectric]] generation was increased to the maximum level, normally used only at night and in winter in order to maintain the scenic appearance of [[Niagara Falls]]. The resultant drop in the river level below the falls meant that the [[Maid of the Mist]] tour boats could not dock safely, and their operation had to be suspended.\n\nThe [[Petro-Canada]] [[oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] had to perform an emergency shutdown due to the lack of power. The plant's [[gas flare|flare]] system produced large flames during the shutdown, leading to erroneous reports in the media that there had been a fire in the plant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The Petro Canada lubricants plant in [[Mississauga]] experienced a fire one week later while restarting normal operations.<ref>{{cite web| title=Update on Fire and Explosion at Petro-Canada Lubricants Plant in Mississauga, Ontario| url=http://www.petro-canada.ca/en/media/1886.aspx?id=630421| publisher=Petro-Canada|access-date=March 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015182630/http://www.petro-canada.ca/en/media/1886.aspx?id=630421|archive-date=October 15, 2007| date=August 22, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/error.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725145113/http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/docs/cdp_report3.pdf|url-status=dead|title=The Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation &#124; Error|archivedate=July 25, 2011|website=www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nMany Torontonians remember that night as a moment where the community came together: \"Without power, residents of Toronto took to the streets to help direct traffic; florists arranged flowers for weddings by candlelight; and convenience stores served customers in the blackness. The night sky was a rarely seen canopy of dazzling stars, twinkling down on the darkened city through soft summer heat that lingered into the evening.\"\n\n==== Pennsylvania ====\n\nThe blackout was confined to the northwest portion of the state.  According to emergency officials in Erie, Crawford, Venango, Clarion, Bradford, Forest and Warren counties, outages lasted into the night, but there were no serious injuries or incidents.<ref>{{cite news\n |author       = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n |title        = Pennsylvania hit by blackout, but just near Erie\n |url          = https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2003/08/15/Pennsylvania-hit-by-blackout-but-just-near-Erie/stories/200308150020\n |work         = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n |location     = \n |date         = August 15, 2003\n |access-date  = June 20, 2019\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20190620195009/https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2003/08/15/Pennsylvania-hit-by-blackout-but-just-near-Erie/stories/200308150020\n |archive-date = June 20, 2019\n |url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\n== Emergency services ==\n\nIn New York, about 3,000 fire calls were reported, many from people using candles.

Officials said the fire was apparently caused by candles left burning.\n\n== Long-term effects ==\n\nThe blackout prompted the federal government of the United States to include reliability provisions in the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]]. The standards of the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] became mandatory for U.S. electricity providers.\n\nIn the United States, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration had emphasized the need for changes to the U.S. national energy policy, [[critical infrastructure protection]], and [[homeland security]]. During the blackout, most systems that would detect unauthorized border crossings, port landings, or detect unauthorized access to many vulnerable sites failed. There was considerable fear that future blackouts would be exploited for [[terrorism]]. In addition, the failure highlighted the ease with which the power grid could be taken down.\n\nThe Ontario government fell in a [[2003 Ontario general election|provincial election]] held in October 2003; power had long been a major issue. The government may have been hurt by the success of [[Quebec]] and [[Manitoba]], which were not affected whereas Ontario was shut down. The extra publicity given to Ontario's need to import electricity from the United States, mostly due to a decision of the government not to expand the province's power generating capabilities, may also have adversely affected the Conservative government. Premier [[Ernie Eves]]'s handling of the crisis was also criticized; he was not heard from until long after Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Pataki had spoken out. Due to the regular announcements he gave in the days following the blackout, Eves enjoyed a moderate increase in the polls that his party took as a sign of an opportunity to call an [[2003 Ontario general election|election]] they could win, but they lost instead.\n\n== Restoration of service ==\nBy evening of August 14, power had been restored to:\n\n*Many areas of [[Ontario]]\n*Parts of [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]] and [[Michigan]]\n*Parts of [[New York (state)|New York]], including [[Long Island]]\n\n[[Con Edison]] retracted its claim that New York City would have power by 1 a.m. That night some areas of Manhattan regained power at approximately 5 a.m. (August 15), the New York City borough of [[Staten Island]] regained power around 3 a.m. on August 15, and Niagara Mohawk predicted that the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] area would have to wait until 8 a.m. In the New York City borough of Brooklyn power was not fully restored until around sunset on August 15.\n\nBy early evening of August 15, two airports, [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], were back in service.\n\nHalf of the affected part of Ontario had power by the morning of August 15, though even in areas where it had come back online, some services were still disrupted or running at lower levels. The last areas to regain power were usually suffering from trouble at local electrical substations that was not directly related to the blackout itself.\n\nBy August 16, power was fully restored in New York and Toronto. Toronto's subway and streetcars remained out of service until August 18 to prevent the possibility of equipment being stuck in awkward locations if the power was interrupted again. Power had been mostly restored in Ottawa, though authorities warned of possible additional disruptions and advised conservation as power continued to be restored to other areas. Ontarians were asked to reduce their electricity use by 50% until all generating stations could be brought back on line. Four remained out of service on the 19th. Illuminated billboards were largely dormant for the week following the blackout, and many stores had only a portion of their lights on.\n\nPreparations against the possible disruptions threatened by the [[Year 2000 problem]] have been credited for the installation of new electrical equipment and systems which allowed for a relatively rapid restoration of power in some areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Media coverage and official reports ==\nIn the United States and Canada, the regional blackout dominated news broadcasts and news headlines beginning August 15. U.S. and Canadian television networks pre-empted normal programming in favor of full-time, advertising-free coverage of the unfolding story. Once terrorism had been conclusively ruled out as a cause, many stations switched back to normal programming following an 8:30&nbsp;p.m. EDT address by President [[George W.

(A lightning strike to a power substation north of New York City was similarly blamed for the [[1977 New York City blackout|1977 blackout]] that plunged nearly the entire city into darkness for 24 hours.) New York state power officials replied that the problem did not originate in the United States, there was no rain storm in the area where the lightning allegedly stuck, and the power plant in question remained in operation throughout the blackout.\n*Canadian Defence Minister [[John McCallum]] blamed an outage at a [[nuclear power|nuclear plant]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where state officials reported all plants were functioning normally. McCallum later said his sources had given him incorrect information.\n*[[New York (state)|New York]] governor [[George Pataki]] blamed the power outage on Canada, stating, \"the New York independent systems operator says they are virtually certain it had nothing to do in New York state.

[[southern Ontario|southern]] and central Ontario, and 45 million people in eight U.S. states.\n\nThe blackout's proximate cause was a [[software bug]] in the alarm system at the control room of [[FirstEnergy]], an [[Akron, Ohio]]\u2013based company, which rendered operators unaware of the need to redistribute load after overloaded transmission lines drooped into foliage. What should have been a manageable local blackout cascaded into the collapse of the entire Northeast region.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=4}}\n\n== Immediate impact ==\nAccording to the New York Independent System Operator ([[NYISO]]) \u2013 the [[Independent System Operator|ISO]] responsible for managing the [[New York (state)|New York]] state [[electrical grid|power grid]] \u2013 a 3,500 [[megawatt]] power surge (towards Ontario) affected the transmission grid at 4:10:39&nbsp;p.m. EDT.<ref name=\"NYISO\">{{cite web| url = http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/NYISO.blackout.report.8.Jan.04.pdf| title = Interim Report on the August 14, 2003, Blackout| date = January 8, 2004| publisher = New York Independent System Operator| access-date = September 16, 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080910221454/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/NYISO.blackout.report.8.Jan.04.pdf| archive-date = September 10, 2008| url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nFor the next 30 minutes, to 4:40&nbsp;p.m. EDT, outages were reported in parts of [[Maryland]] ([[Baltimore]]), [[Michigan]] ([[Detroit]]), [[Ohio]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]), [[Ontario]] ([[London, Ontario|London]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]), [[New Jersey]] ([[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]), and [[New York (state)|New York]] ([[New York City]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]]).\n\nThis was followed by outages in other areas initially unaffected, including all of New York City, portions of southern New York state, New Jersey, [[Vermont]], [[Connecticut]], as well as most of the province of [[Ontario]], including [[Toronto]].<ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/08/14/power.outage/ |title=Major power outage hits New York, other large cities |website=[[CNN]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] |access-date=September 16, 2008 |date=August 14, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914184151/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/08/14/power.outage/ |archive-date=September 14, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nEventually, a large, somewhat triangular area bounded by [[Lansing, Michigan]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]], the shore of [[James Bay]], [[Ottawa]], New York, and Toledo was left without power.\n\nAccording to the official analysis of the blackout prepared by the US and Canadian governments, more than 508 generating units at 265 power plants shut down during the outage. In the minutes before the event, the NYISO-managed power system was carrying 28,700 MW of load. At the height of the outage, the load had dropped to 5,716 MW, a loss of 80%.<ref name=\"NYISO\" />\n\nEssential services remained in operation in some of these areas. In others, backup generation systems failed. Telephone networks generally remained operational, but the increased demand triggered by the blackout left many circuits overloaded. Water systems in several cities lost pressure, forcing [[boil-water advisory|boil-water advisories]] to be put into effect. [[Mobile phone|Cellular service]] was interrupted as mobile networks were overloaded with the increase in volume of calls. Major [[List of United States wireless communications service providers|cellular network providers]] lost service until power was restored.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Television and radio stations remained on the air, with the help of [[Emergency power system|backup generators]], although some stations were knocked off the air for periods ranging from several hours to the length of the entire blackout.{{Vague|Which stations? \"Some\" and \"Most\" don't mean anything.|date=June 2010}}\n\nIt was a hot day (over {{convert|31|C|F|disp=x|, or }}) in much of the affected region, and the heat played a role in the initial event that triggered the wider power outage. The high ambient temperature increased energy demand, as people across the region turned on fans and air conditioning. This caused the power lines to sag as higher currents heated the lines.\n\nIn areas where power remained off after nightfall, the [[Milky Way]] and orbiting artificial [[satellite]]s became visible to the naked eye in metropolitan areas where they cannot ordinarily be seen due to the effects of particulate [[air pollution|air]] and [[light pollution]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoislighting.org/loss.html |title=The Costs Of Losing Our Night Skies |publisher=www.illinoislighting.org |date=August 14, 2003 |access-date=June 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618013711/http://www.illinoislighting.org/loss.html |archive-date=June 18, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost of the [[Amtrak]] [[Northeast Corridor]] service was interrupted, as it relies on electric for its signaling and crossing systems; electrified commuter railways also shut down.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> [[Via Rail]] in Canada was able to continue most of its service. All airports in the affected area closed immediately, so there were no take-offs, and incoming flights had to be diverted to airports with power. U.S. financial markets, which are completely power-dependent, were also shut down. The reliability of the electrical grid was called into question, meaning it was deficient, of less value, and required substantial investment to repair its shortcomings.\n\n==Duration==\nMost places restored power by midnight, as early as 6 p.m. on August 14.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> [[New York subways]] resumed limited services around 8 p.m..<ref name=\"CNN\" />.

Half of the affected portions of Ontario regained power by the morning. By early evening of August 15, two airports, [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], were back in service. By August 16, power was fully restored in New York and Toronto.<ref name=\"DGA.Consulting\"/>\n=== Unaffected regions ===\nWithin the area affected, about 200,000 people continued to have power \u2013 in the [[Niagara Peninsula]] of Ontario; the homes on Gill Crescent in Oakville, Ontario, the easternmost corner of Ontario (centered on [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]]); and the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, NY]] area, excluding southern Erie county, along the shore of Lake Huron via a feeder line to Owen Sound from [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]]. Three of the four Bruce B units were able to throttle back their output without a complete shutdown, then reconnect to the grid within five hours: the portion of New York state including parts of Albany and north and west of Albany, a small pocket of mid-east Michigan, the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], and small pockets in New Jersey. The unaffected area was protected by transmission circuit devices at the [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] (coincidentally, the starting point of the [[Northeast blackout of 1965]]) at a switching station of the hydroelectric power station in Cornwall, as well as central New York state. [[Philadelphia]] and the surrounding [[mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] areas were also completely unaffected because [[PJM Interconnection|PJM]] disconnected them.<ref name=\"NYISO\" /> The Saint Clair power plant{{which|date=October 2017}} in [[East China Township, Michigan]], remained online for about 36 hours, and residents were informed that the plant would have to shut down in order to facilitate the reboot of the whole system. [[Orrville, Ohio]], was able to restore power within an hour disconnecting the local utility from the larger grid and restarting the coal-fired generator.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n== Causes ==\n[[File:Northeast blackout 2003.gif|thumb|300px|Satellite imagery of the [[Northeastern United States]] taken before and during the blackout]]\n\n=== Background ===\nThe load on any power network must be immediately matched by its supply and its ability to transmit that power. Any [[overcurrent|overload]] of a power line or generator can cause costly damage, so the affected device is disconnected from the network if an overload is detected.\n\nThe [[electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] of a power line causes it to produce more heat as the [[electric current|current]] it carries increases. If this heat is not sufficiently dissipated, the metal conductor in the line will expand and lengthen, so that it sags between supporting structures. If the line sags too low, a [[electric arc|flash over]] to nearby objects (such as trees) may occur, causing a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] increase in current. Automatic [[protective relay]]s detect the excessively high current and quickly disconnect the line, with the load previously carried by the line transferred to other lines. If the other lines do not have enough spare capacity to accommodate the extra current, their overload protection will react as well, causing a [[cascading failure]].\n\nSystem operators are responsible for ensuring that power supply and loads remain balanced, and for keeping the system within safe operational limits such that no single fault can cause the system to fail. After a failure affecting their system, operators must obtain more power from generators or other regions or \"shed load\" (meaning to intentionally cut power or [[Brownout (electricity)|reduce voltage]] to a given area) until they can be sure that the worst remaining possible failure anywhere in the system will not cause a system collapse. In an emergency, they are expected to immediately shed load as required to bring the system into balance.\n\nTo assist the operators there are computer systems, with backups, which issue alarms when there are faults in the transmission or generation system. [[Power flow study|Power flow modeling tools]] let them analyze the state of their network, predict whether any parts of it may be overloaded, and predict the worst possible failure remaining, so that they can change the distribution of [[Electricity generation|generation]] or reconfigure the transmission system to prevent a failure should this situation occur. If the computer systems and their backups fail, the operators are required to monitor the grid manually, instead of relying on computer alerts. If they cannot interpret the state of the power grid in such an event, they follow a contingency plan, contacting other plant and grid operators by telephone if necessary. If there is a failure, they are also required to notify adjacent areas which may be affected, so those can predict the possible effects on their own systems.\n\n=== Investigation efforts ===\nA joint federal task force was formed by the governments of Canada and the U.S. to oversee the investigation and report directly to Ottawa and Washington. The task force was led by then-Canadian Natural Resource Minister [[Herb Dhaliwal]] and [[United States Secretary of Energy|U.S. Energy Secretary]] [[Spencer Abraham]].\n\nIn addition to determining the initial cause of the cascading failure, the investigation of the incident also included an examination of the failure of safeguards designed to prevent a repetition of the [[Northeast blackout of 1965]]. The [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]], a joint Canada-U.S. council, is responsible for dealing with these issues.\n\nOn November 19, 2003, Abraham said his department would not seek to punish FirstEnergy Corp for its role in the blackout because current U.S. law does not require electric reliability standards. Abraham stated, \"The absence of enforceable reliability standards creates a situation in which there are limits in terms of federal level punishment.\"<ref>{{cite web| title=DOE chief sees no blackout penalty for FirstEnergy| url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2003/11/19/rtr1153863.html|periodical=[[Forbes]]| publisher=Forbes, LLC|access-date=March 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040224080845/http://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2003/11/19/rtr1153863.html|archive-date=February 24, 2004| date=November 19, 2003}}</ref>\n\n=== Findings ===\nIn February 2004, the U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force released their final report, placing the causes of the blackout into four groups:<ref name=taskforcefinal>{{cite report |date=April 2004 |title=Final Report on the August 14, 2003 Blackout in the United States and Canada: Causes and Recommendations |url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/BlackoutFinal-Web.pdf |publisher=U.S./Canada Power System Outage Task Force |website=Energy.gov \u2013 Office of Electricity Delivery & Energy Reliability |format=PDF |agency=[[United States Department of Energy]] |access-date=June 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527210354/https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/BlackoutFinal-Web.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n# [[FirstEnergy]] (FE) and its reliability council \"failed to assess and understand the inadequacies of FE's system, particularly with respect to voltage instability and the vulnerability of the Cleveland-Akron area, and FE did not operate its system with appropriate voltage criteria.\"\n# FirstEnergy \"did not recognize or understand the deteriorating condition of its system.\"\n# FirstEnergy \"failed to manage adequately tree growth in its transmission rights-of-way.\"\n# Finally, the \"failure of the interconnected grid's reliability organizations to provide effective real-time diagnostic support.\"\n\nThe report states that a generating plant in [[Eastlake, Ohio]], a suburb northeast of Cleveland, went offline amid high electrical demand, putting a strain on high-voltage power lines (located in Walton Hills, Ohio, a southeast suburb of Cleveland) which later went out of service when they came in contact with \"overgrown trees\". This trip caused load to transfer to other transmission lines, which were not able to bear the load, tripping their breakers. Once these multiple trips occurred, many generators suddenly lost parts of their loads, so they accelerated out of phase with the grid at different rates, and tripped out to prevent damage. The cascading effect that resulted ultimately forced the shutdown of more than 100 power plants.\n\n==== Computer failure ====\nA [[software bug]] known as a [[race condition]] existed in [[General Electric]] Energy's [[Unix]]-based [http://site.ge-energy.com/prod_serv/products/td_operations/en/xa21.htm XA/21] [[energy management system]].

Then all applications (including the stalled alarm system) were automatically transferred to the backup server, which itself failed at 14:54. The server failures slowed the screen refresh rate of the operators' computer consoles from 1\u20133 seconds to 59 seconds per screen. The lack of alarms led operators to dismiss a call from American Electric Power about the tripping and reclosure of a 345 kV shared line in northeast Ohio. But by 15:42, after the control room itself lost power, control room operators informed technical support (who were already troubleshooting the issue) of the alarm system problem.<ref>{{cite report |date=July 13, 2004 |title=Technical Analysis of the August 14, 2003, Blackout: What Happened, Why, and What Did We Learn? |url=http://www.nerc.com/docs/docs/blackout/NERC_Final_Blackout_Report_07_13_04.pdf |publisher=[[North American Electric Reliability Council]] |access-date=June 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318081212/http://www.nerc.com/docs/docs/blackout/NERC_Final_Blackout_Report_07_13_04.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Sequence of events ===\nThe following is the blackout's sequence of events on August 14, 2003<ref name=taskforcefinal /><ref>{{cite news |last=Lerner |first=Eric J. |title=What's wrong with the electric grid? |work=The Industrial Physicist |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |date=October\u2013November 2003 |url=http://www.tipmagazine.com/tip/INPHFA/vol-9/iss-5/p8.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111817/http://www.tipmagazine.com/tip/INPHFA/vol-9/iss-5/p8.html |archive-date=July 16, 2011 <!-- NOTE: newer archive copies seem broken --> |access-date=June 10, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=A timeline of the 2003 blackout |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/08/16/blackout.chron.ap/index.html |website=CNN|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 16, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013125714/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/08/16/blackout.chron.ap/index.html |archive-date=October 13, 2008 |access-date=}}</ref> (times in [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]):\n\n* 12:15&nbsp;p.m. Incorrect [[telemetry]] data renders inoperative the state estimator, a power flow monitoring tool operated by the Indiana-based [[Midcontinent Independent System Operator|Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator]] (MISO).

Suddenly bereft of demand, generating stations go offline, creating a huge power deficit. In seconds, power surges in from the east, overloading east-coast power plants whose generators go offline as a protective measure, and the blackout is on.\n* 4:10:37&nbsp;p.m. The eastern and western Michigan power grids disconnect from each other. Two 345 kV lines in [[Michigan]] trip. A line that runs from [[Grand Ledge, Michigan|Grand Ledge]] to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] known as the Oneida-Majestic interconnection trips.

This put much of the nuclear power offline until those plants could be slowly taken out of \"safe mode\". In the meantime, all available hydro-electric plants (as well as many coal- and oil-fired plants) were brought online, bringing some electrical power to the areas immediately surrounding the plants by the morning of August 15. Homes and businesses both in the affected area and in nearby areas were requested to limit power usage until the grid was back to full power.\n\n==== Water supply ====\nSome areas lost water pressure because pumps lacked power. This loss of pressure caused potential contamination of the water supply. Four million customers of the Detroit water system in eight counties were under a [[boil-water advisory]] until August 18, four days after the initial outage. One county, [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]], ordered all 2,300 restaurants closed until they were decontaminated after the advisory was lifted. Twenty people living on the [[St. Clair River]] claim to have been sickened after bathing in the river during the blackout. The accidental release of 140&nbsp;kg (310&nbsp;lb) of [[vinyl chloride]] from a [[Sarnia]], Ontario chemical plant was not revealed until five days later. Cleveland also lost water pressure and instituted a boil water advisory. Cleveland and New York had [[sewage]] spills into waterways, requiring beach closures. [[Newark, New Jersey]], and northern cities had major sewage spills into the [[Passaic River|Passaic]] and [[Hackensack River|Hackensack]] rivers, which flow directly to the Atlantic Ocean. [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] lost power to sewage pumps, causing raw waste to be dumped into the [[Cataraqui River]] at the base of the [[Rideau Canal]].\n\n==== Transportation ====\n[[File:Streetcar Toronto 2003 Blackout.jpg|thumb|A streetcar left stranded by the blackout in [[Toronto]]]]\n\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] railroad service was stopped north of [[Philadelphia]], and all trains running into and out of New York City were shut down, initially including the [[Long Island Rail Road]] and the [[Metro-North Railroad]]; both were able to establish a bare-bones \"all-diesel\" service by the next morning. Canada's [[Via Rail]], which serves Toronto and [[Montreal]], had a few service delays before returning to normal the next morning.\n\nPassenger screenings at affected airports ceased. Regional airports were shut down for this reason. In New York, flights were cancelled even after power had been restored to the airports because of difficulties accessing \"electronic-ticket\" information. [[Air Canada]] flights remained grounded on the morning of August 15 due to reliable power not having been restored to its [[Mississauga]] control center. It expected to resume operations by midday. This problem affected all Air Canada service and canceled the most heavily traveled flights to [[Metropolitan Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Vancouver]]. At [[Chicago]]'s [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway International Airport]], [[Southwest Airlines]] employees spent 48 hours dealing with the disorder caused by the blackout's sudden incidence.<ref>{{cite episode |network=[[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] |series=Airline |series-link=Airline_(American_TV_series) |title=Beyond Their Control |date=January 12, 2004 |season=1}} features Southwest employees dealing with the flight interruptions caused by the blackout</ref>\n\nMany gas stations were unable to pump fuel due to lack of electricity. In [[North Bay, Ontario]], for instance, a long line of [[transport truck]]s was held up, unable to go further west to [[Manitoba]] without refueling. In some cities, traffic problems were compounded by motorists who simply drove until their cars ran out of gas on the highway. Gas stations operating in pockets of [[Burlington, Ontario]], that had power were reported to be charging prices up to $3.78 per US gallon (99.9 cents/Litre) when the going rate prior to the blackout was lower than $2.65/gallon (70\u00a2/L). Customers still lined up for hours to pay prices many people considered [[price gouging]]. Station operators claimed that they had a limited supply of gasoline and did not know when their tanks would be refilled, prompting the drastic price increases.\n\nMany oil refineries on the East Coast of the United States shut down as a result of the blackout, and were slow to resume gasoline production. As a result, gasoline prices were expected to rise approximately 10 cents/gallon (3\u00a2/L) in the United States. In Canada, gasoline [[rationing]] was also considered by the authorities.\n\n==== Communication ====\nCellular communication devices were disrupted. This was mainly due to the loss of backup power at the cellular sites where generators ran out of fuel. Where cell sites remained up, some cell phones still went out of service as their batteries ran out of charge without a power source to recharge from. Wired [[telephone line]]s continued to work, although some systems were overwhelmed by the volume of traffic, and millions of home users had only cordless telephones depending on house current. Most New York and many Ontario radio stations were momentarily knocked off the air before returning with backup power.\n\n[[Cable television]] systems were disabled, and in areas that had power restored (and had power to their television sets), cable subscribers could not receive information until power was restored to the cable provider. Those who relied on the [[Internet]] were similarly disconnected from their news source for the duration of the blackout, with the exception of [[dial-up]] access from [[laptop]] computers, which were widely reported to work until the batteries ran out of charge. Information was available by over-the-air TV and radio reception for those who were equipped to receive TV and/or audio in that way.\n\nThe blackout affected communications well outside the immediate area of power outage. The New Jersey-based internet operations of [[Advance Publications]] were among those knocked out by the blackout. As a result, the internet editions of Advance newspapers as far removed from the blackout area as ''[[The Birmingham News]]'', the New Orleans ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', and ''[[The Oregonian]]'' were offline for days.<ref>\" {{cite news|title=Blackout Stops Presses, Shuts Web Sites|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108017766.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403174020/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108017766.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 3, 2018|periodical=Newsinc|date=August 18, 2003|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Amateur radio]] operators passed emergency communications during the blackout.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=October 2003| author=Rick Lindquist, N1RL| magazine=[[QST]]| title=Hams a Bright Spot during Power Blackout}}</ref>\n\n==== Industry ====\nLarge numbers of factories were closed in the affected area, and others outside the area were forced to close or slow work because of supply problems and the need to conserve energy while the grid was being stabilized. At one point a 7-hour wait developed for trucks crossing the [[Ambassador Bridge]] between [[Detroit]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] due to the lack of electronic border check systems. Freeway congestion in affected areas affected the \"[[Just in time (business)|just in time]]\" (JIT) supply system. Some industries (including the auto industry) did not return to full production until August 22.\n\n=== By region ===\n\n==== New York ====\n{{for|delayed effects at [[Niagara Falls]]|#Ontario}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:2003 New York City blackout.jpg|thumb|250px|People walking across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] in [[New York City]] during the blackout]]\n\nAlmost the entire state of [[New York (state)|New York]] lost power. Exceptions included [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]] and [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]] on [[Long Island]], which relied on localized power plants; the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], where power dipped briefly (a few areas, such as portions of [[Latham, New York]], didn't lose power at all); the southernmost areas of the [[Southern Tier]] of [[Upstate New York]], mostly near [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly]], which relied on power from [[Pennsylvania]]; the city of [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]]; [[Starrett City, Brooklyn]], which has auxiliary power; most of the city of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; and pockets of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]] in the Buffalo area, running off [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|university power]]. There were also some small pockets of power in the suburbs of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], as a few smaller power companies operating in those areas were able to keep running. The [[North Shore Towers]] complex was unaffected by the blackout due to their on-site self-generating power plant. Power was also available at the [[Kodak Park]] facility and its surrounding neighborhood in the city. Power was lost at the [[Oak Hill Country Club]] in nearby [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], where the [[2003 PGA Championship]] was being played, which caused minor interruptions to the tournament. Also, that evening's [[Major League Baseball]] game between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[Shea Stadium]] was postponed. In New York, all prisons were blacked out and switched to generator power. The two [[Indian Point Energy Center|Indian Point nuclear reactors]] on the [[Hudson River]] near [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]], the two reactors at [[Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Station|Nine Mile Point]] nuclear plant, the single reactor at [[Ginna Nuclear Generating Station|Ginna]] nuclear plant near Rochester, and the [[James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant|FitzPatrick]] reactor near [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]] all shut down. With three other nuclear plants shut down in Ohio, Michigan, and New Jersey, a total of nine reactors were affected. The governor of New York, [[George Pataki]], declared a [[state of emergency]].\n\n[[Verizon Communications|Verizon]]'s emergency generators failed several times, leaving the [[emergency services number]] [[9-1-1]] out of service for several periods of about a quarter-hour each. New York City's [[3-1-1|311]] information hotline received over 175,000 calls from concerned residents during the weekend. [[Amateur radio operator]]s attached to New York City [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service|ARES]] provided a backup communications link to emergency shelters and hospitals. Amateur radio [[repeater]]s were supplied with emergency power via [[electric generator|generators]] and batteries and remained functional.\n\nMajor U.S. networks ([[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) and some cable television channels ([[HBO]], [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]]), centered in [[New York City]], were unable to broadcast normally, so backup stations and flagship transmitters in [[Dallas]] were used for prime-time TV. ABC ran their [[ABC News|news broadcasts]] from [[Washington, D.C.]] instead.\n\n===== New York City =====\n[[Manhattan]], including [[Wall Street]] and the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], was completely shut down, as were all area airports (with the exception of [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh's]] [[Stewart International Airport]], which had once been a military airbase and had its own generators), and all New York-area rail transportation including the [[New York City Subway|subway]], the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] lines between Manhattan and New Jersey, [[New Jersey Transit]]'s rail service, [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]], and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], though limited railroad service resumed early Friday morning through the use of diesel trains.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/4349/dot_4349_DS1.pdf|title=Effects of Catastrophic Events on Transportation Systems Management and Operations - August 2003 Blackout Great Lakes Region|last=Volpe|first=John|date=May 2004|website=U.S. Department of Transportation - National Transportation Library|publisher=United States Department of Transportation - Research and Special Programs Administration|page=46|access-date=July 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725033046/https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/4349/dot_4349_DS1.pdf|archive-date=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Hundreds of people were trapped in elevators; by late evening the [[New York City Fire Department]] had reportedly confirmed that all stalled elevators in approximately 800 Manhattan high-rise office and apartment buildings had been cleared. More than 600 subway and commuter rail cars were trapped between stations; New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] and the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (which operates the PATH lines) reported that all passengers were evacuated without serious injury. PATH resumed subway service on Sixth Avenue by 9:45 PM that evening, system-wide service resumed at 11 PM.<ref name=\":0\" /> By comparison, full service on the New York City Subway system returned gradually from Friday through Saturday morning.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWithout traffic lights, [[gridlock]] was reported as people in [[Lower Manhattan|Lower]] and [[Midtown Manhattan]] fled their offices on foot; for hours into the evening the streets, highways, bridges and tunnels were jammed with traffic and pedestrians leaving Manhattan, though many civilians helped direct traffic. The bus journey from Manhattan to [[Washington, D.C.]] (which normally takes four hours) took more than eight hours, with reports that it took four hours just to get out of Manhattan. Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] advised residents to open their windows, drink plenty of liquids to avoid [[heat stroke]] in the heat, and not to forget their pets. Temperatures were {{convert|92|F}} with high [[humidity]], as New York had just experienced a record-breaking rain spell that had started at the end of July. With cell phone operation mostly stalled by circuit overloads, New Yorkers were lining up 10 deep or more at [[pay phone]]s as [[Public switched telephone network|ordinary telephone service]] remained largely unaffected. Many people found themselves with no phone service at home.\n\nWhile some commuters were able to find alternate sleeping arrangements, many were left stranded in New York and slept in parks and on the steps of public buildings. While practically all businesses and retail establishments closed down, many bars and pubs reported a brisk business as many New Yorkers took the opportunity to spend the evening \"enjoying\" the blackout. Tourists' hotel rooms were blacked out except the hallways and most of the restaurants in lobbies gave out free food to guests. Since most perishable items were going to spoil anyway, many restaurants and citizens simply prepared what they could and served it to anyone who wanted it, leading to vast block parties in many New York City neighborhoods. Any ice cream in frozen storage also had to be quickly served to any and all passers by. The [[Indigo Girls]] were scheduled to perform that evening at [[Central Park SummerStage]], and the band took the stage as planned to play one of the only shows in the affected area, using generators that had been filled with fuel that morning. Their performance was not a full-length concert, as they needed to end early to allow all attendees to exit Central Park before dark. The venue also had bathrooms, and vendors cooking food on propane grills.\n\nForty thousand police officers and the entire fire department were called in to maintain order. At least two fatalities were linked to the use of flames to provide light, and many nonfatal fires also resulted from the use of [[candle]]s. New York City's [[New York City Office of Emergency Management|Office of Emergency Management]] activated its Emergency Operations Center, from which more than 70 agencies coordinated response efforts, which included delivery of portable light towers to unlit intersections, generators and diesel fuel to hospitals, and a portable steam generator necessary to power air conditioning units at the [[American Stock Exchange]].\n\n==== New Jersey ====\nAffected areas included most of [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]], [[Union County, New Jersey|Union]], [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]], and [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] counties, including the major cities of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], although some sections of Newark and [[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]] still had power; also, small sections of certain towns in Essex, Hudson, and Union counties had power. Power was returned first to the urban areas because of concerns of safety and unrest. Counties as far south as [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland]] were affected, where power was restored within an hour. Some towns in Bergen County only momentarily lost power, and had wild oscillations in power line voltage, ranging from about 90&nbsp;V to 135&nbsp;V every few minutes for an hour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe day following the blackout, August 15, the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] stopped collecting tolls until 9:00&nbsp;a.m.\n\n==== Maryland ====\nThe Baltimore-Washington area was not affected other than transportation scheduling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2003-08-15-0308150275-story.html|title=In Maryland, most lights stay on|first=Lorraine|last=Mirabella|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=February 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204174401/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2003-08-15-0308150275-story.html|archive-date=February 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Connecticut ====\nParts of [[New London County, Connecticut|New London]], [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], were affected, although most of the state had power all evening, aside from a few momentary interruptions that caused computers to reboot. [[Metro-North]] trains stopped and remained on the tracks for hours, until they could be towed to the nearest station. Generally, most of the state east of [[Interstate 91]], and some places west of I-91, had power during the duration of the blackout, with some of [[New Haven]]'s eastern suburbs being seen as the easternmost extreme of the effects of the blackout.\n\nA local controversy ensued in the days after the blackout, when the federal government ordered power companies to energize the [[HVDC]] [[Cross Sound Cable]] between New Haven and [[Long Island]]. This cable had been installed, but not activated due to environment and fishery concerns. The [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]] of Connecticut (and future U.S. Senator), [[Richard Blumenthal]], and the [[Governor of New York]], [[George Pataki]], traded insults over the cable. Connecticut politicians expressed their outrage that the cable was being turned on, since it did not help anyone in Connecticut, as the cable would transport power from Connecticut to Long Island.\n\n==== Massachusetts ====\nA small area of western [[Massachusetts]] was affected. In [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] the event was of sufficient magnitude to reboot some computers, while in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] the effect of the event was enough to cause the automatic startup of commercial and industrial backup generation facilities. Some areas were subjected to lower-than-normal voltage (as low as 100 volts AC) and [[brownout (electricity)|brownouts]] for periods of up to 24 hours. The [[Boston]] area was spared from the blackout.\n\n==== Michigan ====\nAbout 2.3 million households and businesses were affected, including almost all of [[Metro Detroit]], as well as [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], and surrounding communities in southeast Michigan. The blackout affected three Michigan utilities: [[Detroit Edison]] (whose entire system went down), [[Lansing Board of Water & Light]], and a small portion of [[Consumers Energy]]'s system in the southeastern corner of the state. Word quickly spread to the surrounding areas without power and many flocked to surrounding areas that still had power, resulting in crowded stores, packed restaurants, booked hotels, and long queues for the gas stations in these towns. Locales closest to the affected areas in the northern [[Metro Detroit|Detroit suburbs]] that did not lose power included the areas of [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]] and [[Holly, Michigan|Holly]], communities along [[M-24 (Michigan highway)|M-24]] and [[M-15 (Michigan highway)|M-15]], and into the [[Lapeer, Michigan|Lapeer]] and [[Flint/Tri-Cities]] area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The city limits of [[Brighton, Michigan|Brighton]] and [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]] were unaffected as well, as they received electricity from Consumers Energy via the Genoa-Latson 138&nbsp;kV line which interconnects Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy. Television and radio stations were temporarily knocked off the air and water supplies were disrupted in Detroit due to the failure of electric pumps. Because of the loss of water pressure all water was required to be boiled before use until August 18. Several schools which had planned to begin the school year August 18 were closed until clean water was available.\n\nA [[Marathon Oil]] refinery in [[Melvindale, Michigan|Melvindale]], near Detroit, suffered a small explosion from gas buildup, necessitating an evacuation within {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} around the plant and the closure of [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]]. Officials feared the release of toxic gases. Heavy rains on August 17 coupled with the lack of sewage pumps closed other expressways and prompted urban flood warnings. Untreated sewage flowed into local rivers in Lansing and Metropolitan Detroit as contingency solutions at some sewage treatment plants failed. In the midst of a summer [[heat wave]], [[Michigander]]s were deprived of [[air conditioning]]. Several people, mostly elderly individuals, had to be treated for symptoms of [[heat stroke]]. In the Detroit area, local television stations' news helicopters were told by each station's management to \"stay above the cars' headlights\" at night, and to not venture into Downtown Detroit (due to the hazard of flying into an unlit [[skyscraper]]). During the days immediately after the blackout, many stations were back on the air, with limited resources. (In one case, [[WXYZ-TV]]'s news anchor was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, as opposed to his normal news suit, and apologized to viewers for the \"rather warm conditions\" in the station, as they only had one air conditioner and a couple of fans working.) The [[Downriver]] communities had to contend with basements flooded with sewage-laden water on the weekend immediately after the blackout, with water and sewage pumps off from a lack of power, much to the general annoyance of residents in the areas. News crews of the areas broadcast notices during their coverages of the blackouts to the Downriver residents, explaining why the pumps had shorted out, as well as to limit water usage. (\"Most places have water pressure, some have low pressure...some have none, and some even have ''negative pressure''. That means in the next few hours, people in the downriver communities should expect flooded basements from, so move all your valuables high up and out of the basements,\" as [[WDIV-TV]] warned.) [[West Michigan]], including the communities of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]] were mostly unaffected, although a large portion was within \"seconds\" of joining the blackout according to local U.S. Representative [[Fred Upton]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=Cogswell|title=Area was seconds away from blackout|url=http://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/area-was-seconds-away-from-blackout/article_513f5764-3e16-5ea9-b126-8c953f8ca859.html|newspaper=[[The Herald-Palladium]]|publisher=[[Paxton Media Group]]|date=August 26, 2003|access-date=May 6, 2016}}</ref> Although right across the border from [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]] was unaffected by the outage, as the two cities are not electrically connected.\n\n==== Ohio ====\nOver 540,000 homes and businesses were without power. In [[Cleveland]], water service stopped because the city is supplied by electric pumps and backup electricity was available only on a very limited basis and water had to be boiled for several days afterwards. Portions of the cities of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]], [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]], and [[Ashland, Ohio|Ashland]] were without power. Cleveland declared a [[curfew]] on all persons under the age of 18. At [[Cedar Point]] amusement park in [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], park employees had to help guests walk down the steps of the {{convert|205|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Magnum XL-200]] roller coaster, which had stopped on the lift hill due to the blackout. Several other guests had to be helped off rides as a result of the blackout. In [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], the [[Toledo Mud Hens|Mud Hens]] baseball team postponed the game scheduled for that night. Some parts of the city were unaffected by the blackout, notably the suburb of [[Sylvania, Ohio|Sylvania]]. Other surrounding cities like [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]] only experienced a brief outage.\n\n==== Ontario ====\n[[File:toronto ON 2003 Blackout.jpg|thumb|[[Toronto]], on the evening of August 14]]\n[[File:Jasonp blackout2003 toronto BayAdelaide.jpg|thumb|Volunteers, like Toronto lawyer Peter Carayiannis (pictured), received fluorescent jackets from the police to direct traffic in Toronto during the blackout.

Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. Most of [[Northwestern Ontario]] (including [[Thunder Bay]]) was not affected.\n\n[[Traffic light]]s, which had no backup power, were all knocked out. All intersections were to be considered an [[all-way stop]]. Coupled with the beginning of the evening rush hour, this caused traffic problems. In many major and minor intersections in both large cities, such as Ottawa and Toronto, ordinary citizens began directing traffic until police or others relieved them. Since there were not enough police officers to direct traffic at every intersection during the afternoon rush hour, passing police officers distributed fluorescent jackets to people who were directing traffic. Drivers and pedestrians generally followed the instructions from them even though they were not police officers.<ref name=\"CBC archived news clip\" />\n\nIn Ottawa, the federal government was shut down.

Toronto officials asked residents to curtail unnecessary use of water, as pumps were not working and there was only a 24-hour supply. Entertainment events were canceled for several days. English band [[Radiohead]] rescheduled a planned August 16 concert in Toronto until the following October 15 due to the power outage. The opening of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]], scheduled for August 15, was postponed to August 19. The roof of the [[Skydome]] in Toronto remained open in an effort to conserve power until August 21, when a thunderstorm struck.\n\nLarge disruptions of truck traffic in northeastern Ontario were reported due to the unavailability of fuel, including the backlog near [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]]. The [[Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel|tunnel]] and [[Ambassador Bridge|bridge]] between [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and Detroit were also closed, with the bridge's pillars illuminated by emergency [[High-intensity discharge lamp|floodlights]], as to not pose a [[shipping]] and [[airplane]] hazard.\n\nAbout 140 miners were marooned underground in the [[Falconbridge, Ontario|Falconbridge]] mine in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] when the power went out. Mine officials said they were safe and could be evacuated if necessary, but were not, due to the risks of doing so with no power. They were safely evacuated by the morning. In [[Sarnia]], a [[Refining (metallurgy)|refinery]] scrubber lost power and released above-normal levels of pollution; residents were advised to close their windows.\n\nOn the evening of August 14, [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario premier]] [[Ernie Eves]] declared a state of emergency, instructing nonessential personnel not to go to work the next day and that rolling blackouts could occur for weeks.<ref name=\"Ontario State of Emergency\">{{cite news| last = Van Rijn| first = Nicholaas| title = BLACKOUT: Eves declares state of emergency and warns of rolling power outages for 'weeks to come'| newspaper = Toronto Star| date = August 15, 2003| location = Toronto| edition = Special}}</ref> Residents were asked not to use televisions, washing machines, or air conditioners if possible, and warned that some restored power might go off again.<ref name=\"Ontario State of Emergency\" /> Although the full state of emergency was lifted the next day, residents were warned that the normal amount of power would not be available for days, and were still asked to reduce power consumption.<ref name=\"Ontario State of Emergency\" />\n\nFor two days of this recovery period, diversion of water from the [[Niagara River]] for [[hydroelectric]] generation was increased to the maximum level, normally used only at night and in winter in order to maintain the scenic appearance of [[Niagara Falls]]. The resultant drop in the river level below the falls meant that the [[Maid of the Mist]] tour boats could not dock safely, and their operation had to be suspended.\n\nThe [[Petro-Canada]] [[oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] had to perform an emergency shutdown due to the lack of power. The plant's [[gas flare|flare]] system produced large flames during the shutdown, leading to erroneous reports in the media that there had been a fire in the plant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The Petro Canada lubricants plant in [[Mississauga]] experienced a fire one week later while restarting normal operations.<ref>{{cite web| title=Update on Fire and Explosion at Petro-Canada Lubricants Plant in Mississauga, Ontario| url=http://www.petro-canada.ca/en/media/1886.aspx?id=630421| publisher=Petro-Canada|access-date=March 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015182630/http://www.petro-canada.ca/en/media/1886.aspx?id=630421|archive-date=October 15, 2007| date=August 22, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/error.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725145113/http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/docs/cdp_report3.pdf|url-status=dead|title=The Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation &#124; Error|archivedate=July 25, 2011|website=www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nMany Torontonians remember that night as a moment where the community came together: \"Without power, residents of Toronto took to the streets to help direct traffic; florists arranged flowers for weddings by candlelight; and convenience stores served customers in the blackness. The night sky was a rarely seen canopy of dazzling stars, twinkling down on the darkened city through soft summer heat that lingered into the evening.\"\n\n==== Pennsylvania ====\n\nThe blackout was confined to the northwest portion of the state.  According to emergency officials in Erie, Crawford, Venango, Clarion, Bradford, Forest and Warren counties, outages lasted into the night, but there were no serious injuries or incidents.<ref>{{cite news\n |author       = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n |title        = Pennsylvania hit by blackout, but just near Erie\n |url          = https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2003/08/15/Pennsylvania-hit-by-blackout-but-just-near-Erie/stories/200308150020\n |work         = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n |location     = \n |date         = August 15, 2003\n |access-date  = June 20, 2019\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20190620195009/https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2003/08/15/Pennsylvania-hit-by-blackout-but-just-near-Erie/stories/200308150020\n |archive-date = June 20, 2019\n |url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\n== Emergency services ==\n\nIn New York, about 3,000 fire calls were reported, many from people using candles.

Officials said the fire was apparently caused by candles left burning.\n\n== Long-term effects ==\n\nThe blackout prompted the federal government of the United States to include reliability provisions in the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]]. The standards of the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] became mandatory for U.S. electricity providers.\n\nIn the United States, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration had emphasized the need for changes to the U.S. national energy policy, [[critical infrastructure protection]], and [[homeland security]]. During the blackout, most systems that would detect unauthorized border crossings, port landings, or detect unauthorized access to many vulnerable sites failed. There was considerable fear that future blackouts would be exploited for [[terrorism]]. In addition, the failure highlighted the ease with which the power grid could be taken down.\n\nThe Ontario government fell in a [[2003 Ontario general election|provincial election]] held in October 2003; power had long been a major issue. The government may have been hurt by the success of [[Quebec]] and [[Manitoba]], which were not affected whereas Ontario was shut down. The extra publicity given to Ontario's need to import electricity from the United States, mostly due to a decision of the government not to expand the province's power generating capabilities, may also have adversely affected the Conservative government. Premier [[Ernie Eves]]'s handling of the crisis was also criticized; he was not heard from until long after Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Pataki had spoken out. Due to the regular announcements he gave in the days following the blackout, Eves enjoyed a moderate increase in the polls that his party took as a sign of an opportunity to call an [[2003 Ontario general election|election]] they could win, but they lost instead.\n\n== Restoration of service ==\nBy evening of August 14, power had been restored to:\n\n*Many areas of [[Ontario]]\n*Parts of [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]] and [[Michigan]]\n*Parts of [[New York (state)|New York]], including [[Long Island]]\n\n[[Con Edison]] retracted its claim that New York City would have power by 1 a.m. That night some areas of Manhattan regained power at approximately 5 a.m. (August 15), the New York City borough of [[Staten Island]] regained power around 3 a.m. on August 15, and Niagara Mohawk predicted that the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] area would have to wait until 8 a.m. In the New York City borough of Brooklyn power was not fully restored until around sunset on August 15.\n\nBy early evening of August 15, two airports, [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], were back in service.\n\nHalf of the affected part of Ontario had power by the morning of August 15, though even in areas where it had come back online, some services were still disrupted or running at lower levels. The last areas to regain power were usually suffering from trouble at local electrical substations that was not directly related to the blackout itself.\n\nBy August 16, power was fully restored in New York and Toronto. Toronto's subway and streetcars remained out of service until August 18 to prevent the possibility of equipment being stuck in awkward locations if the power was interrupted again. Power had been mostly restored in Ottawa, though authorities warned of possible additional disruptions and advised conservation as power continued to be restored to other areas. Ontarians were asked to reduce their electricity use by 50% until all generating stations could be brought back on line. Four remained out of service on the 19th. Illuminated billboards were largely dormant for the week following the blackout, and many stores had only a portion of their lights on.\n\nPreparations against the possible disruptions threatened by the [[Year 2000 problem]] have been credited for the installation of new electrical equipment and systems which allowed for a relatively rapid restoration of power in some areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Media coverage and official reports ==\nIn the United States and Canada, the regional blackout dominated news broadcasts and news headlines beginning August 15. U.S. and Canadian television networks pre-empted normal programming in favor of full-time, advertising-free coverage of the unfolding story. Once terrorism had been conclusively ruled out as a cause, many stations switched back to normal programming following an 8:30&nbsp;p.m. EDT address by President [[George W.

(A lightning strike to a power substation north of New York City was similarly blamed for the [[1977 New York City blackout|1977 blackout]] that plunged nearly the entire city into darkness for 24 hours.) New York state power officials replied that the problem did not originate in the United States, there was no rain storm in the area where the lightning allegedly stuck, and the power plant in question remained in operation throughout the blackout.\n*Canadian Defence Minister [[John McCallum]] blamed an outage at a [[nuclear power|nuclear plant]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where state officials reported all plants were functioning normally. McCallum later said his sources had given him incorrect information.\n*[[New York (state)|New York]] governor [[George Pataki]] blamed the power outage on Canada, stating, \"the New York independent systems operator says they are virtually certain it had nothing to do in New York state.
