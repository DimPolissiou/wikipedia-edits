The series centers on the surreal life of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] Australian-immigrant [[wallaby]]<!--Do not change. Rocko is referred to as a wallaby, despite constantly being called \"Kangaroo Boy\".--> named [[Rocko]] and his friends: the eccentric steer<!--Do not change, despite the running gag of everyone mistaking Heff for a cow, he always corrects them as \"steer\".--> [[Heffer Wolfe]], the neurotic turtle [[Filburt Shellbach|Filburt]], and Rocko's faithful dog [[Spunky (Rocko's Modern Life)|Spunky]]. It is set in the fictional town of O-Town. Throughout its run, this show was [[controversial]] for its [[adult humor]], including [[double entendre]], [[innuendo]], and [[satirical]] social commentary, similar to ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''.\n\nMurray created the title character for an unpublished comic book series in the late 1980s, and later reluctantly pitched the series to Nickelodeon, who were looking for edgier cartoonists for their then-new [[Nicktoons]]. The network gave the staff a large amount of creative freedom, with the writers targeting both children and adults. The show premiered on September 18, 1993, and ended on November 24, 1996, totaling four seasons and 52 episodes. A [[Television special|special]], entitled ''[[Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling]]'', was [[Streaming media|digitally released]] on [[Netflix]] on August 9, 2019.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NickRewind/status/1151114646767771649|title=Rocko is still living a MODERN life in the Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling movie coming to @netflix 8/9pic.twitter.com/G3Ms8eJgAT|last=NickRewind|date=2019-07-16|website=@NickRewind|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe show launched the careers of voice actors [[Carlos Alazraqui]] and [[Tom Kenny]]. After the show's cancellation, much of the staff regrouped to work on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', created by ''Rocko''{{'}}s creative director [[Stephen Hillenburg]].\n\n==Premise==\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Rocko's Modern Life characters}}\n''Rocko's Modern Life'' follows the life of an easily frightened Australian immigrant [[wallaby]]<!--Do not change. Rocko is referred to as a wallaby, despite constantly being called \"Kangaroo Boy\".--> named [[Rocko]] (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]), who encounters various dilemmas and situations regarding otherwise mundane aspects of life. His best friends are: [[Heffer Wolfe]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), a fat and enthusiastic steer<!--Do not change, despite the running gag of everyone mistaking Heff for a cow, he always corrects them as \"steer\".-->; [[Filburt]] ([[Mr. Lawrence]]), a neurotic turtle who often feels awkward or disturbed; and his faithful dog [[Spunky (Rocko's Modern Life)|Spunky]] (Alazraqui). Living next door to Rocko is a middle-aged couple, [[Ed Bighead]] ([[Charlie Adler]]), a cynical and cantankerous toad<!--They are always referred to as toads on the show, not frogs. Do not change.--> who despises Rocko; and his compassionate and more friendly wife Bev (Adler).\n\nAll of the characters in ''Rocko's Modern Life'' are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals of varying species, the vast majority of whom are mentally unstable. Murray said that he matched personalities of his characters to the various animals in the series to form a social [[caricature]].<ref name=\"CNMurrayInterview\"/>\n\n===Setting===\n''Rocko's Modern Life'' is set in a generic fictional American town called O-Town, located near the [[Great Lakes]]. Places in the town include: Chokey Chicken (later renamed \"Chewy Chicken\" due to the former name referring to [[masturbation]]), a parody of [[KFC]] and a favorite restaurant/hang-out place for Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt; Conglom-O Corporation, a [[megacorporation]] with the slogan \"We own you\" that owns everything in town; [[Hell|Heck]], a place of eternal torment run by [[Satan|Peaches]] where \"bad people\" go when they die; Holl-o-Wood, a town that resembles [[Hollywood]]; and Kind of a Lot O' Comics, a [[comic book]] store owned by a cruel toad named Mr. Smitty, where Rocko works.\n\nMany of the locations in ''Rocko's Modern Life'' have the letter \"O\" in them; for example, O-Town and Conglom-O Corporation. When asked about the use of \"O\" in his show, Murray said:\n{{quote|I always got a big kick out of the businesses that were 'House-O-Paint', or 'Ton-O-Noodles', because their names seemed to homogenize what they sold, and strip the products of true individuality and stress volume ... and we all know, the American dream is volume! So what better company to create volume than 'Conglom-O', and since a majority of the town worked at Conglom-O, it should be called 'O' Town. I also wanted the town to be 'anytown' USA, and I used to love sports players with a big ZERO on their back. It was funny to me.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/>}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Joe Murray publicity shot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Rocko's Modern Life'' creator Joe Murray.]]\nOriginally, the character appeared in an unpublished comic book titled ''Travis''. Murray tried selling the comic book in the late 1980s, between illustrating jobs and did not find success in getting it into production. Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks. He described the early 1990s animation atmosphere as \"ripe for this kind of project. We took some chances that would be hard to do in these current times (the 1990s)\".<ref name=\"MurrayRockoHome\">\n\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110206001351/http://www.joemurraystudio.com/tv/rocko.shtml Rocko's Modern Life]\", ''[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] Studio''\n</ref> Murray wanted funding for his independent film ''My Dog Zero'', so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. He presented a pencil test to [[Nickelodeon]], which afterward became interested in buying and financing the show. Murray had never worked in television before.<ref name=\"harrington\"/> The industry was coming out of a \"[[Animation in the United States in the television era#Commercialization and counterculture|rough period]]\" and Murray wanted to \"shake things up a bit\".<ref name=\"awn\"/>\n\n[[Linda Simensky]], then in charge of animation development in Nickelodeon, described the [[Nicktoons]] lineup and concept to Murray. He originally felt skepticism towards the concept of creating a Nicktoon as he disliked television cartoons. Simensky told him that Nicktoons differed from other cartoons. He then told her that he believed that ''My Dog Zero'' would not work as a cartoon. He then researched Nickelodeon at the library and found that Nickelodeon's \"attitude was different than regular TV\".<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/> The cable network providers were \"making their own rules\": for example, Murray stated that he \"didn't write for children\", which the executives were fine with.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> Murray was unsure at first, but was inspired by independent animation around him, such as Animation Celebration and [[MTV]]'s ''[[Liquid Television]]'', and gave the network a shot.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> At the time, Nickelodeon was selling itself as a network-based as much around the edge as around kids' entertainment. It aimed to appeal to college students and parents as much as children.<ref name=\"theavclub\"/>\n\nMurray developed the Rocko character after visiting a zoo in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] and coming across a wallaby that seemed to be oblivious to the chaos around him.<ref name=\"awn\"/> Murray combed through his sketchbooks, developed the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' concept, and submitted it to Nickelodeon, believing that the concept would likely be rejected. Murray felt they would not like the pilot, and he would just collect his sum and begin funding his next independent film.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> According to Murray, around three or four months later he had \"forgotten about\" the concept and was working on ''My Dog Zero'' when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for ''My Dog Zero''.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\">\"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/murray.html Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life]\", ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref> On his website he describes ''My Dog Zero'' as \"that film that Linda Simensky saw which led me to ''Rocko''.\"<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100309032237/http://www.joemurraystudio.com/indie/indie.shtml Independent Filmwork]\", ''[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] Studio''</ref> \"Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic\" was originally written as the pilot; the executives decided that [[Heffer Wolfe]], one of the characters, would be \"a little too weird for test audiences\". Murray, instead of removing Heffer from \"Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic\", decided to write \"Trash-O-Madness\" as the pilot episode.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/>\n\nIn the original series pilot, Rocko was colored yellow. His color was changed when a toy merchandising company informed Nick they were interested in marketing toys but did not want to market Rocko because \"they already had a yellow character\". Murray changed Rocko's color to beige, but after the pilot aired, the company opted out of producing toys for the series, so the color change was pointless. When the series was in development prior to the release of the first episode, the series had the title ''The Rocko Show''.<ref name=\"Sumares\">\"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/unknowns/ A Bit of Trivia From Paul Sumares]\", ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref>\n\nIn November 1992, two months prior to the production of season 1 of ''Rocko's Modern Life'', Murray's first wife committed suicide.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080629041444/http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?p=135 June 16, 2008]\".

Since Nickelodeon did not have an animation studio, it had to contract out to other studios. After incidents with ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' creator [[John Kricfalusi]], Nickelodeon began not to trust its creators as much and began to form its own studio, Games Animation.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> However, Murray recalls that they were still able to get a lot done independently. Murray has likened the independence to that of \"Termite Terrace\" ([[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]) from the 1930s. As Nickelodeon began to have more and more success with its animation cartoons,  Murray said the \"Termite Terrace\" mentality was not working as much.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> Producer Mary Harrington made the move from New York City to Los Angeles to set up Games Animation, in order to produce ''Rocko's Modern Life''.

If he liked the story premises, the writers produced full outlines from the premises. Outlines approved by both him and Nickelodeon became ''Rocko's Modern Life'' episodes.

Instead of a finished script, the animators usually received a three-page outline, requiring them to come up with a majority of the gags and dialogue.

The second version of the theme song was a slightly remixed version of the first and was used for episode 8. Version 2 had high-pitched, distorted voices in the chorus. The third version of the theme song was performed by [[Kate Pierson]] and [[Fred Schneider]] from [[The B-52's]]. They performed the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' theme song for the rest of the series.\n\nAt first, Murray wanted Paul Sumares to perform the theme song since Sumares created most of the music found in ''My Dog Zero''. Murray wanted the same style in ''My Dog Zero'' exhibited in ''Rocko's Modern Life''. Nickelodeon wanted a person with more experience.<ref name=\"Sumares\"/> According to Sumares, believing for the request to be a long shot, Murray asked for [[Danny Elfman]] and felt stunned when Nickelodeon decided to honor his request by asking Elfman to perform.<ref name=\"Sumares\"/> According to Murray, Elfman, his first choice, was booked.

The series centers on the surreal life of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] Australian-immigrant [[wallaby]]<!--Do not change. Rocko is referred to as a wallaby, despite constantly being called \"Kangaroo Boy\".--> named [[Rocko]] and his friends: the eccentric steer<!--Do not change, despite the running gag of everyone mistaking Heff for a cow, he always corrects them as \"steer\".--> [[Heffer Wolfe]], the neurotic turtle [[Filburt Shellbach|Filburt]], and Rocko's faithful dog [[Spunky (Rocko's Modern Life)|Spunky]]. It is set in the fictional town of O-Town. Throughout its run, this show was [[controversial]] for its [[adult humor]], including [[double entendre]], [[innuendo]], and [[satirical]] social commentary, similar to ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''.\n\nMurray created the title character for an unpublished comic book series in the late 1980s, and later reluctantly pitched the series to Nickelodeon, who were looking for edgier cartoonists for their then-new [[Nicktoons]]. The network gave the staff a large amount of creative freedom, with the writers targeting both children and adults. The show premiered on September 18, 1993, and ended on November 24, 1996, totaling four seasons and 52 episodes. A [[Television special|special]], entitled ''[[Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling]]'', was [[Streaming media|digitally released]] on [[Netflix]] on August 9, 2019.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NickRewind/status/1151114646767771649|title=Rocko is still living a MODERN life in the Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling movie coming to @netflix 8/9pic.twitter.com/G3Ms8eJgAT|last=NickRewind|date=2019-07-16|website=@NickRewind|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe show launched the careers of voice actors [[Carlos Alazraqui]] and [[Tom Kenny]]. After the show's cancellation, much of the staff regrouped to work on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', created by ''Rocko''{{'}}s creative director [[Stephen Hillenburg]].\n\n==Premise==\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Rocko's Modern Life characters}}\n''Rocko's Modern Life'' follows the life of an easily frightened Australian immigrant [[wallaby]]<!--Do not change. Rocko is referred to as a wallaby, despite constantly being called \"Kangaroo Boy\".--> named [[Rocko]] (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]), who encounters various dilemmas and situations regarding otherwise mundane aspects of life. His best friends are: [[Heffer Wolfe]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), a fat and enthusiastic steer<!--Do not change, despite the running gag of everyone mistaking Heff for a cow, he always corrects them as \"steer\".-->; [[Filburt]] ([[Mr. Lawrence]]), a neurotic turtle who often feels awkward or disturbed; and his faithful dog [[Spunky (Rocko's Modern Life)|Spunky]] (Alazraqui). Living next door to Rocko is a middle-aged couple, [[Ed Bighead]] ([[Charlie Adler]]), a cynical and cantankerous toad<!--They are always referred to as toads on the show, not frogs. Do not change.--> who despises Rocko; and his compassionate and more friendly wife Bev (Adler).\n\nAll of the characters in ''Rocko's Modern Life'' are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals of varying species, the vast majority of whom are mentally unstable. Murray said that he matched personalities of his characters to the various animals in the series to form a social [[caricature]].<ref name=\"CNMurrayInterview\"/>\n\n===Setting===\n''Rocko's Modern Life'' is set in a generic fictional American town called O-Town, located near the [[Great Lakes]]. Places in the town include: Chokey Chicken (later renamed \"Chewy Chicken\" due to the former name referring to [[masturbation]]), a parody of [[KFC]] and a favorite restaurant/hang-out place for Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt; Conglom-O Corporation, a [[megacorporation]] with the slogan \"We own you\" that owns everything in town; [[Hell|Heck]], a place of eternal torment run by [[Satan|Peaches]] where \"bad people\" go when they die; Holl-o-Wood, a town that resembles [[Hollywood]]; and Kind of a Lot O' Comics, a [[comic book]] store owned by a cruel toad named Mr. Smitty, where Rocko works.\n\nMany of the locations in ''Rocko's Modern Life'' have the letter \"O\" in them; for example, O-Town and Conglom-O Corporation. When asked about the use of \"O\" in his show, Murray said:\n{{quote|I always got a big kick out of the businesses that were 'House-O-Paint', or 'Ton-O-Noodles', because their names seemed to homogenize what they sold, and strip the products of true individuality and stress volume ... and we all know, the American dream is volume! So what better company to create volume than 'Conglom-O', and since a majority of the town worked at Conglom-O, it should be called 'O' Town. I also wanted the town to be 'anytown' USA, and I used to love sports players with a big ZERO on their back. It was funny to me.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/>}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Joe Murray publicity shot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Rocko's Modern Life'' creator Joe Murray.]]\nOriginally, the character appeared in an unpublished comic book titled ''Travis''. Murray tried selling the comic book in the late 1980s, between illustrating jobs and did not find success in getting it into production. Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks. He described the early 1990s animation atmosphere as \"ripe for this kind of project. We took some chances that would be hard to do in these current times (the 1990s)\".<ref name=\"MurrayRockoHome\">\n\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110206001351/http://www.joemurraystudio.com/tv/rocko.shtml Rocko's Modern Life]\", ''[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] Studio''\n</ref> Murray wanted funding for his independent film ''My Dog Zero'', so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. He presented a pencil test to [[Nickelodeon]], which afterward became interested in buying and financing the show. Murray had never worked in television before.<ref name=\"harrington\"/> The industry was coming out of a \"[[Animation in the United States in the television era#Commercialization and counterculture|rough period]]\" and Murray wanted to \"shake things up a bit\".<ref name=\"awn\"/>\n\n[[Linda Simensky]], then in charge of animation development in Nickelodeon, described the [[Nicktoons]] lineup and concept to Murray. He originally felt skepticism towards the concept of creating a Nicktoon as he disliked television cartoons. Simensky told him that Nicktoons differed from other cartoons. He then told her that he believed that ''My Dog Zero'' would not work as a cartoon. He then researched Nickelodeon at the library and found that Nickelodeon's \"attitude was different than regular TV\".<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/> The cable network providers were \"making their own rules\": for example, Murray stated that he \"didn't write for children\", which the executives were fine with.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> Murray was unsure at first, but was inspired by independent animation around him, such as Animation Celebration and [[MTV]]'s ''[[Liquid Television]]'', and gave the network a shot.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> At the time, Nickelodeon was selling itself as a network-based as much around the edge as around kids' entertainment. It aimed to appeal to college students and parents as much as children.<ref name=\"theavclub\"/>\n\nMurray developed the Rocko character after visiting a zoo in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] and coming across a wallaby that seemed to be oblivious to the chaos around him.<ref name=\"awn\"/> Murray combed through his sketchbooks, developed the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' concept, and submitted it to Nickelodeon, believing that the concept would likely be rejected. Murray felt they would not like the pilot, and he would just collect his sum and begin funding his next independent film.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> According to Murray, around three or four months later he had \"forgotten about\" the concept and was working on ''My Dog Zero'' when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for ''My Dog Zero''.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\">\"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/murray.html Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life]\", ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref> On his website he describes ''My Dog Zero'' as \"that film that Linda Simensky saw which led me to ''Rocko''.\"<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100309032237/http://www.joemurraystudio.com/indie/indie.shtml Independent Filmwork]\", ''[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] Studio''</ref> \"Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic\" was originally written as the pilot; the executives decided that [[Heffer Wolfe]], one of the characters, would be \"a little too weird for test audiences\". Murray, instead of removing Heffer from \"Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic\", decided to write \"Trash-O-Madness\" as the pilot episode.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/>\n\nIn the original series pilot, Rocko was colored yellow. His color was changed when a toy merchandising company informed Nick they were interested in marketing toys but did not want to market Rocko because \"they already had a yellow character\". Murray changed Rocko's color to beige, but after the pilot aired, the company opted out of producing toys for the series, so the color change was pointless.

They performed the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' theme song for the rest of the series.\n\nAt first, Murray wanted Paul Sumares to perform the theme song since Sumares created most of the music found in ''My Dog Zero''.

V. Satish always wanted to make a difference to the society and the surrounding living conditions through all his endeavours. All his ventures, be it films, book promotion or any other avocation that he undertook, had an underlying mission. With the incorporation of his real estate organization, one of his most desired dreams started to be fulfilled as he was successful in transforming the quality of lives of several thousands of families.\n\nAlthough he has been instrumental in homing teeming thousands and has baffled customers\u2019 expectations in increasing their affordability for homes, his vision is housing for all.\u00a0 He firmly believes that proper housing is the birthright of every individual for which he works relentlessly in making his long-drawn vision a reality.\n\n== Philanthropic Activities ==\nAlong with his professional life, Dr. Satish keeps himself engaged in various social work and philanthropic activities through the [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]]<nowiki/>s he founded, namely Aashra Foundation and K V S Fans Charitable trust. These two organizations regularly conduct blood donation camps, eye cataract surgeries, food and cloth donation, and other charitable activities which have made a marked difference in the lives of many. \n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
