Affluent districts are associated with a modified [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) accent, reflecting their traditional popularity with [[upper middle class|upper middle]] and [[upper-class]] residents which has spread throughout more social classes broadly in rural areas with commuting access to London.  Less affluent areas have traditionally mainstream London accents (that is, variants of the [[Estuary English|Estuary English accent]]) that grade into southern rural outside urban areas.<ref name=wells/>\n\n===Regional dialect levelling (\"supralocalisation\") in the South-East of England===\nCommentators report widespread homogenisation in the south-east (Kerswill & Williams 2000; Britain 2002).

But the diphthong is retained before inflectional endings, so that ''board'' and ''pause'' often contrast with ''bored'' {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0254\u0259d]}} and ''paws'' {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u0254\u0259z]}}.\n* lengthening of {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} in words such as ''man'', ''sad'', ''bag'', ''hand'' (cf. ''can'', ''had'', ''lad''): split of {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} into two phonemes {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} and {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}}.  See [[Phonological history of English short A#Bad\u2013lad split|bad\u2013lad split]].\n* an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/\u0259\u028a/}} before \"dark L\" {{IPA|([\u026b])}}, namely {{IPA|[\u0252\u028a]}}, for example ''whole'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0252\u028a\u026b]}} versus ''holy'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0259\u028ali]}}. But the {{IPA|[\u0252\u028a]}} is retained when the addition of a suffix turns the \"dark L\" clear, so that ''wholly'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0252\u028ali]}} can contrast with ''holy''.\n\nIt is also common{{fact|date=March 2015}} to hear young Londoners drop \"(to) the\" from sentences related to going places (such as: Do you want to go cinema?/Do you want to go West End?).\n\n====Sloane-speak and Rah (slang)====\n{{See also|Rah (slang)}}\n'''Sloane-speak''' or '''Sloaney-speech''' is spoken by the [[upper middle class|upper middle]] and [[upper class]]es, ultralocalised in [[Inner London|Inner South-West and West London]] by a range of inhabitants of the very expensive private housing in and around [[Sloane Street]] and [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[Mayfair]] and alongside [[Marylebone High Street]].<ref>These were also singled out as the districts lived in by the subjects of the fly-on-the-wall documentary ''[[Made in Chelsea]]'' (2012)</ref> The speakers of Sloaney are sometimes defined as [[Sloane Ranger]]s.  Levelling aspects of the speech of the young aristocracy were heightened in the early 1980s by the '[[Princess Diana]]' accent and effect yet drew upon [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] and historic vocabulary to form a distinct Sloane-speak of the young and wealthy soon dubbed '[[Sloane Ranger]]s'. Here aristocrats' clipped Received Pronunciation was modified in this particular [[speech community]] as the young upper and upper-middle classes, like Diana and contemporaries, increasingly settled as singles in the '[[muesli|muesli belt]]' round Sloane Square on the border of [[Belgravia]] and [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], Chelsea's [[Kings Road|King's Road]] into [[Fulham]] and even in expensive parts of [[Putney]], [[Richmond, London]], [[Wandsworth]] and [[Battersea]].  Sloanies followed the 1960s fashion boom of [[Kings Road|King's Road]] and became lesser cultural icons for a time in fashion, as well as seeking out idiosyncratic cultural pursuits and language.\n\nFeatures, whether affected or throwback to particular aristocratic shorthands include 'jah' for yes; \"(s)he's rairly, rairly (really, really) nice', or shortened ('Nick's' for [[Harvey Nichols]]; 'Rods' for [[Harrods]]; 'Fred's' for [[Fortnum and Mason|Fortnum and Mason's]]).  Hyperbole was for a period rife ('frightfully', 'ghastly', 'appalling', 'thanks awfully'), but subject to influences from more [[wikt:demotic|demotic]] speech of the capital, particularly towards its fringes.\"\n\nReflecting national [[upper class]] moves towards slightly less formal pronunciation,<ref>See [[Received Pronunciation#Historical variation|Received Pronunciation: Historical Variation]]</ref> or indeed the middle-dialect influence of Sloane-speak, end-of-sentence glottal stop and final-t {{IPAc-en|d}} sounds came into the speech of younger Royalty: for instance in the speech of Diana and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]]; and vocoids for \"l\" as in ''{{IPA|mi\u0289[\u026b]k}}''; all juxtaposed against borrowed vocabulary from opposing dialects such as 'bog' (''toilet'') and 'yonks'\n(''a long time'').\n\nTo many middle-class Londoners, however, the often [[drawl]]ed pronunciation of the Sloane Rangers was deemed as 'marked' or 'affected' as the Queen's, so closely identified was with a particular social group: the '''rah-rah''' accent and dialect, named in 1982, coupled with the most obscure vocabulary became [[Rah (slang)]], synonymous with [[snobbery]]. The once trendy [[rah (slang)|rah]] concepts faded into fashion oblivion during the [[Cool Britannia]] decade but in the late 2000s staged a comeback with slightly different, edgier, rougher forms continuing to develop:\n\n*''\"Sloane-speak has grown edgier. [[Nancy Mitford]]'s vocabulary was updated last year by a wealth of new words compiled into a dictionary by Olivia Stewart-Liberty and Peter York (author of the original Sloane Ranger Handbook). But the past few months have yielded telling additions: \"disrevelled\" refers to a Sloane's appearance after a heavy night at Boujis; \"dorleybowl\" is a bad haircut (in frequent usage, as you can imagine); \"squippy\" is the perpetual state of the Sloane (it means \"hyperactive\"). Then there's \"jollop\" (to go out and enjoy oneself) and \"floordrobe\", the place young Sloanes choose to store their clothes \u2013 i.e., on the floor. Oddly, there don't seem to be any jolly,  japeish terms for \"the workplace\", \"grocery shopping\" and \"bill paying\"\".''<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3637343/OK,-yo!-Sloane-speak's-gone-street.html OK, yo!

It is characterised by a number of phonological differences from RP:\n* The [[Dental consonant|dental]] [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|[\u03b8, \u00f0]}} are [[Phonological history of English consonants#''TH''-fronting|replaced]] with [[labiodental]] {{IPA|[f, v]}}, for example ''think'' {{IPA|[f\u026a\u014bk]}}\n* The [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/a\u028a/}} is monophthongized to {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}}, for example ''south'' {{IPA|[s\u00e6\u02d0f]}}\n* [[Phonological history of English consonants#''H''-dropping|''H''-dropping]], for example ''house'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0s]}}\n* [[T-glottalization|Replacement]] of {{IPA|[t]}} in the middle or end of a word with a glottal stop; for example ''hit'' {{IPA|[\u026a\u0294]}}\n* [[Diphthong]] shift of {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} to {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} (for example ''beet'' {{IPA|[b\u0259i\u0294]}}), {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} to {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} (for example ''bait'' {{IPA|[ba\u026a\u0294]}}), {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} to {{IPA|[\u0252\u026a]}} (for example ''bite'' {{IPA|[b\u0252\u026a\u0294]}}), and {{IPA|[\u0254\u026a]}} to {{IPA|[o\u026a]}} (for example, ''boy'' {{IPA|[bo\u026a]}}.\n* [[Speech production|Vocalisation]] of {{IPA|[\u026b]}} (dark L) to {{IPA|[\u026f]}}, for example, ''people'' {{IPA|[p\u0259ip\u026f]}}\n\n====Multicultural London English====\n{{Main|Multicultural London English}}\n'''Multicultural London English''' (abbreviated '''MLE'''), colloquially called '''Blockney''' or '''Jafaican''', is a [[dialect]] (and/or [[sociolect]]) of [[English language|English]] that emerged in the late 20th century.  It is spoken mainly by [[youths]] in [[inner London]].\n\n====Jamaican-London====\nThe speech of [[Jamaica]]ns, or children of Jamaican parents, in London shows interesting combinations of the Jamaican accent with the London accent. For example, in [[Jamaican English]], {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is replaced by {{IPA|[t]}}, for example ''both'' {{IPA|/bo\u02d0t/}}. In London, word-final {{IPA|/t/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, as mentioned above. In Jamaican-London speech, glottalization of {{IPA|/t/}} applies also to {{IPA|/t/}} from {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, for example ''both of them'' {{IPA|[b\u028c\u028a\u0294 \u0259 dem]}}. [[Hypercorrection]]s like {{IPA|[f\u028a\u03b8]}} for ''foot'' are also heard from Jamaicans.<ref>[[John C. Wells]] ''Jamaican pronunciation in London'' The [[Philological Society]] (1973).</ref> [[John C. Wells]]'s dissertation, ''Jamaican pronunciation in London'', was published by the Philological Society in 1973.\n\n===Essex===\n'''[[Essex]]''', is usually associated with Estuary English, mainly in urban areas receiving an influx of East London migrants. The non-urban Essex accent, generally found in the north of the county, is more closely related to those of East Anglia. Residents of places within Essex such as [[Basildon]], [[Billericay]] and [[Grays, Essex|Grays]] are more likely to have an accent similar to the traditional '[[Cockney]]' accent, due to the proximity to East London and East End migration to these areas since WWII.\n\n===Estuary===\n{{Main|Estuary English}}\n'''Estuary English''' is the name given to an accent (or group of accents) that may informally be considered a compromise between Cockney and RP. It retains some aspects of Cockney, such as the [[Speech production|vocalisation]] of {{IPA|[\u026b]}} ([[dark L]]) to {{IPA|[o]}}, and [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-coalescence|''yod''-coalescence]] in [[lexical stress|stress]]ed [[syllable]]s (for example, ''duty'' {{IPA|[d\u0292\u0289\u02d0\u0294i]}}) and replacement of {{IPA|[t]}} with {{IPA|[\u0294]}} (the [[glottal stop]]) in weak positions, or occasionally with d).\n\n===East Hertfordshire===\nThe east [[Hertfordshire|Herts]] accent traditionally spoken is akin to a native central/north Essex rural accent. The largest towns in particular have the diverse [[sociolect]] variants of [[Received Pronunciation]] and [[Estuary English]] as seen in London, with smaller settlements tending towards the traditional dialects or variants of RP.\n\n===West Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire===\nBefore the 21st Century, West Herts and [[Buckinghamshire]] tended to have [[r-colored vowel|r-coloured vowel]]s; for instance, here the established dialects made a distinction between the words ''farther'' and ''father'' ({{IPA|/f\u0251\u02d0\u02b4\u00f0\u0259\u02b4}} and {{IPA|/f\u0251\u02d0\u00f0\u0259\u02b4/}}). However, in recent times, strong influences have come from London's [[Estuary English]], thanks to the influx of post-[[World War II]] migrants from across London, and thus [[Estuary English]] is now the norm across West Herts and [[Buckinghamshire]] (though some of the older dialect can be heard in older generations, particularly in more rural areas).<ref name=wells/>\n\n===Hampshire===\n[[Hampshire]] is often missed in dialect definitions and placed on borderlines between South East and West England. In country areas, the local accent can still be heard for example by [[John Arlott]], [[Lord Denning]] and [[Reg Presley]] although the use of the v sound in \"field\" has declined. Since the 1960s, particularly in Andover and Basingstoke, the local accent has changed reflecting the arrival of East Londoners relocated by London County Council. It can be argued that Hampshire is a borderline county moving East, linguistically.\n\n====Portsmouth====\nThe traditional [[Portsmouth]] dialect (affectionately known as the [[Portsmouth|Pompey]] dialect, and less favourably as Just Chav Talk) is an oddity and somewhat an isolate. It stands well apart both structurally and phonetically from all other local English varieties around it. The traditional origin story is that the Dockyards attracted an influx of East Londoners at the turn of the 20th century and the accent is based in \"Dockyard slang\". Though structurally it is based around an East London model, it has retained a lot of traditional Hampshire features. Whilst it follows the consonant rules of Estuary English closely, the vowel sounds are quite different. The dialect is not a recent phenomenon, and can be heard in the speech of local people in their nineties.  The surrounding accents geographically are quite different, and few contain as many of the \"Estuary-isms\" found in the Pompey dialect and some of those may actually originate from Portsmouth, rather than Estuary English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthsociety.org.uk/news2003/pompeyspeakcomments.htm|title=Portsmouth Society - Pompey as she is spoke (Pompeyspeak) - readers' comments|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2008/october/do-you-speak-pompey|title=Do You Speak Pompey?|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1317474/School-STAFF-English-lessons-bad-slang-habits-dont-hamper-pupils.html|title=School STAFF to get English lessons so bad slang habits don't hamper pupils|date=3 October 2010|work=Mail Online}}</ref>\n\n===Bedfordshire===\nAs with neighbouring [[Hertfordshire]], [[Bedfordshire]] has a variety of accents.\n\nIn the [[Luton/Dunstable Urban Area]], the accent is similar to a London accent, and it is often mistaken as one. This is because of the overflow of Londoners and their subsequent generations in the area. The Lutonian accent is not as strong as an accent from [[Essex]].\n\nIn Mid Bedfordshire the more traditional accent of the area is still held. Especially by those of an older generation, or in very remote areas.\n\nWhile in North Bedfordshire especially near the border with [[Northamptonshire]] it can be argued that the dialect is one which sounds more like [[East Midlands English]], [[Bedford]] itself is linguistically diverse, reflecting the more varied demographics of the town (compared with the surrounding villages). A typical Bedford accent is more similar to a Londonian Luton or Dunstable accent, due largely to movement of people from these places to Bedford.\n\n===Kent===\n[[File:Foot-strut split.svg|thumb|Foot-strut split [[isogloss]]]]\nAccents today are a cross between [[Estuary English]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] which both evolve over time and are becoming significantly more similar; where towards the former, accents have been strongly influenced by proximity to towns in the [[London Gateway]] involved in heavy trades, fishing and repairs and merchant sides of the [[Royal Navy]], which was concentrated in [[Greenwich]] and [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]].  This corresponds to the name of the dialect which refers to the [[Thames Estuary]].  'H dropping' is in general rare, as in the other [[Home Counties]], but 't dropping' or substitution with a weaker vowel is common.<ref name=wells>{{cite book | author=[[John C. Wells|Wells, John C.]] | title=Accents of English | location=[[Cambridge]] | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1982 | isbn=0-521-24225-8 <!--(vol. 3)-->| pages=400\u201370}}</ref>\n\nHowever of particular note, one vowel usage is unique to West Kent which is the {{IPAblink|\u0252}} realization of the {{IPAc-en|\u028c}} phoneme.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}.\n\n===Surrey===\nA traditional Surrey accent again has [[r-colored vowel|r-coloured vowel]]s while being entirely [[nonrhotic]].\n\nEstuary English is common throughout the county, particularly in the northern areas bordering on London, although many large settlements further south into Surrey, such as Guildford and Woking, share in variants of estuary English. Furthest north into Surrey is the borough of Spelthorne, where the accent is indistinguishable (as formerly part of  [[Middlesex]]) from the London accent due to it sharing borders with the London boroughs of Hounslow, Richmond-upon-Thames and Hillingdon.\n\n===Jafaican===\n{{Main|Jafaican}}\n'''Jafaican''', also known as '''Tikkiny''' or less commonly '''\"Hood-Chat\"''' is part accent, part [[dialect]], from around the mid-1990s, and influenced not only by British black urban culture, but by [[rap music]]. This variant is used by the youth of all races as a 'street' patois, [[American English]] influences (such as the greeting \"Yo!\"), but also [[Caribbean]] patterns such as \"aks\" (rather than \"ask\"). The dialect is used mainly by young people, regardless of racial background. It can be heard in many parts of England, but especially around London.\n\n==Rural South and West Country==\n{{Main|West Country dialects}}\n\nThis family of similar strongly [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] accents, now perceived as rural, originally extended across much of southern England south of the [[broad A]] [[isogloss]], but they are now most often found west of a line roughly from [[Shropshire]] via [[Oxfordshire]]. Their shared characteristics have been caricatured as [[Mummerset]].\n\nThey persist most strongly in areas that remain largely rural with a largely indigenous population, particularly the [[West Country]]. In many other areas they are declining because of RP and Estuary accents moving to the area; for instance, strong [[Isle of Wight#Language and dialect|Isle of Wight accents]] tend to be more prevalent in older speakers.\n\nAs well as rhoticity, here are common features of West County accents:\n* The diphthong {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} (as in ''price'') realised as {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} or {{IPA|[\u0254\u026a]}}, sounding more like the diphthong in [[Received Pronunciation]] ''choice''.\n* The diphthong {{IPA|/a\u028a/}} (as in ''mouth'') realised as {{IPA|[\u025b\u028a]}}, with a starting point close to the vowel in [[Received Pronunciation]] ''dress''.\n* The vowel {{IPA|/\u0252/}} (as in ''lot'') realised as an unrounded vowel {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, as in many forms of [[American English]].\n* In traditional West Country accents, the voiceless [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/s/, /f/, /\u03b8/, /\u0283/}} (as in ''sat, farm, think, shed'' respectively) are often voiced to {{IPA|[z], [v], [\u00f0], [\u0292]}}, giving pronunciations like \"Zummerzet\" for ''Somerset'', \"varm\" for ''farm'', \"zhure\" for ''sure'', etc.\n* In the [[Bristol]] area a vowel at the end of a word is often followed by an intrusive dark l, {{IPA|[\u026b]}}. Hence the old joke about the three Bristolian sisters Evil, Idle, and Normal (written Eva, Ida, and Norma). ''L'' is pronounced darkly where it is present, too, which means that in Bristolian rendering, 'idea' and 'ideal' are homophones.\n* [[H-dropping|''H''-dropping]] in [[South Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], \"''Berry 'Aid''\" for [[Berry Head]] (in [[Brixham]], South Devon)\n\nIn traditional Southern rural accents, the voiceless [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/s/, /f/, /\u03b8/, /\u0283/}} always remain voiceless, which is the main difference from West Country accents.\n\n==East Anglia==\n{{Main|East Anglian English}}\nFeatures which can be found in '''[[East Anglia]]n English''' (especially in [[Norfolk]]) include:\n* [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-dropping|''Yod''-dropping]] after all consonants: ''beautiful'' may be pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0289\u02d0\u0294\u026af\u0259l]}}, often represented as \"bootiful\" or \"bewtiful\", ''huge'' as {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0289\u02d0d\u0292]}}, and so on.<ref>There are more details on {{cite web|url=http://www.norfolkdialect.com/trudgill.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222181929/http://www.norfolkdialect.com/trudgill.html |archivedate=22 February 2008 |df=dmy }}, written by Norfolk-born linguist [[Peter Trudgill]]</ref>\n* Absence of the [[Phonological history of English vowels#Long mid mergers|long mid merger]] between [[Early Modern English]] {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} (as in ''toe, moan, road, boat'') and {{IPA|/\u0254\u028a/}} (as in ''tow, mown, rowed'').

But the diphthong is retained before inflectional endings, so that ''board'' and ''pause'' often contrast with ''bored'' {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0254\u0259d]}} and ''paws'' {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u0254\u0259z]}}.\n* lengthening of {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} in words such as ''man'', ''sad'', ''bag'', ''hand'' (cf.

Levelling aspects of the speech of the young aristocracy were heightened in the early 1980s by the '[[Princess Diana]]' accent and effect yet drew upon [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] and historic vocabulary to form a distinct Sloane-speak of the young and wealthy soon dubbed '[[Sloane Ranger]]s'. Here aristocrats' clipped Received Pronunciation was modified in this particular [[speech community]] as the young upper and upper-middle classes, like Diana and contemporaries, increasingly settled as singles in the '[[muesli|muesli belt]]' round Sloane Square on the border of [[Belgravia]] and [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], Chelsea's [[Kings Road|King's Road]] into [[Fulham]] and even in expensive parts of [[Putney]], [[Richmond, London]], [[Wandsworth]] and [[Battersea]].  Sloanies followed the 1960s fashion boom of [[Kings Road|King's Road]] and became lesser cultural icons for a time in fashion, as well as seeking out idiosyncratic cultural pursuits and language.\n\nFeatures, whether affected or throwback to particular aristocratic shorthands include 'jah' for yes; \"(s)he's rairly, rairly (really, really) nice', or shortened ('Nick's' for [[Harvey Nichols]]; 'Rods' for [[Harrods]]; 'Fred's' for [[Fortnum and Mason|Fortnum and Mason's]]).  Hyperbole was for a period rife ('frightfully', 'ghastly', 'appalling', 'thanks awfully'), but subject to influences from more [[wikt:demotic|demotic]] speech of the capital, particularly towards its fringes.\"\n\nReflecting national [[upper class]] moves towards slightly less formal pronunciation,<ref>See [[Received Pronunciation#Historical variation|Received Pronunciation: Historical Variation]]</ref> or indeed the middle-dialect influence of Sloane-speak, end-of-sentence glottal stop and final-t {{IPAc-en|d}} sounds came into the speech of younger Royalty: for instance in the speech of Diana and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]]; and vocoids for \"l\" as in ''{{IPA|mi\u0289[\u026b]k}}''; all juxtaposed against borrowed vocabulary from opposing dialects such as 'bog' (''toilet'') and 'yonks'\n(''a long time'').\n\nTo many middle-class Londoners, however, the often [[drawl]]ed pronunciation of the Sloane Rangers was deemed as 'marked' or 'affected' as the Queen's, so closely identified was with a particular social group: the '''rah-rah''' accent and dialect, named in 1982, coupled with the most obscure vocabulary became [[Rah (slang)]], synonymous with [[snobbery]]. The once trendy [[rah (slang)|rah]] concepts faded into fashion oblivion during the [[Cool Britannia]] decade but in the late 2000s staged a comeback with slightly different, edgier, rougher forms continuing to develop:\n\n*''\"Sloane-speak has grown edgier. [[Nancy Mitford]]'s vocabulary was updated last year by a wealth of new words compiled into a dictionary by Olivia Stewart-Liberty and Peter York (author of the original Sloane Ranger Handbook). But the past few months have yielded telling additions: \"disrevelled\" refers to a Sloane's appearance after a heavy night at Boujis; \"dorleybowl\" is a bad haircut (in frequent usage, as you can imagine); \"squippy\" is the perpetual state of the Sloane (it means \"hyperactive\"). Then there's \"jollop\" (to go out and enjoy oneself) and \"floordrobe\", the place young Sloanes choose to store their clothes \u2013 i.e., on the floor. Oddly, there don't seem to be any jolly,  japeish terms for \"the workplace\", \"grocery shopping\" and \"bill paying\"\".''<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3637343/OK,-yo!-Sloane-speak's-gone-street.html OK, yo!

It is characterised by a number of phonological differences from RP:\n* The [[Dental consonant|dental]] [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|[\u03b8, \u00f0]}} are [[Phonological history of English consonants#''TH''-fronting|replaced]] with [[labiodental]] {{IPA|[f, v]}}, for example ''think'' {{IPA|[f\u026a\u014bk]}}\n* The [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/a\u028a/}} is monophthongized to {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}}, for example ''south'' {{IPA|[s\u00e6\u02d0f]}}\n* [[Phonological history of English consonants#''H''-dropping|''H''-dropping]], for example ''house'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0s]}}\n* [[T-glottalization|Replacement]] of {{IPA|[t]}} in the middle or end of a word with a glottal stop; for example ''hit'' {{IPA|[\u026a\u0294]}}\n* [[Diphthong]] shift of {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} to {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} (for example ''beet'' {{IPA|[b\u0259i\u0294]}}), {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} to {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} (for example ''bait'' {{IPA|[ba\u026a\u0294]}}), {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} to {{IPA|[\u0252\u026a]}} (for example ''bite'' {{IPA|[b\u0252\u026a\u0294]}}), and {{IPA|[\u0254\u026a]}} to {{IPA|[o\u026a]}} (for example, ''boy'' {{IPA|[bo\u026a]}}.\n* [[Speech production|Vocalisation]] of {{IPA|[\u026b]}} (dark L) to {{IPA|[\u026f]}}, for example, ''people'' {{IPA|[p\u0259ip\u026f]}}\n\n====Multicultural London English====\n{{Main|Multicultural London English}}\n'''Multicultural London English''' (abbreviated '''MLE'''), colloquially called '''Blockney''' or '''Jafaican''', is a [[dialect]] (and/or [[sociolect]]) of [[English language|English]] that emerged in the late 20th century.  It is spoken mainly by [[youths]] in [[inner London]].\n\n====Jamaican-London====\nThe speech of [[Jamaica]]ns, or children of Jamaican parents, in London shows interesting combinations of the Jamaican accent with the London accent. For example, in [[Jamaican English]], {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is replaced by {{IPA|[t]}}, for example ''both'' {{IPA|/bo\u02d0t/}}. In London, word-final {{IPA|/t/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, as mentioned above. In Jamaican-London speech, glottalization of {{IPA|/t/}} applies also to {{IPA|/t/}} from {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, for example ''both of them'' {{IPA|[b\u028c\u028a\u0294 \u0259 dem]}}. [[Hypercorrection]]s like {{IPA|[f\u028a\u03b8]}} for ''foot'' are also heard from Jamaicans.<ref>[[John C. Wells]] ''Jamaican pronunciation in London'' The [[Philological Society]] (1973).</ref> [[John C. Wells]]'s dissertation, ''Jamaican pronunciation in London'', was published by the Philological Society in 1973.\n\n===Essex===\n'''[[Essex]]''', is usually associated with Estuary English, mainly in urban areas receiving an influx of East London migrants. The non-urban Essex accent, generally found in the north of the county, is more closely related to those of East Anglia. Residents of places within Essex such as [[Basildon]], [[Billericay]] and [[Grays]] are more likely to have an accent similar to the traditional '[[Cockney]]' accent, due to the proximity to East London and East End migration to these areas since WWII.\n\n===Estuary===\n{{Main|Estuary English}}\n'''Estuary English''' is the name given to an accent (or group of accents) that may informally be considered a compromise between Cockney and RP. It retains some aspects of Cockney, such as the [[Speech production|vocalisation]] of {{IPA|[\u026b]}} ([[dark L]]) to {{IPA|[o]}}, and [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-coalescence|''yod''-coalescence]] in [[lexical stress|stress]]ed [[syllable]]s (for example, ''duty'' {{IPA|[d\u0292\u0289\u02d0\u0294i]}}) and replacement of {{IPA|[t]}} with {{IPA|[\u0294]}} (the [[glottal stop]]) in weak positions, or occasionally with d).\n\n===East Hertfordshire===\nThe east [[Hertfordshire|Herts]] accent traditionally spoken is akin to a native central/north Essex rural accent. The largest towns in particular have the diverse [[sociolect]] variants of [[Received Pronunciation]] and [[Estuary English]] as seen in London, with smaller settlements tending towards the traditional dialects or variants of RP.\n\n===West Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire===\nBefore the 21st Century, West Herts and [[Buckinghamshire]] tended to have [[r-colored vowel|r-coloured vowel]]s; for instance, here the established dialects made a distinction between the words ''farther'' and ''father'' ({{IPA|/f\u0251\u02d0\u02b4\u00f0\u0259\u02b4}} and {{IPA|/f\u0251\u02d0\u00f0\u0259\u02b4/}}). However, in recent times, strong influences have come from London's [[Estuary English]], thanks to the influx of post-[[World War II]] migrants from across London, and thus [[Estuary English]] is now the norm across West Herts and [[Buckinghamshire]] (though some of the older dialect can be heard in older generations, particularly in more rural areas).<ref name=wells/>\n\n===Hampshire===\n[[Hampshire]] is often missed in dialect definitions and placed on borderlines between South East and West England. In country areas, the local accent can still be heard for example by [[John Arlott]], [[Lord Denning]] and [[Reg Presley]] although the use of the v sound in \"field\" has declined. Since the 1960s, particularly in Andover and Basingstoke, the local accent has changed reflecting the arrival of East Londoners relocated by London County Council. It can be argued that Hampshire is a borderline county moving East, linguistically.\n\n====Portsmouth====\nThe traditional [[Portsmouth]] dialect (affectionately known as the [[Portsmouth|Pompey]] dialect, and less favourably as Just Chav Talk) is an oddity and somewhat an isolate. It stands well apart both structurally and phonetically from all other local English varieties around it. The traditional origin story is that the Dockyards attracted an influx of East Londoners at the turn of the 20th century and the accent is based in \"Dockyard slang\". Though structurally it is based around an East London model, it has retained a lot of traditional Hampshire features. Whilst it follows the consonant rules of Estuary English closely, the vowel sounds are quite different. The dialect is not a recent phenomenon, and can be heard in the speech of local people in their nineties.  The surrounding accents geographically are quite different, and few contain as many of the \"Estuary-isms\" found in the Pompey dialect and some of those may actually originate from Portsmouth, rather than Estuary English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthsociety.org.uk/news2003/pompeyspeakcomments.htm|title=Portsmouth Society - Pompey as she is spoke (Pompeyspeak) - readers' comments|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2008/october/do-you-speak-pompey|title=Do You Speak Pompey?|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1317474/School-STAFF-English-lessons-bad-slang-habits-dont-hamper-pupils.html|title=School STAFF to get English lessons so bad slang habits don't hamper pupils|date=3 October 2010|work=Mail Online}}</ref>\n\n===Bedfordshire===\nAs with neighbouring [[Hertfordshire]], [[Bedfordshire]] has a variety of accents.\n\nIn the [[Luton/Dunstable Urban Area]], the accent is similar to a London accent, and it is often mistaken as one. This is because of the overflow of Londoners and their subsequent generations in the area. The Lutonian accent is not as strong as an accent from [[Essex]].\n\nIn Mid Bedfordshire the more traditional accent of the area is still held. Especially by those of an older generation, or in very remote areas.\n\nWhile in North Bedfordshire especially near the border with [[Northamptonshire]] it can be argued that the dialect is one which sounds more like [[East Midlands English]], [[Bedford]] itself is linguistically diverse, reflecting the more varied demographics of the town (compared with the surrounding villages). A typical Bedford accent is more similar to a Londonian Luton or Dunstable accent, due largely to movement of people from these places to Bedford.\n\n===Kent===\n[[File:Foot-strut split.svg|thumb|Foot-strut split [[isogloss]]]]\nAccents today are a cross between [[Estuary English]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] which both evolve over time and are becoming significantly more similar; where towards the former, accents have been strongly influenced by proximity to towns in the [[London Gateway]] involved in heavy trades, fishing and repairs and merchant sides of the [[Royal Navy]], which was concentrated in [[Greenwich]] and [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]].  This corresponds to the name of the dialect which refers to the [[Thames Estuary]].  'H dropping' is in general rare, as in the other [[Home Counties]], but 't dropping' or substitution with a weaker vowel is common.<ref name=wells>{{cite book | author=[[John C. Wells|Wells, John C.]] | title=Accents of English | location=[[Cambridge]] | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1982 | isbn=0-521-24225-8 <!--(vol. 3)-->| pages=400\u201370}}</ref>\n\nHowever of particular note, one vowel usage is unique to West Kent which is the {{IPAblink|\u0252}} realization of the {{IPAc-en|\u028c}} phoneme.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}.\n\n===Surrey===\nA traditional Surrey accent again has [[r-colored vowel|r-coloured vowel]]s while being entirely [[nonrhotic]].\n\nEstuary English is common throughout the county, particularly in the northern areas bordering on London, although many large settlements further south into Surrey, such as Guildford and Woking, share in variants of estuary English. Furthest north into Surrey is the borough of Spelthorne, where the accent is indistinguishable (as formerly part of  [[Middlesex]]) from the London accent due to it sharing borders with the London boroughs of Hounslow, Richmond-upon-Thames and Hillingdon.\n\n===Jafaican===\n{{Main|Jafaican}}\n'''Jafaican''', also known as '''Tikkiny''' or less commonly '''\"Hood-Chat\"''' is part accent, part [[dialect]], from around the mid-1990s, and influenced not only by British black urban culture, but by [[rap music]]. This variant is used by the youth of all races as a 'street' patois, [[American English]] influences (such as the greeting \"Yo!\"), but also [[Caribbean]] patterns such as \"aks\" (rather than \"ask\"). The dialect is used mainly by young people, regardless of racial background. It can be heard in many parts of England, but especially around London.\n\n==Rural South and West Country==\n{{Main|West Country dialects}}\n\nThis family of similar strongly [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] accents, now perceived as rural, originally extended across much of southern England south of the [[broad A]] [[isogloss]], but they are now most often found west of a line roughly from [[Shropshire]] via [[Oxfordshire]]. Their shared characteristics have been caricatured as [[Mummerset]].\n\nThey persist most strongly in areas that remain largely rural with a largely indigenous population, particularly the [[West Country]]. In many other areas they are declining because of RP and Estuary accents moving to the area; for instance, strong [[Isle of Wight#Language and dialect|Isle of Wight accents]] tend to be more prevalent in older speakers.\n\nAs well as rhoticity, here are common features of West County accents:\n* The diphthong {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} (as in ''price'') realised as {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} or {{IPA|[\u0254\u026a]}}, sounding more like the diphthong in [[Received Pronunciation]] ''choice''.\n* The diphthong {{IPA|/a\u028a/}} (as in ''mouth'') realised as {{IPA|[\u025b\u028a]}}, with a starting point close to the vowel in [[Received Pronunciation]] ''dress''.\n* The vowel {{IPA|/\u0252/}} (as in ''lot'') realised as an unrounded vowel {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, as in many forms of [[American English]].\n* In traditional West Country accents, the voiceless [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/s/, /f/, /\u03b8/, /\u0283/}} (as in ''sat, farm, think, shed'' respectively) are often voiced to {{IPA|[z], [v], [\u00f0], [\u0292]}}, giving pronunciations like \"Zummerzet\" for ''Somerset'', \"varm\" for ''farm'', \"zhure\" for ''sure'', etc.\n* In the [[Bristol]] area a vowel at the end of a word is often followed by an intrusive dark l, {{IPA|[\u026b]}}. Hence the old joke about the three Bristolian sisters Evil, Idle, and Normal (written Eva, Ida, and Norma). ''L'' is pronounced darkly where it is present, too, which means that in Bristolian rendering, 'idea' and 'ideal' are homophones.\n* [[H-dropping|''H''-dropping]] in [[South Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], \"''Berry 'Aid''\" for [[Berry Head]] (in [[Brixham]], South Devon)\n\nIn traditional Southern rural accents, the voiceless [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/s/, /f/, /\u03b8/, /\u0283/}} always remain voiceless, which is the main difference from West Country accents.\n\n==East Anglia==\n{{Main|East Anglian English}}\nFeatures which can be found in '''[[East Anglia]]n English''' (especially in [[Norfolk]]) include:\n* [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-dropping|''Yod''-dropping]] after all consonants: ''beautiful'' may be pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0289\u02d0\u0294\u026af\u0259l]}}, often represented as \"bootiful\" or \"bewtiful\", ''huge'' as {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0289\u02d0d\u0292]}}, and so on.<ref>There are more details on {{cite web|url=http://www.norfolkdialect.com/trudgill.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222181929/http://www.norfolkdialect.com/trudgill.html |archivedate=22 February 2008 |df=dmy }}, written by Norfolk-born linguist [[Peter Trudgill]]</ref>\n* Absence of the [[Phonological history of English vowels#Long mid mergers|long mid merger]] between [[Early Modern English]] {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} (as in ''toe, moan, road, boat'') and {{IPA|/\u0254\u028a/}} (as in ''tow, mown, rowed'').

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html |title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit |date=March 8, 1932 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf |title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys |date=October 16, 1940 |work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

This resulted in a \"tiered\" balcony system where several shallow balconies were built at the back of the theater, cantilevered off the back wall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Second, Roxy specified that the stage contain a central section with three parts, so that the [[Set construction|sets]] could be changed easily.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Roxy also wanted red seats because he believed it would make the theater successful.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} He wished for an auditorium with an oval shape because contemporary wisdom held that oval-shaped auditoriums had better acoustic qualities.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=94}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} Finally, he wanted to build at least 6,201 seats in the Music Hall so it would be larger than the Roxy Theatre. There were only 5,960 audience seats, but Roxy counted exactly 6,201 seats by including elevator stools, [[orchestra pit]] seats, and dressing-room chairs.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|pp=217\u2013218}}\n\nDespite Roxy's specific requests for design features, the Music Hall's general design was determined by the Associated Architects, the architectural consortium that was designing the rest of Rockefeller Center.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} The Radio City Music Hall was designed by architect [[Edward Durell Stone]]{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=7}} and interior designer [[Donald Deskey]]{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=10}} in the [[Art Deco]] style.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=1}} Stone used [[Indiana Limestone]] for the facade, as with all the other buildings in Rockefeller Center, but he also included some distinguishing features. Three {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented [[fire escape]]s were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets. Inside, Stone designed {{convert|165|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Grand Foyer with a large staircase, balconies, and mirrors, and commissioned [[Ezra Winter]] for the grand foyer's {{convert|2400|ft2|m2|adj=on}} mural, \"Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth\".{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} Deskey, meanwhile, was selected as part of a competition for interior designers for the Music Hall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=220}} He had reportedly called Winter's painting \"God-awful\" and regarded the interior and exterior as not much better.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}} To make the Music Hall presentable in his opinion, Deskey designed upholstery and furniture that was custom to the Hall.

Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each embedded into the northern and southern walls, and two in the middle, facing the booths in the walls. Large black pillars support a low, slightly [[coffer]]ed ceiling.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=16}}  The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\nTo the ticket lobby's east, and the advance sales lobby's northeast, is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Two long, tubular chandeliers created by [[Edward F.

The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level.

Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: \"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=Secrets of the Magic Theater |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=27 |date=January 1941 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news | title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale |first=Walter Rendell |last=Storey | work=The New York Times | date=December 25, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site.

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html |title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit |date=March 8, 1932 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf |title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys |date=October 16, 1940 |work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

This resulted in a \"tiered\" balcony system where several shallow balconies were built at the back of the theater, cantilevered off the back wall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Second, Roxy specified that the stage contain a central section with three parts, so that the [[Set construction|sets]] could be changed easily.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Roxy also wanted red seats because he believed it would make the theater successful.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} He wished for an auditorium with an oval shape because contemporary wisdom held that oval-shaped auditoriums had better acoustic qualities.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=94}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} Finally, he wanted to build at least 6,201 seats in the Music Hall so it would be larger than the Roxy Theatre. There were only 5,960 audience seats, but Roxy counted exactly 6,201 seats by including elevator stools, [[orchestra pit]] seats, and dressing-room chairs.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|pp=217\u2013218}}\n\nDespite Roxy's specific requests for design features, the Music Hall's general design was determined by the Associated Architects, the architectural consortium that was designing the rest of Rockefeller Center.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} The Radio City Music Hall was designed by architect [[Edward Durell Stone]]{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=7}} and interior designer [[Donald Deskey]]{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=10}} in the [[Art Deco]] style.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=1}} Stone used [[Indiana Limestone]] for the facade, as with all the other buildings in Rockefeller Center, but he also included some distinguishing features. Three {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented [[fire escape]]s were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets. Inside, Stone designed {{convert|165|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Grand Foyer with a large staircase, balconies, and mirrors, and commissioned [[Ezra Winter]] for the grand foyer's {{convert|2400|ft2|m2|adj=on}} mural, \"Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth\".{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} Deskey, meanwhile, was selected as part of a competition for interior designers for the Music Hall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=220}} He had reportedly called Winter's painting \"God-awful\" and regarded the interior and exterior as not much better.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}} To make the Music Hall presentable in his opinion, Deskey designed upholstery and furniture that was custom to the Hall.

Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each embedded into the northern and southern walls, and two in the middle, facing the booths in the walls. Large black pillars support a low, slightly [[coffer]]ed ceiling.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=16}}  The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\nTo the ticket lobby's east, and the advance sales lobby's northeast, is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Two long, tubular chandeliers created by [[Edward F.

The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level.

Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: \"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=Secrets of the Magic Theater |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=27 |date=January 1941 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news | title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale |first=Walter Rendell |last=Storey | work=The New York Times | date=December 25, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site.

It featured the 28th World Championship of Drivers and the 20th International Cup for Formula 1 Constructors,<ref>Championship conditions were published by the FIA in the \"World Championship of Drivers\" and the \"International Cup for Formula 1 Constructors\" sections of the 1977 FIA Yearbook of Automoble Sport</ref> which commenced on 9 January 1977, and ended on 23 October after seventeen races; the longest Formula One season in the sport's history up to that point. The season also included a single non-championship race for Formula One cars, the [[1977 Race of Champions]].\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] won his second championship, despite [[Mario Andretti]] winning more races. [[Jody Scheckter]]'s Wolf won first time out, Shadow took their only victory, and [[Gunnar Nilsson]] achieved the only win of a career ended by cancer. [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] entered Grand Prix racing with a turbocharged car which was initially not very successful. The German ATS team took over the Penske cars and the South African Grand Prix was the last race a BRM ever qualified to start. Lauda departed [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] even before the season ended, so did not complete the season, having already sealed the title thanks to his consistent form. Ferrari won its third consecutive Constructors' title with new driver [[Carlos Reutemann]] having a solid season.\n\nThe season was also marred by one of the most horrific accidents in Formula One history. During the [[1977 South African Grand Prix|South African GP]] on 5 March, TV cameras captured how [[Tom Pryce]] was unable to avoid 19-year-old race marshall Frederik Jansen van Vuuren. The latter was killed by the terrifying collision, his body was hurled into the air, and his fire extinguisher killed and nearly decapitated Pryce, whose car proceeded to the end of the straight where it collided with [[Jacques Laffite]]'s [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]]. There was further tragedy as [[Carlos Pace]] lost his life in an aviation accident only a couple of weeks after Pryce's accident.\n\n==Drivers and constructors==\nThe following drivers and constructors contested the World Championship of Drivers and the International Cup for Formula 1 Constructors:\n[[File:Lauda celebrating at 1977 Dutch Grand Prix crop.jpg|thumb|Austrian [[Niki Lauda]]

report==\n\n===Race 1: Argentina===\nThe 1977 season started in Argentina, returning after a year's absence. It was reigning world champion [[James Hunt]] who started off his title defence with pole position in his [[McLaren]]. Countryman [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] shared the front row with him in the [[Brabham]], and [[Patrick Depailler]] in the six-wheeled [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] was third on the grid. The weather was, as was very often the case in Buenos Aires, oppressively hot, which contributed to the attrition of this race \u2013 the track temperature was 51&nbsp;\u00b0C (124&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nWatson took the lead at the start with Hunt second. Watson led for the first 10 laps until Hunt moved ahead and pulled away, with [[Mario Andretti]]'s [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] third, but soon the other McLaren of [[Jochen Mass]] took the place. Mass had to retire soon after with an engine failure which caused him to spin, and a suspension failure took teammate and race leader Hunt out three laps later. Watson took the lead again, but he also had suspension failures and let teammate [[Carlos Pace]] through. Watson eventually retired, and Pace struggled towards the end due to heat in his cockpit and was passed by [[Jody Scheckter]]'s [[Walter Wolf Racing|Wolf]] and Andretti, but the latter retired then with a wheel bearing failure. Scheckter took the first win of 1977, with Pace second, and home hero [[Carlos Reutemann]] completing the podium for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].\n\n===Race 2: Brazil===\nThe second round took place at the longest circuit of the year \u2013 the very demanding and difficult 5-mile Interlagos circuit in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Hunt took pole again with Reutemann second and Andretti third on the grid. Home hero Pace took the lead at the start, with Hunt dropping behind Reutemann as well but soon Hunt was back behind Pace and attacking. There was contact, and Hunt took the lead whereas Pace had to pit for repairs. Hunt led Reutemann until he began to suffer from tyre troubles and was passed by Reutemann. Hunt pitted for new tyres, and rejoined fourth and soon passed [[Niki Lauda]] in the Ferrari and Watson to reclaim second. Reutemann marched on to victory, Hunt was second and Lauda third after Watson crashed out.\n\n===Race 3: South Africa===\nThe race in South Africa was over a month later, but Hunt still continued his streak of poles, with Pace alongside and Lauda next. Hunt led off at the start, with Lauda and Scheckter following him after Pace struggled. The order stayed put until the seventh lap when Lauda took the lead and was never headed again, with Scheckter taking second from Hunt 11 laps later.\n\nOn lap 21, two marshals ran across the track after the [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]] of [[Renzo Zorzi]] caught fire. The second marshal, Fredrik Jansen van Vuuren, carrying a fire extinguisher was hit by the car of [[Tom Pryce]] at about 270&nbsp;km/h (170&nbsp;mph) and was killed instantly by the collision. His fire extinguisher struck Pryce's face, killing and nearly decapitating him.\n\nThe race continued however, and Lauda won, his first since his own horror crash last year, with home hero Scheckter second, and Depailler's six-wheeler took third from Hunt in the closing laps.\n\n===Race 4: United States GP West===\nThe death of Pryce had shaken the field up, and then before the next round at Long Beach, California in the western United States, there was more bad news, as [[Carlos Pace]], who had finished second in the opening round in Argentina, was killed in a plane crash.\n\nThe field, in a somber mood, went to this relatively new street circuit near Los Angeles, and Lauda took pole ahead of home hero Andretti, with Scheckter third. At the start, it was Scheckter who got the best start, and he passed both Andretti and Lauda, with Reutemann going up an escape road and spinning as he tried to follow Scheckter through. The top three of Scheckter, Andretti and Lauda pulled away from the rest of the pack, and ran closely together but the order did not change. However, a tyre began to deflate for Scheckter, and both Andretti and Lauda passed him with two laps left, with Andretti thus taking a popular home victory ahead of Lauda and a disappointed Scheckter.\n\n===Race 5: Spain===\nThe next round was in Spain, at the Jarama circuit near Madrid, where Andretti continued his recent form with pole and [[Jacques Laffite]]'s [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] springing a surprise, beating Lauda to second, however Lauda was unable to take part in the race due to a broken rib. At the start, Andretti took the lead with Laffite following. Laffite gave chase to Andretti in the early stages but had to pit with a deflating tyre, leaving Andretti to romp to victory with Reutemann second. Hunt inherited third but retired with a misfire, giving it to Watson until he lost places due to a spin, leaving Scheckter to take the final spot on the podium.\n\n===Race 6: Monaco===\nIn the elite Monaco race, Watson took his first career pole for Brabham with Scheckter also on the front row and Reutemann third. It was Scheckter who got the best start to beat Watson to the first corner, with Reutemann running third in the early stages until he was passed by his teammate Lauda. Watson ran second to Scheckter until mid-race when he had to retire with gearbox trouble, allowing Lauda to close in on Scheckter but the latter was flawless and held on to take his second win of the season. Lauda had to be satisfied with second, with Reutemann completing the podium.\n\n===Race 7: Belgium===\nBelgium was host to the seventh race of the season, and in qualifying at the Zolder circuit Andretti took a comfortable pole with Watson just beating the second Lotus of [[Gunnar Nilsson]] to second. The race was wet due to rain earlier in the day, and Watson took the lead at the first corner, but later in the first lap, Andretti ran into the back to him while attempting to retake the lead, resulting in both of them spinning out and Scheckter taking the lead.\n\nScheckter led the early stages ahead of Nilsson, whereas Reutemann made an early charge but spun off. The track began to dry and everyone had to pit for tyres, and those who stopped early were the ones who benefited, as now Lauda was leading from Jochen Mass and Scheckter was down to fifth. Mass spun off from second, handing it to Nilsson who then went on to catch and pass Lauda before driving away to his first career victory. Behind second-placed Lauda, [[Ronnie Peterson]] completed the podium for [[Tyrrell Racing|Team Tyrrell]] after Scheckter retired with an engine failure.\n\n===Race 8: Sweden===\nThe Swedish race at the isolated Anderstorp Raceway was full of anticipation after Nilsson's win last time out, but once again in qualifying, it was his teammate Andretti leading the way from Watson, with Hunt heading the second row. At the start, again it was Watson who led into the first corner followed by Scheckter, but soon Andretti passed both of them and opened up a lead. Watson and Scheckter battled for second until they collided, with Scheckter having to retire and Watson pitting for repairs. Hunt took second but he began to drop back and was passed by a charging Laffite, and then by his teammate Mass. Andretti however, was dominant until he had to pit due to a fuel metering problem with two laps left, handing the lead to Laffite who went on to take his first ever win ahead of Mass and Reutemann.\n\n===Race 9: France===\nThe next race was staged at the newly extended Dijon-Prenois circuit in France, and once again it was Andretti on pole with Hunt second and Nilsson third on the grid. Hunt got the best start and led into the first corner from Watson and Laffite, with Andretti dropping down to fourth. However, Watson passed Hunt on the fifth lap and started to build a gap until Andretti got up to second and began to reel him in. During the final few laps, leader Watson and Andretti were running nose-to-tail but Watson held him off till the last lap when his engine missed a beat and immediately Andretti was past. Andretti thus took the win ahead of a crestfallen Watson and Hunt.\n\n===Race 10: Great Britain===\nBritish drivers had not much luck this season, so it was a relief to the British fans at the fast Silverstone circuit to see defending champion Hunt on pole for his home race with Watson alongside, and Lauda next. Hunt did not get a good start, and so Watson led into the first corner ahead of Lauda and Scheckter, but as the race progressed, a recovering Hunt soon passed both to get up to second behind Watson. The race was set for a grandstand British finish with Hunt slowly closing down leader Watson, but the fans were robbed of it when Watson's fuel system failed with 15 laps left. Hunt took the lead and went on to win his first race of the season, with Lauda second. Scheckter ran third until his engine failed, thus giving the place to Andretti until he too suffered a similar fate, leaving Nilsson to take the final spot on the podium.\n\n===Race 11: West Germany===\nThe West German race took place in Hockenheim because the N\u00fcrburgring track was deemed to be too dangerous to race on because of the inability of the 'Ring's organizers to effectively manage such a huge circuit. In qualifying, Scheckter took his first pole of the season, ahead of Watson and then Lauda who headed the second row. Scheckter kept the lead at the first corner with both Watson and Lauda keeping their positions. Watson put pressure on Scheckter until his engine failed on the eighth lap, giving second to Lauda who passed Scheckter soon after and began to pull away. Scheckter battled for second with Hunt until the defending champion retired with an engine failure, giving third to Watson's teammate and home driver [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]]. That was how it stayed to the end; Lauda winning from Scheckter and Stuck. One notable highlight of the race involved German touring car legend [[Hans Heyer]], who started the race despite failing to qualify.\n\n===Race 12: Austria===\nWith two-thirds of the season complete, Lauda led the championship as the drivers went to the very fast and scenic \u00d6sterreichring in Austria. This circuit had been modified from the year before \u2013 a chicane had been put in to replace the ultra fast, flat out Voest-Hugel Kurve. Lauda pleased his home fans further by beating Hunt to pole, with Andretti settling for third on the grid. The race started in damp conditions, and poleman Lauda led into the first corner followed by Hunt, but Andretti passed both at one corner soon after. His teammate Nilsson was on a charge and was rapidly up to second, whereas Lauda went backwards.\n\nNilsson had to pit to change tyres, giving second to Hunt and this became the lead when Andretti's engine failed. The Australian [[Alan Jones (Formula 1)|Alan Jones]] in the [[Shadow Racing Team|Shadow]] was now charging up the order, passing both Scheckter and Stuck and as the race progressed, the recovering Nilsson and Lauda also passed the duo, however none of them could make an impression on Hunt. Hunt seemed to be headed for victory until his engine failed with ten laps left, giving Jones his first ever Formula One victory. Lauda took second and Stuck was third, both benefiting after Nilsson also retired with an engine failure. Jones's victory was so unexpected that the organizers did not have a copy of the Australian national anthem, so they played \"Happy Birthday\" instead (it was not Jones's birthday that day).\n\n===Race 13: Netherlands===\nThe field went to the Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam in the Netherlands for the next round, and in qualifying Andretti took his fifth pole of the season with Laffite alongside on the front row, and Hunt third. At the start, Hunt jumped both the front row starters to lead but before the end of the first lap, Andretti tried to drive alongside him but some aggressive defending from Hunt forced him to lift, and Laffite took advantage to get second. Five laps later, Andretti had got back past Laffite and was again attacking Hunt, who defended aggressively but this time Andretti did not lift and they collided. Hunt was out on the spot, whereas Andretti spun and rejoined fourth.\n\nThis left Laffite leading from the Ferraris of Lauda and Reutemann. The latter had a long battle with Andretti for third, repeatedly exchanging places, until the Lotus driver's engine blew up. Soon after, Lauda passed Laffite to take the lead, and he went on build a gap and win comfortably. Laffite finished second. After Andretti's demise, Reutemann ran third until the second Lotus of Nilsson attacked him, and the two collided with Nilsson out and Reutemann rejoining at the back. This sensationally left [[Patrick Tambay]] in the [[Ensign (racing team)|Ensign]] third, but he ran out of fuel on the last lap, thus handing the place to Scheckter.\n\nThis meant that Lauda had a 21-point lead over Scheckter with four races left.\n\n===Race 14: Italy===\nItaly was next on the calendar, but the fact that it was Ferrari's home race at the Monza Autodrome near Milan did not deter Hunt who took pole, whereas Reutemann cheered the home fans by starting second in front of Scheckter. Scheckter took the lead after a brilliant start, and in second place was [[Clay Regazzoni]]'s Ensign who got an even better one. Regazzoni however did not have the pace and soon dropped down the order, whereas Andretti was on the move, passing Hunt on the second lap, and Scheckter a few laps later to take the lead. Hunt dropped back with brake troubles as the race progressed, and Scheckter retired when his engine failed, leaving Reutemann and Lauda in second and third. Lauda was soon past Reutemann, and the latter had to retire when he spun off on oil on the track, handing third to Jones. The race finished in that order; with Andretti taking a dominant victory from Lauda, who closed in on the championship, and Jones who took his second podium in three races.\n\n===Race 15: United States===\nThe scenario going into the second race in the eastern United States at the picturesque and fast Watkins Glen circuit in upstate New York was that if Lauda had a single point or if Scheckter did not win the race, Lauda would be world champion. Scheckter's hopes looked bleak as he qualified ninth to Lauda's seventh, as Hunt took pole from the Brabhams of Stuck and Watson. Stuck got the best start and took the lead into the first corner followed by Hunt and Andretti. Scheckter was on a charge and passed many drivers, including Lauda, in the early stages to get up to fourth, which became third when leader Stuck crashed out. However, Hunt and Andretti continued to pull away from him and, with Lauda running fourth, Scheckter needed something extraordinary to happen to keep the title battle alive. That did not happen, as the rest of the race passed on without incident, with Hunt winning ahead of Andretti and Scheckter, with Lauda's fourth place enough to make him the world champion.\n\nAfter the race, Lauda decided not to race in the final two races because of the declining relationship between him and Ferrari.\n\n===Race 16: Canada===\nCanada was host to the penultimate round of the season at the fast and flowing Mosport Park near Toronto, and the field went in minus Lauda, who was unconvinced that Ferrari could prepare three cars efficiently for a Grand Prix \u2013 the third car was for Quebecoir Canadian Gilles Villeneuve in his debut race with Ferrari. In qualifying, Andretti took yet another pole ahead of Hunt, with Ronnie Peterson's six-wheeled Tyrrell in third. The safety of the Mosport Park circuit was under intense scrutiny, as the ubiquitous bumps and limited safety of the circuit caused a number of nasty accidents including Briton Ian Ashley vaulting barriers and crashing into a TV tower. These accidents were dealt with badly and the severely injured Ashley was only flown out 40 minutes after he crashed. But the race went ahead anyway, and both Andretti and Hunt kept their positions at the start, with Hunt's teammate Jochen Mass charging up to third. Andretti and Hunt then proceeded to demolish the entire field, but they themselves were separated by nothing as they ran nose-to-tail. With less than 20 laps left, they came to lap third-placed Mass during which there was a misunderstanding between the McLarens who collided and spun off, Hunt retiring and Mass pitting for repairs and rejoining fifth. Andretti was left well over a lap ahead until his engine failed with three laps left, giving the win to Scheckter. [[Patrick Depailler]] finished second for Tyrrell, and Mass completed the podium.\n\n===Race 17: Japan===\nThe final round of the season was in Japan at the fast Fuji Speedway near Tokyo, and Andretti and Hunt continued their late-season battle, with the American pipping Hunt to the pole, with Watson heading the second row. Unlike the previous year, the weather conditions at the Fuji circuit near Tokyo were perfect, and Hunt took the lead at the start, and Scheckter and Mass jumped up to second and third, whereas Andretti had a terrible start and was at the tail of the top ten. On the second lap, Andretti was involved in a collision while trying to gain places, putting him out. But this race, like South Africa was marred by terrible tragedy. Peterson and Villeneuve came together at the end of the straight, and Villeneuve crashed appallingly and his Ferrari flew into a crowd that was standing in a restricted area, killing 2 photographers and injuring several others. But the race continued on, and with Andretti out, Hunt had no challengers left and he built a large gap, with teammate Mass second and Watson passing Scheckter for third. However, both Mass and Watson had to retire within one lap of each other with engine and gearbox failures, and with Scheckter dropping back, Reutemann was second until he was passed by Laffite. Hunt went on and capped off the season with a comfortable win, whereas Laffite ran of fuel on the last lap, handing over second to Reutemann and allowing Depailler to complete the podium. The Japanese Grand Prix was not held again until 1987 at the Suzuka circuit \u2013 there had been talk of moving the race from Fuji to Suzuka for 1978, but this never materialized.\n\n==Results and

It featured the 28th World Championship of Drivers and the 20th International Cup for Formula 1 Constructors,<ref>Championship conditions were published by the FIA in the \"World Championship of Drivers\" and the \"International Cup for Formula 1 Constructors\" sections of the 1977 FIA Yearbook of Automoble Sport</ref> which commenced on 9 January 1977, and ended on 23 October after seventeen races. At the time the longest Formula One season in the sport's history. The season also included a single non-championship race for Formula One cars, the [[1977 Race of Champions]].\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] won his second championship, despite [[Mario Andretti]] winning more races. [[Jody Scheckter]]'s Wolf won first time out, Shadow took their only victory, and [[Gunnar Nilsson]] achieved the only win of a career ended by cancer. [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] entered Grand Prix racing with a turbocharged car which was initially not very successful. The German ATS team took over the Penske cars and the South African Grand Prix was the last race a BRM ever qualified to start. Lauda departed [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] even before the season ended, so did not complete the season, having already sealed the title thanks to his consistent form. Ferrari won its third consecutive Constructors' title with new driver [[Carlos Reutemann]] having a solid season.\n\nThe season was also marred by one of the most horrific accidents in Formula One history. During the [[1977 South African Grand Prix|South African GP]] on 5 March, TV cameras captured how [[Tom Pryce]] was unable to avoid 19-year-old race marshall Frederik Jansen van Vuuren. The latter was killed by the terrifying collision, his body was hurled into the air, and his fire extinguisher killed and nearly decapitated Pryce, whose car proceeded to the end of the straight where it collided with [[Jacques Laffite]]'s [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]]. There was further tragedy as [[Carlos Pace]] lost his life in an aviation accident only a couple of weeks after Pryce's accident.\n\n==Drivers and constructors==\nThe following drivers and constructors contested the World Championship of Drivers and the International Cup for Formula 1 Constructors:\n[[File:Lauda celebrating at 1977 Dutch Grand Prix crop.jpg|thumb|Austrian [[Niki Lauda]]

report==\n\n===Race 1: Argentina===\nThe 1977 season started in Argentina, returning after a year's absence. It was reigning world champion [[James Hunt]] who started off his title defence with pole position in his [[McLaren]]. Countryman [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] shared the front row with him in the [[Brabham]], and [[Patrick Depailler]] in the six-wheeled [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] was third on the grid. The weather was, as was very often the case in Buenos Aires, oppressively hot, which contributed to the attrition of this race \u2013 the track temperature was 51&nbsp;\u00b0C (124&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nWatson took the lead at the start with Hunt second. Watson led for the first 10 laps until Hunt moved ahead and pulled away, with [[Mario Andretti]]'s [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] third, but soon the other McLaren of [[Jochen Mass]] took the place. Mass had to retire soon after with an engine failure which caused him to spin, and a suspension failure took teammate and race leader Hunt out three laps later. Watson took the lead again, but he also had suspension failures and let teammate [[Carlos Pace]] through. Watson eventually retired, and Pace struggled towards the end due to heat in his cockpit and was passed by [[Jody Scheckter]]'s [[Walter Wolf Racing|Wolf]] and Andretti, but the latter retired then with a wheel bearing failure. Scheckter took the first win of 1977, with Pace second, and home hero [[Carlos Reutemann]] completing the podium for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].\n\n===Race 2: Brazil===\nThe second round took place at the longest circuit of the year \u2013 the very demanding and difficult 5-mile Interlagos circuit in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Hunt took pole again with Reutemann second and Andretti third on the grid. Home hero Pace took the lead at the start, with Hunt dropping behind Reutemann as well but soon Hunt was back behind Pace and attacking. There was contact, and Hunt took the lead whereas Pace had to pit for repairs. Hunt led Reutemann until he began to suffer from tyre troubles and was passed by Reutemann. Hunt pitted for new tyres, and rejoined fourth and soon passed [[Niki Lauda]] in the Ferrari and Watson to reclaim second. Reutemann marched on to victory, Hunt was second and Lauda third after Watson crashed out.\n\n===Race 3: South Africa===\nThe race in South Africa was over a month later, but Hunt still continued his streak of poles, with Pace alongside and Lauda next. Hunt led off at the start, with Lauda and Scheckter following him after Pace struggled. The order stayed put until the seventh lap when Lauda took the lead and was never headed again, with Scheckter taking second from Hunt 11 laps later.\n\nOn lap 21, two marshals ran across the track after the [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]] of [[Renzo Zorzi]] caught fire. The second marshal, Fredrik Jansen van Vuuren, carrying a fire extinguisher was hit by the car of [[Tom Pryce]] at about 270&nbsp;km/h (170&nbsp;mph) and was killed instantly by the collision. His fire extinguisher struck Pryce's face, killing and nearly decapitating him.\n\nThe race continued however, and Lauda won, his first since his own horror crash last year, with home hero Scheckter second, and Depailler's six-wheeler took third from Hunt in the closing laps.\n\n===Race 4: United States GP West===\nThe death of Pryce had shaken the field up, and then before the next round at Long Beach, California in the western United States, there was more bad news, as [[Carlos Pace]], who had finished second in the opening round in Argentina, was killed in a plane crash.\n\nThe field, in a somber mood, went to this relatively new street circuit near Los Angeles, and Lauda took pole ahead of home hero Andretti, with Scheckter third. At the start, it was Scheckter who got the best start, and he passed both Andretti and Lauda, with Reutemann going up an escape road and spinning as he tried to follow Scheckter through. The top three of Scheckter, Andretti and Lauda pulled away from the rest of the pack, and ran closely together but the order did not change. However, a tyre began to deflate for Scheckter, and both Andretti and Lauda passed him with two laps left, with Andretti thus taking a popular home victory ahead of Lauda and a disappointed Scheckter.\n\n===Race 5: Spain===\nThe next round was in Spain, at the Jarama circuit near Madrid, where Andretti continued his recent form with pole and [[Jacques Laffite]]'s [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] springing a surprise, beating Lauda to second, however Lauda was unable to take part in the race due to a broken rib. At the start, Andretti took the lead with Laffite following. Laffite gave chase to Andretti in the early stages but had to pit with a deflating tyre, leaving Andretti to romp to victory with Reutemann second. Hunt inherited third but retired with a misfire, giving it to Watson until he lost places due to a spin, leaving Scheckter to take the final spot on the podium.\n\n===Race 6: Monaco===\nIn the elite Monaco race, Watson took his first career pole for Brabham with Scheckter also on the front row and Reutemann third. It was Scheckter who got the best start to beat Watson to the first corner, with Reutemann running third in the early stages until he was passed by his teammate Lauda. Watson ran second to Scheckter until mid-race when he had to retire with gearbox trouble, allowing Lauda to close in on Scheckter but the latter was flawless and held on to take his second win of the season. Lauda had to be satisfied with second, with Reutemann completing the podium.\n\n===Race 7: Belgium===\nBelgium was host to the seventh race of the season, and in qualifying at the Zolder circuit Andretti took a comfortable pole with Watson just beating the second Lotus of [[Gunnar Nilsson]] to second. The race was wet due to rain earlier in the day, and Watson took the lead at the first corner, but later in the first lap, Andretti ran into the back to him while attempting to retake the lead, resulting in both of them spinning out and Scheckter taking the lead.\n\nScheckter led the early stages ahead of Nilsson, whereas Reutemann made an early charge but spun off. The track began to dry and everyone had to pit for tyres, and those who stopped early were the ones who benefited, as now Lauda was leading from Jochen Mass and Scheckter was down to fifth. Mass spun off from second, handing it to Nilsson who then went on to catch and pass Lauda before driving away to his first career victory. Behind second-placed Lauda, [[Ronnie Peterson]] completed the podium for [[Tyrrell Racing|Team Tyrrell]] after Scheckter retired with an engine failure.\n\n===Race 8: Sweden===\nThe Swedish race at the isolated Anderstorp Raceway was full of anticipation after Nilsson's win last time out, but once again in qualifying, it was his teammate Andretti leading the way from Watson, with Hunt heading the second row. At the start, again it was Watson who led into the first corner followed by Scheckter, but soon Andretti passed both of them and opened up a lead. Watson and Scheckter battled for second until they collided, with Scheckter having to retire and Watson pitting for repairs. Hunt took second but he began to drop back and was passed by a charging Laffite, and then by his teammate Mass. Andretti however, was dominant until he had to pit due to a fuel metering problem with two laps left, handing the lead to Laffite who went on to take his first ever win ahead of Mass and Reutemann.\n\n===Race 9: France===\nThe next race was staged at the newly extended Dijon-Prenois circuit in France, and once again it was Andretti on pole with Hunt second and Nilsson third on the grid. Hunt got the best start and led into the first corner from Watson and Laffite, with Andretti dropping down to fourth. However, Watson passed Hunt on the fifth lap and started to build a gap until Andretti got up to second and began to reel him in. During the final few laps, leader Watson and Andretti were running nose-to-tail but Watson held him off till the last lap when his engine missed a beat and immediately Andretti was past. Andretti thus took the win ahead of a crestfallen Watson and Hunt.\n\n===Race 10: Great Britain===\nBritish drivers had not much luck this season, so it was a relief to the British fans at the fast Silverstone circuit to see defending champion Hunt on pole for his home race with Watson alongside, and Lauda next. Hunt did not get a good start, and so Watson led into the first corner ahead of Lauda and Scheckter, but as the race progressed, a recovering Hunt soon passed both to get up to second behind Watson. The race was set for a grandstand British finish with Hunt slowly closing down leader Watson, but the fans were robbed of it when Watson's fuel system failed with 15 laps left. Hunt took the lead and went on to win his first race of the season, with Lauda second. Scheckter ran third until his engine failed, thus giving the place to Andretti until he too suffered a similar fate, leaving Nilsson to take the final spot on the podium.\n\n===Race 11: West Germany===\nThe West German race took place in Hockenheim because the N\u00fcrburgring track was deemed to be too dangerous to race on because of the inability of the 'Ring's organizers to effectively manage such a huge circuit. In qualifying, Scheckter took his first pole of the season, ahead of Watson and then Lauda who headed the second row. Scheckter kept the lead at the first corner with both Watson and Lauda keeping their positions. Watson put pressure on Scheckter until his engine failed on the eighth lap, giving second to Lauda who passed Scheckter soon after and began to pull away. Scheckter battled for second with Hunt until the defending champion retired with an engine failure, giving third to Watson's teammate and home driver [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]]. That was how it stayed to the end; Lauda winning from Scheckter and Stuck. One notable highlight of the race involved German touring car legend [[Hans Heyer]], who started the race despite failing to qualify.\n\n===Race 12: Austria===\nWith two-thirds of the season complete, Lauda led the championship as the drivers went to the very fast and scenic \u00d6sterreichring in Austria. This circuit had been modified from the year before \u2013 a chicane had been put in to replace the ultra fast, flat out Voest-Hugel Kurve. Lauda pleased his home fans further by beating Hunt to pole, with Andretti settling for third on the grid. The race started in damp conditions, and poleman Lauda led into the first corner followed by Hunt, but Andretti passed both at one corner soon after. His teammate Nilsson was on a charge and was rapidly up to second, whereas Lauda went backwards.\n\nNilsson had to pit to change tyres, giving second to Hunt and this became the lead when Andretti's engine failed. The Australian [[Alan Jones (Formula 1)|Alan Jones]] in the [[Shadow Racing Team|Shadow]] was now charging up the order, passing both Scheckter and Stuck and as the race progressed, the recovering Nilsson and Lauda also passed the duo, however none of them could make an impression on Hunt. Hunt seemed to be headed for victory until his engine failed with ten laps left, giving Jones his first ever Formula One victory. Lauda took second and Stuck was third, both benefiting after Nilsson also retired with an engine failure. Jones's victory was so unexpected that the organizers did not have a copy of the Australian national anthem, so they played \"Happy Birthday\" instead (it was not Jones's birthday that day).\n\n===Race 13: Netherlands===\nThe field went to the Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam in the Netherlands for the next round, and in qualifying Andretti took his fifth pole of the season with Laffite alongside on the front row, and Hunt third. At the start, Hunt jumped both the front row starters to lead but before the end of the first lap, Andretti tried to drive alongside him but some aggressive defending from Hunt forced him to lift, and Laffite took advantage to get second. Five laps later, Andretti had got back past Laffite and was again attacking Hunt, who defended aggressively but this time Andretti did not lift and they collided. Hunt was out on the spot, whereas Andretti spun and rejoined fourth.\n\nThis left Laffite leading from the Ferraris of Lauda and Reutemann. The latter had a long battle with Andretti for third, repeatedly exchanging places, until the Lotus driver's engine blew up. Soon after, Lauda passed Laffite to take the lead, and he went on build a gap and win comfortably. Laffite finished second. After Andretti's demise, Reutemann ran third until the second Lotus of Nilsson attacked him, and the two collided with Nilsson out and Reutemann rejoining at the back. This sensationally left [[Patrick Tambay]] in the [[Ensign (racing team)|Ensign]] third, but he ran out of fuel on the last lap, thus handing the place to Scheckter.\n\nThis meant that Lauda had a 21-point lead over Scheckter with four races left.\n\n===Race 14: Italy===\nItaly was next on the calendar, but the fact that it was Ferrari's home race at the Monza Autodrome near Milan did not deter Hunt who took pole, whereas Reutemann cheered the home fans by starting second in front of Scheckter. Scheckter took the lead after a brilliant start, and in second place was [[Clay Regazzoni]]'s Ensign who got an even better one. Regazzoni however did not have the pace and soon dropped down the order, whereas Andretti was on the move, passing Hunt on the second lap, and Scheckter a few laps later to take the lead. Hunt dropped back with brake troubles as the race progressed, and Scheckter retired when his engine failed, leaving Reutemann and Lauda in second and third. Lauda was soon past Reutemann, and the latter had to retire when he spun off on oil on the track, handing third to Jones. The race finished in that order; with Andretti taking a dominant victory from Lauda, who closed in on the championship, and Jones who took his second podium in three races.\n\n===Race 15: United States===\nThe scenario going into the second race in the eastern United States at the picturesque and fast Watkins Glen circuit in upstate New York was that if Lauda had a single point or if Scheckter did not win the race, Lauda would be world champion. Scheckter's hopes looked bleak as he qualified ninth to Lauda's seventh, as Hunt took pole from the Brabhams of Stuck and Watson. Stuck got the best start and took the lead into the first corner followed by Hunt and Andretti. Scheckter was on a charge and passed many drivers, including Lauda, in the early stages to get up to fourth, which became third when leader Stuck crashed out. However, Hunt and Andretti continued to pull away from him and, with Lauda running fourth, Scheckter needed something extraordinary to happen to keep the title battle alive. That did not happen, as the rest of the race passed on without incident, with Hunt winning ahead of Andretti and Scheckter, with Lauda's fourth place enough to make him the world champion.\n\nAfter the race, Lauda decided not to race in the final two races because of the declining relationship between him and Ferrari.\n\n===Race 16: Canada===\nCanada was host to the penultimate round of the season at the fast and flowing Mosport Park near Toronto, and the field went in minus Lauda, who was unconvinced that Ferrari could prepare three cars efficiently for a Grand Prix \u2013 the third car was for Quebecoir Canadian Gilles Villeneuve in his debut race with Ferrari. In qualifying, Andretti took yet another pole ahead of Hunt, with Ronnie Peterson's six-wheeled Tyrrell in third. The safety of the Mosport Park circuit was under intense scrutiny, as the ubiquitous bumps and limited safety of the circuit caused a number of nasty accidents including Briton Ian Ashley vaulting barriers and crashing into a TV tower. These accidents were dealt with badly and the severely injured Ashley was only flown out 40 minutes after he crashed. But the race went ahead anyway, and both Andretti and Hunt kept their positions at the start, with Hunt's teammate Jochen Mass charging up to third. Andretti and Hunt then proceeded to demolish the entire field, but they themselves were separated by nothing as they ran nose-to-tail. With less than 20 laps left, they came to lap third-placed Mass during which there was a misunderstanding between the McLarens who collided and spun off, Hunt retiring and Mass pitting for repairs and rejoining fifth. Andretti was left well over a lap ahead until his engine failed with three laps left, giving the win to Scheckter. [[Patrick Depailler]] finished second for Tyrrell, and Mass completed the podium.\n\n===Race 17: Japan===\nThe final round of the season was in Japan at the fast Fuji Speedway near Tokyo, and Andretti and Hunt continued their late-season battle, with the American pipping Hunt to the pole, with Watson heading the second row. Unlike the previous year, the weather conditions at the Fuji circuit near Tokyo were perfect, and Hunt took the lead at the start, and Scheckter and Mass jumped up to second and third, whereas Andretti had a terrible start and was at the tail of the top ten. On the second lap, Andretti was involved in a collision while trying to gain places, putting him out. But this race, like South Africa was marred by terrible tragedy. Peterson and Villeneuve came together at the end of the straight, and Villeneuve crashed appallingly and his Ferrari flew into a crowd that was standing in a restricted area, killing 2 photographers and injuring several others. But the race continued on, and with Andretti out, Hunt had no challengers left and he built a large gap, with teammate Mass second and Watson passing Scheckter for third. However, both Mass and Watson had to retire within one lap of each other with engine and gearbox failures, and with Scheckter dropping back, Reutemann was second until he was passed by Laffite. Hunt went on and capped off the season with a comfortable win, whereas Laffite ran of fuel on the last lap, handing over second to Reutemann and allowing Depailler to complete the podium. The Japanese Grand Prix was not held again until 1987 at the Suzuka circuit \u2013 there had been talk of moving the race from Fuji to Suzuka for 1978, but this never materialized.\n\n==Results and

In the [[World War I|First World War]], ''Ark Royal'' participated in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in early 1915, with her aircraft conducting aerial reconnaissance and observation missions. Her aircraft later supported British troops on the [[Macedonian Front (World War I)|Macedonian Front]] in 1916, before she returned to the [[Dardanelles]] to act as a [[depot ship]] for all the seaplanes operating in the area. In January 1918, several of her aircraft unsuccessfully attacked the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} when she sortied from the Dardanelles to attack [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] ships in the area. The ship left the area later in the year to support seaplanes conducting [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine patrols]] over the southern [[Aegean Sea]].\n\nAfter the end of the war, ''Ark Royal'' mostly served as an aircraft transport and depot ship for those aircraft in support of [[White movement|White Russian]] and British operations against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]] regions during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. She also supported [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft in [[British Somaliland]] in the campaign against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] in 1920. Later that year, the ship was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. ''Ark Royal'' was [[Ship commissioning|recommissioned]] to ferry an RAF squadron to the Dardanelles during the [[Chanak Crisis]] in 1922. She was reduced to reserve again upon her return to the United Kingdom the following year.\n\n''Ark Royal'' was recommissioned in 1930 to serve as a [[training ship]], for seaplane pilots and to evaluate [[aircraft catapult]] operations and techniques. She was renamed HMS ''Pegasus'' in 1934, freeing the name for the [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|aircraft carrier ordered that year]], and continued to serve as a training ship until the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in September 1939. Assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] at the beginning of the war, she took on tasks as an aircraft transport, in addition to her training duties, until she was modified to serve as the prototype [[fighter catapult ship]] in late 1940. This type of ship was intended to defend convoys against attacks by German long-range [[maritime patrol aircraft|maritime patrol bombers]] by launching [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s via their catapult to provide air cover for the convoy. ''Pegasus'' served in this role until mid-1941 when she reverted to her previous duties as a training ship. This lasted until early 1944 when she became a [[barracks ship]]. The ship was sold in late 1946 and her conversion into a merchant ship began the following year. However, the owner ran out of money during the process and '''''Anita I''''', as she had been renamed, was seized by her creditors in 1949 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]]. She was not broken up until late 1950.\n\n==Design and description==\nThe Royal Navy had conducted trials in 1913 with a modified [[cruiser]], {{HMS|Hermes|1913|2}}, to evaluate the ability of seaplanes to work with the fleet. They were successful enough that the [[Admiralty]] allocated \u00a381,000 in the 1914\u20131915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a more thorough modification than had been possible with ''Hermes'' to better accommodate seaplanes. A [[tramp steamer]] was purchased in 1914 that had just begun construction at the [[Blyth Shipbuilding Company]] so it could be easily modified to suit its new role.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 91\u201392</ref>\n\n''Ark Royal'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 7 November 1913 by the Blyth Shipbuilding Company in [[Blyth, Northumberland]], as a freighter, probably intended for the coal-for-grain trade in the Black Sea. She was purchased in May 1914<ref name=l92>Layman 1976, p. 92</ref> and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 5 September 1914. The ship was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 December 1914.<ref>Friedman, p. 363</ref>\n\nExtensive changes to the ship were made in converting her to a seaplane tender, with the superstructure, [[funnel (ship)|funnel]], and propulsion machinery moved aft and a working deck occupying the forward half of the ship. The deck was not intended as a flying-off deck, but for starting and running up of seaplane engines and for recovering damaged aircraft from the sea.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Century of Naval Construction, The History of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors |author=D.K. Brown |isbn=0-85177-282-X |publisher=Conway Maritime Press |year=1983 |location=London |page=114}}</ref> The ship was equipped with a large aircraft hold, {{convert|150|ft|m|1}} long, {{convert|45|ft|m|1}} wide and {{convert|15|ft|m|1}} high along with extensive workshops. Two {{convert|3|LT|t|adj=on}} steam [[crane (machine)|crane]]s on the sides of the [[forecastle]] lifted the aircraft through the sliding hatch of the [[hangar]] onto the flight deck or into the water. She carried {{convert|4000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol for her aircraft in standard commercial {{convert|2|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} tins.<ref>Friedman, pp. 28, 363, 368</ref>\n\nShe could carry five [[floatplanes]] and two to four wheeled aircraft. The seaplanes would take off and land in the water alongside the carrier, lifted on and off the ship by cranes; the other aircraft would have to return to land after launch. Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a [[Short Folder]], two [[Wight Pusher Seaplane|Wight Pushers]], three [[Sopwith Type 807]] seaplanes and two to four [[Sopwith Tabloid]] wheeled aircraft.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\n''Ark Royal'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|366|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|50|ft|10|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|18|ft|9|in|m|1}}.

She attempted to fly three of her seaplanes on the day of her arrival to reconnoitre the Straits, but two of them had engine troubles and the third could not take off despite the calm water. A Wight Pusher eventually managed to get into the air and discovered new fortifications down the Straits; it dropped a single {{convert|20|lb|adj=on}} bomb on the Asiatic side of the [[Dardanelles]] and returned with seven bullet holes in its skin. Two days later, the ship's aircraft attempted unsuccessfully to spot for the fleet as they bombarded the Ottoman fortifications defending the Straits. They conducted more [[aerial reconnaissance]] and observation missions in support of the fleet later in the month and in early March as it moved further up the Straits. ''Ark Royal'' lost her first aircraft on 5 March as the [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] of one of her Sopwiths splintered into pieces at {{convert|3000|ft|m}}. Both of the aircraft's crewmen were recovered by the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Usk|1903|6}}.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 96\u20137</ref>\n\nLater in the month, the ship's aircrew learned to spot [[naval mines|mines]] from the air and were moderately successful, although they failed to detect the minefield that sank one French and two British [[predreadnought]]s and damaged a British battlecruiser on 18 March. Later in the month, ''Ark Royal'' and her aircraft were relieved by [[No. 3 Squadron RNAS|No. 3 Squadron]] of the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS). In preparation for the squadron's arrival, the ship's crew cleared a [[vineyard]] on the island to serve as an [[airfield]] and unloaded its crated aircraft on 26\u201327 March. From 31 March to 7 April, ''Ark Royal'' and her companions made several fake landing attempts and her aircraft bombarded the port of [[Izmir|Smyrna]] with little effect. When she returned to Tenedos on 8 April, she exchanged her Tabloids, which had never flown from the ship, for a pair of [[Sopwith Schneider]] single-seat floatplanes. In addition, she received two [[Sopwith Type 860]]s, another Wight Pusher, and a [[Short Type 166]], all two-seat floatplanes, as replacements. The ship had no room for all these aircraft and she used the collier ''Penmorvalt'' to store them and for additional workshop space. Her aircraft resumed reconnaissance and observation missions over the Dardanelles; aircraft discovered a large ammunition dump on 12 April, and provided corrective data to direct gunfire from {{HMS|Lord Nelson||6}} onto the target.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 98, 100</ref>\n\n''Ark Royal''{{'}}s aircraft provided support to the Australian and New Zealand troops at [[Landing at Anzac Cove|Anzac Cove]] as they landed on 25 April on the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]]. Two days later, the ship was taken under fire by the Ottoman predreadnought {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Turgut Reis||2}}, firing across the peninsula, and she had to move in a hurry to avoid being hit. A month later, the battle on the peninsula had bogged down and the success of the German [[submarine]] {{SMU|U-21|Germany|2}} in sinking two British predreadnoughts forced ''Ark Royal'' to move to a safer anchorage at [[Imbros]] at the end of May. There she became a [[depot ship]] for all the seaplanes in the area, while her own aircraft continued to support operations at Gallipoli. On occasion, aircraft were loaned out to other ships for reconnaissance or observation missions.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 100\u201301</ref>\n\nThe ship left Imbros on 1 November for [[Mytilene]], from where her aircraft flew aerial reconnaissance missions over Smyrna, before she continued onwards to [[Salonika]], where she arrived on 8 November. While based there, her aircraft supported British troops [[Macedonian front (World War I)|fighting the Bulgarians]], spotted for British ships conducting shore bombardments, and conducted anti-submarine patrols. At this time, ''Ark Royal'' operated five Short 166s and a couple of Sopwith seaplanes. On 27 March 1917, the ship was transferred to [[Mudros]] to serve as a depot ship for all the seaplanes assigned to [[No. 2 Wing RNAS]], which controlled all RNAS aircraft in the area. By the end of 1917, she operated a mixture of [[Short Type 184]] and [[Sopwith Baby]] aircraft.<ref name=l2>Layman 1976, p. 102</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 20 January 1918, the Ottoman battlecruiser {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem||2}}, together with the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Midilli||2}}, (formerly the German ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'', and still with German crews), sortied from the Dardanelles to attack British warships based at Mudros. ''Yavuz'' struck a mine shortly after they exited the mouth of the Dardanelles so they switched targets and sank two British [[monitor (warship)|monitors]] off Imbros Island.<ref name=meek>{{cite journal |last=Hownam-Meek |first=R.

''Ark Royal'' was transferred to Piraeus in October and was still there when the [[Armistice of Mudros]] with Turkey was signed on 31 October. The ship joined the Allied fleet that occupied [[Constantinople]] after the surrender.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 102\u201303</ref>\n\n===Interwar years and the Second World War===\nAfter the war, ''Ark Royal'' transported aircraft across the Black Sea to [[Batumi]], where they were ferried across the Caucasus to the British naval forces supporting White Russian forces fighting the Bolsheviks in the Caspian Sea during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The ship was withdrawn from the Black Sea in late 1919 and disembarked her seaplanes at [[Malta]] to load a dozen [[de Havilland DH-9]] bombers and 181 personnel of the supporting Z Force for transport to British Somaliland. The ship arrived in [[Berbera]] on 30 December and the squadron was unloaded to support the [[1920 conflict between British forces and Somaliland dervishes|air and land campaign]] against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|the Mad Mullah]]. ''Ark Royal'' served during this campaign solely as a depot and repair ship for the RAF. She was withdrawn before its conclusion and transferred to the Black Sea to support the White Russian forces there as they began to collapse. The ship twice ferried refugees from the Caucasian coast to the [[Crimea]] and, after the second voyage, had to be fumigated at Constantinople after an outbreak of [[typhus]] among her passengers. During the summer of 1920, ''Ark Royal'' ferried RAF aircraft and personnel to [[Basra]]. She then returned to Britain for a refit and was put into reserve at [[Rosyth]] in November.<ref name=l3>Layman 1976, p. 103</ref>\n\nShe was recommissioned in September 1922 to transport [[No. 4 Squadron RAF|4 Squadron]], equipped with a dozen [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]]s, out to the Dardanelles during the [[Chanak crisis]]. The aircraft were ferried semi-assembled and then transferred to the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}} where they were fully assembled. On 11 October, the F.2s flew from the carrier to an airfield at Kilya on the European side of the straits. The ship remained in the area until she was given a brief refit at Malta in early 1923. Now equipped with [[Fairey III]]D seaplanes, ''Ark Royal'' returned to the Dardanelles until she was transferred back to the United Kingdom late in the year. Upon her arrival, the ship was placed back in reserve and became the depot ship for the reserve of [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] at [[Sheerness]] until 1930.<ref name=l3/>\n\n[[File:WalrusAboardPegasusA 012031.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[amphibious aircraft]] making a low pass near seaplane tender HMS ''Pegasus'', September 1942]]\nIn 1930, ''Ark Royal'' was recommissioned again as a training ship and an aircraft catapult was installed on her forecastle, forward of her cranes. For the next nine years, the ship conducted trials and evaluations of catapults and seaplane launch and recovery equipment and techniques. On 21 December 1934, she was renamed HMS ''Pegasus'' to release her name for [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|a new carrier]] that was then beginning construction. The ship was assigned to Home Fleet when the Second World War began, and was mostly used to train sailors in catapult launching and shipboard recovery techniques. The ship used the [[Fairey Seafox]], [[Supermarine Walrus]], and [[Fairey Swordfish]] of the [[764 Naval Air Squadron]].<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 98, 100\u2013101</ref> She also served as an aircraft transport and was present in [[Scapa Flow]], having just delivered some aircraft, on 14 October when the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} was sunk by the {{GS|U-47|1938|6}}.

Under the management of the Compania de Navigation Ellanita, the ship sailed from [[Cardiff]] to [[Antwerp]] in October 1947 to begin conversion to a freighter. The work ceased in early 1948 and ''Anita I'' was seized by her creditors and auctioned off to a Dutch shipbreaking firm on 16 June 1949. She was resold once more before the ship was purchased by the [[British Iron and Steel Corporation]] in October 1950.

In the [[World War I|First World War]], ''Ark Royal'' participated in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in early 1915, with her aircraft conducting aerial reconnaissance and observation missions. Her aircraft later supported British troops on the [[Macedonian Front (World War I)|Macedonian Front]] in 1916, before she returned to the [[Dardanelles]] to act as a [[depot ship]] for all the seaplanes operating in the area. In January 1918, several of her aircraft unsuccessfully attacked the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} when she sortied from the Dardanelles to attack [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] ships in the area. The ship left the area later in the year to support seaplanes conducting [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine patrols]] over the southern [[Aegean Sea]].\n\nAfter the end of the war, ''Ark Royal'' mostly served as an aircraft transport and depot ship for those aircraft in support of [[White movement|White Russian]] and British operations against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]] regions during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. She also supported [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft in [[British Somaliland]] in the campaign against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] in 1920. Later that year, the ship was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. ''Ark Royal'' was [[Ship commissioning|recommissioned]] to ferry an RAF squadron to the Dardanelles during the [[Chanak Crisis]] in 1922. She was reduced to reserve again upon her return to the United Kingdom the following year.\n\n''Ark Royal'' was recommissioned in 1930 to serve as a [[training ship]], for seaplane pilots and to evaluate [[aircraft catapult]] operations and techniques. She was renamed HMS ''Pegasus'' in 1934, freeing the name for the [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|aircraft carrier ordered that year]], and continued to serve as a training ship until the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in September 1939. Assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] at the beginning of the war, she took on tasks as an aircraft transport, in addition to her training duties, until she was modified to serve as the prototype [[fighter catapult ship]] in late 1940. This type of ship was intended to defend convoys against attacks by German long-range [[maritime patrol aircraft|maritime patrol bombers]] by launching [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s via their catapult to provide air cover for the convoy. ''Pegasus'' served in this role until mid-1941 when she reverted to her previous duties as a training ship. This lasted until early 1944 when she became a [[barracks ship]]. The ship was sold in late 1946 and her conversion into a merchant ship began the following year. However, the owner ran out of money during the process and '''''Anita I''''', as she had been renamed, was seized by her creditors in 1949 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]]. She was not broken up until late 1950.\n\n==Design and description==\nThe Royal Navy had conducted trials in 1913 with a modified [[cruiser]], {{HMS|Hermes|1913|2}}, to evaluate the ability of seaplanes to work with the fleet. They were successful enough that the [[Admiralty]] allocated \u00a381,000 in the 1914\u20131915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a more thorough modification than had been possible with ''Hermes'' to better accommodate seaplanes. A [[tramp steamer]] was purchased in 1914 that had just begun construction at the [[Blyth Shipbuilding Company]] so it could be easily modified to suit its new role.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 91\u201392</ref>\n\n''Ark Royal'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 7 November 1913 by the Blyth Shipbuilding Company in [[Blyth, Northumberland]], as a freighter, probably intended for the coal-for-grain trade in the Black Sea. She was purchased in May 1914<ref name=l92>Layman 1976, p. 92</ref> and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 5 September 1914. The ship was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 December 1914.<ref>Friedman, p. 363</ref>\n\nExtensive changes to the ship were made in converting her to a seaplane tender, with the superstructure, [[funnel (ship)|funnel]], and propulsion machinery moved aft and a working deck occupying the forward half of the ship. The deck was not intended as a flying-off deck, but for starting and running up of seaplane engines and for recovering damaged aircraft from the sea.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Century of Naval Construction, The History of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors |author=D.K.

Two {{convert|3|LT|t|adj=on}} steam [[crane (machine)|crane]]s on the sides of the [[forecastle]] lifted the aircraft through the sliding hatch of the [[hangar]] onto the flight deck or into the water. She carried {{convert|4000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol for her aircraft in standard commercial {{convert|2|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} tins.<ref>Friedman, pp. 28, 363, 368</ref>\n\nShe could carry five [[floatplanes]] and two to four wheeled aircraft. The seaplanes would take off and land in the water alongside the carrier, lifted on and off the ship by cranes; the other aircraft would have to return to land after launch. Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a [[Short Folder]], two [[Wight Pusher Seaplane|Wight Pushers]], three [[Sopwith Type 807]] seaplanes and two to four [[Sopwith Tabloid]] wheeled aircraft.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\n''Ark Royal'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|366|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|50|ft|10|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|18|ft|9|in|m|1}}.

She attempted to fly three of her seaplanes on the day of her arrival to reconnoitre the Straits, but two of them had engine troubles and the third could not take off despite the calm water. A Wight Pusher eventually managed to get into the air and discovered new fortifications down the Straits; it dropped a single {{convert|20|lb|adj=on}} bomb on the Asiatic side of the [[Dardanelles]] and returned with seven bullet holes in its skin. Two days later, the ship's aircraft attempted unsuccessfully to spot for the fleet as they bombarded the Ottoman fortifications defending the Straits. They conducted more [[aerial reconnaissance]] and observation missions in support of the fleet later in the month and in early March as it moved further up the Straits. ''Ark Royal'' lost her first aircraft on 5 March as the [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] of one of her Sopwiths splintered into pieces at {{convert|3000|ft|m}}. Both of the aircraft's crewmen were recovered by the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Usk|1903|6}}.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 96\u20137</ref>\n\nLater in the month, the ship's aircrew learned to spot [[naval mines|mines]] from the air and were moderately successful, although they failed to detect the minefield that sank one French and two British [[predreadnought]]s and damaged a British battlecruiser on 18 March. Later in the month, ''Ark Royal'' and her aircraft were relieved by [[No. 3 Squadron RNAS|No. 3 Squadron]] of the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS). In preparation for the squadron's arrival, the ship's crew cleared a [[vineyard]] on the island to serve as an [[airfield]] and unloaded its crated aircraft on 26\u201327 March. From 31 March to 7 April, ''Ark Royal'' and her companions made several fake landing attempts and her aircraft bombarded the port of [[Izmir|Smyrna]] with little effect. When she returned to Tenedos on 8 April, she exchanged her Tabloids, which had never flown from the ship, for a pair of [[Sopwith Schneider]] single-seat floatplanes. In addition, she received two [[Sopwith Type 860]]s, another Wight Pusher, and a [[Short Type 166]], all two-seat floatplanes, as replacements. The ship had no room for all these aircraft and she used the collier ''Penmorvalt'' to store them and for additional workshop space. Her aircraft resumed reconnaissance and observation missions over the Dardanelles; aircraft discovered a large ammunition dump on 12 April, and provided corrective data to direct gunfire from {{HMS|Lord Nelson||6}} onto the target.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 98, 100</ref>\n\n''Ark Royal''{{'}}s aircraft provided support to the Australian and New Zealand troops at [[Landing at Anzac Cove|Anzac Cove]] as they landed on 25 April on the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]]. Two days later, the ship was taken under fire by the Ottoman predreadnought {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Turgut Reis||2}}, firing across the peninsula, and she had to move in a hurry to avoid being hit. A month later, the battle on the peninsula had bogged down and the success of the German [[submarine]] {{SMU|U-21|Germany|2}} in sinking two British predreadnoughts forced ''Ark Royal'' to move to a safer anchorage at [[Imbros]] at the end of May. There she became a [[depot ship]] for all the seaplanes in the area, while her own aircraft continued to support operations at Gallipoli. On occasion, aircraft were loaned out to other ships for reconnaissance or observation missions.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 100\u201301</ref>\n\nThe ship left Imbros on 1 November for [[Mytilene]], from where her aircraft flew aerial reconnaissance missions over Smyrna, before she continued onwards to [[Salonika]], where she arrived on 8 November. While based there, her aircraft supported British troops [[Macedonian front (World War I)|fighting the Bulgarians]], spotted for British ships conducting shore bombardments, and conducted anti-submarine patrols. At this time, ''Ark Royal'' operated five Short 166s and a couple of Sopwith seaplanes. On 27 March 1917, the ship was transferred to [[Mudros]] to serve as a depot ship for all the seaplanes assigned to [[No. 2 Wing RNAS]], which controlled all RNAS aircraft in the area. By the end of 1917, she operated a mixture of [[Short Type 184]] and [[Sopwith Baby]] aircraft.<ref name=l2>Layman 1976, p. 102</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 20 January 1918, the Ottoman battlecruiser {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem||2}}, together with the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Midilli||2}}, (formerly the German ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'', and still with German crews), sortied from the Dardanelles to attack British warships based at Mudros.

''Ark Royal'' was transferred to Piraeus in October and was still there when the [[Armistice of Mudros]] with Turkey was signed on 31 October. The ship joined the Allied fleet that occupied [[Constantinople]] after the surrender.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 102\u201303</ref>\n\n===Interwar years and the Second World War===\nAfter the war, ''Ark Royal'' transported aircraft across the Black Sea to [[Batumi]], where they were ferried across the Caucasus to the British naval forces supporting White Russian forces fighting the Bolsheviks in the Caspian Sea during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The ship was withdrawn from the Black Sea in late 1919 and disembarked her seaplanes at [[Malta]] to load a dozen [[de Havilland DH-9]] bombers and 181 personnel of the supporting Z Force for transport to British Somaliland. The ship arrived in [[Berbera]] on 30 December and the squadron was unloaded to support the [[1920 conflict between British forces and Somaliland dervishes|air and land campaign]] against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|the Mad Mullah]]. ''Ark Royal'' served during this campaign solely as a depot and repair ship for the RAF. She was withdrawn before its conclusion and transferred to the Black Sea to support the White Russian forces there as they began to collapse. The ship twice ferried refugees from the Caucasian coast to the [[Crimea]] and, after the second voyage, had to be fumigated at Constantinople after an outbreak of [[typhus]] among her passengers. During the summer of 1920, ''Ark Royal'' ferried RAF aircraft and personnel to [[Basra]]. She then returned to Britain for a refit and was put into reserve at [[Rosyth]] in November.<ref name=l3>Layman 1976, p. 103</ref>\n\nShe was recommissioned in September 1922 to transport [[No. 4 Squadron RAF|4 Squadron]], equipped with a dozen [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]]s, out to the Dardanelles during the [[Chanak crisis]]. The aircraft were ferried semi-assembled and then transferred to the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}} where they were fully assembled. On 11 October, the F.2s flew from the carrier to an airfield at Kilya on the European side of the straits. The ship remained in the area until she was given a brief refit at Malta in early 1923. Now equipped with [[Fairey III]]D seaplanes, ''Ark Royal'' returned to the Dardanelles until she was transferred back to the United Kingdom late in the year. Upon her arrival, the ship was placed back in reserve and became the depot ship for the reserve of [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] at [[Sheerness]] until 1930.<ref name=l3/>\n\n[[File:WalrusAboardPegasusA 012031.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[amphibious aircraft]] making a low pass near seaplane tender HMS ''Pegasus'', September 1942]]\nIn 1930, ''Ark Royal'' was recommissioned again as a training ship and an aircraft catapult was installed on her forecastle, forward of her cranes. For the next nine years, the ship conducted trials and evaluations of catapults and seaplane launch and recovery equipment and techniques. On 21 December 1934, she was renamed HMS ''Pegasus'' to release her name for [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|a new carrier]] that was then beginning construction. The ship was assigned to Home Fleet when the Second World War began, and was mostly used to train sailors in catapult launching and shipboard recovery techniques. The ship used the [[Fairey Seafox]], [[Supermarine Walrus]], and [[Fairey Swordfish]] of the [[764 Naval Air Squadron]].<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 98, 100\u2013101</ref> She also served as an aircraft transport and was present in [[Scapa Flow]], having just delivered some aircraft, on 14 October when the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} was sunk by the {{GS|U-47|1938|6}}. As the closest ship to ''Royal Oak'', ''Pegasus'' was able to rescue some 400 survivors.<ref>Layman 1976, pp. 103\u201304</ref>\n\n''Pegasus'' was converted to the prototype fighter catapult ship in November 1940,<ref name=l4/> carrying three [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters from [[807 Naval Air Squadron|807 Squadron]] between 1 December and 10 February 1941, which were replaced by aircraft from [[804 Naval Air Squadron|804 Squadron]] between 10 February and 23 July.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 178, 187, 189</ref> These fighters were supposed to defend convoys against attacks from [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] maritime patrol bombers and to prevent them from radioing location reports to [[U-boat]]s. If out of range of land, the fighters would have to [[emergency landing|ditch]] at sea and hope to be recovered by a ship from their convoy.<ref>Poolman, pp. 39\u201341</ref> The ship escorted nine convoys between December 1940 and July 1941.<ref name=l4>Layman 1976, p. 104</ref> At some point during the war, the ship's anti-aircraft armament was supplemented with a pair of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm]] light [[anti-aircraft gun]]s mounted in the bow, the ship's [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was enlarged and the mast was replaced with a tripod mast bearing a [[Type 291 radar|Type 291]] air warning [[radar]].<ref>Lenton, pp. 112\u201313</ref> The ship then became a seaplane training ship again, hosting [[763 Naval Air Squadron|763 Squadron]] aboard from 20 April 1942 to 13 February 1944.<ref>Sturtivant, p. 98</ref> ''Pegasus'' then became a barracks ship until May 1946 and was then listed for disposal in June.<ref>Layman 1989, p. 47</ref>\n\nShe was sold to R. C. Ellerman on 18 October, renamed ''Anita I'', and [[Ship registry|registered]] under the Panamanian flag. Under the management of the Compania de Navigation Ellanita, the ship sailed from [[Cardiff]] to [[Antwerp]] in October 1947 to begin conversion to a freighter. The work ceased in early 1948 and ''Anita I'' was seized by her creditors and auctioned off to a Dutch shipbreaking firm on 16 June 1949. She was resold once more before the ship was purchased by the [[British Iron and Steel Corporation]] in October 1950. Later that year, the ship was broken up for scrap at [[Thos W Ward]] [[Grays]], Essex.<ref>Layman 1976, p. 105</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David K.|title=The Grand Fleet: Warship Design and Development 1906\u20131922|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|year=1999|isbn=1-55750-315-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=British Carrier Aviation: The Evolution of the Ships and Their Aircraft|year=1988|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=0-87021-054-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Layman|first=R.

He can be heard on the original cast recordings of Cole Porter's \"Can-Can\" and Kander & Ebb's \"70, Girls, 70\", where, among other songs, Conried performs a sensational, fast-paced patter song titled \"The Caper.\"\n\nEven as a younger man, Conried appeared much older than his actual age and he was frequently cast as middle-aged or even elderly pompous scholarly types. His inimitable growl and impeccable diction were well-suited to the roles he played, whether portraying the dim Professor Kropotkin in the radio show ''[[My Friend Irma (radio-TV)|My Friend Irma]]'' or as comic villains and mock-sinister or cranky types, such as Mr. Darling and [[Captain Hook]] in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (following the tradition of having both characters portrayed by the same actor), and [[The Grinch]]/Narrator from [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]''. According to the DVD commentary of ''[[Futurama]]'', he was the inspiration for the voice created for Robot Devil. He was a live action model reference of King Stefan in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', and though he was replaced by [[Taylor Holmes]] for the voice role, he recorded a few dialogues.\n\nConried was a cast member of other Dr. Seuss specials and ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', voicing the character of [[Snidely Whiplash]] in the [[Dudley Do-Right]] segments, a creation of Jay Ward and Bill Scott, as well as [[Wally Walrus]] on ''[[The Woody Woodpecker Show]]'', Professor Waldo P.

He was featured in the 1958 episode \"What Makes Opera Grand?\" on the anthology series ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]''. The episode, an analysis by [[Leonard Bernstein]], showing the powerful effect of music in opera, featured Conried as Marcello in a spoken dramatization of Act III of Puccini's ''[[La Boh\u00e8me]]''. The program demonstrated the effect of the music in ''La Boh\u00e8me'' by having actors speak portions of the libretto in English, followed by opera singers singing the same lines in the original Italian. <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0664962/ What Makes Opera Grand?

He also appeared as Uncle Tonoose on [[Danny Thomas]]' sitcom ''[[The Danny Thomas Show|Make Room for Daddy]]'', and in multiple roles on ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nConried was born on April 15, 1917 in Baltimore, Maryland to parents Edith Beryl (n\u00e9e Gildersleeve) and Hans Georg Conried Sr. His Connecticut-born mother was a descendant of [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], and his father was a Jewish immigrant from Vienna, Austria.<ref name=\"book1\">{{cite book| last=Gargiulo| first=Suzanne| author2=Leonard Maltin| title=Hans Conried: a biography| publisher=McFarland| year=2002| location=| pages=9\u201310| isbn=0-7864-1338-7}}</ref> He was raised in Baltimore and in New York City.\n\nHe studied acting at Columbia University and went on to play major classical roles onstage.

He became a [[M2 4.2 inch mortar|heavy mortar]] crewman then was sent to the Philippines as an engineer laborer until fellow actor [[Jack Kruschen]] obtained his release for service with the [[Armed Forces Radio Network]].<ref>p. 46 Gargiulo, Suzanne ''Hans Conried: A Biography; With a Filmography and a Listing of Radio, Television, Stage and Voice Work'' McFarland, 22 Aug. 2002</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Radio career and other voice work===\nOne of Conried's early radio appearances came in 1937, when he appeared in a supporting role in a broadcast of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' on [[KABC (AM)|KECA]] in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite news| title=Toscanini Will Conduct Vienna Orchestra on Air| url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2339301/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/| newspaper=The San Bernardino County Sun| date=July 26, 1937| page=11| via=[[Newspapers.com]]| accessdate=May 2, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> Four years later, a newspaper reported about his role on ''Hedda Hopper's Hollywood'': \"But at the mike, he's equally convincing as old men, drunks, dialeticians, or Shakesperean tragedians.

Other Broadway productions include ''[[70, Girls, 70]]'' and ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]''. He can be heard on the original cast recordings of Cole Porter's \"Can-Can\" and Kander & Ebb's \"70, Girls, 70\", where, among other songs, Conried performs a sensational, fast-paced patter song titled \"The Caper.\"\n\nEven as a younger man, Conried appeared much older than his actual age and he was frequently cast as middle-aged or even elderly pompous scholarly types. His inimitable growl and impeccable diction were well-suited to the roles he played, whether portraying the dim Professor Kropotkin in the radio show ''[[My Friend Irma (radio-TV)|My Friend Irma]]'' or as comic villains and mock-sinister or cranky types, such as Mr. Darling and [[Captain Hook]] in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (following the tradition of having both characters portrayed by the same actor), and [[The Grinch]]/Narrator from [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]''. According to the DVD commentary of ''[[Futurama]]'', he was the inspiration for the voice created for Robot Devil. He was a live action model reference of King Stefan in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', and though he was replaced by [[Taylor Holmes]] for the voice role, he recorded a few dialogues.\n\nConried was a cast member of other Dr. Seuss specials and ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', voicing the character of [[Snidely Whiplash]] in the [[Dudley Do-Right]] segments, a creation of Jay Ward and Bill Scott, as well as [[Wally Walrus]] on ''[[The Woody Woodpecker Show]]'', Professor Waldo P.  Wigglesworth on ''Hoppity Hooper'', and Dr. Dred on ''[[Drak Pack]]''. He also performed as the \"slave in the mirror\" character, hosting several memorable episodes of ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]''.\n\n===TV appearances===\n[[File:Hans Conried Uncle Tonoose Danny Thomas Show 1959.JPG|thumb|Conried as the grumpy Uncle Tonoose, a recurring role he played on ''[[The Danny Thomas Show|Make Room for Daddy]]'']]\nBesides hosting Jay Ward's ''[[Fractured Flickers]]'', Conried was a regular panelist on the pantomime program ''[[Stump the Stars]]'' and a semi-regular guest on the [[Ernie Kovacs]]-hosted game show ''[[Take a Good Look (TV series)|Take a Good Look]]''. He was a regular guest on [[Jack Paar]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'' from 1959 to 1962. Conried joined the cast of ''[[The Tony Randall Show]]'' during the 1977-78 season.\n\nHis many guest appearances included ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (as the English tutor Percy Livermore) ''[[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'', ''[[The Californians (TV series)|The Californians]]'', ''[[Meet McGraw]]'', ''[[Hey, Jeannie!]]'', ''[[Meet Mr. McNutley|The Ray Milland Show]]'', ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]'', ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', ''[[Mister Ed]]'', ''[[The Islanders (TV series)|The Islanders]]'', ''[[Ben Casey]]'', ''[[Dr. Kildare]]'', ''[[Lost in Space]]'', ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker|Kolchak]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''The Donna Reed Show'', ''What's It For'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' and ''[[Quark (TV series)|Quark]]''.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1964, Conried made 21 guest appearances as Danny Thomas' Uncle Tonoose in ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'' on ABC and then CBS. He was featured in the 1958 episode \"What Makes Opera Grand?\" on the anthology series ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]''. The episode, an analysis by [[Leonard Bernstein]], showing the powerful effect of music in opera, featured Conried as Marcello in a spoken dramatization of Act III of Puccini's ''[[La Boh\u00e8me]]''. The program demonstrated the effect of the music in ''La Boh\u00e8me'' by having actors speak portions of the libretto in English, followed by opera singers singing the same lines in the original Italian. <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0664962/ What Makes Opera Grand?

LCNE was broken in two. One of the successor companies, County Bus & Coach, with depots at Harlow, [[Hertford]] and [[Grays, Essex|Grays]], was bought by its management in 1990. In 1994 County was sold to [[National Express West Midlands|West Midlands Travel]], itself bought by [[National Express]] in 1995.

Harlow was allocated 25 [[AEC Regent III RT]]s, 16 [[AEC Routemaster]]s (to operate Green Line routes 718, 720 & 720A), seven RFs and two coach RFs. London Country North East and County Bus used the garage until [[Arriva|The Cowie Group]] purchased County Bus in 1997.\n\nThis was previously an Arriva East Herts & Essex garage, but it is now part of the [[Tellings-Golden Miller]] subsidiary with buses are branded as Network Harlow.

{"title_page": "List of Christmas carols", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}\nThis '''list of Christmas carols''' is organized by country, language or culture of origin.  Originally, a \"[[Christmas carol]]\" referred to a piece of vocal music in [[Carol (music)|carol form]] whose [[lyrics]] centre on the theme of [[Christmas]] or the Christmas season.\n\nMany traditional Christmas carols focus on the Christian celebration of the [[nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]], while others celebrate the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] that range from 25 December to 5 January. As a result, many Christmas Carols can be related to [[Saint Stephen's Day|St Stephen's Day]] (26 December), [[John the Apostle|St John's Day]] (27 December), [[Massacre of the Innocents|Feast of Holy Innocents]] (28 December), [[Saint Sylvester's Day|St Sylvester's Day]] (31 December), and the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. Examples of this are ''[[We Three Kings]]'' (an [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] song), and ''[[Good King Wenceslas]]'' (a carol for [[St. Stephen's Day]]). Nonetheless, some Christmas Carols, both religious and secular, now regarded as Christmas songs have become associated with the Christmas season even though the lyrics may not specifically refer to Christmas \u2013 for example, ''[[Deck the Halls]]'' (no religious references) and ''[[O Come, O Come, Emmanuel]]'' (an [[Advent]] chant). Other [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] focus on more secular Christmas themes, such as winter scenes, family gatherings, and [[Santa Claus]] (''[[Jingle Bells]]'', ''[[O Tannenbaum|O Christmas Tree]], [[Home for the Holidays (song)|Home for the Holidays]]'', ''[[Jolly Old Saint Nicholas|Jolly Old St. Nicholas]]'', etc.).\n\n==American==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"300\" | Title\n! width=\"250\" | Composer / lyricist\n! width=\"20\" | Year\n! width=\"300\" | Notes\n|-\n|\"[[Away in a Manger]]\"\n|First two stanzas unknown, often erroneously attributed to Martin Luther; third stanza written by John McFarland (1904)\n|1882\n|More than 40 settings are known.

Originally, a \"[[Christmas carol]]\" referred to a piece of vocal music in [[Carol (music)|carol form]] whose [[lyrics]] centre on the theme of [[Christmas]] or the Christmas season.\n\nMany traditional Christmas carols focus on the Christian celebration of the [[nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]], while others celebrate the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] that range from 25 December to 5 January. As a result, many Christmas Carols can be related to [[Saint Stephen's Day|St Stephen's Day]] (26 December), [[John the Apostle|St John's Day]] (27 December), [[Massacre of the Innocents|Feast of Holy Innocents]] (28 December), [[Saint Sylvester's Day|St Sylvester's Day]] (31 December), and the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. Examples of this are ''[[We Three Kings]]'' (an [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] song), and ''[[Good King Wenceslas]]'' (a carol for [[St. Stephen's Day]]). Nonetheless, some Christmas Carols, both religious and secular, now regarded as Christmas songs have become associated with the Christmas season even though the lyrics may not specifically refer to Christmas \u2013 for example, ''[[Deck the Halls]]'' (no religious references) and ''[[O Come, O Come, Emmanuel]]'' (an [[Advent]] chant). Other [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] focus on more secular Christmas themes, such as winter scenes, family gatherings, and [[Santa Claus]] (''[[Jingle Bells]]'', ''[[O Tannenbaum|O Christmas Tree]], [[Home for the Holidays (song)|Home for the Holidays]]'', ''[[Jolly Old Saint Nicholas|Jolly Old St. Nicholas]]'', etc.).\n\n==American==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"300\" | Title\n! width=\"250\" | Composer / lyricist\n! width=\"20\" | Year\n! width=\"300\" | Notes\n|-\n|\"[[Away in a Manger]]\"\n|First two stanzas unknown, often erroneously attributed to Martin Luther; third stanza written by John McFarland (1904)\n|1882\n|More than 40 settings are known.
