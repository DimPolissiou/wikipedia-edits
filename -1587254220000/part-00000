{"title_page": "Gaslighting", "text_new": "{{short description|Psychological manipulation via being made to question one's own judgment}}\n{{Other uses|Gaslight (disambiguation)}}\n'''Gaslighting''' is a form of [[psychological manipulation]] in which a person or a group covertly sows seeds of doubt in a targeted individual, making them question their own memory, perception, or judgment, often evoking in them [[cognitive dissonance]] and other changes such as low [[self-esteem]]. Using [[denial]], misdirection, contradiction, and [[misinformation]], gaslighting involves attempts to [[Destabilisation#Psychology|destabilize]] the victim and delegitimize the victim's beliefs. Instances can range from the denial by an [[abuse]]r that previous abusive incidents occurred to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim.\n\nThe term originated from the play ''[[Gas Light]]'' (1938, but originally performed as ''Angel Street'' in the United States) and its [[Gaslight (1940 film)|1940]] and [[Gaslight (1944 film)|1944]] film adaptations (both titled ''Gaslight'').

The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the [[Gas lighting|gas lights]] in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. He further uses the lights in the sealed-off attic to secretly search for jewels belonging to a woman whom he has murdered. He makes loud noises as he searches, including talking to himself. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, noises and voices, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane.<ref name=\"Stern\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-khhWM72pC8C|title=The Gaslight Effect: How to Spot and Survive the Hidden Manipulation Others Use to Control Your Life|last=Stern|first=Robin|date=2007-05-01|location=New York|publisher=Morgan Road Books|isbn=9780767924450|oclc=85766223|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref>{{rp|8}} He intends on having her assessed and committed to a mental institution, after which he will be able to gain power of attorney over her and search more effectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe term \"gaslighting\" has been used colloquially since the 1960s<ref>{{Cite OED|gaslight}} ''1969 S.

Born into a [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] family in [[Budapest]] in 1877, she graduated from public school in 1891. An accomplished linguist, she spoke or read eight languages. In her early career, she had difficulty finding a job that paid a living wage and was sensitized by that experience to women's employment issues. Gathering data to provide statistics on working women, Schwimmer came into contact with members of the international [[women's suffrage]] movement and by 1904 became involved in the struggle. She co-founded the first national women's labor [[umbrella organization]] in Hungary and the Hungarian [[Feminist Association]]. She also assisted in organizing the [[Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], hosted in Budapest in 1913.\n\nThe following year, Schwimmer was hired as a press secretary of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in London. When [[World War I]] broke out, she was branded an [[enemy alien]] and left Europe for the United States, where she spoke on suffrage and [[pacifism]]. She was one of the founders of the [[Woman's Peace Party]] and the organization which would become the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. In 1915, after attending the [[Women at the Hague|International Congress of Women]] in [[The Hague]], she worked with other feminists to persuade foreign ministers in Europe to support the creation of a body to peacefully mediate world affairs and was instrumental in convincing [[Henry Ford]] to charter the [[Peace Ship]]. From 1916 to 1918, Schwimmer lived in Europe working on various plans to end the war. With the establishment of the [[First Hungarian Republic]], she was appointed as one of the world's first female ambassadors (from Hungary to Switzerland) in 1918. When the Republic was toppled by a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'', she fled to the United States, renouncing her Hungarian citizenship.\n\nApplying for naturalization, Schwimmer was rejected on the basis of her pacifism. The case was overturned on appeal in 1928, and the following year the appeal was overturned by the [[US Supreme Court]] in the decision ''[[United States v. Schwimmer]]''. For the remainder of her life, she remained [[Statelessness|stateless]]. Unable to work because of ill-health and a smear campaign, she was supported by loyal friends. In 1935, Schwimmer and [[Mary Ritter Beard]] established the [[World Center for Women's Archives]] to create an educational reference for women's history and document the individual and organizational achievements of influential women. She was one of the first [[World Federalist Movement|world federalists]], proposing a world government in 1937. Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1948, she died before the committee decided not to award it that year. In 1952, naturalization laws in the United States were changed to allow for [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]].\n\n==Early years==\nR\u00f3zsa Schwimmer was born in [[Budapest]], [[Austria-Hungary]] on 11 September 1877 to Bertha (n\u00e9e Katscher) and Max Bernat Schwimmer.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}}{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} The oldest of three children, she was raised in an upper-middle-class [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] family in [[Temesv\u00e1r]], [[Transylvania]] (today [[Timi\u0219oara]], Romania).{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}}{{sfn|Cohen|2010}}{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}} Her father was an agricultural merchant, involved in trading grain, horses and other products,{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}}{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} who also ran an experimental farm. Her maternal uncle, [[Leopold Katscher]] was a noted writer and peace activist, who was a strong influence on Schwimmer. She attended primary school briefly in Budapest and after the family moved to Transylvania was educated in a convent school.{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} Graduating from the public school in 1891, she studied music and languages{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} at the music school in Szabadka (today [[Subotica]]).{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} Though she only attended eight grades, she spoke English, French, German, and Hungarian, and was able to read Dutch, Italian, Norwegian, and Swedish.{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} In 1893 and 1894, she took evening classes at a business school until her father's bankruptcy forced the family to return to Budapest.{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}}\n\n==Career==\n===Early career and politicization===\n[[File:Rosika Schwimmer, seated on bench.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The photograph of a woman wearing pince-nez glasses seated on an outdoor bench holding a lorgnette|Rosika Schwimmer, 1890s]]\nSchwimmer first worked as a [[governess]],{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}} and then had several short-term jobs in Temesv\u00e1r and Szabadka.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} In 1895, she found work as a [[bookkeeper]] and correspondent clerk.{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}}{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}} She began working for the ''N\u0151tisztvisel\u0151k Orsz\u00e1gos Egyes\u00fclete'' (National Association of Women Office Workers) in 1897{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}} and by 1901 had become president of the organization.{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}} Having experienced the difficulty of finding a job which paid a living wage, in an era when women were discouraged from seeking economic independence, Schwimmer chose to make a real difference for working women. Finding no acceptance or interest in addressing the issues women laborers encountered from national trade unions, she began collecting data to compile statistics. She wrote to the Department of Commerce to acquire data on women's employment and sought archived copies of ''Nemzeti N\u0151nevel\u00e9s'' (National Women's Education), the most important journal of the era which analyzed the condition of women in education and labor. To compare the situation in Hungary with that of working women elsewhere, Schwimmer began writing to international feminist organizations to collect statistics on women's working conditions in other countries.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}}\n\nThrough her correspondence to collect data, Schwimmer came in contact with influential figures of the international women's movement, like [[Aletta Jacobs]], [[Marie Lang]] and [[Adelheid Popp]], who encouraged her to found a women's organization that would unite various associations dealing with varied women's issues. When she lost her job at the National Association of Women Office Workers, Schwimmer began working as a journalist in late 1901. She wrote for ''Export Review'' and then was employed at Lloyd's News Agency, before becoming a regular contributor to international feminist magazines.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} She also worked as a translator, creating Hungarian versions of such works as ''Women and Economics'' by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]].{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=68}} In 1903, she co-founded with [[Mariska G\u00e1rdos]], the ''Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Munk\u00e1sn\u0151 Egyes\u00fclet'' (Hungarian Women Workers Association), the first national women's labor [[umbrella organization]].{{sfn|Wenger|2009}}{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}}{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} The following year, as part of the press, she attended the inaugural [[Second Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|conference]] of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]].{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}} She was asked to speak at the conference on labor conditions of industrial workers in Hungary.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} While there, she met many of the leading feminists of the international movement.

It published articles on careers, child care, domestic work, labor, legal issues and sexual abuse. She gained national prominence that year for a dispute with law professor and MP, {{ill|K\u00e1roly Kmety|hu|Kmety K\u00e1roly}}, who introduced a measure to implement stricter limits for women's admission to higher education. Kmety dubbed educated women as \"female monsters\", who aimed to destroy families. Schwimmer's rebuttal to his claims disclosed the fact that Kmety's wife had graduated from a [[normal school]]. Though she had won the argument, criticism of the Feminist Association continued.{{sfn|Ny\u00e1ry|2017}}\n\n[[File:Presidential table during the Seventh congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance IWSA in Budapest 1913.png|thumb|alt=A black and white photograph depicting the head table at a women's conference surrounded by seated delegates above whom are suspended flags of various nations|Presidential table during the Seventh congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance IWSA, Budapest, 1913]]\nIn 1911, Schwimmer married a journalist, P\u00e1l B\u00e9dy and took his name (''B\u00e9dy-Schwimmer'') but he either died in 1912, or they divorced in 1913.{{#tag:ref|There is evidence to support that even though numerous sources confirm the dates of her marriage and dissolution, it may be incorrect.

Schwimmer arranged for university students to provide translation services{{sfn|Harper|1922|pp=849\u2013850}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=11}} and presented an update on the progress of suffrage in Hungary.{{sfn|Harper|1922|p=856}} Trips were also organized to [[Debrecen]], Nagyv\u00e1rad (today [[Oradea]]) and [[Szeged]], as well as smaller villages, so that the feminists could see more of the country. The behavior of the feminists at the conference significantly changed the stereotypes that had previously been ascribed to women's rights advocates. After the close of the conference, Schwimmer changed the name of the Feminist Association's journal to ''A N\u0151'' (The Woman).{{sfn|Ny\u00e1ry|2017}} In August, she attended the [[Universal Peace Congress]] in [[The Hague]], which deepened her interest in [[pacifism]].{{sfn|Cohen|2010}}\n\nBy this time, Schwimmer had traveled widely throughout Europe on lecture tours. An extrovert and experienced journalist, she knew how to appeal to her audience.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=8}}  Known for her comedic wit and clever satire, she was able to convince men to support women's rights and caused women to laugh at men using pointed attacks laced with humor.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=9}} Thanks to her strong, energetic personality, which some described as stubborn, she often went beyond the limitations women were expected to observe.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=66}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=9}} She was an \"uncompromising pacifist\", a [[humanist]], and an [[atheist]].{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=346}} With her Jewish heritage and foreign status, she often experienced [[anti-Semitic]] and [[xenophobic]] attacks.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=67}} She smoked and drank wine, which was unusual at the time, and wore loose-fitting, [[Victorian dress reform|corsetless dresses]] with her trademark [[pince-nez]] glasses. Of stocky build, she typically wore her black, frizzy hair in a bun at the nape of her neck. She described herself as a \"very, very radical feminist\" and was known to elicit either love or hate from others\u2014\"frequently people did both at different times\".{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=66}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=9}}\n\n===Internationalism===\nSchwimmer's international contacts resulted in an invitation for her to become the press secretary of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, leading her to move to London for the job.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}} She also worked as a correspondent of various European newspapers.{{sfn|von Leitner|1998|p=99}} When [[World War I]] broke out, she could not return home and began to agitate for the end of hostilities.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}} She resigned from her post with the Suffrage Alliance, fearing her nationality would cause problems for the women's movement and her own ability to continue pressing for peace.{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=263}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=26\u201327}} Branded as an [[enemy alien]] in 1914, she left Britain{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=30\u201331}} to tour the United States and press for an end to the war.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}} Schwimmer spoke in 22 different states, urging women to press for diplomatic mediation of the European conflict.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=46}} She met with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Jennings Bryan]], but was unsuccessful in her attempts to organize a neutral conference to bring both sides of the conflict together.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}}\n\n[[File:International Congress of Women1915 (22785230005).jpg|thumb|320px|alt=A black and white photograph of thirteen women delegates seated at a head table of a conference|International Congress of Women in 1915. <br>Left to right: 1.

[[Chrystal Macmillan]] proposed that suffragists should hold a conference to discuss international peace principles and Aletta Jacobs suggested that the Netherlands, as a neutral nation, could host the event.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=61}} Schwimmer was asked to secure Catt as the chair of the conference but, unable to convince her, she approached social reformer, [[Jane Addams]], who agreed to serve as conference chair.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=87}}  At the [[Women at the Hague|International Congress of Women]], held in The Hague from 28 April, Schwimmer and [[Julia Grace Wales]], a Canadian academic, proposed a \"continuous conference of neutrals\" between governments be formed to mediate conflicts and restore peace.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=94}} During the conference the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace was established, which would become the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF).{{sfn|Jacobs|1996|p=94}} Schwimmer was selected as one of its board members.{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}}\n\nAfter the conference closed on 3 May 1915, Schwimmer, Addams and Jacobs, along with Macmillan, [[Emily Greene Balch]], [[Mien van Wulfften Palthe]]{{sfn|de Wilde|2018}}{{sfn|Caravantes|2004|p=102}} and others, formed two delegations of women who met with European heads of state over the next several months. The women secured agreement from reluctant foreign ministers, who overall felt that a mediating body would be ineffective. In spite of their hesitancy, the ministers agreed to participate, or at least not impede, the creation of a neutral assembly, if other nations agreed and if US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] would initiate its establishment. In the midst of the war, Wilson refused.{{sfn|Caravantes|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=110\u2013125}} By the time Schwimmer returned from Europe in the fall, sentiment had changed in the United States and many feminists believed that pacifism would hurt the cause for suffrage.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=123}} Disagreeing with them, Schwimmer did not think the struggle for women's rights should focus solely on attaining suffrage. She strongly believed broader changes were needed and women's voices were crucial for ending violence against humanity.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=70}} She also felt that neither Catt nor Addams worked hard enough to secure the broad support needed for peace work from reform-minded women.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=71}} Determined to continue pressing for a mediation conference, she decided that if politicians and feminists would not act, it would fall on individuals to work to end the war.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Schwimmer, Ford.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a seated woman and man in front of a desk with a standing man behind them and to the right.|Schwimmer, Ford and [[Louis P.

Teacher [[Rebecca Shelley]] and poet [[Angela Morgan]] became convinced that Ford and Schwimmer should meet. They arranged a series of demonstrations and public meetings in [[Detroit]] hoping that publicity would facilitate a meeting. When it did not have the desired effect, Shelley met with the editor of the ''[[Detroit Journal]]'' and a reporter, Ralph Yonker, who was a favorite of Ford, set up an interview for Schwimmer. Within three weeks, in early December, she set sail aboard a [[Peace Ship]] to [[Stockholm]], chartered by Ford, with him and other pacifists.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=157\u2013158}} The ''Oskar II'' arrived in [[Christiania, Norway]] on 18 December, but without a definite plan of how they would end the war.{{sfn|''The Tampa Tribune''|1915|p=1}} Without strong leadership from Ford, the pacifists on board jockeyed for power positions, and Schwimmer was resented for having been entrusted with the international correspondence from heads of state.

Having gained the country's [[First Hungarian Republic|independence]], [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]] was selected as the new [[Hungarian prime minister]]. He appointed Schwimmer as the ambassador to [[Switzerland]],{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}{{sfn|Glant|2002|p=46}} making her one of the world's first female ambassadors.{{sfn|Pastor|1974|pp=273\u2013282}}{{sfn|Cohen|2010}} K\u00e1rolyi also tabled a bill guaranteeing women's suffrage{{sfn|Ny\u00e1ry|2017}} for literate women over the age of 24, which was passed by the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Parliament]] later that year.{{sfn|Acs\u00e1dy|2008|p=242}} In February 1919, in [[Berne]], Schwimmer organized a peace conference for the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace; however, she was recalled from her post days before the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|communist ''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] in March. Barred from leaving Hungary, Schwimmer was unable to attend the Zurich Peace Conference in May.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=208}} [[B\u00e9la Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|communist government]] was soon overthrown by another ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' placing [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]] as the head of the government.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}{{sfn|Patai|2015|p=468}} Friedrich's inadequacy led Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]'s forces to try to establish order by implementing a reign of [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] by cleansing the country of Jews and communists.{{sfn|Patai|2015|p=468}}{{sfn|Szegedy-Maszak|2013|p=49}} In 1920, Schwimmer fled to [[Vienna]] where she lived as a refugee, financially supported by her friend [[Lola Maverick Lloyd]], until she secured permission to emigrate to the United States in 1921.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2006|p=484}}{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}\n\n===Statelessness===\nSchwimmer renounced her Hungarian citizenship{{sfn|Tresolini|1963|p=68}} and arrived in the United States on 26 August 1921, first settling in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], near [[Chicago]] with Lloyd.{{sfn|Immigration and Naturalization Service|1927|p=3254}}{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1921|p=1}} She had every intention of resuming her journalistic and lecturing career, but soon found she was blacklisted.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=216}} In 1919, New York State had launched the Lusk Investigation to examine the activities of radical people and organizations liable to threaten the nation's security. They included educators, journalists, reform organizations and religious institutions.{{sfn|Nielsen|2001|p=15}} Feminists and pacifists were branded as subversives; in particular, the women involved in the creation of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom were accused of a lack of loyalty because of their international focus and for leaning toward communism. As Schwimmer was one of the founders, she was listed as a dangerous element in the Lusk Report.{{sfn|Nielsen|2001|pp=43, 79}} Military officials and right-wing women's organizations, such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], joined in the [[Red Scare]] tactics to focus suspicion on the activities of pacifists and suffragists.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}\n\nCatt and Addams both drew criticism from anti-radical groups and because of her link to them, Schwimmer, and those who associated with her, became targets for those seeking to attack leaders in the feminist movement.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=78}} Schwimmer was accused of having prevented the United States from preparing sooner for the war, {{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=216}} was called a spy, and her peace initiatives were twisted from being humanitarian missions into strategic plots to aid the Germans and their allies. Other distortions accused her of having been a diplomat in Kun's brief communist regime and a member of an international Jewish conspiracy.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|pp=78\u201379}} To prevent the attacks leveled at Schwimmer from harming the campaign for suffrage, Catt distanced herself, causing her pain and a feeling of abandonment.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=80}} The Jewish community which had welcomed her before the war largely blamed Schwimmer for Ford's anti-Semitic campaign published between 1920 and 1922 in ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'', though Ford \"never indicated that Schwimmer played any such role\".{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=82}}\n\nIn 1924, Schwimmer applied for [[naturalization]] as a U.S. citizen.{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} When she completed the questionnaire, she left both the question about whether she had registered for the draft and whether she would take up arms in defense of the country blank, assuming they did not apply to women. After review, her file was returned to the Chicago office with a directive for Schwimmer to answer if she would bear arms. Against the advice of Fred Schlotfeldt, the District Director of Naturalization, Schwimmer, believing that as no woman was compelled to fight in any country honesty was required, answered that she would not personally take up arms.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=344}} Two years later, her second interview was called and she explained in detail that defending the country did not necessarily require her physical action, but instead could be a verbal or written defense of principles.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=345}} She was also questioned about her atheism, her views of nationalism, and her commitment to pacifism. Schwimmer responded that faith was a personal choice and in line with the idea of separation of church and state. She also stated that nationalism was a choice, that she had given up her Hungarian citizenship to pursue U.S. naturalization, and she reiterated that she would not compromise her pacifism.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=346}}\n\nAfter the interview, Schlotfeldt advised the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] that Schwimmer qualified for citizenship, but that she might have mental reservations about taking an oath of allegiance.

Born into a [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] family in [[Budapest]] in 1877, she graduated from public school in 1891. An accomplished linguist, she spoke or read eight languages. In her early career, she had difficulty finding a job that paid a living wage and was sensitized by that experience to women's employment issues. Gathering data to provide statistics on working women, Schwimmer came into contact with members of the international [[women's suffrage]] movement and by 1904 became involved in the struggle. She co-founded the first national women's labor [[umbrella organization]] in Hungary and the Hungarian [[Feminist Association]]. She also assisted in organizing the [[Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], hosted in Budapest in 1913.\n\nThe following year, Schwimmer was hired as a press secretary of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in London. When [[World War I]] broke out, she was branded an [[enemy alien]] and left Europe for the United States, where she spoke on suffrage and [[pacifism]]. She was one of the founders of the [[Woman's Peace Party]] and the organization which would become the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. In 1915, after attending the [[Women at the Hague|International Congress of Women]] in [[The Hague]], she worked with other feminists to persuade foreign ministers in Europe to support the creation of a body to peacefully mediate world affairs and was instrumental in convincing [[Henry Ford]] to charter the [[Peace Ship]]. From 1916 to 1918, Schwimmer lived in Europe working on various plans to end the war. With the establishment of the [[First Hungarian Republic]], she was appointed as one of the world's first female ambassadors (from Hungary to Switzerland) in 1918. When the Republic was toppled by a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'', she fled to the United States, renouncing her Hungarian citizenship.\n\nApplying for naturalization, Schwimmer was rejected on the basis of her pacifism. The case was overturned on appeal in 1928, and the following year the appeal was overturned by the [[US Supreme Court]] in the decision ''[[United States v. Schwimmer]]''. For the remainder of her life, she remained [[Statelessness|stateless]]. Unable to work because of ill-health and a smear campaign, she was supported by loyal friends. In 1935, Schwimmer and [[Mary Ritter Beard]] established the [[World Center for Women's Archives]] to create an educational reference for women's history and document the individual and organizational achievements of influential women. She was one of the first [[World Federalist Movement|world federalists]], proposing a world government in 1937. Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1948, she died before the committee decided not to award it that year. In 1952, naturalization laws in the United States were changed to allow for [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]].\n\n==Early years==\nR\u00f3zsa Schwimmer was born in [[Budapest]], [[Austria-Hungary]] on 11 September 1877 to Bertha (n\u00e9e Katscher) and Max Bernat Schwimmer.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}}{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} The oldest of three children, she was raised in an upper-middle-class [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] family in [[Temesv\u00e1r]], [[Transylvania]] (today [[Timi\u0219oara]], Romania).{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}}{{sfn|Cohen|2010}}{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}} Her father was an agricultural merchant, involved in trading grain, horses and other products,{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}}{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} who also ran an experimental farm. Her maternal uncle, [[Leopold Katscher]] was a noted writer and peace activist, who was a strong influence on Schwimmer. She attended primary school briefly in Budapest and after the family moved to Transylvania was educated in a convent school.{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} Graduating from the public school in 1891, she studied music and languages{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} at the music school in Szabadka (today [[Subotica]]).{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} Though she only attended eight grades, she spoke English, French, German, and Hungarian, and was able to read Dutch, Italian, Norwegian, and Swedish.{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} In 1893 and 1894, she took evening classes at a business school until her father's bankruptcy forced the family to return to Budapest.{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}}\n\n==Career==\n===Early career and politicization===\n[[File:Rosika Schwimmer, seated on bench.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The photograph of a woman wearing pince-nez glasses seated on an outdoor bench holding a lorgnette|Rosika Schwimmer, 1890s]]\nSchwimmer first worked as a [[governess]],{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}} and then had several short-term jobs in Temesv\u00e1r and Szabadka.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} In 1895, she found work as a [[bookkeeper]] and correspondent clerk.{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}}{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}} She began working for the ''N\u0151tisztvisel\u0151k Orsz\u00e1gos Egyes\u00fclete'' (National Association of Women Office Workers) in 1897{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}} and by 1901 had become president of the organization.{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}} Having experienced the difficulty of finding a job which paid a living wage, in an era when women were discouraged from seeking economic independence, Schwimmer chose to make a real difference for working women. Finding no acceptance or interest in addressing the issues women laborers encountered from national trade unions, she began collecting data to compile statistics. She wrote to the Department of Commerce to acquire data on women's employment and sought archived copies of ''Nemzeti N\u0151nevel\u00e9s'' (National Women's Education), the most important journal of the era which analyzed the condition of women in education and labor. To compare the situation in Hungary with that of working women elsewhere, Schwimmer began writing to international feminist organizations to collect statistics on women's working conditions in other countries.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}}\n\nThrough her correspondence to collect data, Schwimmer came in contact with influential figures of the international women's movement, like [[Aletta Jacobs]], [[Marie Lang]] and [[Adelheid Popp]], who encouraged her to found a women's organization that would unite various associations dealing with varied women's issues. When she lost her job at the National Association of Women Office Workers, Schwimmer began working as a journalist in late 1901. She wrote for ''Export Review'' and then was employed at Lloyd's News Agency, before becoming a regular contributor to international feminist magazines.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} She also worked as a translator, creating Hungarian versions of such works as ''Women and Economics'' by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]].{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=68}} In 1903, she co-founded with [[Mariska G\u00e1rdos]], the ''Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Munk\u00e1sn\u0151 Egyes\u00fclet'' (Hungarian Women Workers Association), the first national women's labor [[umbrella organization]].{{sfn|Wenger|2009}}{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}}{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} The following year, as part of the press, she attended the inaugural [[Second Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|conference]] of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]].{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}} She was asked to speak at the conference on labor conditions of industrial workers in Hungary.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} While there, she met many of the leading feminists of the international movement. Attracted to her charismatic personality, American suffragist [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] recruited Schwimmer to help in the efforts for [[women's suffrage]].{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=68}} The two developed a deep friendship with Catt mentoring her younger companion.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=69}}\n\nUpon her return home,{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}} Schwimmer co-founded the Hungarian [[Feminist Association]] ({{lang-hu|Feminist\u00e1k Egyes\u00fclete (FE)}}) with [[Vilma Gl\u00fccklich]].{{sfn|Frojimovics|2010}} They were joined by other prominent feminists like [[Eug\u00e9nia Miskolczy Meller]].{{sfn|Papp|Zimmermann|2006|pp=331&ndash;335}} The radical organization set out to work for gender equality in all aspects of women's lives,{{sfn|Zimmermann|1996}} including education, employment, access to birth control,{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=262}} reform of laws governing married women's socioeconomic status,{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=66}} enfranchisement, and women's inheritance rights,{{sfn|Ny\u00e1ry|2017}} as well as curtailing child labor.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=66}} In 1907, to counteract the unfavorable press they received from the media at large, the Feminist Association founded the journal ''A N\u0151 \u00e9s a T\u00e1rsadalom'' (Women and Society), with Schwimmer as editor-in-chief. It published articles on careers, child care, domestic work, labor, legal issues and sexual abuse. She gained national prominence that year for a dispute with law professor and MP, {{ill|K\u00e1roly Kmety|hu|Kmety K\u00e1roly}}, who introduced a measure to implement stricter limits for women's admission to higher education. Kmety dubbed educated women as \"female monsters\", who aimed to destroy families. Schwimmer's rebuttal to his claims disclosed the fact that Kmety's wife had graduated from a [[normal school]]. Though she had won the argument, criticism of the Feminist Association continued.{{sfn|Ny\u00e1ry|2017}}\n\n[[File:Presidential table during the Seventh congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance IWSA in Budapest 1913.png|thumb|alt=A black and white photograph depicting the head table at a women's conference surrounded by seated delegates above whom are suspended flags of various nations|Presidential table during the Seventh congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance IWSA, Budapest, 1913]]\nIn 1911, Schwimmer married a journalist, P\u00e1l B\u00e9dy and took his name (''B\u00e9dy-Schwimmer'') but he either died in 1912, or they divorced in 1913.{{#tag:ref|There is evidence to support that even though numerous sources confirm the dates of her marriage and dissolution, it may be incorrect.

Schwimmer arranged for university students to provide translation services{{sfn|Harper|1922|pp=849\u2013850}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=11}} and presented an update on the progress of suffrage in Hungary.{{sfn|Harper|1922|p=856}} Trips were also organized to [[Debrecen]], Nagyv\u00e1rad (today [[Oradea]]) and [[Szeged]], as well as smaller villages, so that the feminists could see more of the country. The behavior of the feminists at the conference significantly changed the stereotypes that had previously been ascribed to women's rights advocates. After the close of the conference, Schwimmer changed the name of the Feminist Association's journal to ''A N\u0151'' (The Woman).{{sfn|Ny\u00e1ry|2017}} In August, she attended the [[Universal Peace Congress]] in [[The Hague]], which deepened her interest in [[pacifism]].{{sfn|Cohen|2010}}\n\nBy this time, Schwimmer had traveled widely throughout Europe on lecture tours. An extrovert and experienced journalist, she knew how to appeal to her audience.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=8}}  Known for her comedic wit and clever satire, she was able to convince men to support women's rights and caused women to laugh at men using pointed attacks laced with humor.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=9}} Thanks to her strong, energetic personality, which some described as stubborn, she often went beyond the limitations women were expected to observe.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=66}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=9}} She was an \"uncompromising pacifist\", a [[humanist]], and an [[atheist]].{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=346}} With her Jewish heritage and foreign status, she often experienced [[anti-Semitic]] and [[xenophobic]] attacks.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=67}} She smoked and drank wine, which was unusual at the time, and wore loose-fitting, [[Victorian dress reform|corsetless dresses]] with her trademark [[pince-nez]] glasses. Of stocky build, she typically wore her black, frizzy hair in a bun at the nape of her neck. She described herself as a \"very, very radical feminist\" and was known to elicit either love or hate from others\u2014\"frequently people did both at different times\".{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=66}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=9}}\n\n===Internationalism===\nSchwimmer's international contacts resulted in an invitation for her to become the press secretary of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, leading her to move to London for the job.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}} She also worked as a correspondent of various European newspapers.{{sfn|von Leitner|1998|p=99}} When [[World War I]] broke out, she could not return home and began to agitate for the end of hostilities.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}} She resigned from her post with the Suffrage Alliance, fearing her nationality would cause problems for the women's movement and her own ability to continue pressing for peace.{{sfn|Hannam|Auchterlonie|Holden|2000|p=263}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=26\u201327}} Branded as an [[enemy alien]] in 1914, she left Britain{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=30\u201331}} to tour the United States and press for an end to the war.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}} Schwimmer spoke in 22 different states, urging women to press for diplomatic mediation of the European conflict.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=46}} She met with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Jennings Bryan]], but was unsuccessful in her attempts to organize a neutral conference to bring both sides of the conflict together.{{sfn|Wenger|2009}}\n\n[[File:International Congress of Women1915 (22785230005).jpg|thumb|320px|alt=A black and white photograph of thirteen women delegates seated at a head table of a conference|International Congress of Women in 1915. <br>Left to right: 1.

[[Chrystal Macmillan]] proposed that suffragists should hold a conference to discuss international peace principles and Aletta Jacobs suggested that the Netherlands, as a neutral nation, could host the event.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=61}} Schwimmer was asked to secure Catt as the chair of the conference but, unable to convince her, she approached social reformer, [[Jane Addams]], who agreed to serve as conference chair.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=87}}  At the [[Women at the Hague|International Congress of Women]], held in The Hague from 28 April, Schwimmer and [[Julia Grace Wales]], a Canadian academic, proposed a \"continuous conference of neutrals\" between governments be formed to mediate conflicts and restore peace.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=94}} During the conference the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace was established, which would become the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF).{{sfn|Jacobs|1996|p=94}} Schwimmer was selected as one of its board members.{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}}\n\nAfter the conference closed on 3 May 1915, Schwimmer, Addams and Jacobs, along with Macmillan, [[Emily Greene Balch]], [[Mien van Wulfften Palthe]]{{sfn|de Wilde|2018}}{{sfn|Caravantes|2004|p=102}} and others, formed two delegations of women who met with European heads of state over the next several months. The women secured agreement from reluctant foreign ministers, who overall felt that a mediating body would be ineffective. In spite of their hesitancy, the ministers agreed to participate, or at least not impede, the creation of a neutral assembly, if other nations agreed and if US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] would initiate its establishment. In the midst of the war, Wilson refused.{{sfn|Caravantes|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=110\u2013125}} By the time Schwimmer returned from Europe in the fall, sentiment had changed in the United States and many feminists believed that pacifism would hurt the cause for suffrage.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=123}} Disagreeing with them, Schwimmer did not think the struggle for women's rights should focus solely on attaining suffrage. She strongly believed broader changes were needed and women's voices were crucial for ending violence against humanity.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=70}} She also felt that neither Catt nor Addams worked hard enough to secure the broad support needed for peace work from reform-minded women.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=71}} Determined to continue pressing for a mediation conference, she decided that if politicians and feminists would not act, it would fall on individuals to work to end the war.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Schwimmer, Ford.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a seated woman and man in front of a desk with a standing man behind them and to the right.|Schwimmer, Ford and [[Louis P.

When it did not have the desired effect, Shelley met with the editor of the ''[[Detroit Journal]]'' and a reporter, Ralph Yonker, who was a favorite of Ford, set up an interview for Schwimmer. Within three weeks, in early December, she set sail aboard a [[Peace Ship]] to [[Stockholm]], chartered by Ford, with him and other pacifists.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=157\u2013158}} The ''Oskar II'' arrived in [[Christiania, Norway]] on 18 December, but without a definite plan of how they would end the war.{{sfn|''The Tampa Tribune''|1915|p=1}} Without strong leadership from Ford, the pacifists on board jockeyed for power positions, and Schwimmer was resented for having been entrusted with the international correspondence from heads of state. Confronted with ridicule and hostility by the press,{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=160\u2013161}}{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=75}} and in Schwimmer's case suspicion because of her Hungarian roots,{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=162}} Ford returned to the United States abandoning the peace mission to the Women's International Peace Association on 24 December.{{sfn|''The Tampa Tribune''|1915|p=1}}  Disappointed with Ford's efforts, Schwimmer persevered for several months, but exhaustion and a heart condition led her to resign and withdraw from the mission in March 1916.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=160\u2013161}} Failure to secure the backing of the peace mission from the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace and hurt by both Addams and Jacobs lack of support, she resigned from the committee.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=163}}{{sfn|Cohen|2010}} She was unable to return to the United States until August{{sfn|''The Modern View''|1916|p=3}} and stayed only about a month before she was back in Sweden, suffering from illness.{{sfn|Marshall|1916|p=5}}{{sfn|''The Grand Forks Herald''|1916|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Rosika Schwimmer, 1914.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white image of a seated woman wearing pince nez glasses and a beaded dress|Schwimmer, 1914]]\nAccording to [[Beth S.

Having gained the country's [[First Hungarian Republic|independence]], [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]] was selected as the new [[Hungarian prime minister]]. He appointed Schwimmer as the ambassador to [[Switzerland]],{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}{{sfn|Glant|2002|p=46}} making her one of the world's first female ambassadors.{{sfn|Pastor|1974|pp=273\u2013282}}{{sfn|Cohen|2010}} K\u00e1rolyi also tabled a bill guaranteeing women's suffrage{{sfn|Ny\u00e1ry|2017}} for literate women over the age of 24, which was passed by the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Parliament]] later that year.{{sfn|Acs\u00e1dy|2008|p=242}} In February 1919, in [[Berne]], Schwimmer organized a peace conference for the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace; however, she was recalled from her post days before the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|communist ''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] in March. Barred from leaving Hungary, Schwimmer was unable to attend the Zurich Peace Conference in May.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=208}} [[B\u00e9la Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|communist government]] was soon overthrown by another ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' placing [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]] as the head of the government.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}{{sfn|Patai|2015|p=468}} Friedrich's inadequacy led Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]'s forces to try to establish order by implementing a reign of [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] by cleansing the country of Jews and communists.{{sfn|Patai|2015|p=468}}{{sfn|Szegedy-Maszak|2013|p=49}} In 1920, Schwimmer fled to [[Vienna]] where she lived as a refugee, financially supported by her friend [[Lola Maverick Lloyd]], until she secured permission to emigrate to the United States in 1921.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2006|p=484}}{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}\n\n===Statelessness===\nSchwimmer renounced her Hungarian citizenship{{sfn|Tresolini|1963|p=68}} and arrived in the United States on 26 August 1921, first settling in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], near [[Chicago]] with Lloyd.{{sfn|Immigration and Naturalization Service|1927|p=3254}}{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1921|p=1}} She had every intention of resuming her journalistic and lecturing career, but soon found she was blacklisted.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=216}} In 1919, New York State had launched the Lusk Investigation to examine the activities of radical people and organizations liable to threaten the nation's security. They included educators, journalists, reform organizations and religious institutions.{{sfn|Nielsen|2001|p=15}} Feminists and pacifists were branded as subversives; in particular, the women involved in the creation of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom were accused of a lack of loyalty because of their international focus and for leaning toward communism. As Schwimmer was one of the founders, she was listed as a dangerous element in the Lusk Report.{{sfn|Nielsen|2001|pp=43, 79}} Military officials and right-wing women's organizations, such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], joined in the [[Red Scare]] tactics to focus suspicion on the activities of pacifists and suffragists.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=77}}\n\nCatt and Addams both drew criticism from anti-radical groups and because of her link to them, Schwimmer, and those who associated with her, became targets for those seeking to attack leaders in the feminist movement.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=78}} Schwimmer was accused of having prevented the United States from preparing sooner for the war, {{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=216}} was called a spy, and her peace initiatives were twisted from being humanitarian missions into strategic plots to aid the Germans and their allies. Other distortions accused her of having been a diplomat in Kun's brief communist regime and a member of an international Jewish conspiracy.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|pp=78\u201379}} To prevent the attacks leveled at Schwimmer from harming the campaign for suffrage, Catt distanced herself, causing her pain and a feeling of abandonment.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=80}} The Jewish community which had welcomed her before the war largely blamed Schwimmer for Ford's anti-Semitic campaign published between 1920 and 1922 in ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'', though Ford \"never indicated that Schwimmer played any such role\".{{sfn|Wenger|1990|p=82}}\n\nIn 1924, Schwimmer applied for [[naturalization]] as a U.S. citizen.{{sfn|Ruttum|2008|p=v}} When she completed the questionnaire, she left both the question about whether she had registered for the draft and whether she would take up arms in defense of the country blank, assuming they did not apply to women. After review, her file was returned to the Chicago office with a directive for Schwimmer to answer if she would bear arms. Against the advice of Fred Schlotfeldt, the District Director of Naturalization, Schwimmer, believing that as no woman was compelled to fight in any country honesty was required, answered that she would not personally take up arms.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=344}} Two years later, her second interview was called and she explained in detail that defending the country did not necessarily require her physical action, but instead could be a verbal or written defense of principles.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=345}} She was also questioned about her atheism, her views of nationalism, and her commitment to pacifism. Schwimmer responded that faith was a personal choice and in line with the idea of separation of church and state. She also stated that nationalism was a choice, that she had given up her Hungarian citizenship to pursue U.S. naturalization, and she reiterated that she would not compromise her pacifism.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=346}}\n\nAfter the interview, Schlotfeldt advised the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] that Schwimmer qualified for citizenship, but that she might have mental reservations about taking an oath of allegiance. Her case was called on 13 October 1927 with [[United States District Judge|Judge]] [[George A.

Nonetheless, he prepared the [[petition for certiorari]], which White clearly wanted.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|pp=353\u2013354}} In a 6 to 3 decision of the ''[[United States v.

Although she was never granted American citizenship, her life paralleled shifts in American society and values.

A rising conservatism affected feminist groups and transformed them.{{sfn|Wenger|1990|pp=91\u201392}} Although the Peace Ship mission was largely seen as a failure, it changed the war press coverage in Europe, which to that point had been highly censored. The conference that was established in Stockholm in February 1916 served as a clearinghouse for discussing the war and how to end it. It also helped neutral nations avoid bowing to the pressure to enter the war.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=161\u2013162}} Her citizenship case became the basis for a lengthy campaign to change the naturalization laws to recognize that philosophical or religious belief were inadequate reasons for denial of citizenship.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|pp=358\u2013359, 363}} In 1952, the law was finally changed to allow [[conscientious objector]]s to take an oath that they agree to serve in a non-combatant capacity.{{sfn|Flowers|Lahutsky|1990|p=362}}\n\n==Selected works==\n*{{cite book |last1=Schwimmer |first1=Rosika |title=Ehe-Ideale und Ideal-Ehen: Aeusserungen moderner Frauen |date=1905 |publisher=Continent |location=Berlin |language=German |oclc=246799896 |trans-title=Marriage Ideals and Ideal Marriages: Expressions of Modern Women}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=B.-Schwimmer |first1=R\u00f3zsa |title=A magyar n\u0151mozgalom r\u00e9gi dokumentumai |url=http://mtdaportal.extra.hu/ADATTAR/cikktar/b_cikk/bedy_schwimmer_rozsa_a_magyar_nomozgalom_regi_dokumentumai.pdf |date=1907 |location=Budapest |language=Hungarian |trans-title=Old Documents of the Hungarian Women's Movement}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Schwimmer |first1=Rosika |title=Zentralhaushaltung |url=https://archive.org/details/zentralhaushaltu00schw |date=1907 |publisher=Felix Dietrich |location=Leipzig |language=German |oclc=889838107 |trans-title=Central Housekeeping}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Schwimmer |first1=Rosika |title=Ohne Frauen kein allgemeines Wahlrecht |date=1908 |publisher=Druck von W. & S.
