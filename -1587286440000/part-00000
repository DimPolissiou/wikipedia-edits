It was as a wing that McCutcheon was selected to represent Wales when he was chosen for the second game of the [[1891 Home Nations Championship]]. Played away to Scotland at Raeburn Place, McCutcheon was one of three new Welsh caps in the game, the others being [[Ralph Sweet-Escott]] at half-back and [[David Daniel (rugby union)|David Daniel]] in the pack. Wales lost the game 15\u20130, and McCutcheon lost his place in the next game to [[Tom Pearson (rugby union, born 1872)|Tom Pearson]], who McCutcheon himself had replaced the game before.

During the [[1893 Home Nations Championship|1893 Championship]] McCutcheon was given his first full campaign, playing in all three games. In a complete turn around from the prior season, Wales won all their matches lifting the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history.

Despite a heavy defeat by England a month earlier, the Welsh selectors kept faith with majority of the team, so Thomas and Fitzgerald were the only two new caps. The Scottish attempted a half-hearted trial of the four three-quarter system, which did not prove fruitful; Wales won the game 7\u20130.\n\nThomas lost his place when Biggs returned for the final game of the tournament, but was back in the team the next season when he was chosen to play in the opening game of the [[1895 Home Nations Championship|1895 Championship]].

He was educated at [[Christ College, Brecon]] and later while at [[Oxford University]] he achieved a sporting [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]].<ref>[http://www.blackandambers.co.uk/Teams/Player?PersonId=101704 William Llewellyn Thomas player profile] Newport RFC website</ref>\n\n==Personal history==\nThomas was born in [[Brecon|Brecknock]], [[Wales]] in 1872 and was educated at [[Christ College, Brecon]] before attending Oxford University. While at Oxford he won a two sporting Blues in the 1893 and 1894 [[The Varsity Match|Varsity Matches]]. After leaving university he returned to Wales and became an assistant master at his old school, Christ College.<ref name=\"Jenkins156\">Jenkins (1991), p.156</ref> He was ordained into the church in 1899 and became a curate in Rushall. He later moved to [[Llandrindod Wells]] and in 1910 became captain of the local golf club. In 1912 he moved to [[Irton]] and was the village vicar until 1924 when he became the vicar of [[Bootle, Cumbria|Bootle]] in Cumbria; a position he held until his death in 1943.<ref name=\"Jenkins156\"/> Thomas was the cousin of [[England national rugby union team|English]] international [[Richard Budworth]].\n\n==Rugby career==\n[[File:Wales rugby team 1895.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Wales team of 1895 that faced England. Thomas is middle row, far right.]]\nThomas first played for Newport in the 1893/94 season, and in December 1893 was part of the Newport team that faced the Barbarians. Newport won 19\u20130 with Thomas and [[Wallace Watts]] both scoring two tries for the 'black and ambers'.<ref name=\"Starmer-Smith109\">Starmer-Smith (1977), pg 109.</ref> Thomas was later selected for the national side as part of the [[1894 Home Nations Championship]]. Brought in as a replacement for [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff's]] [[Norman Biggs]], Thomas was part of a three-quarters with team mate and Wales' captain [[Arthur Gould (rugby player)|'Monkey' Gould]], and Cardiff pairing [[Tom Pearson (rugby player)|Tom Pearson]] and [[Dai Fitzgerald]]. Despite a heavy defeat by England a month earlier, the Welsh selectors kept faith with majority of the team, so Thomas and Fitzgerald were the only two new caps. The Scottish attempted a half-hearted trial of the four three-quarter system, which did not prove fruitful; Wales won the game 7\u20130.\n\nThomas lost his place when Biggs returned for the final game of the tournament, but was back in the team the next season when he was chosen to play in the opening game of the [[1895 Home Nations Championship|1895 Championship]]. The Welsh team contained five new caps, but the England team they faced fielded ten international debuts. Although vastly more inexperienced, the English team were victorious, and in the away game to Scotland Thomas was replaced by [[Evan Lloyd (rugby player)|Evan Lloyd]].
