His work extended to many fields including eradication of [[untouchability]] and the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], and women's [[emancipation]].He is mostly known for his efforts in educating women and lower caste people. He and his wife, [[Savitribai Phule]], were pioneers of women education in India.

People from all religions and castes could become a part of this association which worked for the upliftment of the oppressed classes. Phule is regarded as an important figure in the social reform movement in Lagrange.\n\n==Early life==\nPhule was born in 1827 into a family that belonged to the [[Mali_caste|Mali]] caste, traditionally occupied as gardeners, vegetable vendors, and florists, and considered to be one of the Shudra varnas in the ritual ranking system of Hinduism.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The original surname of the family had been ''Gorhe'' and had its origins in the village of [[Katgun]], in present-day [[Satara District]], Maharashtra. Phule's great-grandfather worked as a ''chaugula'', a lowly type of village servant, in that village but moved to Khanwadi in [[Pune district]]. He prospered there but his only son, Shetiba, who was of poor intelligence, subsequently squandered what had been gained. Shetiba moved himself and his family, including three boys, to [[Pune|Poona]] in search of some form of income. The boys were taken under the wing of a florist, who taught them his trade. Their proficiency in growing and arranging became well known and they adopted the name of ''Phule'' (flower-man) in place of ''Gorhe''.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}} Their fulfillment of commissions from the [[Peshwa]], [[Baji Rao II]], for flower mattresses and other goods for the rituals and ceremonies of the royal court so impressed him that he granted them {{convert|35|acre|ha}} of land on the basis of the ''[[Inamdar (feudal title)|inam]]'' system, whereby no tax would be payable upon it.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The oldest brother machinated to take sole control of the property, leaving the younger two siblings,  Jyotirao Phule's father, Govindrao, to continue farming and also flower-selling.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}}\n\nGovindrao married Chimnabai and had two sons, of whom Jyotirao was the younger.

He joined the menfolk of his family at work, both in the shop and the farm. However, a Christian convert from the same Mali caste as Phule recognised his intelligence and persuaded Phule's father to allow Phule to attend the local Scottish Mission High School.<ref name=\"RobinsonKujur2010\">{{cite book|author1=Rowena Robinson|author2=Joseph Marianus Kujur|title=Margins of Faith: Dalit and Tribal Christianity in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRtBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT54|date=17 August 2010|publisher=SAGE Publishing India|isbn=978-93-86042-93-4}}</ref>{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=110|ps=}}{{efn|The Scottish Mission school was operated by the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]] and educated pupils from a wide range of castes.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=105|ps=}}}} Phule completed his English schooling in 1847.

He saw the subsequent [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent]] as more of the same sort of thing, being a repressive alien regime, but took heart in the arrival of the British, whom he considered to be relatively enlightened and not supportive of the ''varnashramadharma'' system instigated and then perpetuated by those previous invaders.{{sfnp|Figueira|2012|pp=147\u2013148|ps=}}{{efn|''Varnashramadharma'' has been described by [[Dietmar Rothermund]] as the Indian societal system that \"regulates the duty (''dharma'') of every man according to his caste (''varna'') and age-grade (''ashrama'')\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Soundings in Modern South Asian History |editor-first=D.

Shetiba moved himself and his family, including three boys, to [[Pune|Poona]] in search of some form of income. The boys were taken under the wing of a florist, who taught them his trade.

{"title_page": "File size", "text_new": "\n\n\n\n\n'''File size''' is a measure of how much [[Data (computing)|data]] a [[computer file]] contains or, alternately, how much [[Computer data storage|storage]] it consumes. Typically, file size is expressed in [[units of measurement]] based on the [[byte]]. By convention, file size units use either a [[metric prefix]] (as in [[megabyte]] and [[gigabyte]]) or a [[binary prefix]] (as in [[mebibyte]] and [[gibibyte]]).<ref name=\"J100B01\">{{Cite web\n|author=JEDEC Solid State Technology Association\n|title=Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols for Microprocessors, and Memory Integrated Circuits\n|work=JESD 100B.01\n|date=November 2019\n|page=8\n|url=http://www.jedec.org/down)d/search/JESD100B01.pdf\n|accessdate=2009-04-05\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen a file is written to a [[file system]], which is the case in most modern devices, it may consume slightly more [[disk space]] than the file requires. This is because the file system rounds the size up to include any unused space left over in the last [[disk sector]] used by the file. (A ''sector'' is the smallest amount of space addressable by the file system. The size of a disk sectors is several hundred or several thousands bytes.)  The wasted space is called '''slack space''' or '''internal fragmentation'''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itprotoday.com/microsoft-sql-server/what-slack-space|title=What is Slack Space?|date=2010-01-19|work=IT Pro|access-date=2018-02-17}}</ref>  Although smaller sector sizes allow for denser use of disk space, they decrease the operational efficiency of the file system.\n\nThe maximum file size a file system supports depends not only on the capacity of the file system, but also on the number of [[bit]]s reserved for the storage of file size information. The maximum file size in the [[FAT32]] file system, for example, is 4,294,967,295 bytes, which is one byte less than four gibibytes.<ref name=\"efi\">{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/1/161ba512-40e2-4cc9-843a-923143f3456c/fatgen103.doc |title=Microsoft Extensible Firmware Initiative FAT32 File System Specification, FAT: General Overview of On-Disk Format |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=2000-12-06 |accessdate=2011-07-03 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion table\n! colspan=\"5\" | Traditional units\n| \u2009\n! colspan=\"5\" | Decimal for comparison\n|-\n!

Sometimes kB, with lower cased SI-prefix 'k-' for kilo (1000), is used, then always equaling 1000 bytes.\n\nA file system may display all sizes with the metric system with only 'kB' on small files indicating it, while some file systems/operating systems would display sizes in, the traditionally used on computers, binary system for all sizes, e.g. 'KB', while hard disk manufacturers use the metric system (for e.g. GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes and TB = 1000 GB).\n\nFile transfers (e.g. \"downloads\") may use rates of units of bytes (e.g. MB/s) in binary rather than metric system, while networking hardware, such as [[WiFi]], always uses the metric system (Mbit/s, Gbit/s etc.). of units '''of [[bit]]s''' (and it needs to send more than the files themselves, so some overhead needs to be factored in), making superficially similar terms very incompatible.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Metric prefix]]\n* [[Units of information]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Computer Storage Volumes}}\n{{Computer files}}\n\n[[Category:Computer files]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n\n\n\n'''File size''' is a measure of how much [[Data (computing)|data]] a [[computer file]] contains or, alternately, how much [[Computer data storage|storage]] it consumes. Typically, file size is expressed in [[units of measurement]] based on the [[byte]]. By convention, file size units use either a [[metric prefix]] (as in [[megabyte]] and [[gigabyte]]) or a [[binary prefix]] (as in [[mebibyte]] and [[gibibyte]]).<ref name=\"J100B01\">{{Cite web\n|author=JEDEC Solid State Technology Association\n|title=Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols for Microprocessors, and Memory Integrated Circuits\n|work=JESD 100B.01\n|date=November 2019\n|page=8\n|url=http://www.jedec.org/down)d/search/JESD100B01.pdf\n|accessdate=2009-04-05\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen a file is written to a [[file system]], which is the case in most modern devices, it may consume slightly more [[disk space]] than the file requires. This is because the file system rounds the size up to include any unused space left over in the last [[disk sector]] used by the file. (A ''sector'' is the smallest amount of space addressable by the file system. The size of a disk sectors is several hundred or several thousands bytes.)  The wasted space is called '''slack space''' or '''internal fragmentation'''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itprotoday.com/microsoft-sql-server/what-slack-space|title=What is Slack Space?|date=2010-01-19|work=IT Pro|access-date=2018-02-17}}</ref>  Although smaller sector sizes allow for denser use of disk space, they decrease the operational efficiency of the file system.\n\nThe maximum file size a file system supports depends not only on the capacity of the file system, but also on the number of [[bit]]s reserved for the storage of file size information. The maximum file size in the [[FAT32]] file system, for example, is 4,294,967,295 bytes, which is one byte less than four gigabytes.<ref name=\"efi\">{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/1/161ba512-40e2-4cc9-843a-923143f3456c/fatgen103.doc |title=Microsoft Extensible Firmware Initiative FAT32 File System Specification, FAT: General Overview of On-Disk Format |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=2000-12-06 |accessdate=2011-07-03 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion table\n! colspan=\"5\" | Traditional units\n| \u2009\n! colspan=\"5\" | Decimal for comparison\n|-\n!
