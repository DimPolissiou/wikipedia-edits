His mother was [[Margaret Tyndal Winthrop|Margaret Tyndal]]. He was named after his mother's half-brother, Sir John Deane. He outlived all of his full and half-siblings. There is no known portrait of him.\n\nDeane was born in the village of [[Groton, Suffolk|Groton]] in [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. At the age of 12, he departed London, England with his older brother [[John Winthrop the Younger]], age 29, on the ship the ''Abigail'' in July 1635. He later settled and farmed in an area of the Town of Boston known as Pullen Point (Pulling Point), part of the area known to the native [[Massachusett]] tribe as Winnisimmet, which is today the Town of [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Plantation of Groton==\n\nIn the 1650s, he was involved in the project of settlement in the [[Nashoba Valley]] that became known as the Plantation of Groton (1655), named in honor of his birthplace where his father, John Winthrop, was [[Lord of the Manor]]. The area of the Plantation today comprises the Massachusetts towns of [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], [[Ayer, Massachusetts|Ayer]], almost all of [[Pepperell (town), Massachusetts|Pepperell]] and [[Shirley, Massachusetts|Shirley]], large parts of [[Dunstable, Massachusetts|Dunstable]], [[Littleton, Massachusetts|Littleton]], and [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]] plus smaller parts of [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]] and [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]], as well as [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Hollis, New Hampshire]]. Deane served as one of the original [[selectmen]] of the settlement, but his permanent residence was always Pullen Point.<ref name=\"Town of Groton\">[http://www.townofgroton.org/Town/GrotonHistory.aspx ''Groton History''], Groton (Massachusetts) website.

The land of the site was first granted in 1637 to Captain William Pierce (1595-1641), a renowned mariner and [[slave trader]]. Pierce (also spelled Peirce, Pearce, Pearse, etc. in various records) built a house on his land sometime after 1638.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capt.

He later rebuilt most of the house in 1675. This house is still intact and is maintained as a both a single family home and a museum. It is one of the oldest extent [[wood frame]] houses in the country. It is also the oldest continuously inhabited house in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deane Winthrop|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Deane-Winthrop/6000000005077233069|website=www.geni.com|accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nLike most settlers in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Deane was a [[Puritan]] Christian who dissented from certain practices retained by the [[Church of England]]. At the age of 25, he married Sarah Glover (1629-1684), daughter of the Rev. Jose Glover, and sister of his brother Adam Winthrop's wife in 1648. They had nine children together: Deane (b. 15 June 1651, died in infancy); Deane, again, (b. 6 Sept. 1653, died young); John (b. 1655, died young); Sarah (b. 11 February 1657); Margaret (b. 25 July 1660) who married Jotham Grover and had children; Elizabeth (b. 9 July  1663) who married Captain Samuel Kent and had children; Jose (b. 3 May 1666., d. 15 November 1702, aged 36, no children); Priscilla (b. 1 May 1669) who married Eliab Adams and had children; Mercy (b. 18 January 1673) who married Atherton Hough on 11 January 1700 and had children.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Pedigree of the Family of Winthrop|url=https://archive.org/stream/pedigreeoffamily00wint/pedigreeoffamily00wint_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|publisher=John Wilson and Son|accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nDeane's first wife, Sarah, died in 1684 at the age of about 55. In the same year, at the age of 61, he married Martha Mellows (1625-1716), aged 59. She was the widow of Captain John Mellows (or Mellhouse) of Boston. Deane also owned three slaves of African origin. They are mentioned by name in his will of 1702 as: Marrear, Primas, and a child named Robbin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capt.

Sewall was a prominent judge, businessman, and printer in [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. He is notorious for his involvement in the [[Salem Witch Trials]] of 1692-1693 (for which he later apologized). He provides this account of Deane Winthrop's burial in his diary:\n\n:\"March 16, 1703/4 Mr Deane Winthrop, of Pulling Point, dies upon his Birthday, just about the Breaking of it. He was Taken at eight aclock the evening before, as he sat in his chair, sunk first, being set up, he vomited, complained of his head, which were almost his last words. Hardly spake anything after his being in bed. 81 years old. He is the last of Govr Winthrop's children... statione novissimus exit. March 20. is buried at Pulling Point by his son and three Daughters. [Pall] Bearers [were] Russel, Cooke; Hutchinson, Sewall; Townsend, Paige. From the House of Hasey. Scutcheons on the Pall.

This is an allusion to Deane as the last child of John Winthrop to die. There were six pall bearers (in pairs on either side of the casket) mentioned by surname. The \"scutcheons\" mentioned on the funeral [[pall (funeral)|pall]] over the casket refer to his coat of arms inherited from his father (see entry below). Deane's \"son\" that Sewall refers to may have been Deane's stepson, a son of Martha and her first husband, as none of Deane's biological sons survived childhood except Jose. Jose however died two years before Dean not having fathered children.

In the [[Champ Car World Series]] and the [[IndyCar Series]], he achieved five wins and 24 podiums, as well as two third place championship finishes in [[2002 CART season|2002]] and [[2004 Champ Car season|2004]]. The long-time Champ Car driver switched to the IndyCar Series in 2005, and moved on to [[Grand Am Road Racing]] in 2007. After a few [[NASCAR]] races in 2007, he moved full-time into the series in 2008. Since 2009, he has only had part-time drives, so became a contractor and renovator in [[Montreal]], trading in real estate in [[Las Vegas]], as well as being a [[color commentator]] for television coverage of various racing series. He last competed part-time in the NASCAR [[Sprint Cup Series]], driving the No. 32 [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] for [[Go FAS Racing]].\n\n==Toyota Atlantic years==\n\nPatrick Carpentier started into [[Formula Ford|Formula Ford 2000 Canada]], before moving up to [[Atlantic Championship|Player's Toyota Atlantic Championship]] in 1992. He joined Lynx Racing in [[1995 Atlantic Championship season|1995]], whereby he won his first-ever race for the team around the streets of [[Museum Park (Miami)|Bicentennial Park (Miami)]]. He won again on the [[Nazareth Speedway]] oval, however the remainder of the season was marked by a variety of mechanical problems.<ref name=\"lynxracing\">[http://www.lynxracing.com/grad_carpentier.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909140717/http://www.lynxracing.com/grad_carpentier.html|date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\n1996 was a whole different story. During the course of the [[1996 Atlantic Championship season|Player's Toyota Atlantic Championship]], he would shatter every record in the 25-year history of the championship, including nine wins out of 12 races \u2013 eight of them in a row, from [[pole position]]. He rewrote the record book for this series, setting a new record for the most consecutive wins(8), most wins in a season (9), also most consecutive wins from pole (8), most laps led in a season and most accumulated points in a season (239pts).  This included a flag-to-flag victory at the [[1996 Canadian Grand Prix|Grand Prix Molson du Canada]] meeting.<ref name=lynxracing/><ref>[http://article.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-16/sports/9606160244_1_racing-mike-modano-dallas.stars]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref> After shattering [[Gilles Villeneuve]]'s long standing records, his 1996 Atlantic season propelled him to the major league Indycar series.\n\n==IndyCar career==\nAfter winning the 1996 [[1996 Atlantic Championship season|Player's Toyota Atlantic Championship]], Carpentier won a ride with [[HVM Racing|Bettenhausen/Alumax team]] in [[Champ Car|CART]], defeating several veteran racers from across the US and Europe, in a test held at [[Sebring International Raceway|Sebring]]. He debuted in CART in 1997 with Bettenhausen/Alumax team. In that first season, he was on pole at Nazareth, with a best finish was second at the inaugural race at [[Gateway Motorsports Park|Gateway]], the [[Emerson Indy 250|Motorola 300]]. He would also be crowned \"Rookie of the Year\".<ref name=lynxracing/>\n\nIn 1998, he started driving for [[Forsythe/Pettit Racing|Player's Forsythe Racing]], when the team expanded their operations to run a second alongside fellow Canadian, [[Greg Moore (racing driver)|Greg Moore]]. At the end of the following season, with the unfortunate death of Moore, in season finale, the [[1999 Marlboro 500|Marlboro 500]] at [[Auto Club Speedway|Fontana]], Carpentier became Forsythe's number one, when rookie [[Alex Tagliani]] was brought into the squad, keeping it an all-Canadian affair. In his early years he was prone to missing races through injuries, some of which originated off-track.<ref name=lynxracing/>\n\nHis first Champ Car victory came in 2001 in the [[2001 Harrah's 500|Harrah's 500]], at the [[Michigan International Speedway]], and would finish tenth in the overall end of year standing. In what was the last CART sanctioned [[Firestone Indy 400|Michigan 500]], he seized victory with a dramatic last-lap pass of [[Dario Franchitti]]. For Carpentier, this first CART win finally arrived in his 79th start. The following season, he would win twice, [[2002 Marconi Grand Prix of Cleveland|Marconi Grand Prix of Cleveland]], and [[2002 CART Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio|Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio]] and would take third in the championship standing. Carpentier was 5th overall in a disappointing 2003 season, despite winning the [[2003 Grand Prix of Monterey|Grand Prix of Monterey]], at the [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]] (compared to title-winning teammate [[Paul Tracy]]).<ref name=lynxracing/><ref name=\"globeandmail2304293\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalandmail.com/globe-drive/reviews/new-cars/motorsports/retired-from-racing-carpentier-working-than-ever/article2304293/page2/ |title=books from this publisher (ISBNs begin with 978-0-9755026) |publisher=Thames River Publishing |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Crowe |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-07-23/sports/0107230135_1_patrick-carpentier-dario-franchitti-max-papis |title=Good show, wild finish - tribunedigital-chicagotribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2001-07-23 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Patrick Carpentier Red Bull 83.jpg|thumb|left|Carpentier at Twin Ring Motegi in 2005]]\nTracy's performance weakened Carpentier's position within the team and rumours circulating pre-2004 season suggesting Carpentier would be dropped by Forsythe Racing, in favour of [[Rodolfo Lavin]]. Instead, [[Gerald Forsythe]] decided to run a third car for Lavin. Allegedly, Patrick kept his ride because of his marketing popularity in his homeland. He would repay Forsythe by retaining the Grand Prix of Monterey. Despite finishing higher than Paul Tracy in the 2004 championship, Carpentier left the team and the series for the 2005 season, joining [[Eddie Cheever]]'s [[Cheever Racing]] in the [[IndyCar Series]]. Due to his excellent record on oval tracks he was expected to do well (most of the IndyCar Series races are on ovals which had become virtually extinct in [[Champ Car]]), but uncompetitive [[Toyota]] engines prevented any major success. He ended 10th in the standings with two third places and 11 top 10s out of 17 races.<ref name=\"globeandmail2304293\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crash.net/indycar/news/19721/1/carpentier-keeps-forsythe-ride.html |title=IndyCar News - Carpentier keeps Forsythe ride |publisher=Crash.net |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\nIn his eight years in Champ Car, Carpentier finished in the top 10 74 times, and stood on the podium 22 times.\n\n==Sports car career==\n\nCheever lost its [[Red Bull]] sponsorship after the season and Carpentier was left without a ride as the now unsponsored team scaled back its IndyCar involvement dramatically, although he did race for Cheever in the [[2006 24 Hours of Daytona|2006 Rolex 24 at Daytona]], driving a [[Crawford Composites|Crawford-Lexus DP03]].\n\nCarpentier competed in the 2006 [[CASCAR]] Super Series event at [[Cayuga Speedway]]. He started 21st in the [[Dave Jacobs Racing]] car and finished sixth. From there he tried his hand at [[Grand-Am Road Racing]], running a partial season with [[SAMAX Motorsport]] piloting their [[Riley Technologies|Riley Mk XI]]. He re-signed for another season with SAMAX, to drive a Daytona Prototype in the 2007 Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, alongside either [[Milka Duno]] or [[Ryan Dalziel]]. The highlight of this partnership was their second place in the [[2007 24 Hours of Daytona|Rolex 24 at Daytona]]. The trio also shared their [[Riley Technologies|Riley-Pontiac Mk XI]] with another British driver, [[Darren Manning]]. They finished on the same lap as the winner, just 75.845 seconds behind after 24 hours of racing, leading for 121 of the 668 laps. Carpentier last race for SAMAX was the 400&nbsp;km Montreal, where he finished 10th, partnered by [[Kris Szekeres]], took place on August 3, 2007. He later left SAMAX to pursue a career in NASCAR, with his first race (the [[2007 NASCAR Busch Series#NAPA Auto Parts 200|NAPA Auto Parts 200]]) the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/race/Daytona-2007-01-28.html |title=Daytona 24 Hours 2007 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date=2007-01-28 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/race/Montreal-2007-08-03-16144.html |title=400 kms Montreal 2007 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==Stock car career==\n[[File:Patrick Carpentier Homestead-Miami.jpg|thumb|left|Patrick Carpentier practicing for the [[2007 Ford 400]] at Homestead-Miami Speedway]]\nCarpentier made his debut in the [[Busch Series|NASCAR Busch Series]] at Montreal's [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] on August 4, 2007, taking pole in qualifying and finished the controversial race in 2nd place, behind [[Kevin Harvick]], while [[Robby Gordon]] was disqualified by NASCAR from his first place spot for intentionally wrecking [[Marcos Ambrose]] and ignoring a resulting penalty.

He was the first by a foreign born in NASCAR's top division since Lloyd Shaw (from [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada) won the pole at [[Langhorne Speedway]] in June 1953. Come race day, he didn't give up the lead easily as he led the first four laps. \"That was a heck of a thrill,\" Carpentier said after the race. \"Winning the pole on Friday was certainly a highlight of my career. But leading those laps was unbelievable. It's hard to put into words.\" He would later be hit by brakes problems and would finish down in 31st place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valvoline.com/racing/news/nhra/2561 |title=Racing Sponsorships |publisher=Valvoline |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jayski.com/news/stats/story/_/page/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup-Series-All-Time-Pole-Winners |title=Jayski's\u00ae NASCAR Silly Season Site - Sprint Cup Series All-Time Pole Winners |publisher=Jayski.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\nOn July 5, 2008, Carpentier earned his best career Sprint Cup finish by finishing 14th in the [[Coke Zero 400]].\n\nOn August 30, 2008, Carpentier announced that he would be a free agent for the [[2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2009 Sprint Cup Series]], leaving Gillett Evernham Motorsports.

racing driver. In the [[Champ Car World Series]] and the [[IndyCar Series]], he achieved five wins and 24 podiums, as well as two third place championship finishes in [[2002 CART season|2002]] and [[2004 Champ Car season|2004]]. The long-time Champ Car driver switched to the IndyCar Series in 2005, and moved on to [[Grand Am Road Racing]] in 2007. After a few [[NASCAR]] races in 2007, he moved full-time into the series in 2008. Since 2009, he has only had part-time drives, so became a contractor and renovator in [[Montreal]], trading in real estate in [[Las Vegas]], as well as being a [[color commentator]] for television coverage of various racing series. He last competed part-time in the NASCAR [[Sprint Cup Series]], driving the No. 32 [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] for [[Go FAS Racing]].\n\n==Toyota Atlantic years==\n\nPatrick Carpentier started into [[Formula Ford|Formula Ford 2000 Canada]], before moving up to [[Atlantic Championship|Player's Toyota Atlantic Championship]] in 1992. He joined Lynx Racing in [[1995 Atlantic Championship season|1995]], whereby he won his first-ever race for the team around the streets of [[Museum Park (Miami)|Bicentennial Park (Miami)]]. He won again on the [[Nazareth Speedway]] oval, however the remainder of the season was marked by a variety of mechanical problems.<ref name=\"lynxracing\">[http://www.lynxracing.com/grad_carpentier.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909140717/http://www.lynxracing.com/grad_carpentier.html|date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\n1996 was a whole different story. During the course of the [[1996 Atlantic Championship season|Player's Toyota Atlantic Championship]], he would shatter every record in the 25-year history of the championship, including nine wins out of 12 races \u2013 eight of them in a row, from [[pole position]]. He rewrote the record book for this series, setting a new record for the most consecutive wins(8), most wins in a season (9), also most consecutive wins from pole (8), most laps led in a season and most accumulated points in a season (239pts).  This included a flag-to-flag victory at the [[1996 Canadian Grand Prix|Grand Prix Molson du Canada]] meeting.<ref name=lynxracing/><ref>[http://article.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-16/sports/9606160244_1_racing-mike-modano-dallas.stars]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref> After shattering [[Gilles Villeneuve]]'s long standing records, his 1996 Atlantic season propelled him to the major league Indycar series.\n\n==IndyCar career==\nAfter winning the 1996 [[1996 Atlantic Championship season|Player's Toyota Atlantic Championship]], Carpentier won a ride with [[HVM Racing|Bettenhausen/Alumax team]] in [[Champ Car|CART]], defeating several veteran racers from across the US and Europe, in a test held at [[Sebring International Raceway|Sebring]]. He debuted in CART in 1997 with Bettenhausen/Alumax team. In that first season, he was on pole at Nazareth, with a best finish was second at the inaugural race at [[Gateway Motorsports Park|Gateway]], the [[Emerson Indy 250|Motorola 300]]. He would also be crowned \"Rookie of the Year\".<ref name=lynxracing/>\n\nIn 1998, he started driving for [[Forsythe/Pettit Racing|Player's Forsythe Racing]], when the team expanded their operations to run a second alongside fellow Canadian, [[Greg Moore (racing driver)|Greg Moore]]. At the end of the following season, with the unfortunate death of Moore, in season finale, the [[1999 Marlboro 500|Marlboro 500]] at [[Auto Club Speedway|Fontana]], Carpentier became Forsythe's number one, when rookie [[Alex Tagliani]] was brought into the squad, keeping it an all-Canadian affair. In his early years he was prone to missing races through injuries, some of which originated off-track.<ref name=lynxracing/>\n\nHis first Champ Car victory came in 2001 in the [[2001 Harrah's 500|Harrah's 500]], at the [[Michigan International Speedway]], and would finish tenth in the overall end of year standing. In what was the last CART sanctioned [[Firestone Indy 400|Michigan 500]], he seized victory with a dramatic last-lap pass of [[Dario Franchitti]]. For Carpentier, this first CART win finally arrived in his 79th start. The following season, he would win twice, [[2002 Marconi Grand Prix of Cleveland|Marconi Grand Prix of Cleveland]], and [[2002 CART Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio|Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio]] and would take third in the championship standing. Carpentier was 5th overall in a disappointing 2003 season, despite winning the [[2003 Grand Prix of Monterey|Grand Prix of Monterey]], at the [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]] (compared to title-winning teammate [[Paul Tracy]]).<ref name=lynxracing/><ref name=\"globeandmail2304293\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalandmail.com/globe-drive/reviews/new-cars/motorsports/retired-from-racing-carpentier-working-than-ever/article2304293/page2/ |title=books from this publisher (ISBNs begin with 978-0-9755026) |publisher=Thames River Publishing |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Crowe |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-07-23/sports/0107230135_1_patrick-carpentier-dario-franchitti-max-papis |title=Good show, wild finish - tribunedigital-chicagotribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2001-07-23 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Patrick Carpentier Red Bull 83.jpg|thumb|left|Carpentier at Twin Ring Motegi in 2005]]\nTracy's performance weakened Carpentier's position within the team and rumours circulating pre-2004 season suggesting Carpentier would be dropped by Forsythe Racing, in favour of [[Rodolfo Lavin]]. Instead, [[Gerald Forsythe]] decided to run a third car for Lavin. Allegedly, Patrick kept his ride because of his marketing popularity in his homeland. He would repay Forsythe by retaining the Grand Prix of Monterey. Despite finishing higher than Paul Tracy in the 2004 championship, Carpentier left the team and the series for the 2005 season, joining [[Eddie Cheever]]'s [[Cheever Racing]] in the [[IndyCar Series]]. Due to his excellent record on oval tracks he was expected to do well (most of the IndyCar Series races are on ovals which had become virtually extinct in [[Champ Car]]), but uncompetitive [[Toyota]] engines prevented any major success. He ended 10th in the standings with two third places and 11 top 10s out of 17 races.<ref name=\"globeandmail2304293\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crash.net/indycar/news/19721/1/carpentier-keeps-forsythe-ride.html |title=IndyCar News - Carpentier keeps Forsythe ride |publisher=Crash.net |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\nIn his eight years in Champ Car, Carpentier finished in the top 10 74 times, and stood on the podium 22 times.\n\n==Sports car career==\n\nCheever lost its [[Red Bull]] sponsorship after the season and Carpentier was left without a ride as the now unsponsored team scaled back its IndyCar involvement dramatically, although he did race for Cheever in the [[2006 24 Hours of Daytona|2006 Rolex 24 at Daytona]], driving a [[Crawford Composites|Crawford-Lexus DP03]].\n\nCarpentier competed in the 2006 [[CASCAR]] Super Series event at [[Cayuga Speedway]]. He started 21st in the [[Dave Jacobs Racing]] car and finished sixth. From there he tried his hand at [[Grand-Am Road Racing]], running a partial season with [[SAMAX Motorsport]] piloting their [[Riley Technologies|Riley Mk XI]]. He re-signed for another season with SAMAX, to drive a Daytona Prototype in the 2007 Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, alongside either [[Milka Duno]] or [[Ryan Dalziel]].

Malta had the second-highest [[voter turnout]] in the world (and the highest for nations without [[mandatory voting]]), based on election turnout in national [[lower house]] elections from 1960 to 1995.<ref>Mark N. Franklin. \"Electoral Participation.\" in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior''</ref> The [[unicameral]] Parliament is made up of the [[President of Malta]] and the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] ({{lang-mt|Kamra tad-Deputati}}). The President of Malta, a largely ceremonial position, is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority.  Members of the House of Representatives are elected by direct universal suffrage through [[single transferable vote]] every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the president either on advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malta|prime minister]] or through the adoption of a motion of no confidence carried within the House of Representatives and not overturned within three days. In either of these cases, the president may alternatively choose to invite another Member of Parliament who invariably should command the majority of the House of Representatives to form an alternative government for the remainder of the legislature.\n\nThe House of Representatives is nominally made up of 65 members of parliament whereby 5 members of parliament are elected from each of the thirteen electoral districts. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The 80th article of the [[Constitution of Malta]] provides that the president appoint as prime minister \"... the member of the House of Representatives who, in his judgment, is best able to command the support of a majority of the members of that House\".<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nMaltese politics is a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Laburista}}), a centre-left [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Nazzjonalista}}), a centre-right [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party. The Labour Party has been the governing party since 2013, and is currently led by Prime Minister [[Robert Abela]], who has been in office since 13 January 2020. The Nationalist Party, with [[Adrian Delia]] as its leader, is currently in opposition. Two parliamentary seats are held by [[independent politician]]s who were formerly with the [[Democratic Party (Malta)|Democratic Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Demokratiku}}), a centre-left [[social liberalism|social liberal]] party which had contested under the Nationalist-led [[Forza Nazzjonali]] electoral alliance in 2017.

Councillors are elected every four years through the [[single transferable vote]]. People who are eligible to vote in the election of the Maltese [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] as well as resident [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the EU]] are eligible to vote. Due to system reforms, no elections were held before 2012. Since then, elections have been held every two years for an alternating half of the councils.\n\nLocal councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality (including repairs to non-arterial roads), allocation of local wardens and refuse collection; they also carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as collection of government rents and funds and answer government-related public inquiries.

It has been a place of pilgrimage since the medieval period.\n\nThe Acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] record that in 451 AD a certain Acacius was Bishop of Malta (''Melitenus Episcopus''). It is also known that in 501 AD, a certain Constantinus, ''Episcopus Melitenensis'', was present at the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]]. In 588 AD, [[Pope Gregory I]] deposed Tucillus, ''Miletinae civitatis episcopus'' and the clergy and people of Malta elected his successor Trajan in 599 AD.

Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese. As a result of the [[History of Malta#Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] and Spanish periods, and the rule of the Knights, Malta became the devout Catholic nation that it is today. It is worth noting that the Office of the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisitor of Malta]] had a very long tenure on the island following its establishment in 1530: the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798, after the Knights capitulated to the forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the period of the [[Republic of Venice]], several Maltese families emigrated to [[Corfu]].

Held in St John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta.]]\n\nThe arrival in Malta of [[Caravaggio]], who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionised local art. Two of Caravaggio's most notable works, ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]'' and ''[[Saint Jerome Writing (Valletta)|Saint Jerome Writing]]'', are on display in the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]] of the Conventual Church of St. John. His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino (1582\u20131637) and [[Stefano Erardi]] (1630\u20131716). However, the [[Baroque]] movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture. The glorious vault paintings of the celebrated Calabrese artist, [[Mattia Preti]] transformed the severe, Mannerist interior of the Conventual Church St. John into a Baroque masterpiece. Preti spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta, where he created many of his finest works, now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Valletta]]. During this period, local sculptor [[Melchiorre Caf\u00e0|Melchior Gaf\u00e0]] (1639\u20131667) emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:'Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches, Apples and other Fruit' by Francesco Noletti.jpg|thumb|Francesco Noletti's 'Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches and other Fruits'.]]\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, [[Naples|Neapolitan]] and [[Rococo]] influences emerged in the works of the Italian painters [[Luca Giordano]] (1632\u20131705) and [[Francesco Solimena]] (1657\u20131747), and these developments can be seen in the work of their Maltese contemporaries such as [[Gio Nicola Buhagiar]] (1698\u20131752) and [[Francesco Zahra]] (1710\u20131773). The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of [[Antoine de Favray]] (1706\u20131798), who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-03-26/news/antoine-favray-and-his-works-205443/|title=Antoine Favray And his works - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2020-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619120019/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-03-26/news/antoine-favray-and-his-works-205443|archive-date=19 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Neo-classicism]] made some inroads among local Maltese artists in the late-18th century, but this trend was reversed in the early 19th century, as the local Church authorities&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps in an effort to strengthen Catholic resolve against the perceived threat of Protestantism during the early days of British rule in Malta&nbsp;\u2013 favoured and avidly promoted the religious themes embraced by the [[Nazarene movement]] of artists.

During the reconstruction period that followed the Second World War, the emergence of the \"Modern Art Group\", whose members included Josef Kalleya (1898\u20131998), George Preca (1909\u20131984), Anton Inglott (1915\u20131945), [[Emvin Cremona]] (1919\u20131987), [[Frank Portelli]] (1922\u20132004), [[Antoine Camilleri (artist)|Antoine Camilleri]] (1922\u20132005), [[Gabriel Caruana]] (1929-2018) and [[Esprit Barthet]] (1919\u20131999) greatly enhanced the local art scene. This group of forward-looking artists came together forming an influential pressure group known as the Modern Art Group. Together they forced the Maltese public to take seriously modern aesthetics and succeeded in playing a leading role in the renewal of Maltese art. Most of Malta's modern artists have in fact studied in Art institutions in England, or on the continent, leading to the explosive development of a wide spectrum of views and to a diversity of artistic expression that has remained characteristic of contemporary Maltese art.

This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures.

Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their [[food craving|cravings]] for specific foods, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark (Maltese: ''xewqa'', literally \"desire\" or \"craving\"). Maltese and Sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child, such as the cycle of the moon on the anticipated date of birth, whether the baby is carried \"high\" or \"low\" during pregnancy, and the movement of a wedding ring, dangled on a string above the abdomen (sideways denoting a girl, back and forth denoting a boy).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nTraditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible, should the child die in infancy without receiving this vital Sacrament; and partly because according to Maltese (and Sicilian) folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a Christian, but \"still a Turk\". Traditional Maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include ''biskuttini tal-mag\u0127mudija'' (almond macaroons covered in white or pink icing), ''it-torta tal-marmorata'' (a spicy, heart-shaped tart of chocolate-flavoured almond paste), and a liqueur known as ''ro\u017colin'', made with rose petals, violets and almonds.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nOn a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as ''il-qu\u010b\u010bija'', where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible, [[crucifix]] or [[rosary beads]], a book, and so on.

The Maltese word for this custom is ''il-\u0121ilwa''. This custom along with many others has long since disappeared from the islands, in the face of modern practices.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nNew wives would wear the [[g\u0127onnella]], a traditional item of Maltese clothing. However, it is no longer worn in modern Malta. Today's couples are married in churches or chapels in the village or town of their choice. The nuptials are usually followed by a lavish and joyous wedding reception, often including several hundred guests. Occasionally, couples will try to incorporate elements of the traditional Maltese wedding in their celebration. A resurgent interest in the traditional wedding was evident in May 2007, when thousands of Maltese and tourists attended a traditional Maltese wedding in the style of the 16th century, in the village of [[\u017burrieq]]. This included ''il-\u0121ilwa'', which led the bride and groom to a wedding ceremony that took place on the [[parvis]] of St. Andrew's Chapel. The reception that followed featured folklore music (''[[g\u0127ana]]'') and dancing.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:The statue of St. George issuing from the Basilica on the third Sunday of July.jpg|thumb|The statue of St. George at the ''festa'' of [[Victoria, Gozo]]]]\n\nLocal festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, [[Baptism|christenings]] and, most prominently, [[saints]]' days, honouring the patron saint of the local parish. On saints' days, in the morning, the ''festa'' reaches its apex with a [[Mass (liturgy)|High Mass]] featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint. In the evening, then, a [[statue]] of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in respectful prayer. The atmosphere of religious devotion is preceded by several days of celebration and revelry: band marches, [[fireworks]], and late-night parties.\n\n[[Maltese Carnival|Carnival]] (Maltese: ''il-karnival ta' Malta'') has had an important place on the cultural calendar after [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Piero de Ponte]] introduced it to the islands in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to [[Ash Wednesday]], and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical [[float (parade)|floats]] presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: ''ir-Re tal-Karnival''), marching bands and costumed revellers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/malta/the-malta-independent-on-sunday/20170312/282226600527054|title=The Malta Independent on Sunday|last=|first=|date=12 March 2017|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2019-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219090605/https://www.pressreader.com/malta/the-malta-independent-on-sunday/20170312/282226600527054|archive-date=19 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malta - ZebbugM - Good Friday 225 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Holy Week procession]] in \u017bebbu\u0121]]\n[[Holy Week in Malta|Holy Week]] (Maltese: ''il-\u0120img\u0127a Mqaddsa'') starts on [[Palm Sunday]] (''\u0126add il-Palm'') and ends on [[Easter Sunday]] (''\u0126add il-G\u0127id'').

Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of [[Saint]]s [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[Saul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]. Its roots can be traced back to the pagan [[Roman Republic|Roman]] feast of ''Luminaria'' (literally, \"the illumination\"), when torches and bonfires lit up the early summer night of 29 June.<ref>''Malta Recent Economic and Political Developments Yearbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments'' {{ISBN|978-1-433-06350-3}} p. 41</ref>\n\nA national feast since the rule of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]], Mnarja is a traditional Maltese festival of food, religion and music. The festivities still commence today with the reading of the ''\"bandu\"'', an official governmental announcement, which has been read on this day in Malta since the 16th century. Originally, Mnarja was celebrated outside St. Paul's Grotto, in the north of Malta. However, by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the Cathedral of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], in [[Mdina]], and featured torchlight processions, the firing of 100 petards, horseraces, and races for men, boys and slaves. Modern Mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of [[Buskett]], just outside the town of [[Rabat Malta|Rabat]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIt is said that under the Knights, this was the one day in the year when the Maltese were allowed to hunt and eat [[hare|wild rabbit]], which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the Knights. The close connection between Mnarja and [[rabbit stew]] (Maltese: ''\"fenkata\"'') remains strong today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/23890/1/FENKATA.PDF|title=Fenkata: An emblem of Maltese peasant resistance?|last=Cassar|first=Carmel|date=1994|publisher=Ministry for Youth and the Arts|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218193705/https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/23890/1/FENKATA.PDF|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1854 British governor [[William Reid (British Army officer)|William Reid]] launched an agricultural show at Buskett which is still being held today.

Malta had the second-highest [[voter turnout]] in the world (and the highest for nations without [[mandatory voting]]), based on election turnout in national [[lower house]] elections from 1960 to 1995.<ref>Mark N. Franklin. \"Electoral Participation.\" in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior''</ref> The [[unicameral]] Parliament is made up of the [[President of Malta]] and the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] ({{lang-mt|Kamra tad-Deputati}}). The President of Malta, a largely ceremonial position, is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority.  Members of the House of Representatives are elected by direct universal suffrage through [[single transferable vote]] every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the president either on advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malta|prime minister]] or through the adoption of a motion of no confidence carried within the House of Representatives and not overturned within three days. In either of these cases, the president may alternatively choose to invite another Member of Parliament who invariably should command the majority of the House of Representatives to form an alternative government for the remainder of the legislature.\n\nThe House of Representatives is nominally made up of 65 members of parliament whereby 5 members of parliament are elected from each of the thirteen electoral districts. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The 80th article of the [[Constitution of Malta]] provides that the president appoint as prime minister \"... the member of the House of Representatives who, in his judgment, is best able to command the support of a majority of the members of that House\".<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nMaltese politics is a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Laburista}}), a centre-left [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Nazzjonalista}}), a centre-right [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party. The Labour Party has been the governing party since 2013, and is currently led by Prime Minister [[Robert Abela]], who has been in office since 13 January 2020. The Nationalist Party, with [[Adrian Delia]] as its leader, is currently in opposition. Two parliamentary seats are held by [[independent politician]]s who were formerly with the [[Democratic Party (Malta)|Democratic Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Demokratiku}}), a centre-left [[social liberalism|social liberal]] party which had contested under the Nationalist-led [[Forza Nazzjonali]] electoral alliance in 2017.

Councillors are elected every four years through the [[single transferable vote]]. People who are eligible to vote in the election of the Maltese [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] as well as resident [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the EU]] are eligible to vote. Due to system reforms, no elections were held before 2012. Since then, elections have been held every two years for an alternating half of the councils.\n\nLocal councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality (including repairs to non-arterial roads), allocation of local wardens and refuse collection; they also carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as collection of government rents and funds and answer government-related public inquiries.

It has been a place of pilgrimage since the medieval period.\n\nThe Acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] record that in 451 AD a certain Acacius was Bishop of Malta (''Melitenus Episcopus''). It is also known that in 501 AD, a certain Constantinus, ''Episcopus Melitenensis'', was present at the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]]. In 588 AD, [[Pope Gregory I]] deposed Tucillus, ''Miletinae civitatis episcopus'' and the clergy and people of Malta elected his successor Trajan in 599 AD.

Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese. As a result of the [[History of Malta#Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] and Spanish periods, and the rule of the Knights, Malta became the devout Catholic nation that it is today. It is worth noting that the Office of the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisitor of Malta]] had a very long tenure on the island following its establishment in 1530: the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798, after the Knights capitulated to the forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the period of the [[Republic of Venice]], several Maltese families emigrated to [[Corfu]].

Held in St John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta.]]\n\nThe arrival in Malta of [[Caravaggio]], who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionised local art. Two of Caravaggio's most notable works, ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]'' and ''[[Saint Jerome Writing (Valletta)|Saint Jerome Writing]]'', are on display in the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]] of the Conventual Church of St. John. His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino (1582\u20131637) and [[Stefano Erardi]] (1630\u20131716). However, the [[Baroque]] movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture. The glorious vault paintings of the celebrated Calabrese artist, [[Mattia Preti]] transformed the severe, Mannerist interior of the Conventual Church St. John into a Baroque masterpiece. Preti spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta, where he created many of his finest works, now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Valletta]]. During this period, local sculptor [[Melchiorre Caf\u00e0|Melchior Gaf\u00e0]] (1639\u20131667) emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:'Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches, Apples and other Fruit' by Francesco Noletti.jpg|thumb|Francesco Noletti's 'Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches and other Fruits'.]]\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, [[Naples|Neapolitan]] and [[Rococo]] influences emerged in the works of the Italian painters [[Luca Giordano]] (1632\u20131705) and [[Francesco Solimena]] (1657\u20131747), and these developments can be seen in the work of their Maltese contemporaries such as [[Gio Nicola Buhagiar]] (1698\u20131752) and [[Francesco Zahra]] (1710\u20131773). The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of [[Antoine de Favray]] (1706\u20131798), who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-03-26/news/antoine-favray-and-his-works-205443/|title=Antoine Favray And his works - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2020-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619120019/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-03-26/news/antoine-favray-and-his-works-205443|archive-date=19 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Neo-classicism]] made some inroads among local Maltese artists in the late-18th century, but this trend was reversed in the early 19th century, as the local Church authorities&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps in an effort to strengthen Catholic resolve against the perceived threat of Protestantism during the early days of British rule in Malta&nbsp;\u2013 favoured and avidly promoted the religious themes embraced by the [[Nazarene movement]] of artists.

During the reconstruction period that followed the Second World War, the emergence of the \"Modern Art Group\", whose members included Josef Kalleya (1898\u20131998), George Preca (1909\u20131984), Anton Inglott (1915\u20131945), [[Emvin Cremona]] (1919\u20131987), [[Frank Portelli]] (1922\u20132004), [[Antoine Camilleri (artist)|Antoine Camilleri]] (1922\u20132005), [[Gabriel Caruana]] (1929-2018) and [[Esprit Barthet]] (1919\u20131999) greatly enhanced the local art scene. This group of forward-looking artists came together forming an influential pressure group known as the Modern Art Group. Together they forced the Maltese public to take seriously modern aesthetics and succeeded in playing a leading role in the renewal of Maltese art. Most of Malta's modern artists have in fact studied in Art institutions in England, or on the continent, leading to the explosive development of a wide spectrum of views and to a diversity of artistic expression that has remained characteristic of contemporary Maltese art.

This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures.

Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their [[food craving|cravings]] for specific foods, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark (Maltese: ''xewqa'', literally \"desire\" or \"craving\"). Maltese and Sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child, such as the cycle of the moon on the anticipated date of birth, whether the baby is carried \"high\" or \"low\" during pregnancy, and the movement of a wedding ring, dangled on a string above the abdomen (sideways denoting a girl, back and forth denoting a boy).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nTraditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible, should the child die in infancy without receiving this vital Sacrament; and partly because according to Maltese (and Sicilian) folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a Christian, but \"still a Turk\". Traditional Maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include ''biskuttini tal-mag\u0127mudija'' (almond macaroons covered in white or pink icing), ''it-torta tal-marmorata'' (a spicy, heart-shaped tart of chocolate-flavoured almond paste), and a liqueur known as ''ro\u017colin'', made with rose petals, violets and almonds.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nOn a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as ''il-qu\u010b\u010bija'', where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible, [[crucifix]] or [[rosary beads]], a book, and so on.

The Maltese word for this custom is ''il-\u0121ilwa''. This custom along with many others has long since disappeared from the islands, in the face of modern practices.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nNew wives would wear the [[g\u0127onnella]], a traditional item of Maltese clothing. However, it is no longer worn in modern Malta. Today's couples are married in churches or chapels in the village or town of their choice. The nuptials are usually followed by a lavish and joyous wedding reception, often including several hundred guests. Occasionally, couples will try to incorporate elements of the traditional Maltese wedding in their celebration. A resurgent interest in the traditional wedding was evident in May 2007, when thousands of Maltese and tourists attended a traditional Maltese wedding in the style of the 16th century, in the village of [[\u017burrieq]]. This included ''il-\u0121ilwa'', which led the bride and groom to a wedding ceremony that took place on the [[parvis]] of St. Andrew's Chapel. The reception that followed featured folklore music (''[[g\u0127ana]]'') and dancing.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:The statue of St. George issuing from the Basilica on the third Sunday of July.jpg|thumb|The statue of St. George at the ''festa'' of [[Victoria, Gozo]]]]\n\nLocal festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, [[Baptism|christenings]] and, most prominently, [[saints]]' days, honouring the patron saint of the local parish. On saints' days, in the morning, the ''festa'' reaches its apex with a [[Mass (liturgy)|High Mass]] featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint. In the evening, then, a [[statue]] of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in respectful prayer. The atmosphere of religious devotion is preceded by several days of celebration and revelry: band marches, [[fireworks]], and late-night parties.\n\n[[Maltese Carnival|Carnival]] (Maltese: ''il-karnival ta' Malta'') has had an important place on the cultural calendar after [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Piero de Ponte]] introduced it to the islands in 1535.

Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of [[Saint]]s [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[Saul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]. Its roots can be traced back to the pagan [[Roman Republic|Roman]] feast of ''Luminaria'' (literally, \"the illumination\"), when torches and bonfires lit up the early summer night of 29 June.<ref>''Malta Recent Economic and Political Developments Yearbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments'' {{ISBN|978-1-433-06350-3}} p. 41</ref>\n\nA national feast since the rule of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]], Mnarja is a traditional Maltese festival of food, religion and music. The festivities still commence today with the reading of the ''\"bandu\"'', an official governmental announcement, which has been read on this day in Malta since the 16th century. Originally, Mnarja was celebrated outside St. Paul's Grotto, in the north of Malta. However, by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the Cathedral of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], in [[Mdina]], and featured torchlight processions, the firing of 100 petards, horseraces, and races for men, boys and slaves. Modern Mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of [[Buskett]], just outside the town of [[Rabat Malta|Rabat]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIt is said that under the Knights, this was the one day in the year when the Maltese were allowed to hunt and eat [[hare|wild rabbit]], which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the Knights. The close connection between Mnarja and [[rabbit stew]] (Maltese: ''\"fenkata\"'') remains strong today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/23890/1/FENKATA.PDF|title=Fenkata: An emblem of Maltese peasant resistance?|last=Cassar|first=Carmel|date=1994|publisher=Ministry for Youth and the Arts|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218193705/https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/23890/1/FENKATA.PDF|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1854 British governor [[William Reid (British Army officer)|William Reid]] launched an agricultural show at Buskett which is still being held today.

Some [[Historic Adventist]]s in the church argue that she is inerrant. Various contemporaries of Ellen White argued for the even stronger view of verbal inspiration.\n*Confirming doctrinal developments. The mainstream and most common Adventist view is that White's writings had a \"confirming\" not \"initiating\" role in the doctrinal development of the church, following the group's conclusions based on Bible study.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p=37}}\n\n=== Official position ===\nOne of the [[28 Fundamentals|28 Fundamental Beliefs]] of the church is\n:\"18. The Gift of Prophecy:\n:One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen. G. White. As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. ({{bibleverse||Joel|2:28,29|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|2:14-21|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Heb.|1:1-3|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Rev.|12:17|NIV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|19:10|NIV}}.)\"{{sfn|SDA Fundamental Beliefs}}\n\nFundamental Belief number one, \"Holy Scriptures,\" states in part,\n:\"The Holy Scriptures are the infallible revelation of His will. They are\u2026 the authoritative reveler of doctrines\u2026\"{{sfn|SDA Fundamental Beliefs}}\n\nThe [[Adventist baptismal vow]]s do not mention Ellen White specifically yet the set of 13 vows include:\n:\"8. I accept the biblical teaching of spiritual gifts and believe that the gift of prophecy is one of the identifying marks of the remnant church.\"<ref>Adventist baptismal vows, as quoted in the {{harvnb|Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[General Conference Session|General Conference in session]] made supportive statements in 2010, 2005{{sfn|Resolution on the Spirit of Prophecy}} and 1995:{{sfn|A Statement of Confidence in the Spirit of Prophecy}} \"Her writings continue to be a most positive influence in the life of the Church, providing for it comfort, guidance, instruction, correction, and theological stimulus. Their study will constantly lead the Church back to the Bible as the very foundation of faith and practice.\"{{sfn|Resolution on the Spirit of Prophecy}}\n\nAn earlier, unofficial list of 22 foundational beliefs first printed in 1931 served as a [[de facto]] standard placed less emphasis on White.\n:\"19. That God has placed in His church the gifts of the Holy Spirit, as enumerated in 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4. That these gifts operate in harmony with the divine principles of the Bible, and are given 'for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.' Eph. 4:12. That the gift of the Spirit of prophecy is one of the identifying marks of the remnant church. (1 Cor. 1:5\u20137; 1 Cor. 2:1\u201328 Rev. 12:17; Rev. 19:10; Amos 3:7; Hosea 12:10, 13.) They recognize that this gift was manifested in the life and ministry of Ellen G. White.\"{{sfn|1931 Seventh-Day Adventist Yearbook}}\n\n=== White's own views ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\nMrs. White's opinions regarding her own inspiration maintain a distinction between her own common fallible opinion as compared to the infallible opinion of God when He communicates a message to mankind. When speaking of God and His message given to prophets she strongly affirms infallible inspiration but when speaking of her own opinions she does not claim infallibility, and cites the Bible and God as the only source of perfection.  In some cases she'll make statements such as:\n\n\"I speak that which I have seen, and which I know to be true.\" <ref>(''Ellen White,'' Letter 4, 1896)</ref>\n\n\"\"I do not write one article in the paper expressing merely my own ideas. They are what God has opened before me in vision--the precious rays of light shining from the throne.\" <ref>(Testimonies, Vol. 5, pp. 63-67)</ref>\n\n\"God is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs and strengthening their faith, or He is not. This work is of God, or it is not. God does nothing in partnership with Satan. My work... bears the stamp of God or the stamp of the enemy. There is no halfway work in the matter. The Testimonies are of the Spirit of God, or of the devil.\" <ref name=\"For The Church Volume 4 p. 230\">(''Testimonies For The Church Volume 4'', Ellen White, p. 230)</ref>\n\n\"I testify the things which I have seen, the things which I have heard, the things which my hands have handled of the Word of life. And this testimony I know to be of the Father and the Son. We have seen and do testify that the power of the Holy Ghost has accompanied the presentation of the truth, warning with pen and voice, and giving the messages in their order. To deny this work would be to deny the Holy Ghost, and would place us in that company who have departed from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 2, p. 388)</ref>\n\n\"Many times in my experience I have been called upon to meet the attitude of a certain class, who acknowledged that the testimonies were from God, but took the position that this matter and that matter were Sister White's opinion and judgment. This suits those who do not love reproof and correction, and who, if their ideas are crossed, have occasion to explain the difference between the human and the divine.\nIf the preconceived opinions or particular ideas of some are crossed in being reproved by testimonies, they have a burden at once to make plain their position to discriminate between the testimonies, defining what is Sister White's human judgment, and what is the word of the Lord. Everything that sustains their cherished ideas is divine, and the testimonies to correct their errors are human\u2014Sister White's opinions. They make of none effect the counsel of God by their tradition.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 3, p. 68)</ref>\n\nEllen White also addresses the subject of common ordinary opinion and that every word spoken at the breakfast table (\"every word spoken in public or private\") is not inspired not even if spoken by one who has at times been given prophetic messages from God.\n\nIn response to a letter by a Dr. Paulson she says:\n\n\"But now I must respond to the letters received from you and others. In your letter you speak of your early training to have implicit faith in the testimonies and say, \"I was led to conclude and most firmly believe that every word that you ever spoke in public or private, that every letter you wrote under any and all circumstances, was as inspired as the Ten Commandments.\"\nMy brother, you have studied my writings diligently, and you have never found that I have made any such claims, neither will you find that the pioneers in our cause ever made such claims.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 1, p. 24)</ref>\n\nAnd thirdly Ellen White addresses the combination of the message given in vision vs the way or style in which one who has been given a vision chooses to convey that message. She appears to state this as a general principle applicable to all prophets whether they be Bible writers or not.\n\n\"Although I am as dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord in writing my views as I am in receiving them, yet the words I employ in describing what I have seen are my own, unless they be those spoken to me by an angel, which I always enclose in marks of quotation.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 1, p. 37)</ref>\n\n\"It is not the words of the Bible that are inspired, but the men that were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the man's words or his expressions but on the man himself, who, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But the words receive the impress of the individual [human] mind.  The divine mind is diffused. The divine mind and will is combined with the human mind and will; thus the utterances of the man are the word of God.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 1, p. 21)</ref>\n\n=== Higher authority ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\n\n\"In the testimonies sent to __________ I have given you the light God  has given to me. In no case have I given my own judgment or opinion. I have enough to write of what has been shown me, without falling back on my own opinions.\" Please notice \"In no case have I given my own judgment or opinion.\" (Testimonies to Battle Creek Church, 1882, p.&nbsp;58, Emphasis supplied) \"Permit me to express my mind, and yet not my mind, but the word of the Lord.\" <ref>(''Counsels to Writers and Editors'', Ellen White, p. 112)</ref>\n\nIn one instance, Ellen White said, \"I have no light on the subject [who would constitute the 144,000]. Please tell my brethren that I have nothing presented before me regarding the circumstances concerning which they write, and I can set before them only that which has been presented to me.\" <ref>(Quoted in a letter by C. C. Crisler to E. E. Andross, Dec. 8, 1914)</ref> That is a major responsibility of a prophet. A prophet cannot give his own opinion. A prophet cannot suggest what he thinks is true, because his listeners would assume that his opinion is the word of the Lord on that subject. So if the Lord has not spoken, the prophet must not speak.\n\nIn writing to an individual wanting guidance, she said, \"I am not at liberty to write to our brethren concerning your future work. . I have received no instruction regarding the place where you should locate... If the Lord gives me definite instruction concerning you, I will give it you; but I cannot take upon myself responsibilities that the Lord does not give me to bear.\" <ref>(Letter 96, Ellen White, 1909)</ref>\n\n\"This morning I attended a meeting where a select few were called together to consider some questions that were presented to them by a letter soliciting consideration and advice on these subjects. Of some of these subjects I could speak, because at sundry times and in diverse places many things have been presented to me... As my brethren read the selections from letters, I knew what to say to them; for this matter has been presented to me again and again... I have not felt at liberty to write out the matter until now.\" <ref>(Southern Work, Ellen White-pp. 97,98)</ref>\n\n\"It does not become anyone to drop a word of doubt here and there that shall work like poison in other minds, shaking their confidence in the messages which God has given, which have aided in laying the foundation of this work, and have attended it to the present day, in reproofs, warnings, corrections, and encouragements. To all who have stood in the way of the Testimonies, I would say, God has given a message to His people, and His voice will be heard, whether you hear or forbear. Your opposition has not hindered me; but you must give an account to the God of heaven, who has sent these warnings and instructions to keep His people in the right way. You will have to answer to Him for your blindness, for being a stumbling block in the way of sinners.\" <ref>(''1st Selected Messages'', Ellen White, p. 43)</ref> \"I saw the state of some who stood on present truth, but disregarded the visions,--the way God had chosen to teach in some cases, those who erred from Bible truth. I saw that in striking against the visions they did not strike against the worm--the feeble instrument that God spake through--but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was a small thing to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to slight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God chose to show them their errors through visions, and they disregarded the teachings of God through visions, they would be left to take their own way, and run in the way of error, and think they were right, until they would find it out too late.\" <ref>(''1st Selected Messages'', Ellen White, 40)</ref>\n\n\"What reserve power has the Lord with which to reach those who have cast aside His warnings and reproofs, and have accredited the testimonies of the Spirit of God to no higher source than human wisdom? In the Judgment, what can you who have done this, offer to God as an excuse for turning from the evidences He has given you that God was in the work?\" <ref>(''Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers'', Ellen White, p. 466)</ref>\n\nSome of White's statements on how inspiration or [[revelation]] from God works are found in the introduction to ''[[The Great Controversy (book)|The Great Controversy]]'' and pages 15 to 23 of ''[[Selected Messages]]'' volume 1.<ref>Compiled by the White Estate into the document \"[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/rev-egw.html Ellen G.

He writes \"The moon is called in Scripture the 'lesser light'. We know that it shines with 'borrowed light' from the sun. But this does not make the moon any less 'authoritative.' It has its sphere and its appointed task in God's creation. So when Ellen White uses this term to describe her work, she is not just being modest or humble; she is not saying that she is a second-class prophet; she is not saying that her messages are of a less important or less urgent nature than those of the Biblical prophets. Rather, she is emphasizing the function of her role and her messages. The work of any one prophet cannot be compared to the cumulative light that shines across the centuries from the many prophets whose works are found in the Holy Scriptures. But the source of her ministry is the same as theirs, and while her work was primarily for the Seventh-day Adventist church, this in no wise diminishes the importance of her role to that people. . . . She is one and the canonical prophets are many. But both she and they were commissioned by the Holy Spirit to accomplish specific tasks for God's people. It is important to discern the distinctive function of both.\" <ref>(Roy F. Graham, \"How the Gift of Prophecy Relates to God's Word.\" Adventist Review, Oct. 14, 1982, pp. 16, 18)</ref>\n\n=== ''Sola Scriptura'' and Ellen White ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist position does not deny ''[[Sola Scriptura]]'', because Scripture itself points to the continuance of prophecy in the church. Adventists state that they will have further messages coming from God in the same way that messages came through Bible prophets, according to [[First Thessalonians]] 5:20-21 where it is written : \"Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.\" (KJV){{citation needed|date=December 2013}}{{original research inline|date=December 2013}}\n\nSometimes it is suggested that Ellen White herself said that her writings were not necessary for our salvation. This statement may clarify her meaning. \"If man had kept the law of God, as given to Adam after his fall, preserved by Noah, and observed by Abraham, there would have been no necessity for the ordinance of circumcision. And if the descendants of Abraham had kept the covenant, of which circumcision was a sign, they would never have been seduced into idolatry, nor would it have been necessary for them to suffer a life of bondage in Egypt; they would have kept God's law in mind, and there would have been no necessity for it to be proclaimed from Sinai or engraved upon the tables of stone. And had the people practiced the principles of the ten commandments, there would have been no need of the additional directions given to Moses.\" (PP 364)\n\n=== Degrees of inspiration regarding Ellen White's writings and doctrinal authority ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\n\nCritics have debated between whether Ellen White is authoritative on devotional and counseling levels, but not on the doctrinal level. Adventists believe that as a prophet, Ellen White was able to give direction at many levels but that it is only God Himself that dictates doctrine, faith and practice through His Holy Spirit. So in their view once she is found to pass the Bible test of a prophet and then makes a claim that God has revealed some point to her that point must be accepted as something other than personal opinion. Even so, all of the statements of belief (the 28 Fundamental Beliefs) promoted by the Seventh-day Adventist church rest on the Bible alone as the test of the validity of each belief (as published on their official web site). The church claims that it is in response to the Bible command to accept God's prophets \u2013 to not despise prophetic statements or quench the Holy Spirit \u2013 that so many Seventh-day Adventists tend to follow Ellen White's counsels.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}{{original research inline|date=December 2013}}\n\n== Terminology ==\nAdventists think of her inspiration as a manifestation of the [[spiritual gift]] of [[prophecy]] described in the New Testament.

The Gift of Prophecy:\n:One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen. G. White. As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. ({{bibleverse||Joel|2:28,29|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|2:14-21|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Heb.|1:1-3|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Rev.|12:17|NIV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|19:10|NIV}}.)\"{{sfn|SDA Fundamental Beliefs}}\n\nFundamental Belief number one, \"Holy Scriptures,\" states in part,\n:\"The Holy Scriptures are the infallible revelation of His will.

Their study will constantly lead the Church back to the Bible as the very foundation of faith and practice.\"{{sfn|Resolution on the Spirit of Prophecy}}\n\nAn earlier, unofficial list of 22 foundational beliefs first printed in 1931 served as a [[de facto]] standard placed less emphasis on White.\n:\"19. That God has placed in His church the gifts of the Holy Spirit, as enumerated in 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4. That these gifts operate in harmony with the divine principles of the Bible, and are given 'for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.' Eph. 4:12. That the gift of the Spirit of prophecy is one of the identifying marks of the remnant church. (1 Cor. 1:5\u20137; 1 Cor. 2:1\u201328 Rev. 12:17; Rev. 19:10; Amos 3:7; Hosea 12:10, 13.)

White.\"{{sfn|1931 Seventh-Day Adventist Yearbook}}\n\n=== White's own views ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\nMrs. White's opinions regarding her own inspiration maintain a distinction between her own common fallible opinion as compared to the infallible opinion of God when He communicates a message to mankind. When speaking of God and His message given to prophets she strongly affirms infallible inspiration but when speaking of her own opinions she does not claim infallibility, and cites the Bible and God as the only source of perfection.  In some cases she'll make statements such as:\n\n\"I speak that which I have seen, and which I know to be true.\" <ref>(''Ellen White,'' Letter 4, 1896)</ref>\n\n\"\"I do not write one article in the paper expressing merely my own ideas. They are what God has opened before me in vision--the precious rays of light shining from the throne.\" <ref>(Testimonies, Vol. 5, pp. 63-67)</ref>\n\n\"God is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs and strengthening their faith, or He is not. This work is of God, or it is not. God does nothing in partnership with Satan. My work... bears the stamp of God or the stamp of the enemy. There is no halfway work in the matter. The Testimonies are of the Spirit of God, or of the devil.\" <ref name=\"For The Church Volume 4 p. 230\">(''Testimonies For The Church Volume 4'', Ellen White, p. 230)</ref>\n\n\"I testify the things which I have seen, the things which I have heard, the things which my hands have handled of the Word of life. And this testimony I know to be of the Father and the Son. We have seen and do testify that the power of the Holy Ghost has accompanied the presentation of the truth, warning with pen and voice, and giving the messages in their order. To deny this work would be to deny the Holy Ghost, and would place us in that company who have departed from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 2, p. 388)</ref>\n\n\"Many times in my experience I have been called upon to meet the attitude of a certain class, who acknowledged that the testimonies were from God, but took the position that this matter and that matter were Sister White's opinion and judgment. This suits those who do not love reproof and correction, and who, if their ideas are crossed, have occasion to explain the difference between the human and the divine.\nIf the preconceived opinions or particular ideas of some are crossed in being reproved by testimonies, they have a burden at once to make plain their position to discriminate between the testimonies, defining what is Sister White's human judgment, and what is the word of the Lord. Everything that sustains their cherished ideas is divine, and the testimonies to correct their errors are human\u2014Sister White's opinions. They make of none effect the counsel of God by their tradition.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 3, p. 68)</ref>\n\nEllen White also addresses the subject of common ordinary opinion and that every word spoken at the breakfast table (\"every word spoken in public or private\") is not inspired not even if spoken by one who has at times been given prophetic messages from God.\n\nIn response to a letter by a Dr. Paulson she says:\n\n\"But now I must respond to the letters received from you and others. In your letter you speak of your early training to have implicit faith in the testimonies and say, \"I was led to conclude and most firmly believe that every word that you ever spoke in public or private, that every letter you wrote under any and all circumstances, was as inspired as the Ten Commandments.\"\nMy brother, you have studied my writings diligently, and you have never found that I have made any such claims, neither will you find that the pioneers in our cause ever made such claims.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 1, p. 24)</ref>\n\nAnd thirdly Ellen White addresses the combination of the message given in vision vs the way or style in which one who has been given a vision chooses to convey that message. She appears to state this as a general principle applicable to all prophets whether they be Bible writers or not.\n\n\"Although I am as dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord in writing my views as I am in receiving them, yet the words I employ in describing what I have seen are my own, unless they be those spoken to me by an angel, which I always enclose in marks of quotation.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 1, p. 37)</ref>\n\n\"It is not the words of the Bible that are inspired, but the men that were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the man's words or his expressions but on the man himself, who, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But the words receive the impress of the individual [human] mind.  The divine mind is diffused. The divine mind and will is combined with the human mind and will; thus the utterances of the man are the word of God.\" <ref>(Selected Messages vol. 1, p. 21)</ref>\n\n=== Higher authority ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\n\n\"In the testimonies sent to __________ I have given you the light God  has given to me. In no case have I given my own judgment or opinion. I have enough to write of what has been shown me, without falling back on my own opinions.\" Please notice \"In no case have I given my own judgment or opinion.\" (Testimonies to Battle Creek Church, 1882, p.&nbsp;58, Emphasis supplied) \"Permit me to express my mind, and yet not my mind, but the word of the Lord.\" <ref>(''Counsels to Writers and Editors'', Ellen White, p. 112)</ref>\n\nIn one instance, Ellen White said, \"I have no light on the subject [who would constitute the 144,000]. Please tell my brethren that I have nothing presented before me regarding the circumstances concerning which they write, and I can set before them only that which has been presented to me.\" <ref>(Quoted in a letter by C. C. Crisler to E. E. Andross, Dec. 8, 1914)</ref> That is a major responsibility of a prophet. A prophet cannot give his own opinion. A prophet cannot suggest what he thinks is true, because his listeners would assume that his opinion is the word of the Lord on that subject. So if the Lord has not spoken, the prophet must not speak.\n\nIn writing to an individual wanting guidance, she said, \"I am not at liberty to write to our brethren concerning your future work. . I have received no instruction regarding the place where you should locate... If the Lord gives me definite instruction concerning you, I will give it you; but I cannot take upon myself responsibilities that the Lord does not give me to bear.\" <ref>(Letter 96, Ellen White, 1909)</ref>\n\n\"This morning I attended a meeting where a select few were called together to consider some questions that were presented to them by a letter soliciting consideration and advice on these subjects. Of some of these subjects I could speak, because at sundry times and in diverse places many things have been presented to me... As my brethren read the selections from letters, I knew what to say to them; for this matter has been presented to me again and again... I have not felt at liberty to write out the matter until now.\" <ref>(Southern Work, Ellen White-pp. 97,98)</ref>\n\n\"It does not become anyone to drop a word of doubt here and there that shall work like poison in other minds, shaking their confidence in the messages which God has given, which have aided in laying the foundation of this work, and have attended it to the present day, in reproofs, warnings, corrections, and encouragements. To all who have stood in the way of the Testimonies, I would say, God has given a message to His people, and His voice will be heard, whether you hear or forbear. Your opposition has not hindered me; but you must give an account to the God of heaven, who has sent these warnings and instructions to keep His people in the right way. You will have to answer to Him for your blindness, for being a stumbling block in the way of sinners.\" <ref>(''1st Selected Messages'', Ellen White, p. 43)</ref> \"I saw the state of some who stood on present truth, but disregarded the visions,--the way God had chosen to teach in some cases, those who erred from Bible truth. I saw that in striking against the visions they did not strike against the worm--the feeble instrument that God spake through--but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was a small thing to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to slight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God chose to show them their errors through visions, and they disregarded the teachings of God through visions, they would be left to take their own way, and run in the way of error, and think they were right, until they would find it out too late.\" <ref>(''1st Selected Messages'', Ellen White, 40)</ref>\n\n\"What reserve power has the Lord with which to reach those who have cast aside His warnings and reproofs, and have accredited the testimonies of the Spirit of God to no higher source than human wisdom? In the Judgment, what can you who have done this, offer to God as an excuse for turning from the evidences He has given you that God was in the work?\" <ref>(''Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers'', Ellen White, p. 466)</ref>\n\nSome of White's statements on how inspiration or [[revelation]] from God works are found in the introduction to ''[[The Great Controversy (book)|The Great Controversy]]'' and pages 15 to 23 of ''[[Selected Messages]]'' volume 1.<ref>Compiled by the White Estate into the document \"[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/rev-egw.html Ellen G.

Man's duty to God and to his fellow man has been distinctly specified in God's word, yet but few of you are obedient to the light given. Additional truth is not brought out; but God has through the Testimonies simplified the great truths already given, and in His own chosen way brought them before the people to awaken and impress the mind with them, that all may be left without excuse.\" <ref>(''Testimonies For The Church Volume 5'', Ellen White, p. 665)</ref>\n\n=== Modern interpretations and viewpoints ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\n\nRoy Graham, an Adventist scholar has explained his interpretation of what Ellen White's statement on being a lesser light means. He writes \"The moon is called in Scripture the 'lesser light'. We know that it shines with 'borrowed light' from the sun. But this does not make the moon any less 'authoritative.' It has its sphere and its appointed task in God's creation. So when Ellen White uses this term to describe her work, she is not just being modest or humble; she is not saying that she is a second-class prophet; she is not saying that her messages are of a less important or less urgent nature than those of the Biblical prophets. Rather, she is emphasizing the function of her role and her messages. The work of any one prophet cannot be compared to the cumulative light that shines across the centuries from the many prophets whose works are found in the Holy Scriptures. But the source of her ministry is the same as theirs, and while her work was primarily for the Seventh-day Adventist church, this in no wise diminishes the importance of her role to that people. . . . She is one and the canonical prophets are many. But both she and they were commissioned by the Holy Spirit to accomplish specific tasks for God's people. It is important to discern the distinctive function of both.\" <ref>(Roy F. Graham, \"How the Gift of Prophecy Relates to God's Word.\" Adventist Review, Oct. 14, 1982, pp. 16, 18)</ref>\n\n=== ''Sola Scriptura'' and Ellen White ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist position does not deny ''[[Sola Scriptura]]'', because Scripture itself points to the continuance of prophecy in the church. Adventists state that they will have further messages coming from God in the same way that messages came through Bible prophets, according to [[First Thessalonians]] 5:20-21 where it is written : \"Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.\" (KJV){{citation needed|date=December 2013}}{{original research inline|date=December 2013}}\n\nSometimes it is suggested that Ellen White herself said that her writings were not necessary for our salvation. This statement may clarify her meaning. \"If man had kept the law of God, as given to Adam after his fall, preserved by Noah, and observed by Abraham, there would have been no necessity for the ordinance of circumcision. And if the descendants of Abraham had kept the covenant, of which circumcision was a sign, they would never have been seduced into idolatry, nor would it have been necessary for them to suffer a life of bondage in Egypt; they would have kept God's law in mind, and there would have been no necessity for it to be proclaimed from Sinai or engraved upon the tables of stone. And had the people practiced the principles of the ten commandments, there would have been no need of the additional directions given to Moses.\" (PP 364)\n\n=== Degrees of inspiration regarding Ellen White's writings and doctrinal authority ===\n{{essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2013}}\n\nCritics have debated between whether Ellen White is authoritative on devotional and counseling levels, but not on the doctrinal level. Adventists believe that as a prophet, Ellen White was able to give direction at many levels but that it is only God Himself that dictates doctrine, faith and practice through His Holy Spirit. So in their view once she is found to pass the Bible test of a prophet and then makes a claim that God has revealed some point to her that point must be accepted as something other than personal opinion. Even so, all of the statements of belief (the 28 Fundamental Beliefs) promoted by the Seventh-day Adventist church rest on the Bible alone as the test of the validity of each belief (as published on their official web site). The church claims that it is in response to the Bible command to accept God's prophets \u2013 to not despise prophetic statements or quench the Holy Spirit \u2013 that so many Seventh-day Adventists tend to follow Ellen White's counsels.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}{{original research inline|date=December 2013}}\n\n== Terminology ==\nAdventists think of her inspiration as a manifestation of the [[spiritual gift]] of [[prophecy]] described in the New Testament.
