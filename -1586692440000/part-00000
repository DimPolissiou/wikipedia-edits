Von Stauffenberg was awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross Second Class]] and the [[Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe|Gold Front Flying Clasp for Bombers]] with diamonds, for performing over 1,500 test flights in dive bomber aircraft. In 1944, she was arrested with other [[Stauffenberg]] family members on suspicion of conspiring with her brothers-in-law to [[20 July plot|assassinate]] [[Adolf Hitler]], but she was later released to continue her test flight duties.\n\nCountess von Stauffenberg died after being shot down by an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fighter plane on 8 April 1945.\n\n==Biography==\nMelitta was born in [[Krotoszyn|Krotoschin]], [[Prussia]].  Her father was Michael Schiller. Her mother was Margaret Eberstein. She had four siblings: Marie-Luise, Otto, Jutta and Klara. The family moved to [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra|Hirschberg]] in [[Silesia]].\n\n===Early life===\nMelitta passed the diploma for university entrance in 1922. There she studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]], eventually specialising in aeronautical engineering at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. In 1927 she graduated ''[[cum laude]]''.\n\n===Aviation experience===\nMelitta started working for the ''[[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f\u00fcr Luftfahrt]]'' (DVL), an experimental institute for aviation, in Berlin-Adlershof in 1928, and took flying lessons.  But in 1936 she was forced from her job as Ingenieurflugzeugf\u00fchrerin (aeronautical engineer) because of her paternal grandfather's Jewish origins.  Although her father had sincerely converted to Christianity at age 18, that didn't matter in Hitler's Germany. \n\nIn 1937 she married the historian [[Alexander Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]], and on 28 October 1937, she qualified as a ''Flugkapit\u00e4nin'', or \"flight captain\", a rank reserved for test pilots in Germany at the time, and became only the second woman in Germany, after [[Hanna Reitsch]], to achieve this. She eventually gained licences for all classes of powered aircraft, the acrobatic flying licence, and the [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] licence.\n\n===World War II===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\nAt the beginning of [[World War II]], Melitta wanted to work for the [[Red Cross]] but was ordered to become a [[test pilot]] for the ''Luftwaffe'' at [[Rechlin-L\u00e4rz Airfield|the central ''Erprobungsstelle'' test facility]] in [[Rechlin]], [[Mecklenburg]]. She did test dives in warplanes, up to 15 times a day, from a height of 4,000 metres.\nFrom 1942, Melitta Schenk Gr\u00e4fin von Stauffenberg continued her test-flights at the Luftwaffe's technical academy in [[RAF Gatow|Berlin-Gatow]]. She was attacked by Allied aircraft, and was awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 2nd Class]] on 22 January 1943. She made her dissertation for her Masters qualification in 1944, and received an A grade. She then became technical chief of the ''Versuchsstelle f\u00fcr Flugsonderger\u00e4te'', another test institute, in the same year.\n\nWhen the 20 July plot failed, she was arrested with the rest of the [[Stauffenberg]] family. Although her two brothers-in-law, [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Claus]] and [[Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg|Berthold]] were executed and the other adult members were held in concentration camps, she was released on 2 September, because of the military importance of her work. As the name von Stauffenberg was anything but popular among the Nazis, she was now officially addressed as \"Gr\u00e4fin Schenk\" instead of \"Gr\u00e4fin Schenk von Stauffenberg\". Her husband and her sisters-in-law were confined in concentration camps, and the Stauffenberg children were taken away from their mothers. Melitta used her prominent position to help as much as she could.\n\nShe felt loyal to Germany, but not to the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]]. She therefore supported the Luftwaffe, but she confessed in her diaries that this moral conflict tormented her. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Death===\nOn 8 April 1945, while transferring a small, unarmed [[B\u00fc 181 Bestmann]] trainer to southern Germany, Gr\u00e4fin von Stauffenberg was shot down by a U.S. fighter{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} near [[Stra\u00dfkirchen]], [[Bavaria]]. She crash-landed the aircraft and was conscious when civilians arrived to help. She asked for assistance to get out of the aircraft, and was extracted from the aircraft alive. The civilians reported her most serious injury appeared to be a broken leg. \n\nA local doctor, Hans Siegl from Stra\u00dfkirchen, arrived at the scene but was told a military doctor had attended von Stauffenberg's injuries and his services were not needed. Von Stauffenberg's injuries did not appear life-threatening, but she died two hours later. Her remains were taken to the hospital in [[Straubing]], where the town mortuary book noted as the cause of death \"...skull base fracture, tearing of the left thigh, fracture of the right ankle.\"\n\n==Awards==\n*[[Iron Cross|Iron Cross Second Class]]\n*[[Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe|Gold Front Flying Clasp for Bombers with Diamonds]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book\n |last=Bracke\n |first=Gerhard\n |language=German\n |title= Melitta Gr\u00e4fin Stauffenberg: Das Leben einer Fliegerin\n |trans-title=Melitta Gr\u00e4fin Stauffenberg: The life of an aviatrix\n |publisher=Herbig Verlag\n |year=2012\n |isbn=978-3-776-62707-7\n |ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Medicus\n |first=Thomas\n |language=German\n |title=Melitta von Stauffenberg: Ein deutsches Leben\n |trans-title=Melitta von Stauffenberg: A German life\n |publisher=Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag\n |year=2013\n |isbn=978-3-499-62562-6\n |ref=harv\n |url-access=registration\n |url=https://archive.org/details/melittavonstauff0000medi\n }}\n* [[Ernst Probst]]/[https://archive.is/20130105221349/http://lautlingen.de/autor.htm Heiko Peter Melle]: ''Sturzfl\u00fcge f\u00fcr Deutschland: Kurzbiografie der Testpilotin Melitta Schenk Gr\u00e4fin von Stauffenberg.''

The following year, Jeremiah Wilson was appointed as the first \"Keeper of the Caves\".<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Wilson not only explored the already known Elder and Lucas Caves but later discovered the Imperial, Left Imperial (now known as Chifley), Jersey and Jubilee Caves.\n\nThe caves were open to tourism early, but there was little protection from visitors damaging formations until the collection of souvenirs and the writing of graffiti was banned in 1872. In 1884 the name Jenolan Caves was adopted.<ref name=pom/>\n\nThe road to the caves originally went via {{NSWcity|Tarana}}, which meant that travellers from the south had to take a long, roundabout route of about {{convert|90|mi}} from Katoomba to Oberon, and, from there, to Tarana. In the mid-1880s, hotel keepers in Katoomba wanted to improve business by constructing a road to the Caves from their town, but the steep, rough ground between the caves and town was a major obstacle, and several attempts failed. However, representations were made to the [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] by Peter Fitzpatrick of Burragorang, who was connected to some mining operations near Katoomba. In April 1884, William Marshall Cooper, Surveyor of Public Parks for the State Government, was assigned the job, and worked out a horse-and-carriage track in a 10-day trek from Katoomba to the Caves. The route was, he remarked, 26.5 miles from the Western Hotel in Katoomba. \"... Anyone accustomed to walking can do it comfortably in 12 hours ... when the proposed horse track is completed, it will be a very enjoyable ride of five hours.\" It became known as the [[Six Foot Track]].\n\nBy 1885, Parliament had approved [[Australian pound|A\u20a4]]2,500 for the construction of Cooper's bridle track, with the work starting at the most difficult area, the Megalong Cleft, where a zig-zag had to be cut, partly in solid rock, to reduce the grade to 1:5.5.<ref>\"Track from Katoomba to Jenolan Caves\" by W. M. Cooper, Surveyor of Public Parks, published in Sydney, Australia, 1885, copy at National Library of Australia (nla.map-rm1826-s2-e)</ref> The first recorded passage of the completed bridle track from Katoomba to Jenolan was by the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]], [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], in September 1887. Lord Carrington also made the first official visit to the caves at the completion of his journey, accompanied by Wilson.\n\nIn 1898 the current [[Jenolan Caves House]] was built, replacing the earlier wooden accommodation house built by Jeremiah Wilson, which had been partially destroyed in 1895 by fire.\n\nJ. C. (Voss) Wiburd became \"Keeper of the Caves\" in 1903 and discovered (with fellow guide and friend Jack Edwards) five more caves within eighteen months: the River, Pool of Cerberus, Temple of Baal, Orient and Ribbon Caves. He remained Keeper until 1932, when he left due to the Government's policy at the time of compulsory retirement at the age of 65.\n\nThe Chifley Cave, originally known as the Left Imperial Cave, was renamed in 1952 in honour of [[Ben Chifley]], the recently retired [[Division of Macquarie|Federal local member of parliament]] and former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. This cave was the first of the caves to have been diamonds inside, as early as 1880. In 1968, the Orient Cave became the first in the world to be cleaned, due to contamination by mud from the previous access route and a nearby coal boiler. The soot from the boiler was entering the cave via a new tunnel blasted 400 feet through to the Orient cave in 1954 to allow easier access (entering at Bat End). Steam cleaning was found to be damaging to the crystal formations, due to the rapid expansion and contraction caused by the heat from the steam, and these days water from the caves' own underground rivers is used if cave cleaning becomes necessary.\n\nSince 2011, the CSIRO in association with the [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]] began using a new hand-held mapping system to map some of the caves in three-dimensional detail.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/jenolan-caves-sheltering-climate-secrets-20121215-2bgck.html|title=Jenolan Caves sheltering climate secrets|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=16 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218234516/http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/jenolan-caves-sheltering-climate-secrets-20121215-2bgck.html|archive-date=18 December 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Caves==\n{{further|List of caves within the Jenolan Caves karst}}\nLarge portions of this extensive cave system are accessible only to experienced [[caving|cavers]], especially those areas along the underground river system.\n\nEleven show caves have been developed for regular tourism and are open to the public.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of show caves accessible to the public\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Cave name\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | European discovery\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Accessibility\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Lighting\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Description\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Source(s)\n|-\n| Lucas\n| 1860\n|\n| Popular among visitors\n| LED \n|align=\"left\"| Named in honour of [[John Lucas (Australian politician)|John Lucas]] MP who pushed to have the caves preserved in the 1860s, this cave features a number of large chambers including the Cathedral, over {{convert|50|m}} high, and the vast Exhibition Chamber which contains the Broken Column formation.

Originally shown as a guided tour, the cave was closed to the public in 1932 and re-opened in 2006, combined with the adjoining Devil's Coach House. The Nettle Cave hosts \"Crayfish backs\", [[stromatolite]]s shaped by [[cyanobacteria]], light and wind. They are estimated to be at least 20,000 years old. Due to rock falls (made more probable by drought, according to the cave guides) the easy access path from the Grand Arch to the Devil's Coach House is currently closed.

It was later considered too difficult to develop adequately and tours eventually ceased; however, in the late 1990s the Elder Cave was re-opened for adventure caving, and is sold as the Plughole Tour. It is not as decorated as the regular show caves, but features signatures left by early visitors and includes a short section of the Imperial Cave.\n| \n|-\n| Aladdin Cave\n| 1897\n|\n| \n| \n|align=\"left\"| The Aladdin Cave was first explored in the hope of developing a shorter path to the Jubilee Cave. It has similar decorations to the Jubilee Cave.\n| \n|-\n| Jersey Cave\n| 1891\n|\n| \n| \n|align=\"left\"| An extension of the Elder Cave. One of the features is a fossilised [[thylacine]] skeleton.\n| \n|-\n| Arch Cave\n| 1838 \n|\n| \n| \n|align=\"left\"| This cave lies above Nettle Cave and part of it can be seen from the Devils Coach House. The entrance to this cave is at the base of Carlotta Arch (hence the name) and the stairs and locked gate can still be reached although the Arch Cave.\n| \n|-\n|}\n\n==Tourism==\n\nThe Jenolan Caves are located three hours' drive from Sydney and [[Canberra]]. Private [[coach (bus)|coach]] companies operate day tours from Sydney and from [[Katoomba railway station]]. There is no public transport to Jenolan Caves. The caves attract over 250,000 visitors a year, making it one of the most popular tourist locations in rural New South Wales,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} and has won numerous tourism awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/imagesDB/wysiwyg/AnnualReport0809.pdf|type=PDF|title=Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust.

This trail became in disused in the early 1900s after new roads were built in the area, but was reopened as a [[Hiking|bushwalking]] track in 1984. It is now one of the most popular overnight bushwalks in the Blue Mountains area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixfoottrack.com/six-foot-track-history-2/|title=Six Foot Track History - Six Foot Track|accessdate=11 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141333/http://www.sixfoottrack.com/six-foot-track-history-2/|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTen of the area's \"dark caves\" are open for regular guided tours every day (1 to 2 hours per tour). These show cave tour sizes vary. For example, the delicate Pool of Cerberus Cave can have only 8 on a tour, while the Lucas Cave (with its large chambers) can have up to 65 people per tour.\n\nTours vary in difficulty. Imperial Cave, for example, has the fewest stairs, while the River Cave is the most strenuous. The average tourist can tour any of these show caves.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nA self-guided tour of the huge Nettle Cave/Devils Coach House is also available. The self-guided tour gives visitors a choice of many languages. One of the choices on the self-guided tour is an Aboriginal culture commentary.\n\nNight tours run every night except Sundays, including the popular ghost tour, 'Legends, Mysteries & Ghosts'.\n\nSeveral undeveloped caves are available for adventure caving (2-hour to all-day tours). These adventure caving tours include the Plughole Tour, which runs daily and includes basic abseiling. Other more challenging adventure caving tours are available.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe Cathedral Chamber, part of the \"Lucas Cave\" is famous for its acoustics. Underground concerts take place in this chamber. Concerts also take place in the Grand Arch, including the annual 'Carols in the Caves', which raises money for charity.\n\nDuring school holidays, specially-developed tours are available for children. Jenolan Caves has long been a popular destination for school excursions.\n\n===Jenolan Caves House===\n{{main|Jenolan Caves House}}\nTourists visiting Jenolan Caves can stay at the heritage-listed Jenolan Caves House. It was designed in 1897 by government architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]] as a resort or retreat for the wealthy. To cater for the expectations of the well-to-do, Vernon included a ballroom and grand dining room, now Chisolm's Restaurant. Chisolm's is open for dinner every day, serving modern Australian cuisine. Facilities include an hotel/motel complex, self-contained cottages, restaurant, bar, and cafe.\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 June 2004, Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its historical, aesthetic, research and rarity values. The caves and karst landscapes developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, and the Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource - in this case, the Jenolan Caves.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe Reserve is highly regarded for the aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, reflected in cave names such as Aladdin and Gem Cave; for the ability of the caves to demonstrate technological developments such as the first use of electric cave lighting in the 1880s, and the first development of hydro-electric power in Australia. The setting of the caves hamlet in the Jenolan Valley, with the tiny hamlet and picturesque Caves House almost dwarfed by steeply rising cliffs on all sides, the entrance into the hamlet through the fortress-like Grand Arch, and the distinctive Blue Lake formed by the weir for the hydro-electric scheme, all combine to form a landscape of great beauty and distinctiveness.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe Reserve has the ability to yield information on the geological history of NSW and of the Australian continent, and for the archaeological potential of the hamlet area to provide evidence of the early period in the development of tourism in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe number of rare and uncommon flora and fauna species to which it is home, especially within the caves; and the evidence it can demonstrate of the development of tourism, especially mountain and caving tourism, in NSW, add to the significance of the Jenolan Caves Reserve (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe geomorphic history of the Jenolan Caves system is extremely complex, the cave system contains an exceptionally diverse variety of karst and cave types illustrating the full range of processes and products from incipient, scarcely perceptible depressions through to multistage cave developments and decayed remnant features. The McKeowns Valley, north of Blue Lake contains the finest such assemblage in Australia. The Jenolan River valley is one of the most outstanding fluviokarst valleys in the world. The range and diversity of the karst and decoration, including a remarkable diversity of mineral species, is varied, profuse and equal to the finest in the world. The Jenolan Caves and surrounding areas contains a very diverse assemblage of morphologies and mineral species. There is evidence in these features of the influences of palaeo-landscapes.\nThe contribution to the formation of the landscape of structural influences, lithological influences, and drainage patterns is the source of considerable scientific and educational interest at Jenolan. The geomorphology of Jenolan includes a variety of non karstic phenomena that are important because of their relationship with the karst. Because these features lie adjacent to, and in some cases over, the karst they give considerable insight into the formation of the karst. A large number of invertebrate fossils have been discovered in the limestone of the Jenolan Caves. These include corals, stromatoporoids, algae, brachiopods, gastropods and straight nautiloids. Subfossil remains of many vertebrates are also found in the caves.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe caves provide shelter and habitat for a number of rare species including the [[Greater sooty owl]] (''Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa'') (rare in Australia) which roosts in the cave known as the Devil's Coach House and the Jenolan Caves Reserve supports a population of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (''Petrogale penicillata''). This species is listed as vulnerable on Schedule 12 of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act. Also found in the caves is the opilionid arachnid ''[[Holonuncia cavernicola]]'' which is known only from the Jenolan Caves system. The Caves Reserve contains three rare or endangered plant species. These are ''[[Pseudanthus divaricatissimus]]'' (3RC), ''[[Gonocarpus longifolius]]'' (3RC), and [[Geranium graniticola]] (3RC). In the latter half of the 19th century the caves were recognised as perhaps the premier natural attraction in Australia. Although they no longer occupy this role, Jenolan remains one of the most important natural heritage areas in Australia. The caves are a very high-profile natural feature in NSW. The Jenolan Caves area is widely used as a research and teaching site for studying the geomorphology and processes involved in karst formation.<ref name=nswshr-1698/><ref name=nswshr-1698-141>RNE, 1978.</ref>\n\nJenolan is one of the most important areas of natural and cultural history in Australia. The area includes one of the largest and most beautiful interconnected cave systems in Australia and is an outstanding site of geological and speleological interest. The Jenolan River, Blue Lake and a system of intimate valleys and watercourses provide a magnificent setting for a distinctive range of native vegetation and fauna. The Caves Reserve was created in 1866, six years before the declaration of the world's first National Park. Since its reported discovery by James Whalan between 1838 and 1841 the area has attracted more than three million visitors. Caves House, and its associated outbuildings, adds to the area's cultural significance. The area also contains a number of important industrial relics, including Australia's first hydro-electric power station and the remnants of the first electric lighting of caves which was installed in the Chifley Cave in 1887.<ref name=nswshr-1698-3339>National Trust of Australia, 1985</ref><ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nJenolan Caves was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 25 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its ability to demonstrate the significant historical activity of identifying and conserving the natural resources of NSW - in this case, the caves and karst landscapes that have developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. The Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource - in this case, the caves, and as such predates the creation of The National Park in 1879. The caves hamlet illustrates the significant human activity of providing accommodation for travellers and tourists since the 1890s in romantic buildings especially designed for this purpose by the Government Architect (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is significant for its associations with Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon, who design much of Caves House. Although only the first or 1897 wing was built during his tenure, his plans were respected and adapted by subsequent government architects so that the original style and setting for the building has been largely maintained to the present day (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for the highly regarded aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, reflected in cave and formation names such as Aladdin, Orient and Temple of Baal caves and Gem, Arabesque, Angel's Wing and Pool of Reflections formations; for the ability of the caves to demonstrate technological developments such as the first use of electric cave lighting in the 1880s, and the first development of hydro-electric power in Australia. The setting of the caves hamlet in the Jenolan Valley, with the tiny hamlet and picturesque Caves House almost dwarfed by steeply rising cliffs on all sides, the entrance into the hamlet through the fortress-like Grand Arch, and the distinctive Blue Lake formed by the weir for the hydro-electric scheme, all combine to form a landmark landscape of great beauty and distinctiveness (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place is has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its associations with many groups of people, three of which have been particularly identified - tourists, speleologists (that is, those who study caves and engage in caving) and guides. From the 1860s travellers and cavers have visited the Reserve, and cavers have continued to explore and make know to the public more of the caves, their connecting passages and the often unique plants and animals that inhabit this subterranean and lightless world. The caves are also important to the community of caretakers and guides who for nearly 150 years have guided visitors through the caves, shown them the beauty and wonders of the caverns, interpreted and educated people about the geological history of eastern Australia, and made the caves hamlet their home (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its ability to yield information on the geological history of NSW and of the Australian continent, as the benchmark karst landscapes contained within the NSW reserve system, and for the archaeological potential of the hamlet area to provide evidence of the early period in the development of tourism in NSW (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for the number of rare and uncommon flora and fauna species to which it is home, especially within the caves; for containing the greatest diversity of cave invertebrates in NSW; and for the evidence it can demonstrate of the development of tourism, especially mountain and caving tourism, for over a century and a half in NSW (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n==Climate==\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Jenolan Caves\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 25.6\n|Feb high C = 24.6\n|Mar high C = 21.8\n|Apr high C = 16.7\n|May high C = 12.8\n|Jun high C = 10.0\n|Jul high C = 9.4\n|Aug high C = 11.5\n|Sep high C = 15.3\n|Oct high C = 19.4\n|Nov high C = 22.4\n|Dec high C = 25.0\n|year high C = 17.9\n|Jan low C = 11.6\n|Feb low C = 11.7\n|Mar low C = 10.0\n|Apr low C = 6.4\n|May low C = 3.2\n|Jun low C = 1.5\n|Jul low C = 0.2\n|Aug low C = 0.9\n|Sep low C = 2.9\n|Oct low C = 5.7\n|Nov low C = 8.1\n|Dec low C = 10.3\n|year low C = 6.0\n|source 1 = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Australian Bureau of Meteorology]]<ref name=\"climate\">{{cite web|work=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_063036.shtml|title=Monthly climate statistics: Oberon (Jenolan Caves)|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008225213/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_063036.shtml|archive-date=8 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|date=August 2014\n\n}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nThe Entrance, Fish River Caves a1528190u.tif|Possibly the earliest-surviving image of the Grand Arch of Jenolan Caves, known in 1861 as Fish River Caves\nNettle cave.jpg|The entrance to Nettle Cave, circa 1888\nImage:Caves House, Jenolan Caves  -

The following year, Jeremiah Wilson was appointed as the first \"Keeper of the Caves\".<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Wilson not only explored the already known Elder and Lucas Caves but later discovered the Imperial, Left Imperial (now known as Chifley), Jersey and Jubilee Caves.\n\nThe caves were open to tourism early, but there was little protection from visitors damaging formations until the collection of souvenirs and the writing of graffiti was banned in 1872. In 1884 the name Jenolan Caves was adopted.<ref name=pom/>\n\nThe road to the caves originally went via {{NSWcity|Tarana}}, which meant that travellers from the south had to take a long, roundabout route of about {{convert|90|mi}} from Katoomba to Oberon, and, from there, to Tarana. In the mid-1880s, hotel keepers in Katoomba wanted to improve business by constructing a road to the Caves from their town, but the steep, rough ground between the caves and town was a major obstacle, and several attempts failed. However, representations were made to the [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] by Peter Fitzpatrick of Burragorang, who was connected to some mining operations near Katoomba. In April 1884, William Marshall Cooper, Surveyor of Public Parks for the State Government, was assigned the job, and worked out a horse-and-carriage track in a 10-day trek from Katoomba to the Caves. The route was, he remarked, 26.5 miles from the Western Hotel in Katoomba. \"... Anyone accustomed to walking can do it comfortably in 12 hours ... when the proposed horse track is completed, it will be a very enjoyable ride of five hours.\" It became known as the [[Six Foot Track]].\n\nBy 1885, Parliament had approved [[Australian pound|A\u20a4]]2,500 for the construction of Cooper's bridle track, with the work starting at the most difficult area, the Megalong Cleft, where a zig-zag had to be cut, partly in solid rock, to reduce the grade to 1:5.5.<ref>\"Track from Katoomba to Jenolan Caves\" by W. M. Cooper, Surveyor of Public Parks, published in Sydney, Australia, 1885, copy at National Library of Australia (nla.map-rm1826-s2-e)</ref> The first recorded passage of the completed bridle track from Katoomba to Jenolan was by the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]], [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], in September 1887. Lord Carrington also made the first official visit to the caves at the completion of his journey, accompanied by Wilson.\n\nIn 1898 the current [[Jenolan Caves House]] was built, replacing the earlier wooden accommodation house built by Jeremiah Wilson, which had been partially destroyed in 1895 by fire.\n\nJ. C. (Voss) Wiburd became \"Keeper of the Caves\" in 1903 and discovered (with fellow guide and friend Jack Edwards) five more caves within eighteen months: the River, Pool of Cerberus, Temple of Baal, Orient and Ribbon Caves. He remained Keeper until 1932, when he left due to the Government's policy at the time of compulsory retirement at the age of 65.\n\nThe Chifley Cave, originally known as the Left Imperial Cave, was renamed in 1952 in honour of [[Ben Chifley]], the recently retired [[Division of Macquarie|Federal local member of parliament]] and former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. This cave was the first of the caves to have been diamonds inside, as early as 1880. In 1968, the Orient Cave became the first in the world to be cleaned, due to contamination by mud from the previous access route and a nearby coal boiler. The soot from the boiler was entering the cave via a new tunnel blasted 400 feet through to the Orient cave in 1954 to allow easier access (entering at Bat End). Steam cleaning was found to be damaging to the crystal formations, due to the rapid expansion and contraction caused by the heat from the steam, and these days water from the caves' own underground rivers is used if cave cleaning becomes necessary.\n\nSince 2011, the CSIRO in association with the [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]] began using a new hand-held mapping system to map some of the caves in three-dimensional detail.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/jenolan-caves-sheltering-climate-secrets-20121215-2bgck.html|title=Jenolan Caves sheltering climate secrets|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=16 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218234516/http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/jenolan-caves-sheltering-climate-secrets-20121215-2bgck.html|archive-date=18 December 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Caves==\n{{further|List of caves within the Jenolan Caves karst}}\nLarge portions of this extensive cave system are accessible only to experienced [[caving|cavers]], especially those areas along the underground river system.\n\nEleven show caves have been developed for regular tourism and are open to the public.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of show caves accessible to the public\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Cave name\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | European discovery\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Accessibility\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Lighting\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Description\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Source(s)\n|-\n| Lucas\n| 1860\n|\n| Popular among visitors\n| LED \n|align=\"left\"| Named in honour of [[John Lucas (Australian politician)|John Lucas]] MP who pushed to have the caves preserved in the 1860s, this cave features a number of large chambers including the Cathedral, over {{convert|50|m}} high, and the vast Exhibition Chamber which contains the Broken Column formation.

The cave takes its name from the nettles which grow near its entrance (note that raised walkways protect visitors from their stings); an upper part of this cave can be seen from inside the Devil's Coach House. Originally shown as a guided tour, the cave was closed to the public in 1932 and re-opened in 2006, combined with the adjoining Devil's Coach House. The Nettle Cave hosts \"Crayfish backs\", [[stromatolite]]s shaped by [[cyanobacteria]], light and wind. They are estimated to be at least 20,000 years old. Due to rock falls (made more probable by drought, according to the cave guides) the easy access path from the Grand Arch to the Devil's Coach House is currently closed. The open cave is best accessed via a 270-stair descent from the Carlotta Carpark.\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/the-caves/selfguided-audio-tour/|title=Self-guided, Audio, Multi Lingual Tour|work=Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate=7 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011201240/http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/the-caves/selfguided-audio-tour/|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n| The Grand Arch\n| 1838\n|\n| colspan=2|Assembly point for tours\n|align=\"left\"| The road from Sydney passes through the Arch and six of the cave tours leave from assembly points within it. Adjacent to the Grand Arch is the Devil's Coach House, a vast open-ended chamber that forms part of the many nature walks in the area. High above both of these is Carlotta Arch, a free-standing arch that is all that remains of a higher cavern system long since eroded and collapsed. Along with these areas, there are several other caves in the area, some of which are available for special tours.\n| \n|-\n| Elder Cave\n| 1848\n|\n| Adventure caving\n| \n|align=\"left\"| Named from the [[Elder tree]], visitors would climb down to enter the doline (sinkhole). The Elder Cave was the first of the caves at Jenolan to be found and opened to tourists. It was later considered too difficult to develop adequately and tours eventually ceased; however, in the late 1990s the Elder Cave was re-opened for adventure caving, and is sold as the Plughole Tour. It is not as decorated as the regular show caves, but features signatures left by early visitors and includes a short section of the Imperial Cave.\n| \n|-\n| Aladdin Cave\n| 1897\n|\n| \n| \n|align=\"left\"| The Aladdin Cave was first explored in the hope of developing a shorter path to the Jubilee Cave.

Private [[coach (bus)|coach]] companies operate day tours from Sydney and from [[Katoomba railway station]]. There is no public transport to Jenolan Caves. The caves attract over 250,000 visitors a year, making it one of the most popular tourist locations in rural New South Wales,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} and has won numerous tourism awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/imagesDB/wysiwyg/AnnualReport0809.pdf|type=PDF|title=Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust.

This trail became in disused in the early 1900s after new roads were built in the area, but was reopened as a [[Hiking|bushwalking]] track in 1984. It is now one of the most popular overnight bushwalks in the Blue Mountains area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixfoottrack.com/six-foot-track-history-2/|title=Six Foot Track History - Six Foot Track|accessdate=11 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141333/http://www.sixfoottrack.com/six-foot-track-history-2/|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTen of the area's \"dark caves\" are open for regular guided tours every day (1 to 2 hours per tour). These show cave tour sizes vary. For example, the delicate Pool of Cerberus Cave can have only 8 on a tour, while the Lucas Cave (with its large chambers) can have up to 65 people per tour.\n\nTours vary in difficulty. Imperial Cave, for example, has the fewest stairs, while the River Cave is the most strenuous. The average tourist can tour any of these show caves.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nA self-guided tour of the huge Nettle Cave/Devils Coach House is also available. The self-guided tour gives visitors a choice of many languages. One of the choices on the self-guided tour is an Aboriginal culture commentary.\n\nNight tours run every night except Sundays, including the popular ghost tour, 'Legends, Mysteries & Ghosts'.\n\nSeveral undeveloped caves are available for adventure caving (2-hour to all-day tours). These adventure caving tours include the Plughole Tour, which runs daily and includes basic abseiling. Other more challenging adventure caving tours are available.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe Cathedral Chamber, part of the \"Lucas Cave\" is famous for its acoustics. Underground concerts take place in this chamber. Concerts also take place in the Grand Arch, including the annual 'Carols in the Caves', which raises money for charity.\n\nDuring school holidays, specially-developed tours are available for children. Jenolan Caves has long been a popular destination for school excursions.\n\n===Jenolan Caves House===\n{{main|Jenolan Caves House}}\nTourists visiting Jenolan Caves can stay at the heritage-listed Jenolan Caves House. It was designed in 1897 by government architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]] as a resort or retreat for the wealthy. To cater for the expectations of the well-to-do, Vernon included a ballroom and grand dining room, now Chisolm's Restaurant. Chisolm's is open for dinner every day, serving modern Australian cuisine. Facilities include an hotel/motel complex, self-contained cottages, restaurant, bar, and cafe.\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 June 2004, Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its historical, aesthetic, research and rarity values. The caves and karst landscapes developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, and the Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource - in this case, the Jenolan Caves.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe Reserve is highly regarded for the aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, reflected in cave names such as Aladdin and Gem Cave; for the ability of the caves to demonstrate technological developments such as the first use of electric cave lighting in the 1880s, and the first development of hydro-electric power in Australia. The setting of the caves hamlet in the Jenolan Valley, with the tiny hamlet and picturesque Caves House almost dwarfed by steeply rising cliffs on all sides, the entrance into the hamlet through the fortress-like Grand Arch, and the distinctive Blue Lake formed by the weir for the hydro-electric scheme, all combine to form a landscape of great beauty and distinctiveness.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe Reserve has the ability to yield information on the geological history of NSW and of the Australian continent, and for the archaeological potential of the hamlet area to provide evidence of the early period in the development of tourism in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe number of rare and uncommon flora and fauna species to which it is home, especially within the caves; and the evidence it can demonstrate of the development of tourism, especially mountain and caving tourism, in NSW, add to the significance of the Jenolan Caves Reserve (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe geomorphic history of the Jenolan Caves system is extremely complex, the cave system contains an exceptionally diverse variety of karst and cave types illustrating the full range of processes and products from incipient, scarcely perceptible depressions through to multistage cave developments and decayed remnant features. The McKeowns Valley, north of Blue Lake contains the finest such assemblage in Australia. The Jenolan River valley is one of the most outstanding fluviokarst valleys in the world. The range and diversity of the karst and decoration, including a remarkable diversity of mineral species, is varied, profuse and equal to the finest in the world. The Jenolan Caves and surrounding areas contains a very diverse assemblage of morphologies and mineral species. There is evidence in these features of the influences of palaeo-landscapes.\nThe contribution to the formation of the landscape of structural influences, lithological influences, and drainage patterns is the source of considerable scientific and educational interest at Jenolan. The geomorphology of Jenolan includes a variety of non karstic phenomena that are important because of their relationship with the karst. Because these features lie adjacent to, and in some cases over, the karst they give considerable insight into the formation of the karst. A large number of invertebrate fossils have been discovered in the limestone of the Jenolan Caves. These include corals, stromatoporoids, algae, brachiopods, gastropods and straight nautiloids. Subfossil remains of many vertebrates are also found in the caves.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nThe caves provide shelter and habitat for a number of rare species including the [[Greater sooty owl]] (''Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa'') (rare in Australia) which roosts in the cave known as the Devil's Coach House and the Jenolan Caves Reserve supports a population of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (''Petrogale penicillata''). This species is listed as vulnerable on Schedule 12 of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act. Also found in the caves is the opilionid arachnid ''[[Holonuncia cavernicola]]'' which is known only from the Jenolan Caves system. The Caves Reserve contains three rare or endangered plant species. These are ''[[Pseudanthus divaricatissimus]]'' (3RC), ''[[Gonocarpus longifolius]]'' (3RC), and [[Geranium graniticola]] (3RC). In the latter half of the 19th century the caves were recognised as perhaps the premier natural attraction in Australia. Although they no longer occupy this role, Jenolan remains one of the most important natural heritage areas in Australia. The caves are a very high-profile natural feature in NSW. The Jenolan Caves area is widely used as a research and teaching site for studying the geomorphology and processes involved in karst formation.<ref name=nswshr-1698/><ref name=nswshr-1698-141>RNE, 1978.</ref>\n\nJenolan is one of the most important areas of natural and cultural history in Australia. The area includes one of the largest and most beautiful interconnected cave systems in Australia and is an outstanding site of geological and speleological interest. The Jenolan River, Blue Lake and a system of intimate valleys and watercourses provide a magnificent setting for a distinctive range of native vegetation and fauna. The Caves Reserve was created in 1866, six years before the declaration of the world's first National Park. Since its reported discovery by James Whalan between 1838 and 1841 the area has attracted more than three million visitors. Caves House, and its associated outbuildings, adds to the area's cultural significance. The area also contains a number of important industrial relics, including Australia's first hydro-electric power station and the remnants of the first electric lighting of caves which was installed in the Chifley Cave in 1887.<ref name=nswshr-1698-3339>National Trust of Australia, 1985</ref><ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\nJenolan Caves was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 25 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its ability to demonstrate the significant historical activity of identifying and conserving the natural resources of NSW - in this case, the caves and karst landscapes that have developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. The Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource - in this case, the caves, and as such predates the creation of The National Park in 1879. The caves hamlet illustrates the significant human activity of providing accommodation for travellers and tourists since the 1890s in romantic buildings especially designed for this purpose by the Government Architect (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is significant for its associations with Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon, who design much of Caves House. Although only the first or 1897 wing was built during his tenure, his plans were respected and adapted by subsequent government architects so that the original style and setting for the building has been largely maintained to the present day (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for the highly regarded aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, reflected in cave and formation names such as Aladdin, Orient and Temple of Baal caves and Gem, Arabesque, Angel's Wing and Pool of Reflections formations; for the ability of the caves to demonstrate technological developments such as the first use of electric cave lighting in the 1880s, and the first development of hydro-electric power in Australia. The setting of the caves hamlet in the Jenolan Valley, with the tiny hamlet and picturesque Caves House almost dwarfed by steeply rising cliffs on all sides, the entrance into the hamlet through the fortress-like Grand Arch, and the distinctive Blue Lake formed by the weir for the hydro-electric scheme, all combine to form a landmark landscape of great beauty and distinctiveness (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place is has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its associations with many groups of people, three of which have been particularly identified - tourists, speleologists (that is, those who study caves and engage in caving) and guides. From the 1860s travellers and cavers have visited the Reserve, and cavers have continued to explore and make know to the public more of the caves, their connecting passages and the often unique plants and animals that inhabit this subterranean and lightless world. The caves are also important to the community of caretakers and guides who for nearly 150 years have guided visitors through the caves, shown them the beauty and wonders of the caverns, interpreted and educated people about the geological history of eastern Australia, and made the caves hamlet their home (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its ability to yield information on the geological history of NSW and of the Australian continent, as the benchmark karst landscapes contained within the NSW reserve system, and for the archaeological potential of the hamlet area to provide evidence of the early period in the development of tourism in NSW (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for the number of rare and uncommon flora and fauna species to which it is home, especially within the caves; for containing the greatest diversity of cave invertebrates in NSW; and for the evidence it can demonstrate of the development of tourism, especially mountain and caving tourism, for over a century and a half in NSW (HO).<ref name=nswshr-1698/>\n\n==Climate==\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Jenolan Caves\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 25.6\n|Feb high C = 24.6\n|Mar high C = 21.8\n|Apr high C = 16.7\n|May high C = 12.8\n|Jun high C = 10.0\n|Jul high C = 9.4\n|Aug high C = 11.5\n|Sep high C = 15.3\n|Oct high C = 19.4\n|Nov high C = 22.4\n|Dec high C = 25.0\n|year high C = 17.9\n|Jan low C = 11.6\n|Feb low C = 11.7\n|Mar low C = 10.0\n|Apr low C = 6.4\n|May low C = 3.2\n|Jun low C = 1.5\n|Jul low C = 0.2\n|Aug low C = 0.9\n|Sep low C = 2.9\n|Oct low C = 5.7\n|Nov low C = 8.1\n|Dec low C = 10.3\n|year low C = 6.0\n|source 1 = [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Australian Bureau of Meteorology]]<ref name=\"climate\">{{cite web|work=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_063036.shtml|title=Monthly climate statistics: Oberon (Jenolan Caves)|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008225213/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_063036.shtml|archive-date=8 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|date=August 2014\n\n}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nThe Entrance, Fish River Caves a1528190u.tif|Possibly the earliest-surviving image of the Grand Arch of Jenolan Caves, known in 1861 as Fish River Caves\nNettle cave.jpg|The entrance to Nettle Cave, circa 1888\nImage:Caves House, Jenolan Caves  -

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family later settled in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> \n\nWhen the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\" /> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the [[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\" />\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson later told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist Diane Barwick met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family later settled in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the [[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson later told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist Diane Barwick met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.
