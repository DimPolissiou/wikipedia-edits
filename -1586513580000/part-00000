Part of the spoken dialogue is in Esperanto.\n*2004: The movie ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' takes place in a generic city which writer/director [[David S. Goyer|David Goyer]] nevertheless wanted to represent as bilingual (as many cities are worldwide), so the second language spoken in this nameless city, and visible on most of its signage, is Esperanto.\n*2004: In the Spanish film ''El coche de pedales'' (''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395121/ El Coche de Pedales]''), one of the main characters is a teacher of Esperanto. There are some scenes in which he greets people with \"Saluton\" or \"Dankon\", and a scene of one of his lectures, in which he reads a tale in Esperanto.\n*2004: In the Korean amateur animation named ''Esperanto'' \u2013 which received a prize in the Digital Content Grand Prix \u2013 one can hear some sentences in Esperanto.\n*2004: On the [[Nickelodeon]] animated show [[Danny Phantom]] a limited run character named Wulf was featured who spoke exclusively in Esperanto.\n*2005: A short film named ''Esperanto'' was released, with scenes in French and Esperanto.\n*2005: ''[[:ru:\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430 (\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b)|Casarosa]]'' is a film by the First Channel of Russian television.

In June 1944, the [[Australian Army]] moved in, installing a a radar station which had been previously operating in [[Bupul]], and renamed it Post 5,<ref>Simmonds, Ed (2002). pp.26\u201330</ref> under the command of an infantry sergeant.<ref>Dexter (1961). p. 812</ref> The goal was to spot [[Japanese]] airplanes coming from the [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru islands]] or the [[Bird's Head Peninsula|Vogelkop]] to attack [[Merauke]].

They want to get into the local college but don't have the required grades. The college guard Pandit ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]) tells them that he can provide them with the leaked class XII papers to them, for a significant amount. Choocha has this god-gift where he can get the winning number of any lottery in his dream and Honey has the talent to sand the exact number out of his dream. The protagonists could not afford or collect the money required, so they decided to sell the papers to other students but failed there too.\n\nMeanwhile, through Pandit, they meet Zafar ([[Ali Fazal]]), a former student of the college and a struggling musician. The fourth character is Lali ([[Manjot Singh]]), whose father Billa, runs a sweet shop. Lali is currently pursuing his degree through correspondence and like Hunny and Choocha also wants to get into the same college, where his girlfriend, who ignores him all the time studies but doesn't have the marks. Pandit asks Lali to donate \u20b9 250,000 in the college development fund to get admission. Lalli asks his father for the money, but he refuses to say the college is too costly.\n\nZafar's girlfriend, Neetu ([[Vishakha Singh]]), who has broken up with him over his career choices is now giving private tuitions to Lalli so that he could attain enough marks to get into the college of his dreams. On the other hand, Zafar's father faces a stroke and is paralyzed now, for his treatment, the struggling musician needs money badly. The four meet up at Pandit's office where Hunny explains his scheme. However, since now they all together need a lot of money, they need someone to invest lakhs. So, on Zafar's insistence, Pandit takes them to meet a local gangster, Bholi Punjaban ([[Richa Chadda]]) where Hunny tells them their scheme. Bholi is ready to invest, and Lali also gives his shop papers as a mortgage. Bholi tells them to come the next day with the number. However, the same night everyone except Choocha falls asleep.\n\nThe next morning, Choocha narrates a fake dream which Hunny interprets and gets a number. They go to Bholi and tell the number. But it backfires, and Bholi loses her money. Now to recover her money, she gives them a packet containing drug pills which Zafar, Hunny and Lali have to sell at a rave party the same night. She keeps Choocha as security with her. At the party, Police and Narcotics teams conduct a raid, and Lali escapes with a packet with the police chasing him. Lali manages to fool the cops and reaches Neetu's place. He also sees Zafar there. Neetu throws the drugs down the drain just as the police are about to search her home. The cops leave her place warning Lali. Zafar in the meanwhile tells the whole story to Neetu. Lali also calls Choocha telling him to run from Bholi's house which he succeeds in doing.\n\nThe next morning, all the five land up at Bholi's place. She gives them 24 hours to pay all the money due; otherwise, she would take the money by selling Lali's shop. The four are fighting at Zafar's place where Choocha tells them the truth about not seeing the dream. However, he says to them that he slept last night, and he saw a dream. Zafar is not interested while Lali, Hunny and Neetu are. Hunny interprets the dream, but they are short of cash even after Neetu is ready to give her savings. However, next morning Lali is able to borrow some money from a homeless man who used to remove parts from Lali's motorbike. They invest and win a huge amount.\n\nThey go to Bholi's house and give her the money. Then Hunny tells Bholi that he wants to sell those drug pills again and gives her an advance. Impressed Bholi goes inside and returns with the pills only to be caught red-handed by the police and Narcotics who have raided her home. In a flashback, it is shown that while Hunny, Choocha, Lali and Neetu were investing the money, Zafar met the Narcotics division and made a plan to catch Bholi and also calls Neetu, Lali, Choocha and Hunny where they confess to the police. Now with Bholi behind bars, the police pardon the four, and they are free.\n\nThree months later, it is shown that Hunny and Choocha are entering the same college on horses as they had planned at the beginning of the film while Pandit is shocked and Lali, Zafar and Neetu are having a good laugh.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pulkit Samrat]] as Vikas \"Hunny\" Gulati\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Dilip \"Choocha\" Singh\n* [[Ali Fazal]] as Zafar Bhai\n* [[Manjot Singh]] as Lali\n* [[Priya Anand]] as Priya\n* [[Richa Chadda]] as Bholi Punjaban (loosely based on real-life Sex Racket Queen Sonu Punjaban)<ref>https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/sex-racket-queen-sonu-punjaban-arrested-again-for-forcing-a-girl-into-prostituti/305954</ref>\n* [[Vishakha Singh]] as Neetu Singh\n* Bhupesh Rai as Bhuppa Ali\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Pandit\n* [[Ashraful Haque (actor)|Ashraful Haque]] as Shakiya (stealer of Lali's bike)\n* Anurag Arora as Narco Officer\n* [[Ajay Trehan]] as Inspector Khanna\n* Pooja Kalra as Fat woman on bus\n* V.K.

They want to get into the local college but don't have the required grades. The college guard Pandit ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]) tells them that he can provide them with the leaked class XII papers to them, for a significant amount. Choocha has this god-gift where he can get the winning number of any lottery in his dream and Honey has the talent to sand the exact number out of his dream. The protagonists could not afford or collect the money required, so they decided to sell the papers to other students but failed there too.\n\nMeanwhile, through Pandit, they meet Zafar ([[Ali Fazal]]), a former student of the college and a struggling musician. The fourth character is Lali ([[Manjot Singh]]), whose father Billa, runs a sweet shop. Lali is currently pursuing his degree through correspondence and like Hunny and Choocha also wants to get into the same college, where his girlfriend, who ignores him all the time studies but doesn't have the marks. Pandit asks Lali to donate \u20b9 250,000 in the college development fund to get admission. Lalli asks his father for the money, but he refuses to say the college is too costly.\n\nZafar's girlfriend, Neetu ([[Vishakha Singh]]), who has broken up with him over his career choices is now giving private tuitions to Lalli so that he could attain enough marks to get into the college of his dreams. On the other hand, Zafar's father faces a stroke and is paralyzed now, for his treatment, the struggling musician needs money badly. The four meet up at Pandit's office where Hunny explains his scheme. However, since now they all together need a lot of money, they need someone to invest lakhs. So, on Zafar's insistence, Pandit takes them to meet a local gangster, Bholi Punjaban ([[Richa Chadda]]) where Hunny tells them their scheme. Bholi is ready to invest, and Lali also gives his shop papers as a mortgage. Bholi tells them to come the next day with the number. However, the same night everyone except Choocha falls asleep.\n\nThe next morning, Choocha narrates a fake dream which Hunny interprets and gets a number. They go to Bholi and tell the number. But it backfires, and Bholi loses her money. Now to recover her money, she gives them a packet containing drug pills which Zafar, Hunny and Lali have to sell at a rave party the same night. She keeps Choocha as security with her. At the party, Police and Narcotics teams conduct a raid, and Lali escapes with a packet with the police chasing him. Lali manages to fool the cops and reaches Neetu's place. He also sees Zafar there. Neetu throws the drugs down the drain just as the police are about to search her home. The cops leave her place warning Lali. Zafar in the meanwhile tells the whole story to Neetu. Lali also calls Choocha telling him to run from Bholi's house which he succeeds in doing.\n\nThe next morning, all the five land up at Bholi's place. She gives them 24 hours to pay all the money due; otherwise, she would take the money by selling Lali's shop. The four are fighting at Zafar's place where Choocha tells them the truth about not seeing the dream. However, he says to them that he slept last night, and he saw a dream. Zafar is not interested while Lali, Hunny and Neetu are. Hunny interprets the dream, but they are short of cash even after Neetu is ready to give her savings. However, next morning Lali is able to borrow some money from a homeless man who used to remove parts from Lali's motorbike. They invest and win a huge amount.\n\nThey go to Bholi's house and give her the money. Then Hunny tells Bholi that he wants to sell those drug pills again and gives her an advance. Impressed Bholi goes inside and returns with the pills only to be caught red-handed by the police and Narcotics who have raided her home. In a flashback, it is shown that while Hunny, Choocha, Lali and Neetu were investing the money, Zafar met the Narcotics division and made a plan to catch Bholi and also calls Neetu, Lali, Choocha and Hunny where they confess to the police. Now with Bholi behind bars, the police pardon the four, and they are free.\n\nThree months later, it is shown that Hunny and Choocha are entering the same college on horses as they had planned at the beginning of the film while Pandit is shocked and Lali, Zafar and Neetu are having a good laugh.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pulkit Samrat]] as Vikas \"Hunny\" Gulati\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Dilip \"Choocha\" Singh\n* [[Ali Fazal]] as Zafar Bhai\n* [[Manjot Singh]] as Lali\n* [[Priya Anand]] as Priya\n* [[Richa Chadda]] as Bholi Punjaban (loosely based on real-life Sex Racket Queen Sonu Punjaban)<ref>https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/sex-racket-queen-sonu-punjaban-arrested-again-for-forcing-a-girl-into-prostituti/305954</ref>\n* [[Vishakha Singh]] as Neetu Singh\n* Bhupesh Rai as Bhuppa Ali\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Pandit\n* [[Ashraful Haque (actor)|Ashraful Haque]] as Shakiya (stealer of Lali's bike)\n* Anurag Arora as Narco Officer\n* [[Ajay Trehan]] as Inspector Khanna\n* Pooja Kalra as Fat woman on bus\n* V.K.
