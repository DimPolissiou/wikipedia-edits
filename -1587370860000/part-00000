In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure's mother was queen [[Neferhetepes (Userkaf)|Neferhetepes II]].{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=192 \u2013 198}} She was the wife of pharaoh [[Userkaf]], as indicated by the location of [[Pyramid of Userkaf#Pyramid complex of Queen Neferhetepes|her pyramid]] immediately adjacent to [[Pyramid of Userkaf|that of Userkaf]],{{sfn|Labrousse|Lauer|2000}} and bore the title of \"king's mother\".{{efn|group=note|Ancient Egyptian ''Mwt-Nswt''.{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=494}}}}{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=494}} This makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further reinforced by the discovery of Sahure's [[cartouche]] in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at [[Saqqara]], indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.{{sfn|Labrousse|Lauer|2000}}\n\nThis contradicts older, alternative theories according to which Sahure was the son of queen [[Khentkaus I]],{{sfn|Clayton|1994|p=46}} believed to be the wife of the last pharaoh of the preceding [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]], [[Shepseskaf]] and a brother to either Userkaf or Neferirkare.{{efn|group=note|In a version of this theory, Khentkaus possibly remarried Userkaf after the death of her first husband{{sfn|Hayes|1978|pp=66 \u2013 68 & p. 71}} and became the mother of Sahure and his successor on the throne, Neferirkare Kakai.{{sfn|Rice|1999|p=173}} This theory is based on the fact that Khentkaus is known to have borne the title of ''mwt nswt bity nswt bity'', which could be translated as \"mother of two kings\". A story from the [[Westcar Papyrus]] tells of a magician foretelling to [[Khufu]] that the future demise of his lineage will come from three brothers, born of the god Ra and a woman named [[Rededjet]], who will reign successively as the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty.{{sfn|Lichteim|2000|pp=215 \u2013 220}} Some Egyptologists have therefore proposed that Khentkaus was the mother of Sahure and the historical figure on which [[Rededjet]] is based. Following the discoveries of Verner and El-Awady in Abusir, this theory has been abandoned{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=192 \u2013 198}} and the real role of Khentkaus remains difficult to ascertain. This is in part because the translation of her title is problematic and because the details of the transition from the Fourth to the Fifth Dynasty are not yet clear. In particular, an ephemeral pharaoh [[Djedefptah]] may have ruled between Shepseskaf and Userkaf.{{sfn|Hayes|1978|pp=66 \u2013 68 & p. 71}}}}{{sfn|Baud|1999b|pp=547\u2014548 & 550}}\n\n[[File:Borchardt Sahure 33.jpg|thumb|upright|Sahure's figure towering next to those of his sons including Netjerirenre, Khakare and Neferirkare Kakai on a relief from his mortuary temple.{{sfn|Borchardt|1910|loc=Pl. 32, 33 & 34}}|alt=Large figure of a king standing and holding a staff.

They propose that Netjerirenre may have later seized the throne for a brief reign under the name \"[[Shepseskare]]\", although this remains conjectural.{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=213 \u2013 214}} The same relief further depicts queen [[Meretnebty]],{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=198 \u2013 203}} who was thus most likely Sahure's consort{{sfn|Callender|2011|p=133 & 141}} and the mother of Ranefer and Netjerirenre.{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=208 \u2013 213}} Three more sons, Khakare,{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=535}} Horemsaf,{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=521}} and Nebankhre{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=487}} are shown on reliefs from Sahure's mortuary temple, but the identity of their mother(s) is unknown.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|pp=62 \u2013 69}}\n\nNetjerirenre bore several religious titles corresponding to high-ranking positions in the court and which suggest that he may have acted as a [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] for his father.{{sfn|Mac Farlane|1991|p=80}} This is debated, as Michel Baud points out that at the time of Sahure, the eviction of royal princes from the vizierate was ongoing if not already complete.{{sfn|Baud|1999a|p=297}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Chronology ===\n\n[[File:Abydos KL 05-02 n27.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Three hieroglyphs inscribed on a cream-colored stone: a circle, beneath it three toes and a chick|Cartouche of Sahure on the Abydos king list]]\n\n==== Relative chronology ====\n\nThe relative chronology of Sahure's reign is well established by historical records, contemporary artifacts and archeological evidences, which agree that he succeeded Userkaf and was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1999|pp=56 \u2013 57|loc=king number 2}} An historical source supporting this order of succession is the ''Aegyptiaca'' (\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac), a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy II]] (283 \u2013 246 BC) by [[Manetho]]. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and [[Eusebius]]. According to the Byzantine scholar [[George Syncellus]], Africanus wrote that the ''Aegyptiaca'' mentioned the succession \"Usercher\u00eas \u2192 Sephr\u00eas \u2192 Nefercher\u00eas\" at the start of the Fifth Dynasty. Usercher\u00eas, Sephr\u00eas (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], \u03a3\u03f5\u03d5\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2), and Nefercher\u00eas are believed to be the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] forms for Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare, respectively.{{sfn|Waddell|1971|p=51}} Manetho's reconstruction of the early Fifth Dynasty is in agreement with those given on two more historical sources, the [[Abydos king list]] where Sahure's cartouche is on the 27th entry, and the [[Saqqara Tablet]] where Sahure's name is given on the 33rd entry. These lists of kings were written during the reigns of [[Seti I]] and Ramses II, respectively.{{sfn|Daressy|1912|p=205}}\n\n==== Reign length ====\n\nThe [[Turin King List|Turin canon]], a king list written during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] in the early [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Ramesside era]] (1292\u20141189 BC), credits him with a reign of twelve years  five months and twelve days. In contrast, the near contemporary royal annal of the Fifth Dynasty known as the [[Palermo Stone]] records his second, third, fifth and sixth years on the throne as well as his final 13th or 14th year of reign{{efn|group=note|During the Old Kingdom period, the Egyptians did not record time as we do today. Rather, they counted years since the beginning of the reign of the current king. Furthermore these years were referred to by the number of [[Cattle count (Egypt)|cattle counts]] which had taken place since the start of the reign. The cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population.

Yet to be located, it is known to have existed thanks an inscription on the Palermo stone where it is called ''Sekhetre'' (also spelt ''Sekhet Re''), meaning \"The Field of Ra\"{{sfn|Breasted|1906|pp=108 \u2013 110}} as well as mentions of it in 24 tombs of administration officials.{{sfn|Spalinger|1994|p=295}} A few limestone blocks bearing reliefs which once adorned the temple have been found embedded in the walls of the mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini, Sahure's fourth successor.{{sfn|Verner|Zemina|1994|p=110}} This suggests either that these blocks were leftovers from the construction of the temple, or as Wener Kaiser has posited,{{sfn|Kaiser|1956|p=112}} that Nyuserre dismantled Sahure's temple,{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=390}} using it as a quarry for construction materials because it was largely unfinished.{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=391}}{{sfn|Verner|Zemina|1994|p=110}} Indeed, the rather meager evidence for the ''Sekhetre'' leads Miroslav Verner to propose that it never fully functioned as a sun temple.{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=390}}\n\nNew analyses of the verso of the Palermo stone performed in 2018 by the Czech Institute of Archeology enabled the reading of further inscriptions mentioning precisely the architecture of the temple as well as lists of donations it received, establishing firmly that it was a distinct entity from the earlier sun temple of Userkaf, the ''[[Sun temple of Userkaf|Nekhenre]]'' but leaving its ultimate fate uncertain.{{sfn|Czech Institute of Egyptology website|2018}} Further precision as to the architecture of the temple may be inferred from the absence{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=390}} of the obelisk determinative in some hieroglyphic variants of the name ''Sekhetre'' and its presence in others. For Anthony Spalinger this possibly indicates that Sahure's sun temple was effectively built and  acquired such an obelisk at some point after its construction, perhaps after Sahure's reign.{{sfn|Spalinger|1994|p=295 \u2013 296}}\n\n=== Nekhenre ===\nUserkaf was the first king to build a sun temple in Abusir. Known to the ancient Egyptians as the ''Nekhenre'', or \"Fortress of Re\", it was unfinished at his death. Construction works continued in at least four building phases, the first of which may have taken place under Sahure,{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=390}} and then under his successors Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=150}}{{sfn|Verner|2001a|pp=387\u2013389}}\n\n== Pyramid complex ==\n{{main|Pyramid of Sahure}}\n[[Image:SahurePyramid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=Crumbling pyramid in the desert with scattered stones in front|The ruined pyramid of Sahure as seen from the pyramid's causeway]]\nSahure built a pyramid complex for his tomb and funerary cult, named ''Khaba Sahura'',{{sfn|Brugsch|2015|p=88}} which is variously translated as \"The Rising of the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ba .28soul.29|Ba]] Spirit of Sahure\",{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=143}}{{sfn|Hellum|2007|p=100}} \"The Ba of Sahure appears\",{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|2001|p=598}} \"Sahure's pyramid where the royal soul rises in splendor\",{{sfn|Bennett|1966|p=175}} or \"In glory comes forth the soul of Sahure\".{{sfn|Verner|Zemina|1994|p=71}} The builders and artisans who worked on Sahure's mortuary complex lived in an enclosed pyramid town  located next to the causeway leading up to Sahure's pyramid and mortuary temple.

Its inner core is made of roughly hewn stones organized in steps and held together in many sections with a thick mortar of mud. This construction technique, much cheaper and faster to execute than the stone-based techniques hitherto employed, fared much worse over time. Owing to this, Sahure's pyramid is now largely ruined and amounts to little more than a pile of rubble showing the crude filling of debris and mortar constituting the core, which became exposed after the casing stones were stolen in antiquity.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}\n\nWhile the core was under construction, a corridor was left open leading into the shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the [[Pyramid of Neferefre]].{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}} This technique also reflects the older style from the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at [[Dahshur]] and Giza during the Fourth Dynasty.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}\n\nThe entrance at the north side is a short descending corridor lined with red granite followed by a passageway ending at the burial chamber with its [[Gable|gabled roof]] comprising large limestone beams of several tons each.{{sfn|Edwards|1972|pp=175 \u2013 176, 180 \u2013 181 & 275}} Today all of these beams are fractured, which weakens the pyramid structure. Fragments of a basalt [[sarcophagus]], likely Sahure's, were found here in the burial chamber when it was first entered by [[John Shae Perring]] in the mid 19th century.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}\n\nThe mortuary complex immediately around the pyramid also includes a second smaller cult pyramid which must have stood nearly {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, originally built for the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ka|Ka]] of the king.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n[[File:Sahure-Pyramid - Temple 04.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|alt=Column of limestone, its capitals made to look like a palm tree|Palmiform columns, an innovation of Sahure's temple, became a hallmark of Egyptian architecture.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}]]\n\n=== Artistic and architectural ===\n\nThe painted reliefs covering the walls of Sahure's mortuary temple were recognized as an artistic achievement of the highest degree by the Ancient Egyptians.

Some of its architectural elements, such as its palmiform columns, became hallmarks of Egyptian architecture.{{efn|group=note|The standard work on Sahure's pyramid complex is Borchardt's excavation report, available online in its entirety.{{sfn|Borchardt|1910}}}}{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}{{sfn|Hayes|1978|p=68}}\n\nThis trend continued to hold in later times. For example, in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], [[Senusret I]] had reliefs for his temple directly copied from those of Sahure. He also chose to follow the innovative layout of Sahure's complex once again. At the time, Senusret I's decision was in stark contrast with the burial customs of the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|11th Dynasty]] pharaohs, who were buried in saff tombs. These consisted of an open courtyard fronting a row of entrances into subterranean corridors and chambers dug in the hillsides of [[El-Tarif]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]], near Thebes.{{efn|group=note|This change may have been spurred by the return of the Egyptian capital to Middle Egypt, in [[Itjtawy]], close to Memphis and the attraction of then already ancient pyramids of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties.{{sfn|Lansing|1926|p=34}}}}{{sfn|Lansing|1926|p=34}}\n\n=== Cults ===\n\n==== Old Kingdom ====\n\nSahure was the object of a funerary cult from the time of his death and which continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, some 300 years later.

For example, Sahure is present on the Karnak king list, a list of kings inscribed on the walls of the ''Akhmenu'', the Karnak temple of Thutmose III. Unlike other ancient Egyptian king lists, the kings there are not listed in chronological order. Rather, the purpose of the list was purely religious, its aim being to name the deceased kings to be honored in the Karnak temple.{{sfn|Wildung|1969|pp=60 \u2013 63}}\n\nIn the second part of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and during the Nineteenth Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple.{{sfn|Borchardt|1910|p=101}}{{sfn|Peden|2001|pp=59 \u2013 60, 95 \u2013 96}}\nThese activities were related to a cult then taking place in the mortuary temple of Sahure since the time of Thutmose III.

Sahure]]\n}}\n'''Sahure''' (also '''Sahura''', meaning \"He who is close to [[Ra|Re]]\") was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] and second ruler of the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]]. He reigned for about 12 years in the early 25th century BC during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom Period]]. Sahure's reign is considered to mark the political and cultural high point of the Fifth Dynasty.{{sfn|Brinkmann|2010a|loc=Book abstract, English translation [https://www.liebieghaus.de/en/exhibitions/sahure available online] and on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190322004805/https://www.liebieghaus.de/en/exhibitions/sahure Internet archive]}} He was probably the son of his predecessor [[Userkaf]] with Queen [[Neferhetepes (Userkaf)|Neferhetepes II]], and was in turn succeeded by his son [[Neferirkare Kakai]].\n\nDuring Sahure's rule, Egypt had important trade relations with the [[Levant]]ine coast. Sahure launched several naval expeditions to modern-day [[Lebanon]] to procure cedar trees, slaves and exotic items. His reign may have witnessed the flourishing of the Egyptian navy, which included a high-seas fleet as well as specialized racing boats. Relying on this, Sahure ordered the earliest attested expedition to the [[land of Punt]], which brought back large quantities of [[myrrh]], [[malachite]] and [[electrum]]. Sahure is shown celebrating the success of this venture in a relief from his mortuary temple which shows him tending a myrrh tree in the garden of his palace named \"Sahure's splendor soars up to heaven\". This relief is the only one in Egyptian art depicting a king gardening. Sahure sent further expeditions to the [[turquoise]] and [[copper]] mines in [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. He also ordered military campaigns against [[Libya]]n chieftains in the Western Desert, bringing back livestock to Egypt.\n\nSahure had a pyramid built for himself in [[Abusir]], thereby abandoning the royal necropolises of [[Saqqara]] and [[Giza]], where his predecessors had built their monuments. This decision was possibly motivated by the presence of the sun temple of Userkaf in Abusir, the first such temple of the Fifth Dynasty. The [[Pyramid of Sahure]] is much smaller than the pyramids of the preceding [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] but the decoration and architecture of his mortuary temple is more elaborate. The valley temple, causeway and mortuary temple of his pyramid complex were once adorned by over {{convert|10000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of exquisite polychrome reliefs, representing the highest form reached by this art during the Old Kingdom period. The Ancient Egyptians recognized this particular artistic achievement and tried to emulate the reliefs in the tombs of subsequent kings and queens. The architects of Sahure's pyramid complex introduced the use of palmiform columns (that is columns whose [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] has the form of [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]]), which would soon become a hallmark of ancient Egyptian architecture. The layout of his mortuary temple was also innovative and became the architectural standard for the remainder of the Old Kingdom period. Sahure is also known to have constructed a sun temple called \"''The Field of Ra''\", and although it is yet to be located it is presumably also in Abusir.\n\nSahure was the object of a funerary cult, the food offerings for which were initially provided by agricultural estates set up during his reign. This official, state-sponsored cult endured until the end of the Old Kingdom. Subsequently, during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom period]], Sahure was venerated as a royal ancestor figure but his cult no longer had dedicated priests. During the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], Sahure was equated with a form of the goddess [[Sekhmet]] for unknown reasons. The cult of \"Sekhmet of Sahure\" had priests and attracted visitors from all over Egypt to Sahure's temple. This unusual cult, which was celebrated well beyond Abusir, persisted up until the end of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom#History|Ptolemaic period]] nearly 2500 years after Sahure's death.\n\n== Family ==\n\n=== Parentage ===\n\n[[File:PapyrusWestcar photomerge-AltesMuseum-Berlin-5.jpg|thumb|right|340px|alt=Image of a dark papyrus covered with writings in black ink and scattered holes|The [[Westcar Papyrus]], dating to the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]] but probably first written during the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]], tells the myth of the origins of the Fifth Dynasty.]]\nExcavations at the [[pyramid of Sahure]] in [[Abusir]] under the direction of [[Miroslav Verner]] and Tarek El-Awady in the early 2000s provide a picture of the royal family of the early Fifth Dynasty. In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure's mother was queen [[Neferhetepes (Userkaf)|Neferhetepes II]].{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=192 \u2013 198}} She was the wife of pharaoh [[Userkaf]], as indicated by the location of [[Pyramid of Userkaf#Pyramid complex of Queen Neferhetepes|her pyramid]] immediately adjacent to [[Pyramid of Userkaf|that of Userkaf]],{{sfn|Labrousse|Lauer|2000}} and bore the title of \"king's mother\".{{efn|group=note|Ancient Egyptian ''Mwt-Nswt''.{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=494}}}}{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=494}} This makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further reinforced by the discovery of Sahure's [[cartouche]] in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at [[Saqqara]], indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.{{sfn|Labrousse|Lauer|2000}}\n\nThis contradicts older, alternative theories according to which Sahure was the son of queen [[Khentkaus I]],{{sfn|Clayton|1994|p=46}} believed to be the wife of the last pharaoh of the preceding [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]], [[Shepseskaf]] and a brother to either Userkaf or Neferirkare.{{efn|group=note|In a version of this theory, Khentkaus possibly remarried Userkaf after the death of her first husband{{sfn|Hayes|1978|pp=66 \u2013 68 & p. 71}} and became the mother of Sahure and his successor on the throne, Neferirkare Kakai.{{sfn|Rice|1999|p=173}} This theory is based on the fact that Khentkaus is known to have borne the title of ''mwt nswt bity nswt bity'', which could be translated as \"mother of two kings\". A story from the [[Westcar Papyrus]] tells of a magician foretelling to [[Khufu]] that the future demise of his lineage will come from three brothers, born of the god Ra and a woman named [[Rededjet]], who will reign successively as the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty.{{sfn|Lichteim|2000|pp=215 \u2013 220}} Some Egyptologists have therefore proposed that Khentkaus was the mother of Sahure and the historical figure on which [[Rededjet]] is based. Following the discoveries of Verner and El-Awady in Abusir, this theory has been abandoned{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=192 \u2013 198}} and the real role of Khentkaus remains difficult to ascertain. This is in part because the translation of her title is problematic and because the details of the transition from the Fourth to the Fifth Dynasty are not yet clear. In particular, an ephemeral pharaoh [[Djedefptah]] may have ruled between Shepseskaf and Userkaf.{{sfn|Hayes|1978|pp=66 \u2013 68 & p. 71}}}}{{sfn|Baud|1999b|pp=547\u2014548 & 550}}\n\n[[File:Borchardt Sahure 33.jpg|thumb|upright|Sahure's figure towering next to those of his sons including Netjerirenre, Khakare and Neferirkare Kakai on a relief from his mortuary temple.{{sfn|Borchardt|1910|loc=Pl. 32, 33 & 34}}|alt=Large figure of a king standing and holding a staff.

They propose that Netjerirenre may have later seized the throne for a brief reign under the name \"[[Shepseskare]]\", although this remains conjectural.{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=213 \u2013 214}} The same relief further depicts queen [[Meretnebty]],{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=198 \u2013 203}} who was thus most likely Sahure's consort{{sfn|Callender|2011|p=133 & 141}} and the mother of Ranefer and Netjerirenre.{{sfn|El Awady|2006a|pp=208 \u2013 213}} Three more sons, Khakare,{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=535}} Horemsaf,{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=521}} and Nebankhre{{sfn|Baud|1999b|p=487}} are shown on reliefs from Sahure's mortuary temple, but the identity of their mother(s) is unknown.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|pp=62 \u2013 69}}\n\nNetjerirenre bore several religious titles corresponding to high-ranking positions in the court and which suggest that he may have acted as a [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] for his father.{{sfn|Mac Farlane|1991|p=80}} This is debated, as Michel Baud points out that at the time of Sahure, the eviction of royal princes from the vizierate was ongoing if not already complete.{{sfn|Baud|1999a|p=297}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Chronology ===\n\n[[File:Abydos KL 05-02 n27.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Three hieroglyphs inscribed on a cream-colored stone: a circle, beneath it three toes and a chick|Cartouche of Sahure on the Abydos king list]]\n\n==== Relative chronology ====\n\nThe relative chronology of Sahure's reign is well established by historical records, contemporary artifacts and archeological evidences, which agree that he succeeded Userkaf and was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1999|pp=56 \u2013 57|loc=king number 2}} An historical source supporting this order of succession is the ''Aegyptiaca'' (\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac), a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy II]] (283 \u2013 246 BC) by [[Manetho]]. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and [[Eusebius]]. According to the Byzantine scholar [[George Syncellus]], Africanus wrote that the ''Aegyptiaca'' mentioned the succession \"Usercher\u00eas \u2192 Sephr\u00eas \u2192 Nefercher\u00eas\" at the start of the Fifth Dynasty. Usercher\u00eas, Sephr\u00eas (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], \u03a3\u03f5\u03d5\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2), and Nefercher\u00eas are believed to be the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] forms for Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare, respectively.{{sfn|Waddell|1971|p=51}} Manetho's reconstruction of the early Fifth Dynasty is in agreement with those given on two more historical sources, the [[Abydos king list]] where Sahure's cartouche is on the 27th entry, and the [[Saqqara Tablet]] where Sahure's name is given on the 33rd entry.

Rather, they counted years since the beginning of the reign of the current king.

These including [[Molding (decorative)|torus molding]] and [[cornice]]s for false doors, first found in Persen's tomb.{{sfn|Strudwick|1985|pp=10, 15 & footnote 3 p. 10}} This feature would subsequently become common and here demonstrates the particularly high esteem in which Persen must have been held by the king.{{sfn|Strudwick|1985|p=15}} Another innovation is the depiction of small unusual offerings such as that of seven sacred oils on false doors, first found in Niankhsekhmet's tomb.{{sfn|Strudwick|1985|pp=26 \u2013 27}} The canonical list of offerings was also developed during or shortly before Sahure's time in the tombs of the royal family, and spread to those of non-royal high-officials{{sfn|Strudwick|1985|p=41}}\u2014the earliest of whom was Seshemnefer I\u2014under Sahure.{{sfn|Strudwick|1985|pp=39 \u2013 40}}\n\n== Sun temples ==\n===Sekhetre===\nSahure built or started to build a temple dedicated to the sun god Ra, the second such temple of the Fifth Dynasty. Yet to be located, it is known to have existed thanks an inscription on the Palermo stone where it is called ''Sekhetre'' (also spelt ''Sekhet Re''), meaning \"The Field of Ra\"{{sfn|Breasted|1906|pp=108 \u2013 110}} as well as mentions of it in 24 tombs of administration officials.{{sfn|Spalinger|1994|p=295}} A few limestone blocks bearing reliefs which once adorned the temple have been found embedded in the walls of the mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini, Sahure's fourth successor.{{sfn|Verner|Zemina|1994|p=110}} This suggests either that these blocks were leftovers from the construction of the temple, or as Wener Kaiser has posited,{{sfn|Kaiser|1956|p=112}} that Nyuserre dismantled Sahure's temple,{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=390}} using it as a quarry for construction materials because it was largely unfinished.{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=391}}{{sfn|Verner|Zemina|1994|p=110}} Indeed, the rather meager evidence for the ''Sekhetre'' leads Miroslav Verner to propose that it never fully functioned as a sun temple.{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=390}}\n\nNew analyses of the verso of the Palermo stone performed in 2018 by the Czech Institute of Archeology enabled the reading of further inscriptions mentioning precisely the architecture of the temple as well as lists of donations it received, establishing firmly that it was a distinct entity from the earlier sun temple of Userkaf, the ''[[Sun temple of Userkaf|Nekhenre]]'' but leaving its ultimate fate uncertain.{{sfn|Czech Institute of Egyptology website|2018}} Further precision as to the architecture of the temple may be inferred from the absence{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=390}} of the obelisk determinative in some hieroglyphic variants of the name ''Sekhetre'' and its presence in others. For Anthony Spalinger this possibly indicates that Sahure's sun temple was effectively built and  acquired such an obelisk at some point after its construction, perhaps after Sahure's reign.{{sfn|Spalinger|1994|p=295 \u2013 296}}\n\n=== Nekhenre ===\nUserkaf was the first king to build a sun temple in Abusir. Known to the ancient Egyptians as the ''Nekhenre'', or \"Fortress of Re\", it was unfinished at his death. Construction works continued in at least four building phases, the first of which may have taken place under Sahure,{{sfn|Verner|2001a|p=390}} and then under his successors Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=150}}{{sfn|Verner|2001a|pp=387\u2013389}}\n\n== Pyramid complex ==\n{{main|Pyramid of Sahure}}\n[[Image:SahurePyramid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=Crumbling pyramid in the desert with scattered stones in front|The ruined pyramid of Sahure as seen from the pyramid's causeway]]\nSahure built a pyramid complex for his tomb and funerary cult, named ''Khaba Sahura'',{{sfn|Brugsch|2015|p=88}} which is variously translated as \"The Rising of the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ba .28soul.29|Ba]] Spirit of Sahure\",{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=143}}{{sfn|Hellum|2007|p=100}} \"The Ba of Sahure appears\",{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|2001|p=598}} \"Sahure's pyramid where the royal soul rises in splendor\",{{sfn|Bennett|1966|p=175}} or \"In glory comes forth the soul of Sahure\".{{sfn|Verner|Zemina|1994|p=71}} The builders and artisans who worked on Sahure's mortuary complex lived in an enclosed pyramid town  located next to the causeway leading up to Sahure's pyramid and mortuary temple.

Its inner core is made of roughly hewn stones organized in steps and held together in many sections with a thick mortar of mud. This construction technique, much cheaper and faster to execute than the stone-based techniques hitherto employed, fared much worse over time. Owing to this, Sahure's pyramid is now largely ruined and amounts to little more than a pile of rubble showing the crude filling of debris and mortar constituting the core, which became exposed after the casing stones were stolen in antiquity.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}\n\nWhile the core was under construction, a corridor was left open leading into the shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the [[Pyramid of Neferefre]].{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}} This technique also reflects the older style from the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at [[Dahshur]] and Giza during the Fourth Dynasty.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}\n\nThe entrance at the north side is a short descending corridor lined with red granite followed by a passageway ending at the burial chamber with its [[Gable|gabled roof]] comprising large limestone beams of several tons each.{{sfn|Edwards|1972|pp=175 \u2013 176, 180 \u2013 181 & 275}} Today all of these beams are fractured, which weakens the pyramid structure.

Some of its architectural elements, such as its palmiform columns, became hallmarks of Egyptian architecture.{{efn|group=note|The standard work on Sahure's pyramid complex is Borchardt's excavation report, available online in its entirety.{{sfn|Borchardt|1910}}}}{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=142 \u2013 144}}{{sfn|Hayes|1978|p=68}}\n\nThis trend continued to hold in later times. For example, in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], [[Senusret I]] had reliefs for his temple directly copied from those of Sahure. He also chose to follow the innovative layout of Sahure's complex once again. At the time, Senusret I's decision was in stark contrast with the burial customs of the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|11th Dynasty]] pharaohs, who were buried in saff tombs. These consisted of an open courtyard fronting a row of entrances into subterranean corridors and chambers dug in the hillsides of [[El-Tarif]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]], near Thebes.{{efn|group=note|This change may have been spurred by the return of the Egyptian capital to Middle Egypt, in [[Itjtawy]], close to Memphis and the attraction of then already ancient pyramids of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties.{{sfn|Lansing|1926|p=34}}}}{{sfn|Lansing|1926|p=34}}\n\n=== Cults ===\n\n==== Old Kingdom ====\n\nSahure was the object of a funerary cult from the time of his death and which continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, some 300 years later.

For example, Sahure is present on the Karnak king list, a list of kings inscribed on the walls of the ''Akhmenu'', the Karnak temple of Thutmose III. Unlike other ancient Egyptian king lists, the kings there are not listed in chronological order. Rather, the purpose of the list was purely religious, its aim being to name the deceased kings to be honored in the Karnak temple.{{sfn|Wildung|1969|pp=60 \u2013 63}}\n\nIn the second part of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and during the Nineteenth Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple.{{sfn|Borchardt|1910|p=101}}{{sfn|Peden|2001|pp=59 \u2013 60, 95 \u2013 96}}\nThese activities were related to a cult then taking place in the mortuary temple of Sahure since the time of Thutmose III.
