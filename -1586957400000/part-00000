Towns are generally larger than [[village]]s but smaller than [[city|cities]], though the criteria to distinguish them vary considerably between different parts of the world.\n\n== Origin and use ==\nThe word \"town\" shares an origin with the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|Zaun}}, the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word {{lang|nl|tuin}}, and the [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|tun}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/town|title=Town|publisher=Dictionary.com}}</ref> The original [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] word, *''tunan'', is thought to be an early borrowing from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] *''dunon'' (cf. [[Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|dun}}, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|din}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/town|title=Town|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nThe original sense of the word in both Germanic and Celtic was that of a fortress or an enclosure. Cognates of \"town\" in many modern Germanic languages designate a fence or a hedge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/town|title=Town|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> In English and Dutch, the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed, and through which a track must run.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In England, a town was a small community that could not afford or was not allowed to build walls or other larger fortifications, and built a [[palisade]] or stockade instead.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In the Netherlands, this space was a garden, more specifically those of the wealthy, which had a high fence or a wall around them (like the garden of the palace of [[Het Loo Palace|Het Loo]] in [[Apeldoorn]], which was the model for the privy garden of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] at [[Hampton Court]]). In Old Norse {{lang|non|tun}} means a (grassy) place between farmhouses, and the word is still used with a similar meaning in modern Norwegian.\n\nOld English ''tun'' became a common place-name suffix in England and southeastern Scotland during the Anglo-Saxon settlement period. In [[Old English]] and Early and Middle [[Scots language|Scots]], the words ''ton'', ''toun'', etc. could refer to diverse kinds of settlements from agricultural estates and holdings, partly picking up the Norse sense (as in the Scots word {{lang|sco|[[fermtoun]]}}) at one end of the scale, to fortified municipalities.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Other common Anglo-Saxon suffixes included ''ham'' (\"home\"), ''stede'' (\"stead\"), and ''burh'' (\"bury,\" \"borough,\" \"burgh\").\n\nIn some cases, \"town\" is an alternative name for \"city\" or \"village\" (especially a larger village). Sometimes, the word \"town\" is short for \"township\". In general, today towns can be differentiated from [[township]]s, [[village]]s, or [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s on the basis of their economic character, in that most of a town's population will tend to derive their living from manufacturing [[industry]], [[commerce]], and [[public service]]s rather than [[primary industry]] such as [[agriculture]] or related activities.\n\nA place's population size is not a reliable determinant of urban character. In many areas of the world, e.g. in [[India]] at least until recent times, a large village might contain several times as many people as a small town. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are historical cities [[List of urban areas in England by population|that are far smaller]] than the larger towns.\n\nThe modern phenomenon of extensive [[suburb]]an growth, satellite urban development, and migration of city dwellers to villages has further complicated the definition of towns, creating communities urban in their economic and cultural characteristics but lacking other characteristics of urban localities.\n\nSome forms of non-rural settlement, such as temporary [[mining]] locations, may be clearly non-rural, but have at best a questionable claim to be called a town.\n\nTowns often exist as distinct governmental units, with legally defined borders and some or all of the appurtenances of local government (e.g. a [[police]] force). In the United States these are referred to as \"incorporated towns\". In other cases the town lacks its own governance and is said to be \"unincorporated\". Note that the existence of an unincorporated town may be legally set out by other means, e.g. zoning districts. In the case of some [[planned community|planned communities]], the town exists legally in the form of covenants on the properties within the town. The [[United States Census]] identifies many [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs) by the names of unincorporated towns which lie within them; however, those CDPs typically include rural and suburban areas and even surrounding villages and other towns.\n\nThe distinction between a town and a city similarly depends on the approach: a city may strictly be an administrative entity which has been granted that designation by law, but in informal usage, the term is also used to denote an urban locality of a particular size or importance: whereas a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] city may have possessed as few as 10,000 inhabitants, today some{{who|date=November 2014}} consider an urban place of fewer than 100,000 as a town, even though there are many officially designated cities that are much smaller than that.\n\n== Age of towns scheme ==\n[[Australian]] geographer [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] proposed a classification of towns based on their age and pattern of [[land use]]. He identified five types of town:<ref>Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.</ref>\n\n* ''Infantile towns'', with no clear [[zoning]]\n* ''Juvenile towns'', which have developed an area of [[Retailing|shop]]s\n* ''Adolescent towns'', where [[factory|factories]] have started to appear\n* ''Early mature towns'', with a separate area of [[social class|high-class]] [[house|housing]]\n* ''Mature towns'', with defined [[industry|industrial]], [[commerce|commercial]] and various types of [[residential area]]\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn [[Afghanistan]], towns and cities are known as ''sh\u0101r'' ([[Dari language|Dari]]: \u0634\u0647\u0631, [[Pashto]]: \u069a\u0627\u0631).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:687.raverty|title=A dictionary of the Puk'hto, Pus'hto, or language of the Afghans|website=dsalsrv0 2.uchicago.edu|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> As the country is an historically rural society with few larger settlements, with major cities never holding more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants before the 2000s, the lingual tradition of the country does not discriminate between towns and cities.\n\n=== Albania ===\nIn [[Albania]] \"qytez\u00eb\" means town, which is very similar with the word for city (''\"qytet\"''). Although there is no official use of the term for any settlement. \nIn [[albanian language|Albanian]] \"qytez\u00eb\" means \"small city\" or \"new city\", while in ancient times \"small residential center within the walls of a castle\".\n\n=== Arab ===\nThe center is a population group, larger than a village, and smaller than a city. Though the village is bigger than a hamlet.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn [[Australia]], most rural and regional centres of population can be called towns; many small towns have populations of less than 200.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics, \"Frequently Asked Questions\". https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Frequently+Asked+Questions#Anchor12 Retrieved 16 Oct 2019.</ref> The smallest may be described as townships.\n\nIn addition, some local government entities are officially styled as towns in [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]], and formerly also (till the 1990s) in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n=== Austria ===\n\nThe [[Austria]]n legal system does not distinguish between villages, towns, and cities. The country is partitioned into 2098 municipalities ({{lang-de|Gemeinden}}) of fundamentally equal rank. Larger municipalities are designated as market towns ({{lang-de|Marktgemeinden}}) or cities (''St\u00e4dte''), but these distinctions are purely symbolic and do not confer additional legal responsibilities. There is a number of smaller communities that are labelled cities because they used to be regional population centers in the distant past. The city of [[Rattenberg]] for example has about 400 inhabitants. The city of [[Hardegg]] has about 1200 inhabitants, although the historic city core \u2212 Hardegg proper without what used to be the surrounding hamlets \u2212 is home to just 80 souls.\n\nThere are no unincorporated areas.\n\nOf the 201 cities in Austria, 15 are [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] (''Statutarst\u00e4dte''). A statutory city is a city that is vested, in addition to its purview as a municipality, with the duties of a [[district (Austria)|district administrative authority]]. The status does not come with any additional autonomy: district administrative authorities are essentially just service centers that citizens use to interact with the national government, for example to apply for driver licenses or passports. The national government generally uses the provinces to run these points of contact on its behalf; in the case of statutory cities, the municipality gets to step up.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Bulgaria}}\n\nBulgarians do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. However, in everyday language and media the terms \"large towns\" and \"small towns\" are in use. \"Large towns\" usually refers to [[Sofia]], [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]], which have population over 200,000. [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] and [[Stara Zagora]] are often included as well due to presence of relatively developed infrastructure and population over 100,000 threshold. It is difficult to call the remaining [[Provinces of Bulgaria|provincial capitals]] \"large towns\" as, in general, they are less developed and have shrinking population, some with as few as 30,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]] the [[Council of Ministers of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] defines what constitutes a settlement, while the [[President of Bulgaria]] grants each settlement its title. In 2005 the requirement that villages that wish to classify themselves as town must have a social and technical infrastructure, as well as a population of no fewer than 3500 people. For resort settlements the requirements are lower with the population needing to be no fewer than 1000 people but infrastructure requirements remain.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Main|List of towns in Canada|Municipal government in Canada}}\nThe legal definition of a town in [[Canada]] varies by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]], as each has jurisdiction over defining and legislating towns, cities and other types of municipal organization within its own boundaries.\n\nThe province of [[Quebec]] is unique in that it makes no distinction under law between towns and cities. There is no intermediate level in French between ''village'' and ''ville'' (''municipality'' is an administrative term usually applied to a legal, not geographical entity), so both are combined under the single legal status of ''[[ville]]''. While an informal preference may exist among English speakers as to whether any individual ''ville'' is commonly referred to as a city or as a town, no distinction and no objective legal criteria exist to make such a distinction under law.\n\n=== Chile ===\nIn [[Chile]], towns (Spanish: ''pueblos'') are defined by the National Statistics Institute (INE) as an urban entity with a population from 2001 to 5000 or an area with a population from 1001 to 2000 and an established economic activity.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn the Czech Republic, the word ''m\u011bsto'' (city) is used for very wide variety of municipalities, ranging from [[Prague]], the largest and capital city with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants, to the smallest, [[P\u0159ebuz]], with just 74 inhabitants.  Technically, a municipality must have at least 3,000 inhabitants to be granted the ''m\u011bsto'' title, although many smaller municipalities,  especially some former mining towns, retain the title ''m\u011bsto'' for historic reasons.  Currently, approximately 192 of the 592 ''m\u011bsta'' have less than 3,000 inhabitants.\n\nSome municipalities have been amalgamated together, such that the whole is considered as a ''m\u011bsto''.\n\n[[Statutory city (Czech Republic)|Statutory cities]] (''statut\u00e1rn\u00ed m\u011bsto''), which are defined by law no. 128/2000 Coll.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128 |title=Consolidated version of Law no. 128/200 Coll |publisher=Zakonyprolidi.cz |date=2000-05-15 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref> can define their own self-governing municipal districts.. There are 25 such cities, in addition to [[Prague]], which is a ''de facto'' statutory city.\n\nIn 2006, the legal concept of a town (''[[m\u011bstys]]'', or formerly ''m\u011bste\u010dko'') was reintroduced. Currently, around 213 municipalities hold the title ''m\u011bstys''.\n\nMunicipalities which do not qualify as a ''m\u011bsto'' or a ''m\u011bstys'' default to the title of ''obec'' (a municipality) or, unofficially, a ''vesnice'' (village), even though they may consist of one or more villages.\n\n=== Denmark ===\nIn [[Denmark]], in many contexts no distinction is made between \"city\", \"town\" and \"village\"; all three translate as \"by\". In more specific use, for small villages and [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] the word \"landsby\" (meaning \"country town\") is used, while the Danish equivalent of English \"city\" is \"storby\" (meaning \"large town\"). For formal purposes, [[urban area]]s having at least 200 inhabitants are counted as \"by\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/Vejviser/dokumentation/Varedeklarationer/emnegruppe/emne.aspx?sysrid=000766 |title=Byopg\u00f8relsen pr. 1. januar \u2013 Varedeklaration \u2013 Danmarks Statistik |publisher=Dst.dk |date=2005-03-22 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>\n\nHistorically some towns held various privileges, the most important of which was the right to hold market. They were administered separately from the rural areas in both fiscal, military and legal matters. Such towns are known as \"k\u00f8bstad\" (roughly the same meaning as \"borough\" albeit deriving from a different etymology) and they retain the exclusive right to the title even after the last vestiges of their privileges vanished through the reform of the local administration carried through in 1970.\n\n===Estonia===\nIn [[Estonia]], there is no distinction between a town and a city as the word ''linn'' is used for both bigger and smaller settlements, which are bigger than villages and boroughs. There are 30 [[Municipalities of Estonia|municipal towns]] (''omavalitsuslik linn'') in Estonia and a [[List of cities and towns in Estonia|further 17 towns]], which have merged with a municipal parish (''vallasisene linn'').\n\n[[File:Salins les Bains 2.JPG|thumb|The town of [[Salins-les-Bains]], [[France]]]]\n\n=== France ===\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the smallest level of local authorities are all called [[Communes of France|\"communes\"]]. Those can have anywhere from a handful to millions of inhabitants, and France has 36000 of them. The French term for \"town\" is \"[[:fr:Bourg|bourg]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/bourg |title=BOURG : D\u00e9finition de BOURG |date=n.d. |website=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales' |access-date=March 22, 2020 |language=french |trans-title=BOURG: Definition of BOURG }}</ref> but French laws does not really distinguish between towns and cities which are all commonly called \"villes\". However, some laws do treat these authorities differently based on the population and different rules apply to the three big cities [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]]. For historical reasons, [[List of French villages destroyed in World War I|six communes]] in the [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] d\u00e9partement exist as independent administrative entities despite having no inhabitant at all.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the national statistical institute ([[INSEE]]) operates a distinction between urban areas with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and bigger communes, the latter being called \"villes\". Smaller settlements are usually called \"villages\".\n\n[[File:Putbus (2011-05-21) 14.JPG|thumb|[[Putbus]] on [[R\u00fcgen|R\u00fcgen Island]], Germany]]\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Germany}}\n\n[[Germany|Germans]] do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. The German word for both is ''Stadt'', as it is the case in many other languages that do not differentiate between these Anglo-Saxon concepts. The word for a 'village', as a smaller settlement, is ''Dorf''. However, the International Statistics Conference of 1887 defined different sizes of ''Stadt'', based on their population size, as follows: ''Landstadt'' (\"country town\"; under 5,000), ''Kleinstadt'' (\"small town\"; 5,000 to 20,000), ''Mittelstadt'' (\"middle town\"; between 20,000 and 100,000) and ''Gro\u00dfstadt'' (\"large town\"; over 100,000).<ref>Universit\u00e4t Dortmund: [http://www.raumplanung.uni-dortmund.de/srp/web/dokumente/downloads/64_SRPapers%20Nr.1.pdf Kleine und mittlere St\u00e4dte \u2013 Blaupausen der Gro\u00dfstadt?], Dokumentation des Expertenkolloquiums am 29. April 2004 in Dortmund</ref> The term ''Gro\u00dfstadt'' may be translated as \"city\". In addition, Germans may speak of a ''Millionenstadt'', a city with over one million inhabitants (such as [[Munich]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]]).\n\nHistorically, many settlements became a ''Stadt'' by being awarded a [[Town privileges|''Stadtrecht'']] in medieval times. In modern German language use, the historical importance, the existence of central functions (education, retail etc.) and the population density of an urban place might also be taken as characteristics of a ''Stadt''. The modern local government organisation is subject to the laws of each [[States of Germany|state]] and refers to a ''Gemeinde'' ([[States of Germany#Municipalities (Gemeinden)|municipality]]), regardless of its historic title. While most ''Gemeinden'' form part of a ''Landkreis'' ([[States of Germany#Administrative districts (Kreise)|district]]) on a higher tier of local government, larger towns and cities may have the status of a ''kreisfreie Stadt'', combining both the powers of a municipality and a district.\n\nDesignations in different states are as diverse as e.g. in Australian States and Territories, and differ from state to state. In some German states, the words ''Markt'' (\"market\"), ''Marktflecken'' (both used in southern Germany) or ''Flecken'' (\"spot\"; northern Germany e.g. in [[Lower Saxony]]) designate a town-like residential community between ''Gemeinde'' and ''Stadt'' with special importance to its outer conurbation area. Historically those had ''Marktrecht'' (market right) but not full town privileges; see [[Market town]]. The legal denomination of a specific settlement may differ from its common designation (e.g. ''Samtgemeinde'' \u2013 a legal term in [[Lower Saxony]] for a group of villages [''Dorf'', pl. ''D\u00f6rfer''] with common local government created by combining municipalities [''Gemeinde'', pl. ''Gemeinden'']).\n\n=== Greece and Cyprus ===\nIn ordinary speech, [[Greeks]] use the word \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc (=village) to refer to smaller settlements and the word \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 or \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (=city) to refer to larger ones. Careful speakers may also use the word \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 to refer to towns with a population of 2,000\u20139,999. \nIn Greek administrative law there used to be a distinction between \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, i.e. municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants or considered important for some other geographical (county seats), historical or ecclesiastical (bishops' seats) reason, and \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, referring to smaller self-governing units, mostly villages. A sweeping reform, carried out in two stages early in the 21st century, merged most \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 with the nearest \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, dividing the whole country into 325 big self-governing \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9. The former municipalities survive as administrative subdivisions (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2).\n\nCyprus, including the Turkish-occupied areas, is also divided into 39 \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 (in principle, with at least 5,000 inhabitants, though there are exceptions) and 576 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Hong Kong#Towns|l1=List of cities and towns in Hong Kong}}\n[[File:ShatinTownHall 20070529.jpg|thumb|Nearly every town in Hong Kong has its own town hall. The picture shows the [[Sha Tin Town Hall]] in the town of [[Sha Tin]].]]\n\n[[Hong Kong]] started developing new towns in the 1950s, to accommodate exponential population increase. The very first new towns included [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]] and [[Kwun Tong]]. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, another stage of new town developments was launched. Nine new towns have been developed so far. Land use is carefully planned and development provides plenty of room for public housing projects. Rail transport is usually available at a later stage. The first towns are [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]], [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]], [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] and [[Tseung Kwan O]]. [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] was intended to be self-reliant, but was not successful and turned into a [[bedroom community]] like the other new towns. More recent developments are [[Tin Shui Wai New Town|Tin Shui Wai]] and [[North Lantau New Town|North Lantau (Tung Chung-Tai Ho)]].\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn [[Hungary]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in Hungarian is: v\u00e1ros). Nevertheless, the expressions formed by adding the adjectives \"kis\" (small) and \"nagy\" (large) to the beginning of the root word (e.g. \"nagyv\u00e1ros\") have been normalized to differentiate between cities and towns (towns being smaller, therefore bearing the name \"kisv\u00e1ros\".) In Hungary, a village can gain the status of \"v\u00e1ros\" (town), if it meets a set of diverse conditions for quality of life and development of certain public services and utilities (e.g. having a local secondary school or installing full-area sewage collection pipe network). Every year the Minister of Internal Affairs selects candidates from a committee-screened list of applicants, whom the President of Republic usually affirms by issuing a bill of town's rank to them. Since being a town carries extra fiscal support from the government, many relatively small villages try to win the status of \"v\u00e1rosi rang\" nowadays.\n\nBefore the [[fall of communism]] in 1990, Hungarian villages with fewer than 10,000 residents were not allowed to become towns. Recently some settlements as small as 2,500 souls have received the rank of town (e.g. Visegr\u00e1d, Zalakaros or G\u00f6nc) and meeting the conditions of development is often disregarded to quickly elevate larger villages into towns. As of middle 2013, there are 346 towns in Hungary, encompassing some 69% of the entire population.\n\nTowns of more than 50,000 people are able to gain the status of \"megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1ros\" (town with the rights of a [[county]]), which allows them to maintain a higher degree of [[Public service|services]]. (There are a few exceptions, when towns of fewer than 50,000 people gained the status: [[\u00c9rd]], [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]], [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] and [[Szeksz\u00e1rd]])<ref>[http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/regiok/veszpremmjv10.pdf Megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosok] \u2013 essay of [[Hungarian Central Statistical Office]] (Hungarian, July 2012)</ref> As of middle 2013, there are only 23 such towns in Hungary.<ref>[http://www.terport.hu/telepulesek/telepulestipusok/megyei-jogu-varosok/magyarorszag-megyei-jogu-varosai \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosai\"] \u2013 list of Hungarian town with the rights of a county on \"T\u00e9rport\" related webpage of Ministry of National Development (Hungarian, access date: May 4, 2013.)</ref>\n\n=== Iceland ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Iceland}}\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{Main|List of populated places in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nThe '''Local Government act 2001''' provides that from January 1, 2002 (section 10 subsection (3)\n''Within the county in which they are situated and of which they form part, there continue to be such other local government areas as are set out in Schedule 6 which \u2013 (a) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of that Schedule, shall be known as boroughs, and \u2013 (b) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 2 of Part 1 and Part 2 of that Schedule, shall be known as towns, and in this Act a reference to a town shall include a reference to a borough.''\n\nThese provisions affect the replacement of the boroughs, Towns and urban districts which existed before then. Similar reforms in the nomenclature of local authorities ( but not their functions) are effected by section 11 part 17 of the act includes provision (section 185(2))\n''Qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census or such other figure as the Minister may from time to time prescribe by regulations, and not having a [[town council]], may make a proposal in accordance with paragraph (b) for the establishment of such a council''\nand contains provisions enabling the establishment of new town councils and provisions enabling the dissolution of existing or new town councils in certain circumstances\n\nThe reference to ''town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census'' hands much of the power relating to defining what is in fact a town over to the Central Statistics Office and their criteria are published as part of each census.\n\n;Planning and Development Act 2000\nAnother reference to the Census and its role in determining what is or is not a town for some administrative purpose is in the Planning and Development act 2000 (part II chapter I which provides for Local area plans)\n\n''A local area plan shall be made in respect of an area which \u2014(i) is designated as a town in the most recent census of population, other than a town designated as a suburb or environs in that census, (ii) has a population in excess of 2,000, and (iii) is situated within the functional area of a planning authority which is a county council.''\n\n;Central Statistics Office criteria\nThese are set out in full at [http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census_2006_Appendices.pdf 2006 Census Appendices].\n\nIn short they speak of \"towns with legally defined boundaries\" ( i.e. those established by the Local Government Act 2001) and the remaining 664 as \"census towns\", defined by themselves since 1971 as ''a cluster of 50 or more occupied dwellings in which within a distance of 800 meters there is a nucleus of 30 occupied houses on both sides of the road or twenty occupied houses on one side of the road'' there is also a ''200 meter criterion'' for determining whether a house is part of a census town.\n\n=== India ===\n[[File:One of the high streets in Paravur.jpg|right|thumb|A street in [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]] town, India]]\nThe [[2011 Census of India]] defines towns of two types: statutory town and [[census town]]. Statutory town is defined as all places with a [[municipality]], [[Municipal corporation|corporation]], [[Cantonment Board|cantonment board]] or notified town area committee. Census towns are defined as places that satisfy the following criteria:\n# Minimum population of 5,000\n# At least 75% of male working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits\n# Density of population at least 400/km<sup>2</sup>.

In older Persian texts (until the first half of the 20th century), the Arabic word \"Qasabeh\" (\u0642\u0635\u0628\u0647) was used for a town. However, in recent 50 years, this word has become obsolete.\n\nThere is a word in Persian which is used for special sort of satellite townships and city neighborhoods. It is ''Shahrak'' (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u06a9), (lit.: small city).\nAnother smaller type of town or [[neighborhood]] in a big city is called ''Kuy'' (\u06a9\u0648\u06cc). ''Shahrak'' and ''Kuy'' each have their different legal definitions.\nLarge cities such as [[Tehran]], [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Tabriz]], etc. which have millions of populations are referred to as ''Kalan-shahr''\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0634\u0647\u0631 ([[metropole]]).\n\nThe pace in which different large villages have gained city status in [[Iran]] shows a dramatic increase in the last two decades.\n\nBigger cities and towns usually are centers of a [[township]] (in Persian: ''Shahrestan'' (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646). Shahrestan itself is a subdivision of ''Ostan'' \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 (Province).\n\n===Isle of Man===\nThere are four settlements which are historically and officially designated as towns (Douglas, Ramsey, Peel, Castletown); however\n\n* Peel is also sometimes referred to as a city by virtue of its cathedral.\n* Onchan and Port Erin are both larger in population than the smallest \"town\", having expanded in modern times, but are designated as villages.\n\n=== Israel ===\n[[Modern Hebrew]] does provide a word for the concept of a town: ''Ayara'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4),  derived from ''Ir'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8), the biblical word for \"city\". However, the term ''ayara'' is normally used only to describe towns in foreign countries, i.e. urban areas of limited population, particularly when the speaker is attempting to evoke nostalgic or romantic attitudes. The term is also used to describe a [[Shtetl]], a pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[Eastern Europe]]an Jewish town.\n\nWithin Israel, established urban areas are always referred to as cities (with one notable exception explained below) regardless of their actual size. Israeli law does not define any nomenclature for distinction between urban areas based on size or any other factor \u2013 meaning that all urban settlements in Israel are legally referred to as \"cities\".\n\nThe exception to the above is the term ''Ayeret Pituakh'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05e4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05d7, lit. \"Development Town\") which is applied to certain cities in Israel based on the reasons for their establishment. These cities, created during the earlier decades of Israeli independence (1950s and 1960s, generally), were designed primarily to serve as commercial and transportation hubs, connecting smaller agricultural settlements in the northern and southern regions of the country (the \"Periphery\") to the major urban areas of the coastal and central regions. Some of these \"development towns\" have since grown to a comparatively large size, and yet are still referred to as \"development towns\", particularly when the speaker wishes to emphasize their (often low) socio-economic status. Nonetheless, they are rarely (if ever) referred to simply as \"towns\"; when referring to one directly, it will be called either a \"development town\" or a \"city\", depending on context.\n\n=== Italy ===\nAlthough Italian provides different words for city (''citt\u00e0''), town (''paese'') and village (''villaggio'', old-fashioned, or ''[[frazione]]'', most common), no legal definitions exist as to how settlements must be classified. Administratively, both towns and cities are ruled as [[comuni]]/[[comune]]s, while villages might be subdivisions of the former. \nGenerally, in everyday's speech, a town is larger or more populated than a village and smaller than a city. Various cities and towns together may form a metropolitan area (''area metropolitana''). A city, can also be a culturally, economically or politically prominent community with respect to surrounding towns. Moreover, a city can be such by [[President of Italy|Presidential]] decree. A town, in contrast, can be an inhabited place which would elsewhere be styled a city, but has not received any official recognition.\nRemarkable exceptions do exist: for instance, [[Bassano del Grappa]], was given the status of \"citt\u00e0\" in 1760 by [[Francesco Loredan]]'s [[Doge|dogal]] decree and has since then carried this title. Also, the Italian word for town (''paese'' with lowercase P) must not be confused with the Italian word for country/nation (''Paese'' usually with uppercase P).\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn Japan city status (''[[Cities of Japan|shi]]'') was traditionally reserved for only a few particularly large settlements. Over time however the necessary conditions to be a city have been watered down and today the only loose rules that apply are having a population over 50,000 and over 60% of the population in a \"city centre\". In recent times many small villages and towns have merged in order to form a city despite seeming geographically to be just a collection of villages.\n\nThe distinction between towns (''[[Towns of Japan|machi/ch\u014d]]'') and villages (''[[Villages of Japan|mura/son]]'') is largely unwritten and purely one of population size when the settlement was founded with villages having under 10,000 and towns 10,000\u201350,000.\n\n=== Korea ===\n{{main|Eup (administrative division)}}\nIn both of South Korea and North Korea, towns are called ''[[Eup (administrative division)|eup]]'' (''\uc74d'').\n\n=== Latvia ===\nIn [[Latvia]], towns and cities are indiscriminately called ''pils\u0113ta'' in singular form. The name is a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of two Latvian words: ''pils'' (castle) and ''s\u0113ta'' (fence), making it very obvious what is meant by the word \u2013 what is situated between the castle and the castle fence. However, a city can be called ''lielpils\u0113ta'' in reference to its size. A village is called ''ciemats'' or ''ciems'' in Latvian.\n\n=== Lithuania ===\n{{main|List of towns in Lithuania}}\nIn [[Lithuania]]n,  a city is called ''[[:lt:miestas|miestas]]'', a town is called ''[[:lt:miestelis|miestelis]]'' (literally \"small ''miestas''). [[Metropolis]] is called ''[[:lt:didmiestis|didmiestis]]'' (literally \"big ''miestas'').\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nIn [[Malaysia]], a town is the area administered by Municipal Council ({{lang-ms|1=Majlis Perbandaran}}).\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nBefore 1848 there was a legal distinction between ''stad'' and non-''stad'' parts of the country, but the word no longer has any legal significance. About 220 places were granted ''stadsrechten'' (city rights) and are still so called for historical and traditional reasons, though the word is also used for large urban areas that never obtained such rights. Because of this, in the [[Netherlands]], no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as ''stad''. A hamlet (''gehucht'') usually has fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, a village (''dorp'') ranges from 1,000 up to 25,000 inhabitants, and a place above 25,000 can call itself either village or city, mostly depending on historic reasons or size of the place. As an example, [[The Hague]] never gained city rights, but because of its size - more than half a million inhabitants - it is regarded as a city. [[Staverden]], with only 40 inhabitants, would be a hamlet, but because of its city rights it may call itself a city.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the Netherlands has three sorts of cities:\n* ''kleine stad'' (small city): 50,000 \u2014 99,999 inhabitants\n* ''middelgrote stad'' (medium-sized city): 100,000 \u2014 249,999 inhabitants\n* ''grote stad'' (large city): 250,000 or more\n\nOnly [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht]] are regarded as a ''grote stad''.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn [[New Zealand]], a town is a built-up area that is not large enough to be considered a city. Historically, this definition corresponded to a population of between approximately 1,000 and 20,000. Towns have no independent legal existence, being administered simply as built-up parts of districts, or, in some cases, of cities.\n\nNew Zealand's towns vary greatly in size and importance, ranging from small rural service centres to significant regional centres such as [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and [[Taupo]]. Typically, once a town reaches a population of somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 people, it will begin to be informally regarded as a city. One who regards a settlement as too small to be a town will typically call it a \"township\" or \"village.\"\n\n=== Norway ===\nIn [[Norway]], \"city\" and \"town\" both translate to \"[[By (city or town)|by]]\", even if a city may be referred to as \"storby\" (\"large town\"). They will all be part of and administered as a \"[[Municipalities of Norway|kommune]]\" (\"[[municipality]]\").\n\nNorway has had inland the northernmost city in the world: Hammerfest. Now the record is held by New \u00c5lesund on the Norwegian island Svalbard\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[File:Loboc Bohol 1.jpg|thumb|The town center of [[Loboc, Bohol]].]]\n{{Main|List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|Municipalities of the Philippines}}\nIn the [[Philippines]], the local official equivalent of the town is the [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] (Filipino ''bayan''). Every municipality, or town, in the country has a mayor (Filipino ''alkalde'') and a vice mayor (Filipino ''bise alkalde'') as well as local town officials ([[Sangguniang Bayan]]). Philippine towns, otherwise called as municipalities, are composed of a number of villages and communities called ''[[barangays]]'' with one (or a few cluster of) ''barangay''(s) serving as the town center or ''[[poblacion]]''.\n\nUnique in Philippine towns is that they have fixed budget, population and land requirements to become as such, i.e. from a ''barangay'', or a cluster of such, to a town, or to become cities, i.e. from town to a city. Respectively, examples of these are the town of [[Braulio E. Dujali, Davao del Norte|B.E. Dujali]] in [[Davao del Norte]] province, which was formed in 1998 from a cluster of 5 ''barangays'', and the city of [[El Salvador, Misamis Oriental|El Salvador]], which was converted from a town to a city in 2007. Each town in the Philippines was classified by its [[Municipalities of the Philippines#Income classification|annual income and budget]].\n\nA sharp, hierarchical distinction exists between Philippine [[Philippine city|cities]] (Filipino ''lungsod'' or ''siyudad'') and towns, as towns in the country are juridically separate from cities, which are typically larger and more populous (some smaller and less populated) and which political and economic status are above those of towns. This was further supported and indicated by the income classification system implemented by the National Department of Finance, to which both cities and towns fell into their respective categories that indicate they are such as stated under Philippine law. However, both towns and cities equally share the status as [[Administrative divisions of the Philippines#Local government units|local government units]] (LGU's) grouped under and belong to [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]]; both each are composed of ''barangays'' and are governed by a mayor and a vice mayor supplemented by their respective LGU legislative councils.\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Zamo\u015b\u0107. Ratusz..jpg|thumb|right|[[Zamo\u015b\u0107]] in [[Poland]] is an example of a [[utopia]]n [[ideal town]]. It was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1992]]\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Poland}}\n\nSimilarly to Germany and Sweden, in [[Poland]] there is no linguistic distinction between a city and a town. The word for both is ''miasto'', as a form of settlement distinct from following: village (wie\u015b), hamlet (przysi\u00f3\u0142ek), settlement (osada), or colony (kolonia). Town status is conferred by administrative decree, new towns are announced by the Government in a separate Bill effective from the first day of the year. Some settlements tend to remain villages even though they have a larger population than many smaller towns. Town may be called in diminutive way as \"miasteczko\", what is colloquially used for localities with a few thousand residents. Such localities have usually a '''Mayor''' (burmistrz) as a chief of town council.\n\nCities are the biggest localities, generally must be bigger than 100 thousand of residents, they are ruled by '''President''' (prezydent) as a chief of City Council. There are bare a few (mainly historic or political) exemptions which have allowed towns lesser than 100 thousand of people, to obtain President title for their Mayors, and to become recognized as Cities that way. Just to name a few: [[Boles\u0142awiec]], [[Gniezno]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]].\n\n=== Portugal ===\nLike other Iberian cultures, in [[Portugal]] there is a traditional distinction between towns (''[[:pt:Vila|vilas]]'') and cities (''[[:pt:Cidade|cidades]]''). Similarly, although these areas are not defined under the constitution, and have no political function (with associated organs), they are defined by law,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |title=Law n.\u00ba 11/82 (Lei das designa\u00e7\u00f5es e determina\u00e7\u00e3o de categoria das povoa\u00e7\u00f5es), of June, 2nd |accessdate=2010-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100608050009/http%3A//www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-08 }}</ref> and a town must have:\n* at least 3,000 inhabitants\n* at least half of these services: health unit, pharmacy, cultural centre, public transportation network, post office, commercial food and drinking establishments, primary school and/or bank office\nIn this context, the town or city is subordinate to the local authority ([[freguesia|civil parish]] or [[concelho|municipality]], in comparison to the North American context, where they have political functions. In special cases, some [[village]]s may be granted the status of town if they possess historical, cultural or architectonic importance.\n\nThe Portuguese urban settlements [[heraldry]] reflects the difference between towns and cities,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/pt-_m.html#rules |website=Flags of the World|title = Portuguese municipal flags |publisher= Crwflags.com |accessdate=}}</ref> with the [[coat of arms]] of a town bearing a crown with 4 towers, while the coat of arms of a city bears a crown with 5 towers. This difference between towns and cities is still in use in other Portuguese speaking countries, but in Brazil is no longer in use.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Romania}}\n\nIn [[Romania]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is: ''ora\u015f''). Cities and towns in Romania can have the status either of ''ora\u015f'' [[municipiu]], conferred to large urban areas, or only ''ora\u015f'' to smaller urban localities. Some settlements remain villages ([[Communes of Romania|communes]]) even though they have a larger population than other smaller towns.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Types of inhabited localities in Russia}}\n\n[[File:moscow reutov.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Reutov]] is separated from the city of [[Moscow]] just by the [[Moscow Ring Road|MKAD]] highway]]\n\nUnlike [[English language|English]], the [[Russian language]] does not distinguish the terms \"city\" and \"town\"\u2014both are translated as \"{{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434}}\" (''gorod'').  Occasionally the term \"{{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434}}\" is applied to [[urban-type settlement]]s as well, even though the status of those is not the same as that of a city/town proper.\n\nIn Russia, the criteria an inhabited locality needs to meet in order to be granted city/town (''gorod'') status vary in different [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]. In general, to qualify for this status, an inhabited locality should have more than 12,000 inhabitants and the occupation of no less than 85% of inhabitants must be other than agriculture. However, inhabited localities which were previously granted the city/town status but no longer meet the criteria can still retain the status for historical reasons.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{main|New towns of Singapore}}\nIn Singapore, towns are large scale satellite housing developments which are designed to be self contained. It includes public housing units, a town centre and other amenities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Maisy|date=July 2014|title=Estimating the distortionary effects of ethnic quotas in Singapore using housing transactions|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=115|issue=|pages=131\u2013145|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.04.006|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/real-estate_papers/9}}</ref> Helmed by a hierarchy of commercial developments, ranging from a town centre to precinct-level outlets, there is no need to venture out of town to meet the most common needs of residences. Employment can be found in industrial estates located within several towns. Educational, health care, and recreational needs are also taken care of with the provision of schools, hospitals, parks, sports complexes, and so on. The most populous town in the country is [[Bedok]].\n[[File:1 2014 panorama bishan park aerial gopro dji phantom.jpg|600px|thumb|center|[[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]], one of Singapore's towns is the 38th biggest in terms of geographical size and the 21st most populated planning area in the country.]]\n\n===South Africa===\nIn South Africa the [[Afrikaans]] term \"Dorp\" is used interchangeably with the English equivalent of \"Town\". A \"town\" is a settlement that has a size that is smaller than that of a city.\n\n=== Spain ===\nIn [[Spain]], the equivalent of town would be ''villa,'' a population unit between a village (''pueblo)'' and a city ''(ciudad)'', and is not defined by the number of inhabitants, but by some historical rights and privileges dating from the Middle Ages, such as the right to hold a market or fair. For instance, while [[Madrid]] is technically a ''villa'', [[Barcelona]], with a smaller population, is known as a city.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:\u00d6vre Finngr\u00e4nd 7 Sta Maria 29 Visby Gotland.jpg|thumbnail|View towards [[Visby Cathedral|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Visby]], [[Sweden]].

Today it is the seat of [[Gotland Municipality]].]]\n{{See also|Stad (Sweden)|K\u00f6ping}}\n\nThe [[Swedish language]] does not differentiate between towns and cities in the English sense of the words; both words are commonly translated as ''stad'', a term which has no legal significance today. The term ''t\u00e4tort'' is used for an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] or a locality, which however is a statistical rather than an administrative concept and encompasses densely settled villages with only 200 inhabitants as well as the major cities. The word ''[[k\u00f6ping]]'' corresponds to an English ''[[market town]]'' ''(chipping)'' or German ''[[wikt:Markt|Markt]]'' but is mainly of historical significance, as the term is not used today and only survives in some [[toponym]]s. Some towns with names ending in ''-k\u00f6ping'' are cities with over 100 000 inhabitants today, e.g. [[Link\u00f6ping]].\n\nBefore 1971, 132 larger [[Municipality|municipalities]] in [[Sweden]] enjoyed special royal charters as ''[[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]'' instead of ''[[kommun]]'' (which is similar to a US [[County (United States)|county]]). However, since 1971 all municipalities are officially defined as ''kommun'', thus making no legal difference between, for instance, [[Stockholm]] and a small countryside municipality. Every urban area that was a ''stad'' before 1971 is still often referred to as a ''stad'' in daily speech. Since the 1980s, 14 of these municipalities brand themselves as ''stad'' again, although this has no legal or administrative significance, as they still have refer to themselves as ''kommun'' in all legal documentation.\n\nFor statistical purposes, [[Statistics Sweden]] officially defines a ''stad'' as an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] of at least 10,000 inhabitants. In the [[Swedish language]] the term for a major city is ''storstad'' (literally \"big town\"), but there is no clear definition as to when a ''stad'' should be called a ''storstad''. Most Swedes would only call [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malm\u00f6]] ''storst\u00e4der'', i.e. \"major cities\", although [[Uppsala]] fulfills the definition of \"municipality with a population that exceeds 200 000 inhabitants\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/BE/LE0102/2002A01/LE0102_2002A01_BR_12_BE51ST0307.pdf |title=Bilaga 1.

Public electronic dictionary of Ukrainian language (ukrlit.org)</ref> Historically, town in the Ukrainian lands was a smaller populated place that was chartered under the [[German town law]] and had a market square (see [[Market town]]). \nToday informally, town is also referred to [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|cities of district significance]], cities with small population, and former Jewish [[shtetl]]s.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{Main|City status in the United Kingdom}}\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{Main|List of urban areas in England by population|list of urban areas in Wales by population}}\n\n[[File:Rugby town centre.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional English town centre at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]]]\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], a town traditionally was a settlement which had a charter to hold a [[Market (place)|market]] or [[fair]] and therefore became a \"[[market town]]\". Market towns were distinguished from villages in that they were the economic hub of a surrounding area, and were usually larger and had more facilities.\n\nIn parallel with popular usage, however, there are many technical and official definitions of what constitutes a town, to which various interested parties cling.\n\nIn modern official usage the term ''town'' is employed either for old market towns, or for settlements which have a [[town council]], or for settlements which elsewhere would be classed a city, but which do not have [[City status in the United Kingdom|the legal right]] to call themselves such. Any parish council can decide to describe itself as a town council, but this will usually only apply to the smallest \"towns\" (because larger towns will be larger than a single civil parish).\n\nNot all settlements which are commonly described as towns have a \"Town Council\" or \"Borough Council\". In fact, because of many successive changes to the structure of local government, there are now few large towns which are represented by a body closely related to their historic borough council. These days, a smaller town will usually be part of a local authority which covers several towns. And where a larger town '''is''' the seat of a local authority, the authority will usually cover a much wider area than the town itself (either a large rural hinterland, or several other, smaller towns).\n\nAdditionally, there are \"[[new town]]s\" which were created during the 20th century, such as [[Basildon]], [[Redditch]] and [[Telford]]. [[Milton Keynes]] was designed to be a \"new city\" but legally it is still a town despite its size.\n\nSome settlements which describe themselves as towns (e.g. [[Shipston-on-Stour]], [[Warwickshire]]) are smaller than some large villages (e.g. [[Kidlington]], [[Oxfordshire]]).\n\nThe status of a ''city'' is reserved for places that have [[letters patent]] entitling them to the name, historically associated with the possession of a cathedral. Some large municipalities (such as [[Northampton]] and [[Bournemouth]]) are legally [[borough]]s but not cities, whereas some cities are quite small \u2014 such as [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] or [[St David's]]. The city of [[Brighton and Hove]] was created from the two former towns and some surrounding villages, and within the city the correct term for the former distinct entities is somewhat unclear.\n\n[[File:Windhill.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford]]]]\n\nIt appears that a city may become a town, though perhaps only through administrative error: [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in Kent had been a city for centuries but, when in 1998 the [[Medway]] district was created, a bureaucratic blunder meant that Rochester lost its official [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] and is now technically a town.\n\nIt is often thought that towns with [[cathedral|bishops' seats]] rank automatically as cities: however, [[Chelmsford]] was a town until 5 June 2012 despite being the seat of the [[diocese of Chelmsford]], created in 1914. [[St Asaph]], which is the seat of the [[diocese of St Asaph]], only became a city on 1 June 2012 though the diocese was founded in the mid sixth century. In reality, the pre-qualification of having a cathedral of the established [[Church of England]], and the formerly established [[Church in Wales]] or [[Church of Ireland]], ceased to apply from 1888.\n\nThe word ''town'' can also be used as a general term for urban areas, including cities and in a few cases, districts within cities. In this usage, a city is a type of town; a large one, with a certain status. For example, central [[Greater London]] is sometimes referred to colloquially as \"London town\". (The \"[[City of London]]\" is the historical nucleus, informally known as the \"Square Mile\", and is administratively separate from the rest of Greater London, while the [[City of Westminster]] is also technically a city and is also a [[London borough]].) [[Camden Town]] and [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] are districts of London, as [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] is a district of [[Edinburgh]] \u2013 actually the Georgian centre.\n\nIn recent years the division between cities and towns has grown, leading to the establishment of groups like the Centre for Towns, who work to highlight the issues facing many towns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.centrefortowns.org/about-us|title=About Us|last=Design|first=Concom Website|website=Centre For Towns|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> Towns also became a significant issue in the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election]], with [[Lisa Nandy]] making significant reference to Labour needing to win back smaller towns which have swung away from the party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/house/house-magazine/107129/lisa-nandy-mp-britains-towns-are-short-changed-cities|title=Lisa Nandy MP: Britain\u2019s towns are short-changed as cities capture an ever-greater share of foreign investment|last=PoliticsHome.com|date=2019-10-08|website=PoliticsHome.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Scotland ====\n{{Main|List of burghs in Scotland|List of towns and cities in Scotland by population}}\n\nA ''town'' in [[Scotland]] has no specific legal meaning and (especially in areas which were or are still [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking) can refer to a mere collection of buildings (e.g. a ''farm-town'' or in [[Scots language|Scots]] ''ferm-toun''), not all of which might be inhabited, or to an inhabited area of any size which is not otherwise described in terms such as [[city]], [[burgh]], etc. Many locations of greatly different size will be encountered with a name ending with ''-town'', ''-ton'', ''-toun'' etc. (or beginning with the Gaelic equivalent ''baile'' etc.).\n\nA [[burgh]] (pronounced ''burruh'') is the [[Scots language|Scots']] term for a town or a municipality. They were highly [[Autonomous area|autonomous]] units of [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] from at least the 12th century until their abolition in 1975, when a new [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|regional structure of local government]] was introduced across the country. Usually based upon a town, they had a [[municipal corporation]] and certain rights, such as a degree of [[self-governance]] and representation in the sovereign [[Parliament of Scotland]] adjourned in 1707.\n\nThe term no longer describes units of local government although various claims are made from time to time that the legislation used was not competent to change the status of the Royal Burghs described below. The status is now chiefly ceremonial but various functions have been inherited by current Councils (e.g. the application of various endowments providing for public benefit) which might only apply within the area previously served by a burgh; in consequence a burgh can still exist (if only as a defined geographical area) and might still be signed as such by the current local authority. The word 'burgh' is generally not used as a synonym for 'town' or 'city' in everyday speech, but is reserved mostly for government and administrative purposes.\n\nHistorically, the most important burghs were [[royal burgh]]s, followed by [[burgh of regality|burghs of regality]] and [[burgh of barony|burghs of barony]]. Some newer settlements were only designated as [[police burgh]]s from the 19th century onward, a classification which also applies to most of the older burghs.\n\n=== United States ===\n[[File:Wyatt-indiana-from-above.jpg|thumb|The tiny farming community of [[Wyatt, Indiana]]]]\n\nThe definition of \"town\" varies widely from state to state and in many states there is no official definition. In some states, the term \"town\" refers to an area of population distinct from others in some meaningful dimension, typically population or type of government. The characteristic that distinguishes a town from another type of populated place &mdash; a city, borough, village, or [[Civil township|township]], for example &mdash; differs from state to state. In some states, a town is an incorporated [[municipality]]; that is, one with a [[charter]] received from the state, similar to a city (see [[incorporated town]]), while in others, a town is unincorporated. In some instances, the term \"town\" refers to a small incorporated municipality of less than a population threshold specified by state statute, while in others a town can be significantly larger. Some states do not use the term \"town\" at all, while in others the term has no official meaning and is used informally to refer to a populated place, of any size, whether incorporated or unincorporated. In still other states, the words \"town\" and \"city\" are legally interchangeable.\n\nSmall town life has been a major theme in American literature, especially stories of rejection by young people leaving for the metropolis.<ref>Miles Orvell, ''The Death and Life of Main Street: Small Towns in American Memory, Space, and Community'' (University of North Carolina Press; 2012)</ref>\n\nSince the use of the term varies considerably by state, individual usages are presented in the following sections:\n\n====Alabama====\nIn [[Alabama]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population.  A municipality with a population of 2,000 or more is a city, while less than 2,000 is a town (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104014/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-6.htm Section 11-40-6]).  For legislative purposes, municipalities are divided into eight classes based on population.  Class 8 includes all towns, plus cities with populations of less than 6,000 (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104906/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-12.htm Section 11-40-12]).\n\n====Arizona====\n\nIn [[Arizona]], the terms \"town\" and \"city\" are largely interchangeable. A community may incorporate under either a town or a city organization with no regard to population or other restrictions according to Arizona law (see Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 9). Cities may function under slightly differing governmental systems, such as the option to organize a district system for city governments, but largely retain the same powers as towns. Arizona law also allows for the consolidation of neighboring towns and the unification of a city and a town, but makes no provision for the joining of two adjacent cities.\n\n====California====\nIn [[California]], the words \"town\" and \"city\" are synonymous by law (see Cal. Govt. Code Secs. 34500\u201334504). There are two types of cities in California: charter and general law. Cities organized as charter cities derive their authority from a [[municipal charter|charter]] that they draft and file with the state, and which, among other things, states the municipality's name as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\" Government Code Sections 34500\u201334504 applies to cities organized as [[general-law municipality|general law cities]], which differ from charter cities in that they do not have charters but instead operate with the powers conferred them by the pertinent sections of the Government Code. Like charter cities, general law cities may incorporate as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\"\n\nSome cities change their minds as to how they want to be called. The sign in front of the municipal offices in [[Los Gatos, California]], for example, reads \"City of Los Gatos\", but the words engraved on the building above the front entrance when the city hall was built read \"Town of Los Gatos.\" There are also signs at the municipal corporation limit, some of which welcome visitors to the \"City of Los Gatos\" while older, adjacent signs welcome people to the \"Town of Los Gatos.\" Meanwhile, the village does not exist in California as a municipal corporation. Instead, the word \"town\" is commonly used to indicate any unincorporated community that might otherwise be known as an unincorporated village. Additionally, some people may still use the word \"town\" as shorthand for \"township\", which is not an incorporated municipality but an administrative division of a county.\n\n====Hawaii====\n\nThe [[Hawaii]]an Island of [[Oahu]] has various communities that may be referred to as towns. However, the entire island is lumped as a single incorporated city, the City and County of [[Honolulu]]. The towns on Oahu are merely unincorporated [[census-designated place]]s.\n\n====Illinois====\nIn [[Illinois]], the word \"town\" has been used both to denote a subdivision of a county called a township,<ref>See the Township Code, 60 ILCS 1 et seq.</ref> and to denote a form of municipality similar to a [[village]], in that it is generally governed by a president and trustees rather than a mayor.<ref>See ''Phillips v. Town of Scales Mound'', 195 Ill. 353, 357, 63 N.E. 180 (1902)</ref> In some areas a \"Town\" may be incorporated legally as a Village (meaning it has at large Trustees) or a City (meaning it has aldermen from districts) and absorb the duties of the Township it is coterminous with (maintenance of birth records, certain welfare items). [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]] and [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] are examples of Towns in this manner. Under the current Illinois Municipal Code, an incorporated or unincorporated town may choose to incorporate as a city or as a village, but other forms of incorporation are no longer allowed.<ref>''See generally'' Article 2 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/2\u20111\u20111 et seq.</ref>\n\n====Louisiana====\nIn [[Louisiana]] a \"town\" is defined as being a municipal government having a population of 1,001 to 4,999 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/gc021x2.pdf |title=Individual State Descriptions: 2002 |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref>\n\n====Maryland====\n\nWhile a \"town\" is generally considered a smaller entity than a \"city\", the two terms are legally interchangeable in Maryland.  The only exception may be the [[independent city]] of [[Baltimore]], which is a special case, as it was created by the [[Constitution of Maryland]].\n\n====Nevada====\n\nIn [[Nevada]], a town has a form of government, but is not considered to be incorporated. It generally provides a limited range of services, such as [[land use planning]] and recreation, while leaving most services to the county. Many communities have found this \"semi-incorporated\" status attractive; the state has only 20 incorporated [[List of cities in Nevada|cities]], and towns as large as [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] (186,020 in 2000 Census), home of the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Most [[county seat]]s are also towns, not cities.\n\n====New England====\n{{Main|New England town}}\n\nIn the six [[New England]] states, a [[New England town|town]] is a municipality and a more important unit than the [[county]]. In [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]] and 7 out of 14 counties in [[Massachusetts]], in fact, counties only exist as map divisions and have no legal functions; in the other three states, counties are primarily judicial districts, with other functions primarily in [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. In all six, towns perform functions that in most states would be county functions. The defining feature of a New England town, as opposed to a city, is that a [[town meeting]] and a [[board of selectmen]] serve as the main form of government for a town, while cities are run by a mayor and a city council. For example, [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] is a town, even though it is fairly urban, because of its form of government.\n\n====New Jersey====\n{{Main|Town (New Jersey)}}\n\nA \"town\" in the context of New Jersey local government refers to one of five types and one of eleven forms of municipal government. While Town is often used as a shorthand to refer to a Township, the two are not the same. The Town Act of 1895 allowed any municipality or area with a population exceeding 5,000 to become a Town through a petition and referendum process. Under the 1895 Act, a newly incorporated town was divided into at least three wards, with two councilmen per ward serving staggered two-year terms, and one councilman at large, who also served a two-year term. The councilman at large served as chairman of the town council. The Town Act of 1988 completely revised the Town form of government and applied to all towns incorporated under the Town Act of 1895 and to those incorporated by a special charter granted by the Legislature prior to 1875.\n\nUnder the 1988 Act, the mayor is also the councilman at large, serving a term of two years, unless increased to three years by a petition and referendum process. The Council under the Town Act of 1988 consists of eight members serving staggered two-year terms with two elected from each of four wards. One councilman from each ward is up for election each year. Towns with different structures predating the 1988 Act may retain those features unless changed by a petition and referendum process. Two new provisions were added in 1991 to the statutes governing towns, First, a petition and referendum process was created whereby the voters can require that the mayor and town council be elected to four-year terms of office. The second new provision defines the election procedure in towns with wards. The mayor in a town chairs the town council and heads the municipal government. The mayor may both vote on legislation before council and veto ordinances. A veto may be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of the council. The council may enact an ordinance to delegate all or a portion of the executive responsibilities of the town to a municipal administrator. Fifteen New Jersey municipalities currently have a type of Town, nine of which operate under the town form of government.\n\n====New York====\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of New York#Town}}\nIn [[Administrative divisions of New York|New York]], a town is similarly a division of the county, but with less importance than in New England. Of some importance, a town provides a closer level of governance than its enclosing county, providing almost all municipal services to unincorporated communities, called [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]], and selected services to incorporated areas, called [[Village (New York)|villages]]. In New York, a town typically contains a number of such hamlets and villages. However, due to their independent nature, incorporated villages may exist in two towns or even two counties (example: [[Almond (village), New York]]). Everyone in New York who does not live on an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] reservation or a city lives in a town and possibly in one of the town's hamlets or villages. (There are no towns in the five counties \u2013 also known as [[Boroughs (New York City)|boroughs]] \u2013 that make up [[New York City]].)\n\n====North Carolina====\nIn [[North Carolina]], all cities, towns, and villages are incorporated as [[List of municipalities in North Carolina|municipalities]]. According to the North Carolina League of Municipalities,<ref>{{cite web|website = North Carolina League of Municipalities|title = How NC Cities Work|url = https://www.nclm.org/advocacy/how-nc-cities-work |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516211303/http://www.nclm.org/resource-center/Pages/How-Municipalities-Work.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-16 }}</ref> there is no legal distinction among a city, town, or village\u2014it is a matter of preference of the local government.  Some North Carolina cities have populations as small as 1,000 residents, while some towns, such as [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], have populations of greater than 100,000.\n\n====Oklahoma====\nAccording to the definitions in the Oklahoma Municipal Code, \"City\" means a municipality which has incorporated as a city in accordance with the laws of the state; \"Town\" means a municipality which has incorporated as a town in accordance with the laws of the state; and, a \"Municipality\" means any incorporated city or town.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw1\u201d>{{cite web|url= https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=75748 |title= 11 O.S. 1-102 (Oklahoma Statutes, Title 11, Cities and Towns; Chapter 1, Oklahoma Municipal Code; Section 1-102, Definitions)|publisher=Oklahoma State Courts Network|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>  The term \u201cVillage\u201d is not defined or used in the act.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw1\u201d />  Any community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a Town; however, if the resident population is one thousand or more, a Town or community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a City.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw2\u201d>{{cite web|url= https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=75750|title= 11 O.S. 2-101 (Oklahoma Statutes, Title 11, Cities and Towns; Chapter 1, Oklahoma Municipal Code; Section 2-101, Incorporation of a Municipality)|publisher=Oklahoma State Courts Network|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nIn [[Pennsylvania]], only one municipality is incorporated as a \"town\": [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]]. Most of the rest of the state is incorporated as townships (there are also boroughs and cities), which function in much the same way as the towns of New York or New England, although they may have different forms of government.\n\n====Texas====\nIn [[Texas]], although some municipalities refer to themselves as \"towns\" or \"villages\" (to market themselves as an attractive place to live), these names have no specific designation in Texas law; legally all incorporated places are considered [[List of municipalities in Texas|cities]].\n\n====Utah====\n{{see also|List of cities and towns in Utah}}\nIn [[Utah]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population. A municipality with a population of 1,000 or more is a city, while less than 1,000 is a town. In addition, cities are divided into five separate classes based on population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|title=Utah Code, Title 10, Chapter 2, Section 301|publisher=Utah State Legislature|accessdate=May 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808233054/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|archivedate=August 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Virginia====\n{{main|Administrative divisions of Virginia#Towns}}\nIn [[Virginia]], a town is an incorporated municipality similar to a city (though with a smaller required minimum population).  But while cities are by Virginia law independent of counties, towns are contained within counties.<ref>{{cite web  |author=[http://cfs.gmu.edu/bio/grymes_c.html Charles A. Grymes]  |url=http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |title=County vs. Town vs. City in Virginia  |accessdate=2011-05-31  |quote=Cities own and maintain their roads, while Virginia counties (except for Arlington and Henrico) rely upon [[Virginia Department of Transportation|VDOT]] for road maintenance. Cities get a fixed allocation of state funding for building and maintaining those roads, while counties must compete with each other and other VDOT priorities for a substantial portion of their road budget. Cities have been granted more authorities, such as the right of city councils to issue bonds to build roads without a voter referendum (counties must get voter approval in a referendum before issuing road bonds)... In Virginia, towns have distinct boundaries, established by the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] or by courts guided by laws passed by the legislature. Towns are *not* independent from counties; residents of towns are still residents of the county in which the town is located. For example, residents of the four towns of [[Haymarket, Virginia|Haymarket]], [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]], [[Dumfries, Virginia|Dumfries]], and [[Occoquan, Virginia|Occoquan]] are also residents of [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]. They pay both town and county property taxes, and town residents get to vote for a town council/mayor.  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620092601/http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |archivedate=2010-06-20  }}</ref>\n\n====Washington====\n{{Further|City government in Washington (state)}}\nA town in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] is a municipality that has a population of less than 1,500 at incorporation, however an existing town can reorganize as a code city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/governance/locgov31.aspx |title=Classification of Washington Cities |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> Town government authority is limited relative to [[city (Washington)|cities]], the other main classification of municipalities in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |title=A Comparison of the Powers of a Town and a Noncharter Code City |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725204227/http://www.mrsc.org/Subjects/Management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> {{As of|2012}}, most municipalities in Washington are cities.

Towns are generally larger than [[village]]s but smaller than [[city|cities]], though the criteria to distinguish them vary considerably between different parts of the world.\n\n== Origin and use ==\nThe word \"town\" shares an origin with the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|Zaun}}, the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word {{lang|nl|tuin}}, and the [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|tun}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/town|title=Town|publisher=Dictionary.com}}</ref> The original [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] word, *''tunan'', is thought to be an early borrowing from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] *''dunon'' (cf. [[Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|dun}}, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|din}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/town|title=Town|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nThe original sense of the word in both Germanic and Celtic was that of a fortress or an enclosure. Cognates of \"town\" in many modern Germanic languages designate a fence or a hedge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/town|title=Town|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> In English and Dutch, the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed, and through which a track must run.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In England, a town was a small community that could not afford or was not allowed to build walls or other larger fortifications, and built a [[palisade]] or stockade instead.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In the Netherlands, this space was a garden, more specifically those of the wealthy, which had a high fence or a wall around them (like the garden of the palace of [[Het Loo Palace|Het Loo]] in [[Apeldoorn]], which was the model for the privy garden of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] at [[Hampton Court]]). In Old Norse {{lang|non|tun}} means a (grassy) place between farmhouses, and the word is still used with a similar meaning in modern Norwegian.\n\nOld English ''tun'' became a common place-name suffix in England and southeastern Scotland during the Anglo-Saxon settlement period. In [[Old English]] and Early and Middle [[Scots language|Scots]], the words ''ton'', ''toun'', etc. could refer to diverse kinds of settlements from agricultural estates and holdings, partly picking up the Norse sense (as in the Scots word {{lang|sco|[[fermtoun]]}}) at one end of the scale, to fortified municipalities.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Other common Anglo-Saxon suffixes included ''ham'' (\"home\"), ''stede'' (\"stead\"), and ''burh'' (\"bury,\" \"borough,\" \"burgh\").\n\nIn some cases, \"town\" is an alternative name for \"city\" or \"village\" (especially a larger village). Sometimes, the word \"town\" is short for \"township\". In general, today towns can be differentiated from [[township]]s, [[village]]s, or [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s on the basis of their economic character, in that most of a town's population will tend to derive their living from manufacturing [[industry]], [[commerce]], and [[public service]]s rather than [[primary industry]] such as [[agriculture]] or related activities.\n\nA place's population size is not a reliable determinant of urban character. In many areas of the world, e.g. in [[India]] at least until recent times, a large village might contain several times as many people as a small town. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are historical cities [[List of urban areas in England by population|that are far smaller]] than the larger towns.\n\nThe modern phenomenon of extensive [[suburb]]an growth, satellite urban development, and migration of city dwellers to villages has further complicated the definition of towns, creating communities urban in their economic and cultural characteristics but lacking other characteristics of urban localities.\n\nSome forms of non-rural settlement, such as temporary [[mining]] locations, may be clearly non-rural, but have at best a questionable claim to be called a town.\n\nTowns often exist as distinct governmental units, with legally defined borders and some or all of the appurtenances of local government (e.g. a [[police]] force). In the United States these are referred to as \"incorporated towns\". In other cases the town lacks its own governance and is said to be \"unincorporated\". Note that the existence of an unincorporated town may be legally set out by other means, e.g. zoning districts. In the case of some [[planned community|planned communities]], the town exists legally in the form of covenants on the properties within the town. The [[United States Census]] identifies many [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs) by the names of unincorporated towns which lie within them; however, those CDPs typically include rural and suburban areas and even surrounding villages and other towns.\n\nThe distinction between a town and a city similarly depends on the approach: a city may strictly be an administrative entity which has been granted that designation by law, but in informal usage, the term is also used to denote an urban locality of a particular size or importance: whereas a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] city may have possessed as few as 10,000 inhabitants, today some{{who|date=November 2014}} consider an urban place of fewer than 100,000 as a town, even though there are many officially designated cities that are much smaller than that.\n\n== Age of towns scheme ==\n[[Australian]] geographer [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] proposed a classification of towns based on their age and pattern of [[land use]]. He identified five types of town:<ref>Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.</ref>\n\n* ''Infantile towns'', with no clear [[zoning]]\n* ''Juvenile towns'', which have developed an area of [[Retailing|shop]]s\n* ''Adolescent towns'', where [[factory|factories]] have started to appear\n* ''Early mature towns'', with a separate area of [[social class|high-class]] [[house|housing]]\n* ''Mature towns'', with defined [[industry|industrial]], [[commerce|commercial]] and various types of [[residential area]]\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn [[Afghanistan]], towns and cities are known as ''sh\u0101r'' ([[Dari language|Dari]]: \u0634\u0647\u0631, [[Pashto]]: \u069a\u0627\u0631).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:687.raverty|title=A dictionary of the Puk'hto, Pus'hto, or language of the Afghans|website=dsalsrv0 2.uchicago.edu|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> As the country is an historically rural society with few larger settlements, with major cities never holding more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants before the 2000s, the lingual tradition of the country does not discriminate between towns and cities.\n\n=== Albania ===\nIn [[Albania]] \"qytez\u00eb\" means town, which is very similar with the word for city (''\"qytet\"'').

The country is partitioned into 2098 municipalities ({{lang-de|Gemeinden}}) of fundamentally equal rank. Larger municipalities are designated as market towns ({{lang-de|Marktgemeinden}}) or cities (''St\u00e4dte''), but these distinctions are purely symbolic and do not confer additional legal responsibilities. There is a number of smaller communities that are labelled cities because they used to be regional population centers in the distant past. The city of [[Rattenberg]] for example has about 400 inhabitants. The city of [[Hardegg]] has about 1200 inhabitants, although the historic city core \u2212 Hardegg proper without what used to be the surrounding hamlets \u2212 is home to just 80 souls.\n\nThere are no unincorporated areas.\n\nOf the 201 cities in Austria, 15 are [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] (''Statutarst\u00e4dte''). A statutory city is a city that is vested, in addition to its purview as a municipality, with the duties of a [[district (Austria)|district administrative authority]]. The status does not come with any additional autonomy: district administrative authorities are essentially just service centers that citizens use to interact with the national government, for example to apply for driver licenses or passports. The national government generally uses the provinces to run these points of contact on its behalf; in the case of statutory cities, the municipality gets to step up.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Bulgaria}}\n\nBulgarians do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. However, in everyday language and media the terms \"large towns\" and \"small towns\" are in use. \"Large towns\" usually refers to [[Sofia]], [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]], which have population over 200,000. [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] and [[Stara Zagora]] are often included as well due to presence of relatively developed infrastructure and population over 100,000 threshold. It is difficult to call the remaining [[Provinces of Bulgaria|provincial capitals]] \"large towns\" as, in general, they are less developed and have shrinking population, some with as few as 30,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]] the [[Council of Ministers of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] defines what constitutes a settlement, while the [[President of Bulgaria]] grants each settlement its title. In 2005 the requirement that villages that wish to classify themselves as town must have a social and technical infrastructure, as well as a population of no fewer than 3500 people. For resort settlements the requirements are lower with the population needing to be no fewer than 1000 people but infrastructure requirements remain.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Main|List of towns in Canada|Municipal government in Canada}}\nThe legal definition of a town in [[Canada]] varies by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]], as each has jurisdiction over defining and legislating towns, cities and other types of municipal organization within its own boundaries.\n\nThe province of [[Quebec]] is unique in that it makes no distinction under law between towns and cities. There is no intermediate level in French between ''village'' and ''ville'' (''municipality'' is an administrative term usually applied to a legal, not geographical entity), so both are combined under the single legal status of ''[[ville]]''. While an informal preference may exist among English speakers as to whether any individual ''ville'' is commonly referred to as a city or as a town, no distinction and no objective legal criteria exist to make such a distinction under law.\n\n=== Chile ===\nIn [[Chile]], towns (Spanish: ''pueblos'') are defined by the National Statistics Institute (INE) as an urban entity with a population from 2001 to 5000 or an area with a population from 1001 to 2000 and an established economic activity.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn the Czech Republic, the word ''m\u011bsto'' (city) is used for very wide variety of municipalities, ranging from [[Prague]], the largest and capital city with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants, to the smallest, [[P\u0159ebuz]], with just 74 inhabitants.  Technically, a municipality must have at least 3,000 inhabitants to be granted the ''m\u011bsto'' title, although many smaller municipalities,  especially some former mining towns, retain the title ''m\u011bsto'' for historic reasons.  Currently, approximately 192 of the 592 ''m\u011bsta'' have less than 3,000 inhabitants.\n\nSome municipalities have been amalgamated together, such that the whole is considered as a ''m\u011bsto''.\n\n[[Statutory city (Czech Republic)|Statutory cities]] (''statut\u00e1rn\u00ed m\u011bsto''), which are defined by law no. 128/2000 Coll.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128 |title=Consolidated version of Law no. 128/200 Coll |publisher=Zakonyprolidi.cz |date=2000-05-15 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref> can define their own self-governing municipal districts.. There are 25 such cities, in addition to [[Prague]], which is a ''de facto'' statutory city.\n\nIn 2006, the legal concept of a town (''[[m\u011bstys]]'', or formerly ''m\u011bste\u010dko'') was reintroduced. Currently, around 213 municipalities hold the title ''m\u011bstys''.\n\nMunicipalities which do not qualify as a ''m\u011bsto'' or a ''m\u011bstys'' default to the title of ''obec'' (a municipality) or, unofficially, a ''vesnice'' (village), even though they may consist of one or more villages.\n\n=== Denmark ===\nIn [[Denmark]], in many contexts no distinction is made between \"city\", \"town\" and \"village\"; all three translate as \"by\". In more specific use, for small villages and [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] the word \"landsby\" (meaning \"country town\") is used, while the Danish equivalent of English \"city\" is \"storby\" (meaning \"large town\"). For formal purposes, [[urban area]]s having at least 200 inhabitants are counted as \"by\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/Vejviser/dokumentation/Varedeklarationer/emnegruppe/emne.aspx?sysrid=000766 |title=Byopg\u00f8relsen pr. 1. januar \u2013 Varedeklaration \u2013 Danmarks Statistik |publisher=Dst.dk |date=2005-03-22 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>\n\nHistorically some towns held various privileges, the most important of which was the right to hold market. They were administered separately from the rural areas in both fiscal, military and legal matters. Such towns are known as \"k\u00f8bstad\" (roughly the same meaning as \"borough\" albeit deriving from a different etymology) and they retain the exclusive right to the title even after the last vestiges of their privileges vanished through the reform of the local administration carried through in 1970.\n\n===Estonia===\nIn [[Estonia]], there is no distinction between a town and a city as the word ''linn'' is used for both bigger and smaller settlements, which are bigger than villages and boroughs. There are 30 [[Municipalities of Estonia|municipal towns]] (''omavalitsuslik linn'') in Estonia and a [[List of cities and towns in Estonia|further 17 towns]], which have merged with a municipal parish (''vallasisene linn'').\n\n[[File:Salins les Bains 2.JPG|thumb|The town of [[Salins-les-Bains]], [[France]]]]\n\n=== France ===\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the smallest level of local authorities are all called [[Communes of France|\"communes\"]]. Those can have anywhere from a handful to millions of inhabitants, and France has 36000 of them. The French term for \"town\" is \"[[:fr:Bourg|bourg]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/bourg |title=BOURG : D\u00e9finition de BOURG |date=n.d. |website=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales' |access-date=March 22, 2020 |language=french |trans-title=BOURG: Definition of BOURG }}</ref> but French laws does not really distinguish between towns and cities which are all commonly called \"villes\". However, some laws do treat these authorities differently based on the population and different rules apply to the three big cities [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]]. For historical reasons, [[List of French villages destroyed in World War I|six communes]] in the [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] d\u00e9partement exist as independent administrative entities despite having no inhabitant at all.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the national statistical institute ([[INSEE]]) operates a distinction between urban areas with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and bigger communes, the latter being called \"villes\". Smaller settlements are usually called \"villages\".\n\n[[File:Putbus (2011-05-21) 14.JPG|thumb|[[Putbus]] on [[R\u00fcgen|R\u00fcgen Island]], Germany]]\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Germany}}\n\n[[Germany|Germans]] do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. The German word for both is ''Stadt'', as it is the case in many other languages that do not differentiate between these Anglo-Saxon concepts. The word for a 'village', as a smaller settlement, is ''Dorf''. However, the International Statistics Conference of 1887 defined different sizes of ''Stadt'', based on their population size, as follows: ''Landstadt'' (\"country town\"; under 5,000), ''Kleinstadt'' (\"small town\"; 5,000 to 20,000), ''Mittelstadt'' (\"middle town\"; between 20,000 and 100,000) and ''Gro\u00dfstadt'' (\"large town\"; over 100,000).<ref>Universit\u00e4t Dortmund: [http://www.raumplanung.uni-dortmund.de/srp/web/dokumente/downloads/64_SRPapers%20Nr.1.pdf Kleine und mittlere St\u00e4dte \u2013 Blaupausen der Gro\u00dfstadt?], Dokumentation des Expertenkolloquiums am 29. April 2004 in Dortmund</ref> The term ''Gro\u00dfstadt'' may be translated as \"city\". In addition, Germans may speak of a ''Millionenstadt'', a city with over one million inhabitants (such as [[Munich]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]]).\n\nHistorically, many settlements became a ''Stadt'' by being awarded a [[Town privileges|''Stadtrecht'']] in medieval times. In modern German language use, the historical importance, the existence of central functions (education, retail etc.) and the population density of an urban place might also be taken as characteristics of a ''Stadt''. The modern local government organisation is subject to the laws of each [[States of Germany|state]] and refers to a ''Gemeinde'' ([[States of Germany#Municipalities (Gemeinden)|municipality]]), regardless of its historic title. While most ''Gemeinden'' form part of a ''Landkreis'' ([[States of Germany#Administrative districts (Kreise)|district]]) on a higher tier of local government, larger towns and cities may have the status of a ''kreisfreie Stadt'', combining both the powers of a municipality and a district.\n\nDesignations in different states are as diverse as e.g. in Australian States and Territories, and differ from state to state. In some German states, the words ''Markt'' (\"market\"), ''Marktflecken'' (both used in southern Germany) or ''Flecken'' (\"spot\"; northern Germany e.g. in [[Lower Saxony]]) designate a town-like residential community between ''Gemeinde'' and ''Stadt'' with special importance to its outer conurbation area. Historically those had ''Marktrecht'' (market right) but not full town privileges; see [[Market town]]. The legal denomination of a specific settlement may differ from its common designation (e.g. ''Samtgemeinde'' \u2013 a legal term in [[Lower Saxony]] for a group of villages [''Dorf'', pl. ''D\u00f6rfer''] with common local government created by combining municipalities [''Gemeinde'', pl. ''Gemeinden'']).\n\n=== Greece and Cyprus ===\nIn ordinary speech, [[Greeks]] use the word \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc (=village) to refer to smaller settlements and the word \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 or \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (=city) to refer to larger ones. Careful speakers may also use the word \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 to refer to towns with a population of 2,000\u20139,999. \nIn Greek administrative law there used to be a distinction between \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, i.e. municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants or considered important for some other geographical (county seats), historical or ecclesiastical (bishops' seats) reason, and \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, referring to smaller self-governing units, mostly villages. A sweeping reform, carried out in two stages early in the 21st century, merged most \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 with the nearest \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, dividing the whole country into 325 big self-governing \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9. The former municipalities survive as administrative subdivisions (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2).\n\nCyprus, including the Turkish-occupied areas, is also divided into 39 \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 (in principle, with at least 5,000 inhabitants, though there are exceptions) and 576 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Hong Kong#Towns|l1=List of cities and towns in Hong Kong}}\n[[File:ShatinTownHall 20070529.jpg|thumb|Nearly every town in Hong Kong has its own town hall. The picture shows the [[Sha Tin Town Hall]] in the town of [[Sha Tin]].]]\n\n[[Hong Kong]] started developing new towns in the 1950s, to accommodate exponential population increase. The very first new towns included [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]] and [[Kwun Tong]]. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, another stage of new town developments was launched. Nine new towns have been developed so far. Land use is carefully planned and development provides plenty of room for public housing projects. Rail transport is usually available at a later stage. The first towns are [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]], [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]], [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] and [[Tseung Kwan O]]. [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] was intended to be self-reliant, but was not successful and turned into a [[bedroom community]] like the other new towns. More recent developments are [[Tin Shui Wai New Town|Tin Shui Wai]] and [[North Lantau New Town|North Lantau (Tung Chung-Tai Ho)]].\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn [[Hungary]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in Hungarian is: v\u00e1ros). Nevertheless, the expressions formed by adding the adjectives \"kis\" (small) and \"nagy\" (large) to the beginning of the root word (e.g. \"nagyv\u00e1ros\") have been normalized to differentiate between cities and towns (towns being smaller, therefore bearing the name \"kisv\u00e1ros\".) In Hungary, a village can gain the status of \"v\u00e1ros\" (town), if it meets a set of diverse conditions for quality of life and development of certain public services and utilities (e.g. having a local secondary school or installing full-area sewage collection pipe network). Every year the Minister of Internal Affairs selects candidates from a committee-screened list of applicants, whom the President of Republic usually affirms by issuing a bill of town's rank to them. Since being a town carries extra fiscal support from the government, many relatively small villages try to win the status of \"v\u00e1rosi rang\" nowadays.\n\nBefore the [[fall of communism]] in 1990, Hungarian villages with fewer than 10,000 residents were not allowed to become towns. Recently some settlements as small as 2,500 souls have received the rank of town (e.g. Visegr\u00e1d, Zalakaros or G\u00f6nc) and meeting the conditions of development is often disregarded to quickly elevate larger villages into towns. As of middle 2013, there are 346 towns in Hungary, encompassing some 69% of the entire population.\n\nTowns of more than 50,000 people are able to gain the status of \"megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1ros\" (town with the rights of a [[county]]), which allows them to maintain a higher degree of [[Public service|services]]. (There are a few exceptions, when towns of fewer than 50,000 people gained the status: [[\u00c9rd]], [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]], [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] and [[Szeksz\u00e1rd]])<ref>[http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/regiok/veszpremmjv10.pdf Megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosok] \u2013 essay of [[Hungarian Central Statistical Office]] (Hungarian, July 2012)</ref> As of middle 2013, there are only 23 such towns in Hungary.<ref>[http://www.terport.hu/telepulesek/telepulestipusok/megyei-jogu-varosok/magyarorszag-megyei-jogu-varosai \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosai\"] \u2013 list of Hungarian town with the rights of a county on \"T\u00e9rport\" related webpage of Ministry of National Development (Hungarian, access date: May 4, 2013.)</ref>\n\n=== Iceland ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Iceland}}\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{Main|List of populated places in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nThe '''Local Government act 2001''' provides that from January 1, 2002 (section 10 subsection (3)\n''Within the county in which they are situated and of which they form part, there continue to be such other local government areas as are set out in Schedule 6 which \u2013 (a) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of that Schedule, shall be known as boroughs, and \u2013 (b) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 2 of Part 1 and Part 2 of that Schedule, shall be known as towns, and in this Act a reference to a town shall include a reference to a borough.''\n\nThese provisions affect the replacement of the boroughs, Towns and urban districts which existed before then. Similar reforms in the nomenclature of local authorities ( but not their functions) are effected by section 11 part 17 of the act includes provision (section 185(2))\n''Qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census or such other figure as the Minister may from time to time prescribe by regulations, and not having a [[town council]], may make a proposal in accordance with paragraph (b) for the establishment of such a council''\nand contains provisions enabling the establishment of new town councils and provisions enabling the dissolution of existing or new town councils in certain circumstances\n\nThe reference to ''town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census'' hands much of the power relating to defining what is in fact a town over to the Central Statistics Office and their criteria are published as part of each census.\n\n;Planning and Development Act 2000\nAnother reference to the Census and its role in determining what is or is not a town for some administrative purpose is in the Planning and Development act 2000 (part II chapter I which provides for Local area plans)\n\n''A local area plan shall be made in respect of an area which \u2014(i) is designated as a town in the most recent census of population, other than a town designated as a suburb or environs in that census, (ii) has a population in excess of 2,000, and (iii) is situated within the functional area of a planning authority which is a county council.''\n\n;Central Statistics Office criteria\nThese are set out in full at [http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census_2006_Appendices.pdf 2006 Census Appendices].\n\nIn short they speak of \"towns with legally defined boundaries\" ( i.e. those established by the Local Government Act 2001) and the remaining 664 as \"census towns\", defined by themselves since 1971 as ''a cluster of 50 or more occupied dwellings in which within a distance of 800 meters there is a nucleus of 30 occupied houses on both sides of the road or twenty occupied houses on one side of the road'' there is also a ''200 meter criterion'' for determining whether a house is part of a census town.\n\n=== India ===\n[[File:One of the high streets in Paravur.jpg|right|thumb|A street in [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]] town, India]]\nThe [[2011 Census of India]] defines towns of two types: statutory town and [[census town]]. Statutory town is defined as all places with a [[municipality]], [[Municipal corporation|corporation]], [[Cantonment Board|cantonment board]] or notified town area committee. Census towns are defined as places that satisfy the following criteria:\n# Minimum population of 5,000\n# At least 75% of male working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits\n# Density of population at least 400/km<sup>2</sup>. (1,000 per sq. mile).\n\nAll the statutory towns, census towns and [[out growth]]s are considered as urban settlements, as opposed to rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Some Concepts and Definitions|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/kerala/13-concept-34.pdf|publisher=Census of India|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Iran ===\nIn contemporary [[Persian language|Persian]] texts, no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as \"Shahr\" (\u0634\u0647\u0631). In older Persian texts (until the first half of the 20th century), the Arabic word \"Qasabeh\" (\u0642\u0635\u0628\u0647) was used for a town. However, in recent 50 years, this word has become obsolete.\n\nThere is a word in Persian which is used for special sort of satellite townships and city neighborhoods. It is ''Shahrak'' (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u06a9), (lit.: small city).\nAnother smaller type of town or [[neighborhood]] in a big city is called ''Kuy'' (\u06a9\u0648\u06cc). ''Shahrak'' and ''Kuy'' each have their different legal definitions.\nLarge cities such as [[Tehran]], [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Tabriz]], etc. which have millions of populations are referred to as ''Kalan-shahr''\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0634\u0647\u0631 ([[metropole]]).\n\nThe pace in which different large villages have gained city status in [[Iran]] shows a dramatic increase in the last two decades.\n\nBigger cities and towns usually are centers of a [[township]] (in Persian: ''Shahrestan'' (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646). Shahrestan itself is a subdivision of ''Ostan'' \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 (Province).\n\n===Isle of Man===\nThere are four settlements which are historically and officially designated as towns (Douglas, Ramsey, Peel, Castletown); however\n\n* Peel is also sometimes referred to as a city by virtue of its cathedral.\n* Onchan and Port Erin are both larger in population than the smallest \"town\", having expanded in modern times, but are designated as villages.\n\n=== Israel ===\n[[Modern Hebrew]] does provide a word for the concept of a town: ''Ayara'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4),  derived from ''Ir'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8), the biblical word for \"city\". However, the term ''ayara'' is normally used only to describe towns in foreign countries, i.e. urban areas of limited population, particularly when the speaker is attempting to evoke nostalgic or romantic attitudes. The term is also used to describe a [[Shtetl]], a pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[Eastern Europe]]an Jewish town.\n\nWithin Israel, established urban areas are always referred to as cities (with one notable exception explained below) regardless of their actual size. Israeli law does not define any nomenclature for distinction between urban areas based on size or any other factor \u2013 meaning that all urban settlements in Israel are legally referred to as \"cities\".\n\nThe exception to the above is the term ''Ayeret Pituakh'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05e4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05d7, lit. \"Development Town\") which is applied to certain cities in Israel based on the reasons for their establishment. These cities, created during the earlier decades of Israeli independence (1950s and 1960s, generally), were designed primarily to serve as commercial and transportation hubs, connecting smaller agricultural settlements in the northern and southern regions of the country (the \"Periphery\") to the major urban areas of the coastal and central regions. Some of these \"development towns\" have since grown to a comparatively large size, and yet are still referred to as \"development towns\", particularly when the speaker wishes to emphasize their (often low) socio-economic status. Nonetheless, they are rarely (if ever) referred to simply as \"towns\"; when referring to one directly, it will be called either a \"development town\" or a \"city\", depending on context.\n\n=== Italy ===\nAlthough Italian provides different words for city (''citt\u00e0''), town (''paese'') and village (''villaggio'', old-fashioned, or ''[[frazione]]'', most common), no legal definitions exist as to how settlements must be classified. Administratively, both towns and cities are ruled as [[comuni]]/[[comune]]s, while villages might be subdivisions of the former. \nGenerally, in everyday's speech, a town is larger or more populated than a village and smaller than a city. Various cities and towns together may form a metropolitan area (''area metropolitana''). A city, can also be a culturally, economically or politically prominent community with respect to surrounding towns. Moreover, a city can be such by [[President of Italy|Presidential]] decree. A town, in contrast, can be an inhabited place which would elsewhere be styled a city, but has not received any official recognition.\nRemarkable exceptions do exist: for instance, [[Bassano del Grappa]], was given the status of \"citt\u00e0\" in 1760 by [[Francesco Loredan]]'s [[Doge|dogal]] decree and has since then carried this title. Also, the Italian word for town (''paese'' with lowercase P) must not be confused with the Italian word for country/nation (''Paese'' usually with uppercase P).\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn Japan city status (''[[Cities of Japan|shi]]'') was traditionally reserved for only a few particularly large settlements. Over time however the necessary conditions to be a city have been watered down and today the only loose rules that apply are having a population over 50,000 and over 60% of the population in a \"city centre\". In recent times many small villages and towns have merged in order to form a city despite seeming geographically to be just a collection of villages.\n\nThe distinction between towns (''[[Towns of Japan|machi/ch\u014d]]'') and villages (''[[Villages of Japan|mura/son]]'') is largely unwritten and purely one of population size when the settlement was founded with villages having under 10,000 and towns 10,000\u201350,000.\n\n=== Korea ===\n{{main|Eup (administrative division)}}\nIn both of South Korea and North Korea, towns are called ''[[Eup (administrative division)|eup]]'' (''\uc74d'').\n\n=== Latvia ===\nIn [[Latvia]], towns and cities are indiscriminately called ''pils\u0113ta'' in singular form. The name is a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of two Latvian words: ''pils'' (castle) and ''s\u0113ta'' (fence), making it very obvious what is meant by the word \u2013 what is situated between the castle and the castle fence. However, a city can be called ''lielpils\u0113ta'' in reference to its size. A village is called ''ciemats'' or ''ciems'' in Latvian.\n\n=== Lithuania ===\n{{main|List of towns in Lithuania}}\nIn [[Lithuania]]n,  a city is called ''[[:lt:miestas|miestas]]'', a town is called ''[[:lt:miestelis|miestelis]]'' (literally \"small ''miestas''). [[Metropolis]] is called ''[[:lt:didmiestis|didmiestis]]'' (literally \"big ''miestas'').\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nIn [[Malaysia]], a town is the area administered by Municipal Council ({{lang-ms|1=Majlis Perbandaran}}).\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nBefore 1848 there was a legal distinction between ''stad'' and non-''stad'' parts of the country, but the word no longer has any legal significance. About 220 places were granted ''stadsrechten'' (city rights) and are still so called for historical and traditional reasons, though the word is also used for large urban areas that never obtained such rights. Because of this, in the [[Netherlands]], no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as ''stad''. A hamlet (''gehucht'') usually has fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, a village (''dorp'') ranges from 1,000 up to 25,000 inhabitants, and a place above 25,000 can call itself either village or city, mostly depending on historic reasons or size of the place. As an example, [[The Hague]] never gained city rights, but because of its size - more than half a million inhabitants - it is regarded as a city. [[Staverden]], with only 40 inhabitants, would be a hamlet, but because of its city rights it may call itself a city.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the Netherlands has three sorts of cities:\n* ''kleine stad'' (small city): 50,000 \u2014 99,999 inhabitants\n* ''middelgrote stad'' (medium-sized city): 100,000 \u2014 249,999 inhabitants\n* ''grote stad'' (large city): 250,000 or more\n\nOnly [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht]] are regarded as a ''grote stad''.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn [[New Zealand]], a town is a built-up area that is not large enough to be considered a city. Historically, this definition corresponded to a population of between approximately 1,000 and 20,000. Towns have no independent legal existence, being administered simply as built-up parts of districts, or, in some cases, of cities.\n\nNew Zealand's towns vary greatly in size and importance, ranging from small rural service centres to significant regional centres such as [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and [[Taupo]]. Typically, once a town reaches a population of somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 people, it will begin to be informally regarded as a city. One who regards a settlement as too small to be a town will typically call it a \"township\" or \"village.\"\n\n=== Norway ===\nIn [[Norway]], \"city\" and \"town\" both translate to \"[[By (city or town)|by]]\", even if a city may be referred to as \"storby\" (\"large town\"). They will all be part of and administered as a \"[[Municipalities of Norway|kommune]]\" (\"[[municipality]]\").\n\nNorway has had inland the northernmost city in the world: Hammerfest. Now the record is held by New \u00c5lesund on the Norwegian island Svalbard\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[File:Loboc Bohol 1.jpg|thumb|The town center of [[Loboc, Bohol]].]]\n{{Main|List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|Municipalities of the Philippines}}\nIn the [[Philippines]], the local official equivalent of the town is the [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] (Filipino ''bayan''). Every municipality, or town, in the country has a mayor (Filipino ''alkalde'') and a vice mayor (Filipino ''bise alkalde'') as well as local town officials ([[Sangguniang Bayan]]). Philippine towns, otherwise called as municipalities, are composed of a number of villages and communities called ''[[barangays]]'' with one (or a few cluster of) ''barangay''(s) serving as the town center or ''[[poblacion]]''.\n\nUnique in Philippine towns is that they have fixed budget, population and land requirements to become as such, i.e. from a ''barangay'', or a cluster of such, to a town, or to become cities, i.e. from town to a city. Respectively, examples of these are the town of [[Braulio E. Dujali, Davao del Norte|B.E. Dujali]] in [[Davao del Norte]] province, which was formed in 1998 from a cluster of 5 ''barangays'', and the city of [[El Salvador, Misamis Oriental|El Salvador]], which was converted from a town to a city in 2007. Each town in the Philippines was classified by its [[Municipalities of the Philippines#Income classification|annual income and budget]].\n\nA sharp, hierarchical distinction exists between Philippine [[Philippine city|cities]] (Filipino ''lungsod'' or ''siyudad'') and towns, as towns in the country are juridically separate from cities, which are typically larger and more populous (some smaller and less populated) and which political and economic status are above those of towns. This was further supported and indicated by the income classification system implemented by the National Department of Finance, to which both cities and towns fell into their respective categories that indicate they are such as stated under Philippine law. However, both towns and cities equally share the status as [[Administrative divisions of the Philippines#Local government units|local government units]] (LGU's) grouped under and belong to [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]]; both each are composed of ''barangays'' and are governed by a mayor and a vice mayor supplemented by their respective LGU legislative councils.\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Zamo\u015b\u0107. Ratusz..jpg|thumb|right|[[Zamo\u015b\u0107]] in [[Poland]] is an example of a [[utopia]]n [[ideal town]]. It was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1992]]\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Poland}}\n\nSimilarly to Germany and Sweden, in [[Poland]] there is no linguistic distinction between a city and a town. The word for both is ''miasto'', as a form of settlement distinct from following: village (wie\u015b), hamlet (przysi\u00f3\u0142ek), settlement (osada), or colony (kolonia). Town status is conferred by administrative decree, new towns are announced by the Government in a separate Bill effective from the first day of the year. Some settlements tend to remain villages even though they have a larger population than many smaller towns. Town may be called in diminutive way as \"miasteczko\", what is colloquially used for localities with a few thousand residents. Such localities have usually a '''Mayor''' (burmistrz) as a chief of town council.\n\nCities are the biggest localities, generally must be bigger than 100 thousand of residents, they are ruled by '''President''' (prezydent) as a chief of City Council. There are bare a few (mainly historic or political) exemptions which have allowed towns lesser than 100 thousand of people, to obtain President title for their Mayors, and to become recognized as Cities that way. Just to name a few: [[Boles\u0142awiec]], [[Gniezno]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]].\n\n=== Portugal ===\nLike other Iberian cultures, in [[Portugal]] there is a traditional distinction between towns (''[[:pt:Vila|vilas]]'') and cities (''[[:pt:Cidade|cidades]]''). Similarly, although these areas are not defined under the constitution, and have no political function (with associated organs), they are defined by law,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |title=Law n.\u00ba 11/82 (Lei das designa\u00e7\u00f5es e determina\u00e7\u00e3o de categoria das povoa\u00e7\u00f5es), of June, 2nd |accessdate=2010-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100608050009/http%3A//www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-08 }}</ref> and a town must have:\n* at least 3,000 inhabitants\n* at least half of these services: health unit, pharmacy, cultural centre, public transportation network, post office, commercial food and drinking establishments, primary school and/or bank office\nIn this context, the town or city is subordinate to the local authority ([[freguesia|civil parish]] or [[concelho|municipality]], in comparison to the North American context, where they have political functions. In special cases, some [[village]]s may be granted the status of town if they possess historical, cultural or architectonic importance.\n\nThe Portuguese urban settlements [[heraldry]] reflects the difference between towns and cities,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/pt-_m.html#rules |website=Flags of the World|title = Portuguese municipal flags |publisher= Crwflags.com |accessdate=}}</ref> with the [[coat of arms]] of a town bearing a crown with 4 towers, while the coat of arms of a city bears a crown with 5 towers. This difference between towns and cities is still in use in other Portuguese speaking countries, but in Brazil is no longer in use.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Romania}}\n\nIn [[Romania]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is: ''ora\u015f''). Cities and towns in Romania can have the status either of ''ora\u015f'' [[municipiu]], conferred to large urban areas, or only ''ora\u015f'' to smaller urban localities. Some settlements remain villages ([[Communes of Romania|communes]]) even though they have a larger population than other smaller towns.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Types of inhabited localities in Russia}}\n\n[[File:moscow reutov.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Reutov]] is separated from the city of [[Moscow]] just by the [[Moscow Ring Road|MKAD]] highway]]\n\nUnlike [[English language|English]], the [[Russian language]] does not distinguish the terms \"city\" and \"town\"\u2014both are translated as \"{{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434}}\" (''gorod'').  Occasionally the term \"{{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434}}\" is applied to [[urban-type settlement]]s as well, even though the status of those is not the same as that of a city/town proper.\n\nIn Russia, the criteria an inhabited locality needs to meet in order to be granted city/town (''gorod'') status vary in different [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]. In general, to qualify for this status, an inhabited locality should have more than 12,000 inhabitants and the occupation of no less than 85% of inhabitants must be other than agriculture. However, inhabited localities which were previously granted the city/town status but no longer meet the criteria can still retain the status for historical reasons.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{main|New towns of Singapore}}\nIn Singapore, towns are large scale satellite housing developments which are designed to be self contained. It includes public housing units, a town centre and other amenities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Maisy|date=July 2014|title=Estimating the distortionary effects of ethnic quotas in Singapore using housing transactions|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=115|issue=|pages=131\u2013145|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.04.006|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/real-estate_papers/9}}</ref> Helmed by a hierarchy of commercial developments, ranging from a town centre to precinct-level outlets, there is no need to venture out of town to meet the most common needs of residences. Employment can be found in industrial estates located within several towns. Educational, health care, and recreational needs are also taken care of with the provision of schools, hospitals, parks, sports complexes, and so on. The most populous town in the country is [[Bedok]].\n[[File:1 2014 panorama bishan park aerial gopro dji phantom.jpg|600px|thumb|center|[[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]], one of Singapore's towns is the 38th biggest in terms of geographical size and the 21st most populated planning area in the country.]]\n\n===South Africa===\nIn South Africa the [[Afrikaans]] term \"Dorp\" is used interchangeably with the English equivalent of \"Town\". A \"town\" is a settlement that has a size that is smaller than that of a city.\n\n=== Spain ===\nIn [[Spain]], the equivalent of town would be ''villa,'' a population unit between a village (''pueblo)'' and a city ''(ciudad)'', and is not defined by the number of inhabitants, but by some historical rights and privileges dating from the Middle Ages, such as the right to hold a market or fair. For instance, while [[Madrid]] is technically a ''villa'', [[Barcelona]], with a smaller population, is known as a city.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:\u00d6vre Finngr\u00e4nd 7 Sta Maria 29 Visby Gotland.jpg|thumbnail|View towards [[Visby Cathedral|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Visby]], [[Sweden]].

The term ''t\u00e4tort'' is used for an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] or a locality, which however is a statistical rather than an administrative concept and encompasses densely settled villages with only 200 inhabitants as well as the major cities. The word ''[[k\u00f6ping]]'' corresponds to an English ''[[market town]]'' ''(chipping)'' or German ''[[wikt:Markt|Markt]]'' but is mainly of historical significance, as the term is not used today and only survives in some [[toponym]]s. Some towns with names ending in ''-k\u00f6ping'' are cities with over 100 000 inhabitants today, e.g. [[Link\u00f6ping]].\n\nBefore 1971, 132 larger [[Municipality|municipalities]] in [[Sweden]] enjoyed special royal charters as ''[[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]'' instead of ''[[kommun]]'' (which is similar to a US [[County (United States)|county]]). However, since 1971 all municipalities are officially defined as ''kommun'', thus making no legal difference between, for instance, [[Stockholm]] and a small countryside municipality. Every urban area that was a ''stad'' before 1971 is still often referred to as a ''stad'' in daily speech. Since the 1980s, 14 of these municipalities brand themselves as ''stad'' again, although this has no legal or administrative significance, as they still have refer to themselves as ''kommun'' in all legal documentation.\n\nFor statistical purposes, [[Statistics Sweden]] officially defines a ''stad'' as an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] of at least 10,000 inhabitants. In the [[Swedish language]] the term for a major city is ''storstad'' (literally \"big town\"), but there is no clear definition as to when a ''stad'' should be called a ''storstad''. Most Swedes would only call [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malm\u00f6]] ''storst\u00e4der'', i.e. \"major cities\", although [[Uppsala]] fulfills the definition of \"municipality with a population that exceeds 200 000 inhabitants\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/BE/LE0102/2002A01/LE0102_2002A01_BR_12_BE51ST0307.pdf |title=Bilaga 1.

Public electronic dictionary of Ukrainian language (ukrlit.org)</ref> Historically, town in the Ukrainian lands was a smaller populated place that was chartered under the [[German town law]] and had a market square (see [[Market town]]). \nToday informally, town is also referred to [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|cities of district significance]], cities with small population, and former Jewish [[shtetl]]s.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{Main|City status in the United Kingdom}}\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{Main|List of urban areas in England by population|list of urban areas in Wales by population}}\n\n[[File:Rugby town centre.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional English town centre at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]]]\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], a town traditionally was a settlement which had a charter to hold a [[Market (place)|market]] or [[fair]] and therefore became a \"[[market town]]\". Market towns were distinguished from villages in that they were the economic hub of a surrounding area, and were usually larger and had more facilities.\n\nIn parallel with popular usage, however, there are many technical and official definitions of what constitutes a town, to which various interested parties cling.\n\nIn modern official usage the term ''town'' is employed either for old market towns, or for settlements which have a [[town council]], or for settlements which elsewhere would be classed a city, but which do not have [[City status in the United Kingdom|the legal right]] to call themselves such. Any parish council can decide to describe itself as a town council, but this will usually only apply to the smallest \"towns\" (because larger towns will be larger than a single civil parish).\n\nNot all settlements which are commonly described as towns have a \"Town Council\" or \"Borough Council\". In fact, because of many successive changes to the structure of local government, there are now few large towns which are represented by a body closely related to their historic borough council. These days, a smaller town will usually be part of a local authority which covers several towns. And where a larger town '''is''' the seat of a local authority, the authority will usually cover a much wider area than the town itself (either a large rural hinterland, or several other, smaller towns).\n\nAdditionally, there are \"[[new town]]s\" which were created during the 20th century, such as [[Basildon]], [[Redditch]] and [[Telford]]. [[Milton Keynes]] was designed to be a \"new city\" but legally it is still a town despite its size.\n\nSome settlements which describe themselves as towns (e.g. [[Shipston-on-Stour]], [[Warwickshire]]) are smaller than some large villages (e.g. [[Kidlington]], [[Oxfordshire]]).\n\nThe status of a ''city'' is reserved for places that have [[letters patent]] entitling them to the name, historically associated with the possession of a cathedral. Some large municipalities (such as [[Northampton]] and [[Bournemouth]]) are legally [[borough]]s but not cities, whereas some cities are quite small \u2014 such as [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] or [[St David's]]. The city of [[Brighton and Hove]] was created from the two former towns and some surrounding villages, and within the city the correct term for the former distinct entities is somewhat unclear.\n\n[[File:Windhill.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford]]]]\n\nIt appears that a city may become a town, though perhaps only through administrative error: [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in Kent had been a city for centuries but, when in 1998 the [[Medway]] district was created, a bureaucratic blunder meant that Rochester lost its official [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] and is now technically a town.\n\nIt is often thought that towns with [[cathedral|bishops' seats]] rank automatically as cities: however, [[Chelmsford]] was a town until 5 June 2012 despite being the seat of the [[diocese of Chelmsford]], created in 1914. [[St Asaph]], which is the seat of the [[diocese of St Asaph]], only became a city on 1 June 2012 though the diocese was founded in the mid sixth century. In reality, the pre-qualification of having a cathedral of the established [[Church of England]], and the formerly established [[Church in Wales]] or [[Church of Ireland]], ceased to apply from 1888.\n\nThe word ''town'' can also be used as a general term for urban areas, including cities and in a few cases, districts within cities. In this usage, a city is a type of town; a large one, with a certain status. For example, central [[Greater London]] is sometimes referred to colloquially as \"London town\". (The \"[[City of London]]\" is the historical nucleus, informally known as the \"Square Mile\", and is administratively separate from the rest of Greater London, while the [[City of Westminster]] is also technically a city and is also a [[London borough]].) [[Camden Town]] and [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] are districts of London, as [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] is a district of [[Edinburgh]] \u2013 actually the Georgian centre.\n\nIn recent years the division between cities and towns has grown, leading to the establishment of groups like the Centre for Towns, who work to highlight the issues facing many towns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.centrefortowns.org/about-us|title=About Us|last=Design|first=Concom Website|website=Centre For Towns|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> Towns also became a significant issue in the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election]], with [[Lisa Nandy]] making significant reference to Labour needing to win back smaller towns which have swung away from the party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/house/house-magazine/107129/lisa-nandy-mp-britains-towns-are-short-changed-cities|title=Lisa Nandy MP: Britain\u2019s towns are short-changed as cities capture an ever-greater share of foreign investment|last=PoliticsHome.com|date=2019-10-08|website=PoliticsHome.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Scotland ====\n{{Main|List of burghs in Scotland|List of towns and cities in Scotland by population}}\n\nA ''town'' in [[Scotland]] has no specific legal meaning and (especially in areas which were or are still [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking) can refer to a mere collection of buildings (e.g. a ''farm-town'' or in [[Scots language|Scots]] ''ferm-toun''), not all of which might be inhabited, or to an inhabited area of any size which is not otherwise described in terms such as [[city]], [[burgh]], etc. Many locations of greatly different size will be encountered with a name ending with ''-town'', ''-ton'', ''-toun'' etc. (or beginning with the Gaelic equivalent ''baile'' etc.).\n\nA [[burgh]] (pronounced ''burruh'') is the [[Scots language|Scots']] term for a town or a municipality. They were highly [[Autonomous area|autonomous]] units of [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] from at least the 12th century until their abolition in 1975, when a new [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|regional structure of local government]] was introduced across the country. Usually based upon a town, they had a [[municipal corporation]] and certain rights, such as a degree of [[self-governance]] and representation in the sovereign [[Parliament of Scotland]] adjourned in 1707.\n\nThe term no longer describes units of local government although various claims are made from time to time that the legislation used was not competent to change the status of the Royal Burghs described below. The status is now chiefly ceremonial but various functions have been inherited by current Councils (e.g. the application of various endowments providing for public benefit) which might only apply within the area previously served by a burgh; in consequence a burgh can still exist (if only as a defined geographical area) and might still be signed as such by the current local authority. The word 'burgh' is generally not used as a synonym for 'town' or 'city' in everyday speech, but is reserved mostly for government and administrative purposes.\n\nHistorically, the most important burghs were [[royal burgh]]s, followed by [[burgh of regality|burghs of regality]] and [[burgh of barony|burghs of barony]]. Some newer settlements were only designated as [[police burgh]]s from the 19th century onward, a classification which also applies to most of the older burghs.\n\n=== United States ===\n[[File:Wyatt-indiana-from-above.jpg|thumb|The tiny farming community of [[Wyatt, Indiana]]]]\n\nThe definition of \"town\" varies widely from state to state and in many states there is no official definition. In some states, the term \"town\" refers to an area of population distinct from others in some meaningful dimension, typically population or type of government. The characteristic that distinguishes a town from another type of populated place &mdash; a city, borough, village, or [[Civil township|township]], for example &mdash; differs from state to state. In some states, a town is an incorporated [[municipality]]; that is, one with a [[charter]] received from the state, similar to a city (see [[incorporated town]]), while in others, a town is unincorporated. In some instances, the term \"town\" refers to a small incorporated municipality of less than a population threshold specified by state statute, while in others a town can be significantly larger. Some states do not use the term \"town\" at all, while in others the term has no official meaning and is used informally to refer to a populated place, of any size, whether incorporated or unincorporated. In still other states, the words \"town\" and \"city\" are legally interchangeable.\n\nSmall town life has been a major theme in American literature, especially stories of rejection by young people leaving for the metropolis.<ref>Miles Orvell, ''The Death and Life of Main Street: Small Towns in American Memory, Space, and Community'' (University of North Carolina Press; 2012)</ref>\n\nSince the use of the term varies considerably by state, individual usages are presented in the following sections:\n\n====Alabama====\nIn [[Alabama]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population.  A municipality with a population of 2,000 or more is a city, while less than 2,000 is a town (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104014/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-6.htm Section 11-40-6]).  For legislative purposes, municipalities are divided into eight classes based on population.  Class 8 includes all towns, plus cities with populations of less than 6,000 (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104906/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-12.htm Section 11-40-12]).\n\n====Arizona====\n\nIn [[Arizona]], the terms \"town\" and \"city\" are largely interchangeable. A community may incorporate under either a town or a city organization with no regard to population or other restrictions according to Arizona law (see Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 9). Cities may function under slightly differing governmental systems, such as the option to organize a district system for city governments, but largely retain the same powers as towns. Arizona law also allows for the consolidation of neighboring towns and the unification of a city and a town, but makes no provision for the joining of two adjacent cities.\n\n====California====\nIn [[California]], the words \"town\" and \"city\" are synonymous by law (see Cal. Govt. Code Secs. 34500\u201334504). There are two types of cities in California: charter and general law. Cities organized as charter cities derive their authority from a charter that they draft and file with the state, and which, among other things, states the municipality's name as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\" Government Code Sections 34500\u201334504 applies to cities organized as general law cities, which differ from charter cities in that they do not have charters but instead operate with the powers conferred them by the pertinent sections of the Government Code. Like charter cities, general law cities may incorporate as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\"\n\nSome cities change their minds as to how they want to be called. The sign in front of the municipal offices in [[Los Gatos, California]], for example, reads \"City of Los Gatos\", but the words engraved on the building above the front entrance when the city hall was built read \"Town of Los Gatos.\" There are also signs at the municipal corporation limit, some of which welcome visitors to the \"City of Los Gatos\" while older, adjacent signs welcome people to the \"Town of Los Gatos.\" Meanwhile, the village does not exist in California as a municipal corporation. Instead, the word \"town\" is commonly used to indicate any unincorporated community that might otherwise be known as an unincorporated village. Additionally, some people may still use the word \"town\" as shorthand for \"township\", which is not an incorporated municipality but an administrative division of a county.\n\n====Hawaii====\n\nThe [[Hawaii]]an Island of [[Oahu]] has various communities that may be referred to as towns. However, the entire island is lumped as a single incorporated city, the City and County of [[Honolulu]]. The towns on Oahu are merely unincorporated [[census-designated place]]s.\n\n====Illinois====\nIn [[Illinois]], the word \"town\" has been used both to denote a subdivision of a county called a township,<ref>See the Township Code, 60 ILCS 1 et seq.</ref> and to denote a form of municipality similar to a [[village]], in that it is generally governed by a president and trustees rather than a mayor.<ref>See ''Phillips v. Town of Scales Mound'', 195 Ill. 353, 357, 63 N.E. 180 (1902)</ref> In some areas a \"Town\" may be incorporated legally as a Village (meaning it has at large Trustees) or a City (meaning it has aldermen from districts) and absorb the duties of the Township it is coterminous with (maintenance of birth records, certain welfare items). [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]] and [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] are examples of Towns in this manner. Under the current Illinois Municipal Code, an incorporated or unincorporated town may choose to incorporate as a city or as a village, but other forms of incorporation are no longer allowed.<ref>''See generally'' Article 2 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/2\u20111\u20111 et seq.</ref>\n\n====Louisiana====\nIn [[Louisiana]] a \"town\" is defined as being a municipal government having a population of 1,001 to 4,999 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/gc021x2.pdf |title=Individual State Descriptions: 2002 |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref>\n\n====Maryland====\n\nWhile a \"town\" is generally considered a smaller entity than a \"city\", the two terms are legally interchangeable in Maryland.  The only exception may be the [[independent city]] of [[Baltimore]], which is a special case, as it was created by the [[Constitution of Maryland]].\n\n====Nevada====\n\nIn [[Nevada]], a town has a form of government, but is not considered to be incorporated. It generally provides a limited range of services, such as [[land use planning]] and recreation, while leaving most services to the county. Many communities have found this \"semi-incorporated\" status attractive; the state has only 20 incorporated [[List of cities in Nevada|cities]], and towns as large as [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] (186,020 in 2000 Census), home of the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Most [[county seat]]s are also towns, not cities.\n\n====New England====\n{{Main|New England town}}\n\nIn the six [[New England]] states, a [[New England town|town]] is a municipality and a more important unit than the [[county]]. In [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]] and 7 out of 14 counties in [[Massachusetts]], in fact, counties only exist as map divisions and have no legal functions; in the other three states, counties are primarily judicial districts, with other functions primarily in [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. In all six, towns perform functions that in most states would be county functions. The defining feature of a New England town, as opposed to a city, is that a [[town meeting]] and a [[board of selectmen]] serve as the main form of government for a town, while cities are run by a mayor and a city council. For example, [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] is a town, even though it is fairly urban, because of its form of government.\n\n====New Jersey====\n{{Main|Town (New Jersey)}}\n\nA \"town\" in the context of New Jersey local government refers to one of five types and one of eleven forms of municipal government. While Town is often used as a shorthand to refer to a Township, the two are not the same. The Town Act of 1895 allowed any municipality or area with a population exceeding 5,000 to become a Town through a petition and referendum process. Under the 1895 Act, a newly incorporated town was divided into at least three wards, with two councilmen per ward serving staggered two-year terms, and one councilman at large, who also served a two-year term. The councilman at large served as chairman of the town council. The Town Act of 1988 completely revised the Town form of government and applied to all towns incorporated under the Town Act of 1895 and to those incorporated by a special charter granted by the Legislature prior to 1875.\n\nUnder the 1988 Act, the mayor is also the councilman at large, serving a term of two years, unless increased to three years by a petition and referendum process. The Council under the Town Act of 1988 consists of eight members serving staggered two-year terms with two elected from each of four wards. One councilman from each ward is up for election each year. Towns with different structures predating the 1988 Act may retain those features unless changed by a petition and referendum process. Two new provisions were added in 1991 to the statutes governing towns, First, a petition and referendum process was created whereby the voters can require that the mayor and town council be elected to four-year terms of office. The second new provision defines the election procedure in towns with wards. The mayor in a town chairs the town council and heads the municipal government. The mayor may both vote on legislation before council and veto ordinances. A veto may be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of the council. The council may enact an ordinance to delegate all or a portion of the executive responsibilities of the town to a municipal administrator. Fifteen New Jersey municipalities currently have a type of Town, nine of which operate under the town form of government.\n\n====New York====\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of New York#Town}}\nIn [[Administrative divisions of New York|New York]], a town is similarly a division of the county, but with less importance than in New England. Of some importance, a town provides a closer level of governance than its enclosing county, providing almost all municipal services to unincorporated communities, called [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]], and selected services to incorporated areas, called [[Village (New York)|villages]]. In New York, a town typically contains a number of such hamlets and villages. However, due to their independent nature, incorporated villages may exist in two towns or even two counties (example: [[Almond (village), New York]]). Everyone in New York who does not live on an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] reservation or a city lives in a town and possibly in one of the town's hamlets or villages. (There are no towns in the five counties \u2013 also known as [[Boroughs (New York City)|boroughs]] \u2013 that make up [[New York City]].)\n\n====North Carolina====\nIn [[North Carolina]], all cities, towns, and villages are incorporated as [[List of municipalities in North Carolina|municipalities]]. According to the North Carolina League of Municipalities,<ref>{{cite web|website = North Carolina League of Municipalities|title = How NC Cities Work|url = https://www.nclm.org/advocacy/how-nc-cities-work |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516211303/http://www.nclm.org/resource-center/Pages/How-Municipalities-Work.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-16 }}</ref> there is no legal distinction among a city, town, or village\u2014it is a matter of preference of the local government.  Some North Carolina cities have populations as small as 1,000 residents, while some towns, such as [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], have populations of greater than 100,000.\n\n====Oklahoma====\nAccording to the definitions in the Oklahoma Municipal Code, \"City\" means a municipality which has incorporated as a city in accordance with the laws of the state; \"Town\" means a municipality which has incorporated as a town in accordance with the laws of the state; and, a \"Municipality\" means any incorporated city or town.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw1\u201d>{{cite web|url= https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=75748 |title= 11 O.S. 1-102 (Oklahoma Statutes, Title 11, Cities and Towns; Chapter 1, Oklahoma Municipal Code; Section 1-102, Definitions)|publisher=Oklahoma State Courts Network|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>  The term \u201cVillage\u201d is not defined or used in the act.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw1\u201d />  Any community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a Town; however, if the resident population is one thousand or more, a Town or community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a City.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw2\u201d>{{cite web|url= https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=75750|title= 11 O.S. 2-101 (Oklahoma Statutes, Title 11, Cities and Towns; Chapter 1, Oklahoma Municipal Code; Section 2-101, Incorporation of a Municipality)|publisher=Oklahoma State Courts Network|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nIn [[Pennsylvania]], only one municipality is incorporated as a \"town\": [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]]. Most of the rest of the state is incorporated as townships (there are also boroughs and cities), which function in much the same way as the towns of New York or New England, although they may have different forms of government.\n\n====Texas====\nIn [[Texas]], although some municipalities refer to themselves as \"towns\" or \"villages\" (to market themselves as an attractive place to live), these names have no specific designation in Texas law; legally all incorporated places are considered [[List of municipalities in Texas|cities]].\n\n====Utah====\n{{see also|List of cities and towns in Utah}}\nIn [[Utah]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population. A municipality with a population of 1,000 or more is a city, while less than 1,000 is a town. In addition, cities are divided into five separate classes based on population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|title=Utah Code, Title 10, Chapter 2, Section 301|publisher=Utah State Legislature|accessdate=May 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808233054/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|archivedate=August 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Virginia====\n{{main|Administrative divisions of Virginia#Towns}}\nIn [[Virginia]], a town is an incorporated municipality similar to a city (though with a smaller required minimum population).  But while cities are by Virginia law independent of counties, towns are contained within counties.<ref>{{cite web  |author=[http://cfs.gmu.edu/bio/grymes_c.html Charles A. Grymes]  |url=http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |title=County vs. Town vs. City in Virginia  |accessdate=2011-05-31  |quote=Cities own and maintain their roads, while Virginia counties (except for Arlington and Henrico) rely upon [[Virginia Department of Transportation|VDOT]] for road maintenance. Cities get a fixed allocation of state funding for building and maintaining those roads, while counties must compete with each other and other VDOT priorities for a substantial portion of their road budget. Cities have been granted more authorities, such as the right of city councils to issue bonds to build roads without a voter referendum (counties must get voter approval in a referendum before issuing road bonds)... In Virginia, towns have distinct boundaries, established by the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] or by courts guided by laws passed by the legislature. Towns are *not* independent from counties; residents of towns are still residents of the county in which the town is located. For example, residents of the four towns of [[Haymarket, Virginia|Haymarket]], [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]], [[Dumfries, Virginia|Dumfries]], and [[Occoquan, Virginia|Occoquan]] are also residents of [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]. They pay both town and county property taxes, and town residents get to vote for a town council/mayor.  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620092601/http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |archivedate=2010-06-20  }}</ref>\n\n====Washington====\n{{Further|City government in Washington (state)}}\nA town in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] is a municipality that has a population of less than 1,500 at incorporation, however an existing town can reorganize as a code city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/governance/locgov31.aspx |title=Classification of Washington Cities |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> Town government authority is limited relative to [[city (Washington)|cities]], the other main classification of municipalities in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |title=A Comparison of the Powers of a Town and a Noncharter Code City |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725204227/http://www.mrsc.org/Subjects/Management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> {{As of|2012}}, most municipalities in Washington are cities.

These Towns retain the name of the Civil Township from which they evolved and are often the same name as a neighboring City. Some Towns, especially those in urban areas, have services similar to those of incorporated Cities, such as police departments. These Towns will, from time to time, incorporate into Cities, such as [[Fox Crossing, Wisconsin|Fox Crossing]] in 2016 from the former town of [[Menasha (town), Wisconsin|Menasha]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.town-menasha.com/town-of-menasha-incorporation-update/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211054509/http://www.town-menasha.com/town-of-menasha-incorporation-update/ |archive-date=2017-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Often this is to protect against being annexed into neighboring cities and villages.\n\n====Wyoming====\nA [[Wyoming]] statute indicates towns are incorporated municipalities with populations of less than 4,000.

His mother, Abijah (also called Abi),<ref name=je /> was a daughter of the high priest Zechariah. Based on Thiele's dating, Hezekiah was born in c. 741 BCE. He was married to Hephzi-bah. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|21:1|HE}}) He died from natural causes at the age of 54 in c. 687 BCE, and was succeeded by his son [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20:21|HE}}).\n\n=== Reign over Judah ===\n[[File:Biblical Jerusalem Wall Remnants.jpg|thumb|Remnants of the [[Broad Wall (Jerusalem)|Broad Wall]] of biblical Jerusalem, built during Hezekiah's days against Sennacherib's siege]]\nAccording to the Bible, Hezekiah assumed the throne of Judah at the age of 25 and reigned for 29 years ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|HE}}). Some writers {{Who|date=November 2015}} have proposed that Hezekiah served as coregent with his father Ahaz for about 14 years. His sole reign is dated by William F. Albright as 715\u2013687 BCE, and by Edwin R. Thiele as 716\u2013687 BCE (the last ten years being a co-regency with his son Manasseh).<ref>See [[William F.

In place of this, he centralized the worship of God at the Jerusalem Temple. Hezekiah also defeated the [[Philistines]], \"as far as Gaza and its territory\", ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:8|HE}}) and resumed the [[Passover]] pilgrimage and the tradition of inviting the [[Ten Lost Tribes|scattered tribes of Israel]] to take part in a Passover festival. He sent messengers to [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] inviting them to Jerusalem for the celebration of the Passover. The messengers, however, were not only not listened to, but were even laughed at; only a few men of [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], Manasseh, and [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]] came to the city. Nevertheless, the Passover was celebrated with great solemnity and such rejoicing as had not been in Jerusalem since the days of [[Solomon]].<ref name=je /> Hezekiah is portrayed by the Bible as a great and good king.\n\n=== Political moves and Assyrian invasion ===\n{{Main|Sennacherib's campaign in Judah}}\n[[File:Assyrian Archers.jpg|thumb|Assyrian archers]]\n\nAfter the death of Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] in 705 BCE, Sargon's son [[Sennacherib]] became king of Assyria. In 703 BCE, Sennacherib began a series of major campaigns to quash opposition to Assyrian rule, starting with cities in the eastern part of the realm. In 701 BCE, Sennacherib turned toward cities in the west. Hezekiah then had to face the invasion of Judah. According to the Bible, Hezekiah did not rely on Egypt for support, but relied on God and prayed to Him for deliverance of his capital city Jerusalem. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:19\u201322|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:32\u201336|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:14\u201319|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:28|HE}}; {{bibleverse|Isaiah|31:1\u20133|HE}})\n\nThe Assyrians recorded that Sennacherib lifted his siege of Jerusalem after Hezekiah paid Sennacherib tribute. The Bible records that Hezekiah paid him three hundred [[talent (weight)|talents]] of silver and thirty of gold as tribute, even sending the doors of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] to produce the promised amount, but, even after the payment was made, Sennacherib renewed his assault on Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Peter J p255-256\">[[Peter J. Leithart]], \"1 & 2 Kings,\" ''Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible'', p. 255\u2013256, [[Baker Publishing Group]], [[Grand Rapids, MI]] (2006)</ref> Sennacherib surrounded the city and sent his [[Rabshakeh]] to the walls as a messenger. The Rabshakeh addressed the soldiers manning the city wall in Hebrew (''[[:wikt:\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea|Y\u0115huwdiyth]]''), asking them to distrust [[YHWH|Yahweh]] and Hezekiah, claiming that Hezekiah's righteous reforms (destroying the idols and [[High place|High Places]]) were a sign that the people should not trust their god to be favorably disposed ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17\u201335|HE}}). {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:15|HE}} records that Hezekiah went to the Temple and there he prayed to God.\n\n=== Hezekiah's construction ===\n[[File:Hezekiahs Tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siloam Tunnel]]]]\nKnowing that Jerusalem would eventually be subject to siege, Hezekiah had been preparing for some time by fortifying the walls of the capital, building towers, and constructing a tunnel to bring fresh water to the city from a spring outside its walls.<ref name=Spar/> He made at least two major preparations that would help Jerusalem to resist conquest: the construction of the [[Siloam Tunnel]], and construction of the [[Broad Wall (Jerusalem)|Broad Wall]].\n\n<blockquote>\"When Sennacherib had come, intent on making war against Jerusalem, Hezekiah consulted with his officers about stopping the flow of the springs outside the city \u2026 for otherwise, they thought, the King of Assyria would come and find water in abundance\" ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:2\u20134|HE}}).</blockquote> \n\nThe narratives of the Bible state that Sennacherib's army [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|besieged Jerusalem]]. ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|33:1|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:9|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Isaiah|36|HE}})\n\n=== Defeat of Sennacherib's army ===\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 082.jpg|thumb|''[[The Defeat of Sennacherib]]'', oil on panel by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], seventeenth century]]\nAccording to the biblical record, Sennacherib sent threatening letters warning Hezekiah that he had not desisted from his determination to take the Judean capital. ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|37:9\u201320|HE}}) Although they besieged Jerusalem, the biblical accounts state that the Assyrians did not so much as \"shoot an arrow there, ... nor cast up a siege rampart against it\", and that God sent out an angel who, in one night, struck down \"a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians,\" sending Sennacherib back \"with shame of face to his own land\".<ref>{{bibleverse|Isaiah|37:33-37|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:21|HE}}</ref>\n\nSennacherib's inscriptions make no mention of the disaster suffered by his forces. But, as Professor [[Jack Finegan]] comments: \"In view of the general note of boasting which pervades the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings, ... it is hardly to be expected that Sennacherib would record such a defeat.\" <ref>See ''Light From the Ancient Past'', 1959, p. 213</ref> The [[Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges]] refers to an \"Egyptian tradition, according to which Sennacherib had already reached [[Pelusium]] in Egypt, when in a single night his army was rendered helpless by a plague of [[Apodemus|field-mice]] which gnawed the bows of the soldiers and the thongs of their shields\".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/37.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Isaiah 37, accessed 10 May 2018, quoting Herodotus, ii. 141</ref> The version of the matter that Sennacherib presents, as found inscribed on what is known as the [[Sennacherib's Annals|Sennacherib Prism]] preserved in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]], in part says: \"As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke ... Hezekiah himself ... did send me, later, to Nineveh, my lordly city, together with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, ...\" <ref>''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p. 288</ref> This version inflates the number of silver talents sent from 300 to 800; but in other regards it confirms the biblical record and shows that Sennacherib made no claim that he captured Jerusalem. However, Sennacherib presents the matter of Hezekiah's paying tribute as having come after the Assyrian threat of a siege against Jerusalem, whereas the Bible states it was paid before.\n\n=== Death of Sennacherib ===\n[[File:The Flight of Adrammelech Murch.jpg|thumb|left|170px|''The Flight of Adrammelech'', biblical illustration by Arthur Murch]]\nOf Sennacherib's death {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:37|HE}} says\n\n<blockquote>\"It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him [Sennacherib] with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.\"</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Assyrian records, Sennacherib was assassinated in 681 BCE, twenty years after the 701 BCE invasion of Judah.<ref>J. D. Douglas, ed., ''New Bible Dictionary'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) 1160.</ref> A Neo-Babylonian letter corroborates with the biblical account a sentiment from Sennacherib\u2019s sons to assassinate him, an event [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]] have reconstructed as historical. The son [[Ardi-Mulishi]], who is mentioned in the letter as killing anyone who would reveal his conspiracy, successfully murders his father in c. 681 BCE,<ref>''The New Oxford Annotated Bible.'' 4th ed. New York: Oxford Press, 2010.</ref> and was most likely the Adrammelech in [[2 Kings]], though Sharezer is not known elsewhere.<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\">''Archaeological Study Bible''. Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2005. Print.</ref> Assyriologists posit the murder was motivated because Esarhaddon was chosen as heir to the throne instead of Ardi-Mulishi, the next eldest son. Assyrian and Hebrew biblical history corroborate that [[Esarhaddon]] ultimately did succeed the throne. Other Assyriologists assert that Sennacherib was murdered in revenge for his destruction of Babylon, a city sacred to all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians.<ref>Georges Roux.

Hezekiah was reassured that his own lifetime would see peace and security.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|20:12\u201319|ESV}}: ESV translation</ref>\n\nAccording to {{bibleverse||Isaiah|38:5|HE}}, Hezekiah lived another 15 years after praying to God.

Some [[Talmudist]]s also considered that it might have come about as a way for Hezekiah to purge his sins or due to his arrogance in assuming his righteousness.<ref name=je>{{cite web|title=Hezekiah|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7668-hezekiah|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Extra-Biblical records ==\n[[File:Stamped-bulla seal-side.jpg|right|thumb|Stamped bulla sealed by a servant of King Hezekiah, formerly pressed against a cord; unprovenanced [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] collection of antiquities]]\n\nExtra-biblical sources do much more for us than give us a pan-Mid Eastern picture into which we contextualize Hezekiah: there are extra-biblical sources that specify Hezekiah by name, along with his reign and influence. \"Historiographically, his reign is noteworthy for the convergence of a variety of biblical sources and diverse extrabiblical evidence often bearing on the same events.

It was written in cuneiform, the Mesopotamian form of writing of the day. The prism records the conquest of 46 strong towns <ref>James B. Pritchard, ed., ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Related to the Old Testament'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1965) 287\u2013288.</ref> and \"uncountable smaller places,\" along with the siege of Jerusalem where Sennacherib says he just \"shut him up ... like a bird in a cage,\"<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" /> subsequently enforcing a larger tribute upon him.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible states that during the night, the angel of Jehovah (YHWH Hebrew) brought death to 185,000 Assyrians troops ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:35|HE}}), forcing the army to abandon the siege, yet it also records a tribute paid to Sennacherib of 300 silver talents following the siege. There is no account of the supernatural event in the prism. Sennacherib's account records his levying of a tribute from Hezekiah, the king of Judea, who was within Jerusalem, leaving the city as the only one intact following the exile of the northern ten-tribe kingdom of Israel due to idolatry. (2 Kings 17:22, 23; 2 Kings 18:1\u20138) Sennacherib recorded a payment of 800 silver talents, which suggests a capitulation to end the siege. However, Inscriptions have been discovered describing Sennacherib's defeat of the Ethiopian forces. These say: \"As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities ... and conquered (them). ... Himself I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage.\"<ref>''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p.&nbsp;288</ref> He does not claim to have captured the city. This is consistent with the Bible account of Hezekiah's revolt against Assyria in the sense that neither account seems to indicate that Sennacherib ever entered or formally captured the city. Sennacherib in this inscription claims that Hezekiah paid for tribute 800 talents of silver, in contrast with the Bible's 300, however this could be due to boastful exaggeration which was not uncommon amongst kings of the period. Furthermore, the annals{{unspecific}} record a list of booty sent from Jerusalem to Nineveh.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=110}} In the inscription, Sennacherib claims that Hezekiah accepted servitude, and some theorize that Hezekiah remained on his throne as a vassal ruler.{{sfn|Grabbe|2003|p=314}} The campaign is recorded with differences in the Assyrian records and in the biblical [[Books of Kings]]; there is agreement that the Assyrian have a propensity for exaggeration.<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" />{{sfn|Grabbe|2003|p=308\u2013309}}\n\nOne theory that takes the biblical view posits that a defeat was caused by \"possibly an outbreak of the bubonic plague\".<ref name=\"Zondervan Handbook\">''Zondervan Handbook to the Bible''.

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] followed the writings of Herodotus.<ref name=\"Anchor Dictionary\" /> These historians record Sennacherib's failure to take Jerusalem is \"uncontested\".<ref name=\"Anchor Dictionary\" />\n==Rabbanic Literature==\nAbi saved the life of her son Hezekiah, whom her godless husband, Ahaz, had designed as an offering to Moloch. By anointing him with the blood of the [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], she enabled him to pass through the fire of Moloch unscathed (Sanh. 63b).<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/300-abijah#anchor6 Jewish encyclopedia Abijah]</ref>\n\nHezekiah is considered as the model of those who put their trust in the Lord. Only during his sickness did he waver in his hitherto unshaken trust and require a sign, for which he was blamed by Isaiah (Lam. R. i.). The Hebrew name \"\u1e24iz\u1e33iyyah\" is considered by the Talmudists to be a surname, meaning either \"strengthened by Yhwh\" or \"he who made a firm alliance between the Israelites and Yhwh\"; his eight other names are enumerated in Isa. ix. 5 (Sanh. 94a). He is called the restorer of the study of the Law in the schools, and is said to have planted a sword at the door of the bet ha-midrash, declaring that he who would not study the Law should be struck with the weapon (ib. 94b).\n\nHezekiah's piety, which, according to the Talmudists, alone occasioned the destruction of the Assyrian army and the signal deliverance of the Israelites when Jerusalem was attacked by Sennacherib, caused him to be considered by some as the Messiah (ib. 99a). According to Bar \u1e32appara, Hezekiah was destined to be the Messiah, but the attribute of justice(\"middat ha-din\") protested against this, saying that as David, who sang so much the glory of God, had not been made the Messiah, still less should Hezekiah, for whom so many miracles had been performed, yet who did not sing the praise of God (ib. 94a).\n\n==Hezekiah and Isaiah==\nHezekiah's dangerous illness was caused by the discord between him and Isaiah, each of whom desired that the other should pay him the first visit. In order to reconcile them God struck Hezekiah with a malady and ordered Isaiah to visit the sick king. Isaiah told the latter that he would die, and that his soul also would perish because he had not married and had thus neglected the commandment to perpetuate the human species. Hezekiah did not despair, however, holding to the principle that one must always have recourse to prayer. He finally married Isaiah's daughter, who bore him Manasseh (Ber. 10a). However, in Gen. R. lxv. 4, as quoted in Yal\u1e33., II Kings, 243, it is said that Hezekiah prayed for illness and for recovery in order that he might be warned and be able to repent of his sins. He was thus the first who recovered from illness. But in his prayer he was rather arrogant, praising himself; and this resulted in the banishment of his descendants (Sanh. 104a). R. Levi said that Hezekiah's words, \"and I have done what is good in thy eyes\" (II Kings xx. 3), refer to his concealing a book of healing. According to the Talmudists, Hezekiah did six things, of which three agreed with the dicta of the Rabbis and three disagreed therewith (Pes. iv., end). The first three were these: (1) he concealed the book of healing because people, instead of praying to God, relied on medical prescriptions; (2) he broke in pieces the brazen serpent (see Biblical Data, above); and (3) he dragged his father's remains on a pallet, instead of giving them kingly burial. The second three were: (1) stopping the water of Gihon; (2) cutting the gold from the doors of the Temple; and (3) celebrating the Passover in the second month (Ber. 10b; comp. Ab. R. N. ii., ed. Schechter, p. 11).\n\nThe question that puzzled Ewald (\"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" iii. 669, note 5) and others, \"Where was the brazen serpent till the time of Hezekiah?\" occupied the Talmudists also. They answered it in a very simple way: Asa and Joshaphat, when clearing away the idols, purposely left the brazen serpent behind, in order that Hezekiah might also be able to do a praiseworthy deed in breaking it (\u1e24ul. 6b).\n\nThe Midrash reconciles the two different narratives (II Kings xviii. 13-16 and II Chron. xxxii. 1-8) of Hezekiah's conduct at the time of Sennacherib's invasion (see Biblical Data, above). It says that Hezekiah prepared three means of defense: prayer, presents, and war (Eccl. R. ix. 27), so that the two Biblical statements complement each other. The reason why Hezekiah's display of his treasures to the Babylonian ambassadors aroused the anger of God (II Chron. xxxii. 25) was that Hezekiah opened before them the Ark, showing them the tablets of the covenant, and saying, \"It is with this that we are victorious\" (Yal\u1e33., l.c. 245).\n\nNotwithstanding Hezekiah's immense riches, his meal consisted only of a pound of vegetables (Sanh. 94b). The honor accorded to him after death consisted, according to R. Judah, in his bier being preceded by 36,000 men whose shoulders were bare in sign of mourning. According to R. Nehemiah, a scroll of the Law was placed on Hezekiah's bier. Another statement is that a yeshibah was established on his grave\u2014for three days, according to some: for seven, according to others; or for thirty, according to a third authority (Yal\u1e33., II Chron. 1085). The Talmudists attribute to Hezekiah the redaction of the books of Isaiah, Proverbs, Song of Solomon, and Ecclesiastes (B. B. 15a).<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7668-hezekiah#anchor4 Hezekiah]</ref>\n\n==Chronological interpretation==\nUnderstanding the biblically recorded sequence of events in Hezekiah's life as chronological or not is critical to the contextual interpretation of his reign. According to scholar [[Stephen L. Harris]], chapter 20 of [[2 Kings]] does not follow the events of chapters 18 and 19 (161).<ref name=\"Harris Bible\">Harris, Stephen L. ''Understanding the Bible''. 8th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011.</ref> Rather, the Babylonian envoys precede the Assyrian invasion and siege. Chapter 20 would have been added during the exile, and Harris says it \"evidently took place before Sennacherib's invasion' when Hezekiah was \"trying to recruit Babylon as an ally against Assyria.'<ref name=\"Harris Bible\" /> Consequently, \"Hezekiah ends his long reign impoverished and ruling over only a tiny scrap of his former domain.'<ref name=\"Harris Bible\" /> Likewise, ''The Archaeological Study Bible'' says, \"The presence of these riches' that Hezekiah shows to the Babylonians \"indicates that this event took place before Hezekiah's payment of tribute to Sennacherib in 701 BC\" (564).<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" /> Again, \"Though the king's illness and the subsequent Babylonian mission are described at the end of the accounts of his reign, they must have occurred before the war with Assyria.<ref name=\"Bible Encyclopedia\" /> Thus, Isaiah's chastening of Hezekiah is due to his alliances made with other countries during the Assyrian conflict for insurance. To a reader who interprets the chapters chronologically, it would appear that Hezekiah ended his reign at a climax, but with a scholarly analysis, his end would contrarily be interpreted as a long fall from where he began.\u201d\n\n==Other chronological notes==\nThere has been considerable academic debate about the actual dates of reigns of the Israelite kings. Scholars have endeavored to synchronize the chronology of events referred to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] with those derived from other external sources. In the case of Hezekiah, scholars have noted that the apparent inconsistencies are resolved by accepting the evidence that Hezekiah, like his predecessors for four generations in the kings of Judah, had a coregency with his father, and this coregency began in 729 BCE.\n\nAs an example of the reasoning that finds inconsistencies in calculations when coregencies are ''a priori'' ruled out, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:10|NIV}} dates the fall of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]] (the Northern Kingdom) to the 6th year of Hezekiah's reign. [[William F. Albright]] has dated the fall of the Kingdom of Israel to 721 BCE, while [[Edwin R. Thiele|E. R. Thiele]] calculates the date as 723 BCE.<ref>Edwin R. Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) pp. 134, 217.</ref> If Abright's or Thiele's dating are correct, then Hezekiah's reign would begin in either 729 or 727 BCE. On the other hand, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|18:13|NIV}} states that Sennacherib invaded Judah in the 14th year of Hezekiah's reign. Dating based on Assyrian records date this invasion to 701 BCE, and Hezekiah's reign would therefore begin in 716/715 BCE.<ref>Leslie McFall, \"A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\" ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) p. 33. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf Link])</ref> This dating would be confirmed by the account of Hezekiah's illness in chapter 20, which immediately follows Sennacherib's departure ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20|NIV}}). This would date his illness to Hezekiah's 14th year, which is confirmed by Isaiah's statement ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20:6|NIV}}) that he will live fifteen more years (29 \u2212 15 = 14). As shown below, these problems are all addressed by scholars who make reference to the ancient Near Eastern practice of [[coregency]].\n\nFollowing the approach of [[Julius Wellhausen|Wellhausen]], another set of calculations shows it is probable that Hezekiah did not ascend the throne before 722 BCE. By Albright's calculations, [[Jehu]]'s initial year is 842 BCE; and between it and Samaria's destruction the ''Books of Kings'' give the total number of the years the kings of Israel ruled as 143 7/12, while for the kings of Judah the number is 165. This discrepancy, amounting in the case of Judah to 45 years (165\u2013120), has been accounted for in various ways; but every one of those theories must allow that Hezekiah's first six years fell before 722 BCE. (That Hezekiah began to reign before 722 BCE, however, is entirely consistent with the principle that the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency began in 729 BCE.) Nor is it clearly known how old Hezekiah was when called to the throne, although {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|NIV}} states he was twenty-five years of age. His father died at the age of thirty-six ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:2|NIV}}); it is not likely that Ahaz at the age of eleven should have had a son. Hezekiah's own son Manasseh ascended the throne twenty-nine years later, at the age of twelve. This places his birth in the seventeenth year of his father's reign, or gives Hezekiah's age as forty-two, if he was twenty-five at his ascension. It is more probable that Ahaz was twenty-one or twenty-five when Hezekiah was born (and suggesting an error in the text), and that the latter was thirty-two at the birth of his son and successor, Manasseh.\n\n[[File:Chludov proclamation.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from [[Chludov Psalter]]]]\nSince Albright and [[Richard Elliott Friedman|Friedman]], several scholars have explained these dating problems on the basis of a coregency between Hezekiah and his father Ahaz between 729 and 716/715 BCE. Assyriologists and Egyptologists recognize that coregency was a practice both in Assyria and Egypt.<ref>William J. Murnane, ''Ancient Egyptian Coregencies'' (Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1977).</ref><ref>J. D. Douglas, ed., ''New Bible Dictionary'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) p. 1160.</ref> After noting that coregencies were only used sporadically in the northern kingdom (Israel), Nadav Na'aman writes,\n<blockquote>In the kingdom of Judah, on the other hand, the nomination of a co-regent was the common procedure, beginning from David who, before his death, elevated his son Solomon to the throne. When taking into account the permanent nature of the co-regency in Judah from the time of Joash, one may dare to conclude that dating the co-regencies accurately is indeed the key for solving the problems of biblical chronology in the eighth century BC.\"<ref>Nadav Na'aman, \"Historical and Chronological Notes on the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah in the Eighth Century BC\" ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' 36 (1986) p. 91.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmong the numerous scholars who have recognized the coregency between Ahaz and Hezekiah are Kenneth Kitchen in his various writings,<ref>See Kitchen's chronology in ''New Bible Dictionary'' p. 220.</ref> Leslie McFall,<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" p.42.</ref> and Jack Finegan.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' (rev. ed.; Peabody MA: Hendrickson, 1998) p. 246.</ref> McFall, in his 1991 article, argues that if 729 BCE (that is, the Judean regnal year beginning in Tishri of 729) is taken as the start of the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency, and 716/715 BCE as the date of the death of Ahaz, then all the extensive chronological data for Hezekiah and his contemporaries in the late eighth century BCE are in harmony. Further, McFall found that no [[Conjecture (textual criticism)|textual emendation]]s are required among the numerous dates, reign lengths, and synchronisms given in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Testament]] for this period.<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" pp. 4\u201345 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf Link]).</ref> In contrast, those who do not accept the Ancient Near Eastern principle of coregencies require multiple emendations of the Scriptural text, and there is no general agreement on which texts should be emended, nor is there any consensus among these scholars on the resultant chronology for the eighth century BCE. This is in contrast with the general consensus among those who accept the biblical and near Eastern practice of coregencies that Hezekiah was installed as coregent with his father Ahaz in 729 BCE, and the synchronisms of 2 Kings 18 must be measured from that date, whereas the synchronisms to Sennacherib are measured from the sole reign starting in 716/715 BCE. The two synchronisms to [[Hoshea]] of Israel in 2 Kings 18 are then in exact agreement with the dates of Hoshea's reign that can be determined from Assyrian sources, as is the date of Samaria's fall as stated in 2 Kings 18:10. An analogous situation of two ways of measurement, both equally valid,  is encountered in the dates given for [[Jehoram of Israel]], whose first year is synchronized to the 18th year of the sole reign of [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah in 2 Kings 3:1 (853/852 BCE), but his reign is also reckoned according to another method as starting in the second year of the coregency of Jehoshaphat and his son [[Jehoram of Judah]] (2 Kings 1:17); both methods refer to the same calendrical year.\n\nScholars who accept the principle of coregencies note that abundant evidence for their use is found in the biblical material itself.<ref>Thiele, ''Mysterious Numbers'' chapter 3, \"Coregencies and Rival Reigns.\"</ref> The agreement of scholarship built on these principles with both biblical and secular texts was such that the Thiele/McFall chronology was accepted as the best chronology for the kingdom period in Jack Finegan's encyclopedic ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology''.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' p. 246.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{Cite book\n|last                           = Grabbe\n|first                          = Lester\n|title                          = Like a Bird in a Cage: The Invasion of Sennacherib in 701 BCE\n|year                           = 2003\n|publisher                      = A&C Black\n|url                            = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ln5NwF8L840C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Like+a+Bird+in+a+Cage:+The+Invasion+of+Sennacherib+in+701+BCE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kLxBVZiKC4GUNp2ngcgB&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Like%20a%20Bird%20in%20a%20Cage%3A%20The%20Invasion%20of%20Sennacherib%20in%20701%20BCE&f=false\n|ref                            = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last                           = Grayson\n|first                          = A.K.\n|chapter                        = Assyria: Sennacherib and Essarhaddon\n|editor1-last                   = Boardman\n|editor1-first                  = John\n|editor2-last                   = Edwards\n|editor2-first                  = I.

His reign is also referred to in the books of the prophets [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]], and [[Book of Micah|Micah]]. The books of Hosea and Micah record that their prophecies were made during Hezekiah\u2019s reign.<ref>{{bibleverse||Hosea|1:1|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Micah|1:1|HE}}</ref>\n\n=== Family and life ===\nHezekiah was the son of King [[Ahaz]] and [[Abijah (queen)|Abijah]]. His mother, Abijah (also called Abi),<ref name=je /> was a daughter of the high priest Zechariah. Based on Thiele's dating, Hezekiah was born in c. 741 BCE. He was married to Hephzi-bah. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|21:1|HE}}) He died from natural causes at the age of 54 in c. 687 BCE, and was succeeded by his son [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20:21|HE}}).\n\n=== Reign over Judah ===\n[[File:Biblical Jerusalem Wall Remnants.jpg|thumb|Remnants of the [[Broad Wall (Jerusalem)|Broad Wall]] of biblical Jerusalem, built during Hezekiah's days against Sennacherib's siege]]\nAccording to the Bible, Hezekiah assumed the throne of Judah at the age of 25 and reigned for 29 years ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|HE}}). Some writers {{Who|date=November 2015}} have proposed that Hezekiah served as coregent with his father Ahaz for about 14 years. His sole reign is dated by William F. Albright as 715\u2013687 BCE, and by Edwin R. Thiele as 716\u2013687 BCE (the last ten years being a co-regency with his son Manasseh).<ref>See [[William F.

In place of this, he centralized the worship of God at the Jerusalem Temple. Hezekiah also defeated the [[Philistines]], \"as far as Gaza and its territory\", ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:8|HE}}) and resumed the [[Passover]] pilgrimage and the tradition of inviting the [[Ten Lost Tribes|scattered tribes of Israel]] to take part in a Passover festival. He sent messengers to [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] inviting them to Jerusalem for the celebration of the Passover. The messengers, however, were not only not listened to, but were even laughed at; only a few men of [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], Manasseh, and [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]] came to the city. Nevertheless, the Passover was celebrated with great solemnity and such rejoicing as had not been in Jerusalem since the days of [[Solomon]].<ref name=je /> Hezekiah is portrayed by the Bible as a great and good king.\n\n=== Political moves and Assyrian invasion ===\n{{Main|Sennacherib's campaign in Judah}}\n[[File:Assyrian Archers.jpg|thumb|Assyrian archers]]\n\nAfter the death of Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] in 705 BCE, Sargon's son [[Sennacherib]] became king of Assyria. In 703 BCE, Sennacherib began a series of major campaigns to quash opposition to Assyrian rule, starting with cities in the eastern part of the realm. In 701 BCE, Sennacherib turned toward cities in the west. Hezekiah then had to face the invasion of Judah. According to the Bible, Hezekiah did not rely on Egypt for support, but relied on God and prayed to Him for deliverance of his capital city Jerusalem. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:19\u201322|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:32\u201336|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:14\u201319|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:28|HE}}; {{bibleverse|Isaiah|31:1\u20133|HE}})\n\nThe Assyrians recorded that Sennacherib lifted his siege of Jerusalem after Hezekiah paid Sennacherib tribute. The Bible records that Hezekiah paid him three hundred [[talent (weight)|talents]] of silver and thirty of gold as tribute, even sending the doors of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] to produce the promised amount, but, even after the payment was made, Sennacherib renewed his assault on Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Peter J p255-256\">[[Peter J. Leithart]], \"1 & 2 Kings,\" ''Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible'', p. 255\u2013256, [[Baker Publishing Group]], [[Grand Rapids, MI]] (2006)</ref> Sennacherib surrounded the city and sent his [[Rabshakeh]] to the walls as a messenger. The Rabshakeh addressed the soldiers manning the city wall in Hebrew (''[[:wikt:\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea|Y\u0115huwdiyth]]''), asking them to distrust [[YHWH|Yahweh]] and Hezekiah, claiming that Hezekiah's righteous reforms (destroying the idols and [[High place|High Places]]) were a sign that the people should not trust their god to be favorably disposed ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17\u201335|HE}}). {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:15|HE}} records that Hezekiah went to the Temple and there he prayed to God.\n\n=== Hezekiah's construction ===\n[[File:Hezekiahs Tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siloam Tunnel]]]]\nKnowing that Jerusalem would eventually be subject to siege, Hezekiah had been preparing for some time by fortifying the walls of the capital, building towers, and constructing a tunnel to bring fresh water to the city from a spring outside its walls.<ref name=Spar/> He made at least two major preparations that would help Jerusalem to resist conquest: the construction of the [[Siloam Tunnel]], and construction of the [[Broad Wall (Jerusalem)|Broad Wall]].\n\n<blockquote>\"When Sennacherib had come, intent on making war against Jerusalem, Hezekiah consulted with his officers about stopping the flow of the springs outside the city \u2026 for otherwise, they thought, the King of Assyria would come and find water in abundance\" ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:2\u20134|HE}}).</blockquote> \n\nThe narratives of the Bible state that Sennacherib's army [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|besieged Jerusalem]]. ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|33:1|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:9|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Isaiah|36|HE}})\n\n=== Defeat of Sennacherib's army ===\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 082.jpg|thumb|''[[The Defeat of Sennacherib]]'', oil on panel by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], seventeenth century]]\nAccording to the biblical record, Sennacherib sent threatening letters warning Hezekiah that he had not desisted from his determination to take the Judean capital. ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|37:9\u201320|HE}}) Although they besieged Jerusalem, the biblical accounts state that the Assyrians did not so much as \"shoot an arrow there, ... nor cast up a siege rampart against it\", and that God sent out an angel who, in one night, struck down \"a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians,\" sending Sennacherib back \"with shame of face to his own land\".<ref>{{bibleverse|Isaiah|37:33-37|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:21|HE}}</ref>\n\nSennacherib's inscriptions make no mention of the disaster suffered by his forces. But, as Professor [[Jack Finegan]] comments: \"In view of the general note of boasting which pervades the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings, ... it is hardly to be expected that Sennacherib would record such a defeat.\" <ref>See ''Light From the Ancient Past'', 1959, p. 213</ref> The [[Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges]] refers to an \"Egyptian tradition, according to which Sennacherib had already reached [[Pelusium]] in Egypt, when in a single night his army was rendered helpless by a plague of [[Apodemus|field-mice]] which gnawed the bows of the soldiers and the thongs of their shields\".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/37.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Isaiah 37, accessed 10 May 2018, quoting Herodotus, ii. 141</ref> The version of the matter that Sennacherib presents, as found inscribed on what is known as the [[Sennacherib's Annals|Sennacherib Prism]] preserved in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]], in part says: \"As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke ... Hezekiah himself ... did send me, later, to Nineveh, my lordly city, together with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, ...\" <ref>''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p. 288</ref> This version inflates the number of silver talents sent from 300 to 800; but in other regards it confirms the biblical record and shows that Sennacherib made no claim that he captured Jerusalem. However, Sennacherib presents the matter of Hezekiah's paying tribute as having come after the Assyrian threat of a siege against Jerusalem, whereas the Bible states it was paid before.\n\n=== Death of Sennacherib ===\n[[File:The Flight of Adrammelech Murch.jpg|thumb|left|170px|''The Flight of Adrammelech'', biblical illustration by Arthur Murch]]\nOf Sennacherib's death {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:37|HE}} says\n\n<blockquote>\"It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him [Sennacherib] with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.\"</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Assyrian records, Sennacherib was assassinated in 681 BCE, twenty years after the 701 BCE invasion of Judah.<ref>J. D. Douglas, ed., ''New Bible Dictionary'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) 1160.</ref> A Neo-Babylonian letter corroborates with the biblical account a sentiment from Sennacherib\u2019s sons to assassinate him, an event [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]] have reconstructed as historical. The son [[Ardi-Mulishi]], who is mentioned in the letter as killing anyone who would reveal his conspiracy, successfully murders his father in c. 681 BCE,<ref>''The New Oxford Annotated Bible.'' 4th ed. New York: Oxford Press, 2010.</ref> and was most likely the Adrammelech in [[2 Kings]], though Sharezer is not known elsewhere.<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\">''Archaeological Study Bible''. Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2005. Print.</ref> Assyriologists posit the murder was motivated because Esarhaddon was chosen as heir to the throne instead of Ardi-Mulishi, the next eldest son. Assyrian and Hebrew biblical history corroborate that [[Esarhaddon]] ultimately did succeed the throne. Other Assyriologists assert that Sennacherib was murdered in revenge for his destruction of Babylon, a city sacred to all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians.<ref>Georges Roux.

It was written in cuneiform, the Mesopotamian form of writing of the day. The prism records the conquest of 46 strong towns <ref>James B. Pritchard, ed., ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Related to the Old Testament'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1965) 287\u2013288.</ref> and \"uncountable smaller places,\" along with the siege of Jerusalem where Sennacherib says he just \"shut him up ... like a bird in a cage,\"<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" /> subsequently enforcing a larger tribute upon him.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible states that during the night, the angel of Jehovah (YHWH Hebrew) brought death to 185,000 Assyrians troops ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:35|HE}}), forcing the army to abandon the siege, yet it also records a tribute paid to Sennacherib of 300 silver talents following the siege. There is no account of the supernatural event in the prism. Sennacherib's account records his levying of a tribute from Hezekiah, the king of Judea, who was within Jerusalem, leaving the city as the only one intact following the exile of the northern ten-tribe kingdom of Israel due to idolatry. (2 Kings 17:22, 23; 2 Kings 18:1\u20138) Sennacherib recorded a payment of 800 silver talents, which suggests a capitulation to end the siege. However, Inscriptions have been discovered describing Sennacherib's defeat of the Ethiopian forces. These say: \"As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities ... and conquered (them). ... Himself I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage.\"<ref>''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p.&nbsp;288</ref> He does not claim to have captured the city. This is consistent with the Bible account of Hezekiah's revolt against Assyria in the sense that neither account seems to indicate that Sennacherib ever entered or formally captured the city. Sennacherib in this inscription claims that Hezekiah paid for tribute 800 talents of silver, in contrast with the Bible's 300, however this could be due to boastful exaggeration which was not uncommon amongst kings of the period. Furthermore, the annals{{unspecific}} record a list of booty sent from Jerusalem to Nineveh.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=110}} In the inscription, Sennacherib claims that Hezekiah accepted servitude, and some theorize that Hezekiah remained on his throne as a vassal ruler.{{sfn|Grabbe|2003|p=314}} The campaign is recorded with differences in the Assyrian records and in the biblical [[Books of Kings]]; there is agreement that the Assyrian have a propensity for exaggeration.<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" />{{sfn|Grabbe|2003|p=308\u2013309}}\n\nOne theory that takes the biblical view posits that a defeat was caused by \"possibly an outbreak of the bubonic plague\".<ref name=\"Zondervan Handbook\">''Zondervan Handbook to the Bible''.

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] followed the writings of Herodotus.<ref name=\"Anchor Dictionary\" /> These historians record Sennacherib's failure to take Jerusalem is \"uncontested\".<ref name=\"Anchor Dictionary\" />\n==Rabbanic Literature==\nAbi saved the life of her son Hezekiah, whom her godless husband, Ahaz, had designed as an offering to Moloch. By anointing him with the blood of the [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], she enabled him to pass through the fire of Moloch unscathed (Sanh. 63b).<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/300-abijah#anchor6 Jewish encyclopedia Abijah]</ref>\n\nHezekiah is considered as the model of those who put their trust in the Lord. Only during his sickness did he waver in his hitherto unshaken trust and require a sign, for which he was blamed by Isaiah (Lam. R. i.). The Hebrew name \"\u1e24iz\u1e33iyyah\" is considered by the Talmudists to be a surname, meaning either \"strengthened by Yhwh\" or \"he who made a firm alliance between the Israelites and Yhwh\"; his eight other names are enumerated in Isa. ix. 5 (Sanh. 94a). He is called the restorer of the study of the Law in the schools, and is said to have planted a sword at the door of the bet ha-midrash, declaring that he who would not study the Law should be struck with the weapon (ib. 94b).\n\nHezekiah's piety, which, according to the Talmudists, alone occasioned the destruction of the Assyrian army and the signal deliverance of the Israelites when Jerusalem was attacked by Sennacherib, caused him to be considered by some as the Messiah (ib. 99a). According to Bar \u1e32appara, Hezekiah was destined to be the Messiah, but the attribute of justice(\"middat ha-din\") protested against this, saying that as David, who sang so much the glory of God, had not been made the Messiah, still less should Hezekiah, for whom so many miracles had been performed, yet who did not sing the praise of God (ib. 94a).\n\n==Hezekiah and Isaiah==\nHezekiah's dangerous illness was caused by the discord between him and Isaiah, each of whom desired that the other should pay him the first visit. In order to reconcile them God struck Hezekiah with a malady and ordered Isaiah to visit the sick king. Isaiah told the latter that he would die, and that his soul also would perish because he had not married and had thus neglected the commandment to perpetuate the human species. Hezekiah did not despair, however, holding to the principle that one must always have recourse to prayer. He finally married Isaiah's daughter, who bore him Manasseh (Ber. 10a). However, in Gen. R. lxv. 4, as quoted in Yal\u1e33., II Kings, 243, it is said that Hezekiah prayed for illness and for recovery in order that he might be warned and be able to repent of his sins. He was thus the first who recovered from illness. But in his prayer he was rather arrogant, praising himself; and this resulted in the banishment of his descendants (Sanh. 104a). R. Levi said that Hezekiah's words, \"and I have done what is good in thy eyes\" (II Kings xx. 3), refer to his concealing a book of healing. According to the Talmudists, Hezekiah did six things, of which three agreed with the dicta of the Rabbis and three disagreed therewith (Pes. iv., end). The first three were these: (1) he concealed the book of healing because people, instead of praying to God, relied on medical prescriptions; (2) he broke in pieces the brazen serpent (see Biblical Data, above); and (3) he dragged his father's remains on a pallet, instead of giving them kingly burial. The second three were: (1) stopping the water of Gihon; (2) cutting the gold from the doors of the Temple; and (3) celebrating the Passover in the second month (Ber. 10b; comp. Ab. R. N. ii., ed. Schechter, p. 11).\n\nThe question that puzzled Ewald (\"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" iii. 669, note 5) and others, \"Where was the brazen serpent till the time of Hezekiah?\" occupied the Talmudists also. They answered it in a very simple way: Asa and Joshaphat, when clearing away the idols, purposely left the brazen serpent behind, in order that Hezekiah might also be able to do a praiseworthy deed in breaking it (\u1e24ul. 6b).\n\nThe Midrash reconciles the two different narratives (II Kings xviii. 13-16 and II Chron. xxxii. 1-8) of Hezekiah's conduct at the time of Sennacherib's invasion (see Biblical Data, above). It says that Hezekiah prepared three means of defense: prayer, presents, and war (Eccl. R. ix. 27), so that the two Biblical statements complement each other. The reason why Hezekiah's display of his treasures to the Babylonian ambassadors aroused the anger of God (II Chron. xxxii. 25) was that Hezekiah opened before them the Ark, showing them the tablets of the covenant, and saying, \"It is with this that we are victorious\" (Yal\u1e33., l.c. 245).\n\nNotwithstanding Hezekiah's immense riches, his meal consisted only of a pound of vegetables (Sanh. 94b). The honor accorded to him after death consisted, according to R. Judah, in his bier being preceded by 36,000 men whose shoulders were bare in sign of mourning. According to R. Nehemiah, a scroll of the Law was placed on Hezekiah's bier. Another statement is that a yeshibah was established on his grave\u2014for three days, according to some: for seven, according to others; or for thirty, according to a third authority (Yal\u1e33., II Chron. 1085). The Talmudists attribute to Hezekiah the redaction of the books of Isaiah, Proverbs, Song of Solomon, and Ecclesiastes (B. B. 15a).<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7668-hezekiah#anchor4 Hezekiah]</ref>\n\n==Chronological interpretation==\nUnderstanding the biblically recorded sequence of events in Hezekiah's life as chronological or not is critical to the contextual interpretation of his reign. According to scholar [[Stephen L. Harris]], chapter 20 of [[2 Kings]] does not follow the events of chapters 18 and 19 (161).<ref name=\"Harris Bible\">Harris, Stephen L. ''Understanding the Bible''. 8th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011.</ref> Rather, the Babylonian envoys precede the Assyrian invasion and siege. Chapter 20 would have been added during the exile, and Harris says it \"evidently took place before Sennacherib's invasion' when Hezekiah was \"trying to recruit Babylon as an ally against Assyria.'<ref name=\"Harris Bible\" /> Consequently, \"Hezekiah ends his long reign impoverished and ruling over only a tiny scrap of his former domain.'<ref name=\"Harris Bible\" /> Likewise, ''The Archaeological Study Bible'' says, \"The presence of these riches' that Hezekiah shows to the Babylonians \"indicates that this event took place before Hezekiah's payment of tribute to Sennacherib in 701 BC\" (564).<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" /> Again, \"Though the king's illness and the subsequent Babylonian mission are described at the end of the accounts of his reign, they must have occurred before the war with Assyria.<ref name=\"Bible Encyclopedia\" /> Thus, Isaiah's chastening of Hezekiah is due to his alliances made with other countries during the Assyrian conflict for insurance. To a reader who interprets the chapters chronologically, it would appear that Hezekiah ended his reign at a climax, but with a scholarly analysis, his end would contrarily be interpreted as a long fall from where he began.\u201d\n\n==Other chronological notes==\nThere has been considerable academic debate about the actual dates of reigns of the Israelite kings. Scholars have endeavored to synchronize the chronology of events referred to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] with those derived from other external sources. In the case of Hezekiah, scholars have noted that the apparent inconsistencies are resolved by accepting the evidence that Hezekiah, like his predecessors for four generations in the kings of Judah, had a coregency with his father, and this coregency began in 729 BCE.\n\nAs an example of the reasoning that finds inconsistencies in calculations when coregencies are ''a priori'' ruled out, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:10|NIV}} dates the fall of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]] (the Northern Kingdom) to the 6th year of Hezekiah's reign. [[William F. Albright]] has dated the fall of the Kingdom of Israel to 721 BCE, while [[Edwin R. Thiele|E. R. Thiele]] calculates the date as 723 BCE.<ref>Edwin R. Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) pp. 134, 217.</ref> If Abright's or Thiele's dating are correct, then Hezekiah's reign would begin in either 729 or 727 BCE. On the other hand, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|18:13|NIV}} states that Sennacherib invaded Judah in the 14th year of Hezekiah's reign. Dating based on Assyrian records date this invasion to 701 BCE, and Hezekiah's reign would therefore begin in 716/715 BCE.<ref>Leslie McFall, \"A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\" ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) p. 33. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf Link])</ref> This dating would be confirmed by the account of Hezekiah's illness in chapter 20, which immediately follows Sennacherib's departure ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20|NIV}}). This would date his illness to Hezekiah's 14th year, which is confirmed by Isaiah's statement ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20:6|NIV}}) that he will live fifteen more years (29 \u2212 15 = 14). As shown below, these problems are all addressed by scholars who make reference to the ancient Near Eastern practice of [[coregency]].\n\nFollowing the approach of [[Julius Wellhausen|Wellhausen]], another set of calculations shows it is probable that Hezekiah did not ascend the throne before 722 BCE. By Albright's calculations, [[Jehu]]'s initial year is 842 BCE; and between it and Samaria's destruction the ''Books of Kings'' give the total number of the years the kings of Israel ruled as 143 7/12, while for the kings of Judah the number is 165. This discrepancy, amounting in the case of Judah to 45 years (165\u2013120), has been accounted for in various ways; but every one of those theories must allow that Hezekiah's first six years fell before 722 BCE. (That Hezekiah began to reign before 722 BCE, however, is entirely consistent with the principle that the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency began in 729 BCE.) Nor is it clearly known how old Hezekiah was when called to the throne, although {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|NIV}} states he was twenty-five years of age. His father died at the age of thirty-six ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:2|NIV}}); it is not likely that Ahaz at the age of eleven should have had a son. Hezekiah's own son Manasseh ascended the throne twenty-nine years later, at the age of twelve. This places his birth in the seventeenth year of his father's reign, or gives Hezekiah's age as forty-two, if he was twenty-five at his ascension. It is more probable that Ahaz was twenty-one or twenty-five when Hezekiah was born (and suggesting an error in the text), and that the latter was thirty-two at the birth of his son and successor, Manasseh.\n\n[[File:Chludov proclamation.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from [[Chludov Psalter]]]]\nSince Albright and [[Richard Elliott Friedman|Friedman]], several scholars have explained these dating problems on the basis of a coregency between Hezekiah and his father Ahaz between 729 and 716/715 BCE. Assyriologists and Egyptologists recognize that coregency was a practice both in Assyria and Egypt.<ref>William J. Murnane, ''Ancient Egyptian Coregencies'' (Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1977).</ref><ref>J. D. Douglas, ed., ''New Bible Dictionary'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) p. 1160.</ref> After noting that coregencies were only used sporadically in the northern kingdom (Israel), Nadav Na'aman writes,\n<blockquote>In the kingdom of Judah, on the other hand, the nomination of a co-regent was the common procedure, beginning from David who, before his death, elevated his son Solomon to the throne. When taking into account the permanent nature of the co-regency in Judah from the time of Joash, one may dare to conclude that dating the co-regencies accurately is indeed the key for solving the problems of biblical chronology in the eighth century BC.\"<ref>Nadav Na'aman, \"Historical and Chronological Notes on the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah in the Eighth Century BC\" ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' 36 (1986) p. 91.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmong the numerous scholars who have recognized the coregency between Ahaz and Hezekiah are Kenneth Kitchen in his various writings,<ref>See Kitchen's chronology in ''New Bible Dictionary'' p. 220.</ref> Leslie McFall,<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" p.42.</ref> and Jack Finegan.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' (rev. ed.; Peabody MA: Hendrickson, 1998) p. 246.</ref> McFall, in his 1991 article, argues that if 729 BCE (that is, the Judean regnal year beginning in Tishri of 729) is taken as the start of the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency, and 716/715 BCE as the date of the death of Ahaz, then all the extensive chronological data for Hezekiah and his contemporaries in the late eighth century BCE are in harmony. Further, McFall found that no [[Conjecture (textual criticism)|textual emendation]]s are required among the numerous dates, reign lengths, and synchronisms given in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Testament]] for this period.<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" pp. 4\u201345 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf Link]).</ref> In contrast, those who do not accept the Ancient Near Eastern principle of coregencies require multiple emendations of the Scriptural text, and there is no general agreement on which texts should be emended, nor is there any consensus among these scholars on the resultant chronology for the eighth century BCE. This is in contrast with the general consensus among those who accept the biblical and near Eastern practice of coregencies that Hezekiah was installed as coregent with his father Ahaz in 729 BCE, and the synchronisms of 2 Kings 18 must be measured from that date, whereas the synchronisms to Sennacherib are measured from the sole reign starting in 716/715 BCE. The two synchronisms to [[Hoshea]] of Israel in 2 Kings 18 are then in exact agreement with the dates of Hoshea's reign that can be determined from Assyrian sources, as is the date of Samaria's fall as stated in 2 Kings 18:10. An analogous situation of two ways of measurement, both equally valid,  is encountered in the dates given for [[Jehoram of Israel]], whose first year is synchronized to the 18th year of the sole reign of [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah in 2 Kings 3:1 (853/852 BCE), but his reign is also reckoned according to another method as starting in the second year of the coregency of Jehoshaphat and his son [[Jehoram of Judah]] (2 Kings 1:17); both methods refer to the same calendrical year.\n\nScholars who accept the principle of coregencies note that abundant evidence for their use is found in the biblical material itself.<ref>Thiele, ''Mysterious Numbers'' chapter 3, \"Coregencies and Rival Reigns.\"</ref> The agreement of scholarship built on these principles with both biblical and secular texts was such that the Thiele/McFall chronology was accepted as the best chronology for the kingdom period in Jack Finegan's encyclopedic ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology''.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' p. 246.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{Cite book\n|last                           = Grabbe\n|first                          = Lester\n|title                          = Like a Bird in a Cage: The Invasion of Sennacherib in 701 BCE\n|year                           = 2003\n|publisher                      = A&C Black\n|url                            = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ln5NwF8L840C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Like+a+Bird+in+a+Cage:+The+Invasion+of+Sennacherib+in+701+BCE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kLxBVZiKC4GUNp2ngcgB&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Like%20a%20Bird%20in%20a%20Cage%3A%20The%20Invasion%20of%20Sennacherib%20in%20701%20BCE&f=false\n|ref                            = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last                           = Grayson\n|first                          = A.K.\n|chapter                        = Assyria: Sennacherib and Essarhaddon\n|editor1-last                   = Boardman\n|editor1-first                  = John\n|editor2-last                   = Edwards\n|editor2-first                  = I.

[[LWT]] broadcast the pilot on 21 September 1969.\n\nThe series was [[Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|remade in 2000]], starring British [[comedy]] duo [[Vic & Bob|Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the initial episode, Hopkirk is murdered during an investigation but returns as a [[ghost]]. Randall is the only main character able to see or hear him, although certain minor characters are also able to do so in various circumstances throughout the series, such as mediums, or drunk, or under hypnosis.\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nThe idea for the series was conceived by Dennis Spooner who had an adjoining office to producer Monty Berman at Elstree Studios. They had already collaborated on ''[[The Champions]]''. In March 1968 the pair conceived ''[[Department S (TV series)|Department S]]'' and Spooner's interest in the paranormal inspired by several feature films contemplated the possibility of a television series featuring a ghost and that a detective series would offer greater scope for storylines.\nThe idea was put to Head of ATV [[Lew Grade]] but he was not enthusiastic as the series lacked a leading American which he felt would inhibit overseas sales. Fortunately the synopsis caught the eye of [[Ralph Smart]] who had worked on ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1958 TV series)|The Invisible Man]]'', and ''[[Danger Man]]'' and he wanted to write the pilot. This convinced Lew Grade to green light the series.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tibbles |first1=Geoff |title=Randall & Hopkirk deceased |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=9780752209159 |pages=11 & 12}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nJeff Randall, originally named Steven Randall, was considered for the comedian [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]] who had made ''Tonight with Dave Allen'' for Lew Grade's ATV. When Allen signed for the [[BBC]] attention turned to Mike Pratt who had appeared in a number of episodes of various [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] series and was deemed to be right for the part by the production team including [[Cyril Frankel]], creative consultant on the series.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pixley |first1=Andrew |title=Programme notes Randall & Hopkirk |journal=DVD booklet |pages=6}}</ref>\n\nMarty Hopkirk proved more difficult and some actors were considered after scouring the pages of casting resource [[Spotlight (company)|Spotlight]], Frankel was at a new Italian restaurant in [[Soho, London]] and sitting at the next table was Kenneth Cope, with his wife, and Frankel though he would be right for the part. Frankel told Monty Berman, directed a screen test and Cope got the part.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pixley |first1=Andrew |title=Programme notes Randall & Hopkirk |journal=DVD booklet |pages=7}}</ref>\n\nJean Hopkirk, not in the original concept, is portrayed by Australian actress Annette Andr\u00e9. She was well known to the production team, having appeared in six episodes of ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' as well as ''[[The Baron]]''. She had been short listed for one of the lead roles in ''The Champions'' but lost to [[Alexandra Bastedo]], reportedly at the whim of an American [[CBS]] executive.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tibbles |first1=Geoff |title=Randall and Hopkirk deceased |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=9780752209159 |pages=20}}</ref>\n\n===Filming and locations===\nFilming commenced with the pilot in May 1968 with the aim to shoot a 48-minute episode over a fortnight working Monday to Friday from 8:30am to 5:30pm with some filming on alternate Sundays. The bulk of filming with the main cast was on two sound stages at ABC Elstree in Borehamwood where ''Department S'' and other series were also in production. Establishing shots would use library footage. Location sequences were usually filmed by a second unit using stand-ins or the guest cast who were only needed for one episode filmed by one director while the main cast were completing the previous episode with another director.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pixley |first1=Andrew |title=Programme notes Randall & Hopkirk Booklet |publisher=network |pages=9}}</ref> To keep costs down, a simple [[jump cut]] was used to make Marty Hopkirk disappear and reappear. Walking through walls was costly and time consuming using an image reflected on plain glass at an angle in front of the camera  often used in the theatre called [[Pepper's ghost]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tibballs |first1=geoff |title=Randall & Hopkirk |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=9780752209159 |pages=24}}</ref>\n\nThe exterior of the Randall & Hopkirk's office was a doorway at the side of Adam's Furniture Fabric on the corner of Kymberly Road and Springfield Road in Harrow now completely redeveloped as St George's Shopping Centre.

Music composed by Astley from  ''The Champions'' was briefly used as was music by [[Albert Elms]] from the same series.

The series was created by [[Dennis Spooner]] and produced by [[Monty Berman]], and was first broadcast in 1969 and 1970. In the United States, it was given the title '''''My Partner the Ghost'''''. \n[[ITC Entertainment]] produced a single series of 26 episodes in 1968 and 1969, which was aired from September 1969 to March 1970. The [[pilot episode]] was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the United Kingdom on 19 September 1969 on [[ATV Midlands]]. [[LWT]] broadcast the pilot on 21 September 1969.\n\nThe series was [[Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|remade in 2000]], starring British [[comedy]] duo [[Vic & Bob|Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the initial episode, Hopkirk is murdered during an investigation but returns as a [[ghost]]. Randall is the only main character able to see or hear him, although certain minor characters are also able to do so in various circumstances throughout the series, such as mediums, or drunk, or under hypnosis.\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nThe idea for the series was conceived by Dennis Spooner who had an adjoining office to producer Monty Berman at Elstree Studios. They had already collaborated on ''[[The Champions]]''. In March 1968 the pair conceived ''[[Department S (TV series)|Department S]]'' and Spooner's interest in the paranormal inspired by several feature films contemplated the possibility of a television series featuring a ghost and that a detective series would offer greater scope for storylines.\nThe idea was put to Head of ATV [[Lew Grade]] but he was not enthusiastic as the series lacked a leading American which he felt would inhibit overseas sales. Fortunately the synopsis caught the eye of [[Ralph Smart]] who had worked on ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1958 TV series)|The Invisible Man]]'', and ''[[Danger Man]]'' and he wanted to write the pilot. This convinced Lew Grade to green light the series.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tibbles |first1=Geoff |title=Randall & Hopkirk deceased |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=9780752209159 |pages=11 & 12}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nJeff Randall, originally named Steven Randall, was considered for the comedian [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]] who had made ''Tonight with Dave Allen'' for Lew Grade's ATV. When Allen signed for the [[BBC]] attention turned to Mike Pratt who had appeared in a number of episodes of various [[ITC]] series and was deemed to be right for the part by the production team including [[Cyril Frankel]], creative consultant on the series.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pixley |first1=Andrew |title=Programme notes Randall & Hopkirk |journal=DVD booklet |pages=6}}</ref>\n\nMarty Hopkirk proved more difficult and some actors were considered after scouring the pages of casting resource [[Spotlight (company)|Spotlight]], Frankel was at a new Italian restaurant in [[Soho, London]] and sitting at the next table was Kenneth Cope, with his wife, and Frankel though he would be right for the part. Frankel told Monty Berman, directed a screen test and Cope got the part.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pixley |first1=Andrew |title=Programme notes Randall & Hopkirk |journal=DVD booklet |pages=7}}</ref>\n\nJean Hopkirk, not in the original concept, is portrayed by Australian actress Annette Andr\u00e9. She was well known to the production team, having appeared in six episodes of ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' as well as ''[[The Baron]]''. She had been short listed for one of the lead roles in ''The Champions'' but lost to [[Alexandra Bastedo]], reportedly at the whim of an American [[CBS]] executive.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tibbles |first1=Geoff |title=Randall and Hopkirk deceased |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=9780752209159 |pages=20}}</ref>\n\n===Filming and locations===\nFilming commenced with the pilot in May 1968 with the aim to shoot a 48-minute episode over a fortnight working Monday to Friday from 8:30am to 5:30pm with some filming on alternate Sundays. The bulk of filming with the main cast was on two sound stages at ABC Elstree in Borehamwood where ''Department S'' and other series were also in production. Establishing shots would use library footage. Location sequences were usually filmed by a second unit using stand-ins or the guest cast who were only needed for one episode filmed by one director while the main cast were completing the previous episode with another director.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pixley |first1=Andrew |title=Programme notes Randall & Hopkirk Booklet |publisher=network |pages=9}}</ref> To keep costs down, a simple [[jump cut]] was used to make Marty Hopkirk disappear and reappear. Walking through walls was costly and time consuming using an image reflected on plain glass at an angle in front of the camera  often used in the theatre called [[Pepper's ghost]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tibballs |first1=geoff |title=Randall & Hopkirk |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=9780752209159 |pages=24}}</ref>\n\nThe exterior of the Randall & Hopkirk's office was a doorway at the side of Adam's Furniture Fabric on the corner of Kymberly Road and Springfield Road in Harrow now completely redeveloped as St George's Shopping Centre.
