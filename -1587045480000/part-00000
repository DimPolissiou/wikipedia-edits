The [[Vostok 3KA]] [[space capsule]] was launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on April 12, 1961, with Soviet [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] aboard, making him the first human to cross into [[outer space]].\n\nThe [[orbital spaceflight]] consisted of a single orbit around Earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at {{convert|169|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} at its lowest point. The flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing. Gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} altitude.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Vostok programme}}\n\nThe [[Space Race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States, the two [[Cold War]] superpowers, began just before the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], [[Sputnik 1]], in 1957. Both countries wanted to develop spaceflight technology quickly, particularly by launching the first successful human spaceflight. The Soviet Union secretly pursued the [[Vostok programme]] in competition with the United States' [[Project Mercury]]. Vostok launched several precursor uncrewed missions between May 1960 and March 1961, to test and develop the [[Vostok (rocket family)|Vostok rocket family]] and [[Vostok (spacecraft)|space capsule]]. These missions had varied degrees of success, but the final two&mdash;[[Korabl-Sputnik 4]] and [[Korabl-Sputnik 5]]&mdash;were complete successes, allowing the first crewed flight.\n\n==Crew==\n:''See also [[Vostok programme#Cosmonaut selection and training|Selection and training of the Vostok programme]]''\nThe Vostok 1 capsule was designed to carry a single cosmonaut. Yuri Gagarin, 27, was chosen as the prime pilot of Vostok 1, with [[Gherman Titov]] and [[Grigori Nelyubov]] as backups. These assignments were formally made on April 8, four days before the mission, but Gagarin had been a favourite among the cosmonaut candidates for at least several months.{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|262,272}}\n\nThe final decision of who would fly the mission relied heavily on the opinion of the head of cosmonaut training, [[Nikolai Kamanin]]. In an April 5 diary entry, Kamanin wrote that he was still undecided between Gagarin and Titov.<ref>Burgess and Hall, p.140</ref> \"The only thing that keeps me from picking [Titov] is the need to have the stronger person for the one day flight.\"<ref>Quoted in Burgess and Hall, p.140-141</ref> Kamanin was referring to the second mission, [[Vostok 2]], compared to the relatively short single-orbit mission of Vostok 1. When Gagarin and Titov were informed of the decision during a meeting on April 9, Gagarin was very happy, and Titov was disappointed.<ref>Burgess and Hall, p.141. The press said that Titov was so happy for Gagarin that he almost kissed him, but Titov denies this \u2013 Burgess and Hall, p.145.</ref> On April 10, this meeting was reenacted in front of television cameras, so there would be official footage of the event. This included an acceptance speech by Gagarin.<ref>Siddiqi, p.272, also Burgess and Hall, p.142</ref> As an indication of the level of secrecy involved, one of the other cosmonaut candidates, [[Alexei Leonov]], later recalled that he did not know who was chosen for the mission until after the spaceflight had begun.<ref name=\"Burgess and Hall, p.151\">Burgess and Hall, p.151</ref>\n\n==Medical exam==\nGagarin was examined by a team of doctors prior to his flight. One doctor gave her recollection of the events in an interview with [[Russia Today]] in April 2011: \"Gagarin looked more pale than usual. He was unsociable and quiet, which was not like him at all. He would answer by nodding or a short 'yes' to all questions. Sometimes he would start humming some tunes. This was a different Gagarin. We geared him up, and hugged. And I said, 'Yuri, everything will be fine.' And he nodded back.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Celebrating a star: 50 years since Gagarin's spaceflight |url=http://rt.com/news/gagarin-space-anniversary-history/ |website=RT International |accessdate=December 22, 2015 |language=en-EN}}</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:Vostok spacecraft.jpg|right|thumb|Model of the Vostok spacecraft with its upper stage, on display in [[Frankfurt Airport]]'s \"Russia in Space\" exhibition]]\nUnlike later Vostok missions, there were no dedicated [[tracking ship]]s available to receive signals from the spacecraft. Instead they relied on the network of ground stations, also called Command Points, to communicate with the spacecraft; all of these Command Points were located within the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Hall and Shayler, p.148-149</ref>\n\nBecause of weight constraints, there was no backup [[retrorocket]] engine. The spacecraft carried 10 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural [[orbital decay]] in the event the retrorockets failed.\n\nThe letters \"\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420\" were hand-painted onto Gagarin's helmet by engineer Gherman  Lebedev during transfer to the launch site. As it had been less than a year since [[1960 U-2 incident|U2 pilot Gary Powers was shot down]], Lebedev reasoned that without some country identification, there was a small chance the cosmonaut might be mistaken for a spy on landing.<ref name=sssr>{{cite news |url=https://pikabu.ru/story/otkuda_vzyalas_nadpis_sssr_na_shleme_gagarina_4193397 |title=(russian) \"Where did the writing CCCP come from?\" with authentic photos. |access-date=October 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115024750/http://pikabu.ru/story/otkuda_vzyalas_nadpis_sssr_na_shleme_gagarina_4193397 |archive-date=January 15, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Automatic control===\n[[File:Vostokpanel.JPG|thumb|right|Part of the Vostok 1 instrument panel prominently displaying the [[Voskhod Spacecraft \"Globus\" IMP navigation instrument|\"Globus\" navigation instrument]]]]\nThe entire mission would be controlled by either automatic systems or by [[Mission control center|ground control]]. This was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness, and therefore it was decided to lock the pilot's manual controls.

However, the actual orbit differed from the planned and would not have allowed descent until 20 days.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u041c. \u0418\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rusbereza.ru/jour/2008/200803/20080313.shtml |title=\u0422\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u042e\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0430, \u0430 \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430!.. |author=\u0420\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u041c. \u0418. |date=May\u2013June 2008 |publisher=\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442-\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430 \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0437\u0430\" |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nTen seconds after the retrofire, commands were sent to separate the Vostok [[service module]] from the [[reentry module]] (code name \"little ball\" ({{Lang-ru|\u0448\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a|sharik}})), but the equipment module unexpectedly remained attached to the reentry module by a bundle of wires. At around 07:35 UT, the two parts of the spacecraft began reentry and went through strong gyrations as Vostok 1 neared Egypt. At this point the wires broke, the two modules separated, and the descent module settled into the proper reentry attitude. Gagarin telegraphed \"Everything is OK\" despite continuing gyrations; he later reported that he did not want to \"make noise\" as he had (correctly) reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission (and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module). As Gagarin continued his descent, he remained conscious as he experienced about 8 [[g-force|g]] during [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]].

There was a huge hole where it hit the first time.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nGagarin's parachute opened almost right away, and about ten minutes later, at 08:05 UT, Gagarin landed.

Gagarin later recalled, \"When they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as I walked, they started to back away in fear.

Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was comparable to [[Moscow Victory Parade of 1945|World War II Victory Parades]].

programme]] and the first [[crewed spaceflight]] in history. The [[Vostok 3KA]] [[space capsule]] was launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on April 12, 1961, with Soviet [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] aboard, making him the first human to cross into [[outer space]].\n\nThe [[orbital spaceflight]] consisted of a single orbit around Earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at {{convert|169|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} at its lowest point. The flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing. Gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} altitude.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Vostok programme}}\n\nThe [[Space Race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States, the two [[Cold War]] superpowers, began just before the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], [[Sputnik 1]], in 1957. Both countries wanted to develop spaceflight technology quickly, particularly by launching the first successful human spaceflight. The Soviet Union secretly pursued the [[Vostok programme]] in competition with the United States' [[Project Mercury]]. Vostok launched several precursor uncrewed missions between May 1960 and March 1961, to test and develop the [[Vostok (rocket family)|Vostok rocket family]] and [[Vostok (spacecraft)|space capsule]]. These missions had varied degrees of success, but the final two&mdash;[[Korabl-Sputnik 4]] and [[Korabl-Sputnik 5]]&mdash;were complete successes, allowing the first crewed flight.\n\n==Crew==\n:''See also [[Vostok programme#Cosmonaut selection and training|Selection and training of the Vostok programme]]''\nThe Vostok 1 capsule was designed to carry a single cosmonaut. Yuri Gagarin, 27, was chosen as the prime pilot of Vostok 1, with [[Gherman Titov]] and [[Grigori Nelyubov]] as backups. These assignments were formally made on April 8, four days before the mission, but Gagarin had been a favourite among the cosmonaut candidates for at least several months.{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|262,272}}\n\nThe final decision of who would fly the mission relied heavily on the opinion of the head of cosmonaut training, [[Nikolai Kamanin]]. In an April 5 diary entry, Kamanin wrote that he was still undecided between Gagarin and Titov.<ref>Burgess and Hall, p.140</ref> \"The only thing that keeps me from picking [Titov] is the need to have the stronger person for the one day flight.\"<ref>Quoted in Burgess and Hall, p.140-141</ref> Kamanin was referring to the second mission, [[Vostok 2]], compared to the relatively short single-orbit mission of Vostok 1. When Gagarin and Titov were informed of the decision during a meeting on April 9, Gagarin was very happy, and Titov was disappointed.<ref>Burgess and Hall, p.141. The press said that Titov was so happy for Gagarin that he almost kissed him, but Titov denies this \u2013 Burgess and Hall, p.145.</ref> On April 10, this meeting was reenacted in front of television cameras, so there would be official footage of the event. This included an acceptance speech by Gagarin.<ref>Siddiqi, p.272, also Burgess and Hall, p.142</ref> As an indication of the level of secrecy involved, one of the other cosmonaut candidates, [[Alexei Leonov]], later recalled that he did not know who was chosen for the mission until after the spaceflight had begun.<ref name=\"Burgess and Hall, p.151\">Burgess and Hall, p.151</ref>\n\n==Medical exam==\nGagarin was examined by a team of doctors prior to his flight. One doctor gave her recollection of the events in an interview with [[Russia Today]] in April 2011: \"Gagarin looked more pale than usual. He was unsociable and quiet, which was not like him at all. He would answer by nodding or a short 'yes' to all questions. Sometimes he would start humming some tunes. This was a different Gagarin. We geared him up, and hugged. And I said, 'Yuri, everything will be fine.' And he nodded back.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Celebrating a star: 50 years since Gagarin's spaceflight |url=http://rt.com/news/gagarin-space-anniversary-history/ |website=RT International |accessdate=December 22, 2015 |language=en-EN}}</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:Vostok spacecraft.jpg|right|thumb|Model of the Vostok spacecraft with its upper stage, on display in [[Frankfurt Airport]]'s \"Russia in Space\" exhibition]]\nUnlike later Vostok missions, there were no dedicated [[tracking ship]]s available to receive signals from the spacecraft. Instead they relied on the network of ground stations, also called Command Points, to communicate with the spacecraft; all of these Command Points were located within the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Hall and Shayler, p.148-149</ref>\n\nBecause of weight constraints, there was no backup [[retrorocket]] engine. The spacecraft carried 10 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural [[orbital decay]] in the event the retrorockets failed.\n\nThe letters \"\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420\" were hand-painted onto Gagarin's helmet by engineer Gherman  Lebedev during transfer to the launch site. As it had been less than a year since [[1960 U-2 incident|U2 pilot Gary Powers was shot down]], Lebedev reasoned that without some country identification, there was a small chance the cosmonaut might be mistaken for a spy on landing.<ref name=sssr>{{cite news |url=https://pikabu.ru/story/otkuda_vzyalas_nadpis_sssr_na_shleme_gagarina_4193397 |title=(russian) \"Where did the writing CCCP come from?\" with authentic photos. |access-date=October 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115024750/http://pikabu.ru/story/otkuda_vzyalas_nadpis_sssr_na_shleme_gagarina_4193397 |archive-date=January 15, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Automatic control===\n[[File:Vostokpanel.JPG|thumb|right|Part of the Vostok 1 instrument panel prominently displaying the [[Voskhod Spacecraft \"Globus\" IMP navigation instrument|\"Globus\" navigation instrument]]]]\nThe entire mission would be controlled by either automatic systems or by [[Mission control center|ground control]]. This was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness, and therefore it was decided to lock the pilot's manual controls.

Gagarin telegraphed \"Everything is OK\" despite continuing gyrations; he later reported that he did not want to \"make noise\" as he had (correctly) reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission (and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module).

A good portion of its land had been devastated by war, and it had lost about 25 million citizens ... but it was the totalitarian state that overwhelmingly took the lead [in the space race].{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|282}}}}\n\nThe landing site is now a monument park. The central feature in the park is a {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall monument that consists of a silver metallic rocketship rising on a curved metallic column of flame, from a wedge shaped, white stone base. In front of this is a 3 meter (9 foot) tall white stone statue of Yuri Gagarin, wearing a spacesuit, with one arm raised in greeting and the other holding a space helmet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?t=h&lci=org.wikipedia.en&q=51.270682,45.99727(Vostok+1)&ie=UTF8&ll=51.2709,45.997245&spn=0.000824,0.002594&z=19 |title=Google Maps \u2013 Vostok 1 Landing Site \u2013 Monument Park Location \u2013 Satellite photo |accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.270508,45.997181&spn=0,0.005187&t=h&z=18&lci=com.panoramio.all&layer=c&cbll=51.270508,45.997181&cbp=12,0,,0,5&photoid=po-43813644 |title=Google Maps \u2013 Vostok 1 Landing Site \u2013 Rocket Monument photo |accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.278777,45.978298&spn=0,0.005187&z=18&lci=com.panoramio.all&layer=c&cbll=51.278777,45.978298&cbp=12,0,,0,5&photoid=po-17440456 |title=Google Maps \u2013 Vostok 1 Landing Site \u2013 Yuri Gagarin Statue photo |accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2018|09}}, the ''Vostok 1'' re-entry capsule belongs to the S.

{"title_page": "List of power metal bands", "text_new": "{{Dynamic list}} \nThis is a '''list of power metal bands''' including notable bands that have at some point in their careers played power metal or heavily contributed to the genre's development. [[Power metal]] is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music combining characteristics of [[traditional heavy metal|traditional metal]] with [[speed metal]], often within [[symphony|symphonic]] context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as [[doom metal]] and [[death metal]]. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound. Power metal has two distinct early styles, which developed in parallel. [[Power metal#American style|US Power Metal]] was developed in the mid/late 80s, pioneered by bands such as [[Omen (band)|Omen]] characterized by harsh thrashy sound and a focus on speed and soaring operatic vocals. It was directly influenced by [[speed metal]] and [[new wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]], and had a drop in popularity in the 90s. [[Power metal#European power metal|European Power Metal]] was developed in the late 80s by key bands such as [[Helloween]], and was more melodic, employing keyboards, synths and anthem-like songs.\n\n<!-- Please add bands that have articles to this list.

[[Power metal]] is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music combining characteristics of [[traditional heavy metal|traditional metal]] with [[speed metal]], often within [[symphony|symphonic]] context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as [[doom metal]] and [[death metal]]. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound. Power metal has two distinct early styles, which developed in parallel. [[Power metal#American style|US Power Metal]] was developed in the mid/late 80s, pioneered by bands such as [[Omen (band)|Omen]] characterized by harsh thrashy sound and a focus on speed and soaring operatic vocals. It was directly influenced by [[speed metal]] and [[new wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]], and had a drop in popularity in the 90s. [[Power metal#European power metal|European Power Metal]] was developed in the late 80s by key bands such as [[Helloween]], and was more melodic, employing keyboards, synths and anthem-like songs.\n\n<!-- Please add bands that have articles to this list.

Elvira is a wealthy widow, concerned about the health of her son. To attract her attention, he spends almost all his funds, but does not succeed. In despair, he returns to his farm with faithful servant Pedrillo, who is in love with Elvira's servant, Marina. A comic scene with two doctors regarding Marina as ill instead of Elvira's son ends the first act.\n\n;Act 2\nIn his farm, Federigo is entertained by Pedrillo and the old soldier's daughter, Jeanette Gregoire. But they can not dispel his sadness. Suddenly, Elvira appears with Marina.\n\n;Act 3\nThey are entertained with songs by Jeanette Gregoire. Finally the real cause of Elvira's visit is clarified. She wanted to ask Federigo's falcon to amuse her son. But Federigo confesses that he cooked it for the lunch having nothing else to prepare. Finally she is in love with Federigo, and they sing a love duet. The servants, Marina and Pedrillo, are also in love.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Holland, Bernard (16 February 1988).

Elvira is a wealthy widow, concerned about the health of her son. To attract her attention, he spends almost all his funds, but does not succeed. In despair, he returns to his farm with faithful servant Pedrillo, who is in love with Elvira's servant, Marina. A comic scene with two doctors regarding Marina as ill instead of Elvira's son ends the first act.\n\n;Act 2\nIn his farm, Federigo is entertained by Pedrillo and the old soldier's daughter, Jeanette Gregoire. But they can not dispel his sadness. Suddenly, Elvira appears with Marina.\n\n;Act 3\nThey are entertained with songs by Jeanette Gregoire. Finally the real cause of Elvira's visit is clarified. She wanted to ask Federigo's falcon to amuse her son. But Federigo confesses that he cooked it for the lunch having nothing else to prepare. Finally she is in love with Federigo, and they sing a love duet. The servants, Marina and Pedrillo, are also in love.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Holland, Bernard (16 February 1988).

Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II, while Mk.

II, further upgrading the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker.

Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be abandoned, and these were enlarged to provide more maneuvering power. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\".

V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAlmost cancelled", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Top_(missile)"}

In the 60' Ilias Chatzieleftheriou scored the first \"professional\" goal of Apollon Kalamarias in the big category. Ten years later, the club's victory over Apollon Athens on April 4, 1993, was important for the club's history as it achieved the 100th victory in the First National Division.\n\n====2001\u20132017====\nThe team had been in and out of the Greek first division until international businessman and former owner of [[Kalamata F.C.|Kalamata]], [[Stavros Papadopoulos]], bought the team in 2001.

However, this passage of the team by the Super League was to indirectly judge the champion of that year, through the evolution of the quirky \"Wallner Case\" (from the name of the Austrian footballer, [[Roman Wallner]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apollonkalamarias.com/tag/balner|title=\"Wallner Case\"|publisher=apollonkalamarias.com|language=Greek|date=|accessdate=}}</ref> who arrived to the International Sports Court of Lausanne ([[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]]), but eventually two days before the trial he withdrew the appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/320186/article/epikairothta/a8lhtismos/prwta8lhths-me-sfragida-cas|title=Olympiacos is a champion with the CAS stamp|publisher=kathimerini.gr|language=Greek|date=|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the next few months, the club was in a difficult financial position, with its debts amounting to 3.5 million, according to Apollon's major shareholder, Eftimis Solomonides. In December, four footballers filed an appeal, asking for the due ones, and at the same time terminating their contracts. The decision makers sought an amount of 300,000 euros for the direct payment of players' appeals, overdue installments, IKA and tax arrangements and the participation of the team in the 2nd National Championship. The submission of a participation statement outside the deadline of the Championship announcement led the historic club to the 4th National Division.\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Apollon Kalamarias participated in the Championship of the 4th National Division taking the 6th place in the final classification of the 2nd group. In the following season, 2010\u201311, they took part in the 2nd Group Championship of the same category. Achieving the first place of the final rankings secured the rise in Football League 2. In the period 2012\u201313, Apollon Kalamarias took part in the Football League 2 Championship, where they managed to go to the Football League. In the period 2014\u201315, the club was downgraded but with a big win over PAOK, 1\u20130 in the Greek Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Paok/to-roteision-espase-to-ahtthto-seri.3047471.html|title=Apollon Kalamarias vs PAOK 1\u20130, in 25 September 2014 for the Greek Cup|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the years 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317, Apollon competes in the [[Gamma Ethniki]], while the football section has been taken over by the brothers Kalatzidis.

However, the emperor of Trebizond, John II (1280\u20131297), during his formal reception in Constantinople 1282) was forced by the Byzantine emperor Michael Palaiologos to be presented in front of him with a despot outfit and without the official Byzantine emblems of the eagles and the purple sandals. Immediately after the blessings of the marriage to Evdokia, John VI was honored the permission of the father of Michael Palaiologos to have imperial emblems, but with the eagle monochet and not bicephal. The monocoque but eagle, as a symbol of power and importance of the Greeks of Pontus, is distinguished from the oldest years, as seen in the coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC century.\nIn coins, we see the eagle looking to the right. For proof we present the following:\nThe 4 silver coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC century. located at the British Museum in London, all show the eagle with his head facing the right wing (as shown in the show we are publishing). The silver coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC, located in the Numismatic Museum in Athens, show the eagle looking to his right wing. In DH's book. Economet \"Pontus and his Dikaia in this Hellenism\", printed in Athens in 1920, and on page 146, the eagle of Sinopi's coin in the 4th century BC, has the eagle to look to his right feather.In David Talbot Rice's book \"The Church of Hagia Sophia at Trebizond\" published in 1968 in [[England]], and on page 118, there is the full fresco painting of Emperor Manuel I who founded Hagia Sophia in Trebizond around 1250. This fresco, in normal size, was located in Hagia Sophia until 1850. Since then it has disappeared. In this fresco and the royal garments of the Emperor Manuel I there are over 15 eagles with their heads facing their right wing. All volumes of the Pontus archive have on the cover a coin of Sinope in the 4th century BC, showing the eagle's head tilted to the right of the wing. In 1961, titled \"1461\u20131961 Memory of Empire of Great Komnenos\" of the Pontian Studies Committee of Athens, the eagles are inclined to their right shoulders. The seal and the briefcases of the Pontian Studies Committee of Athens, since its foundation (1927), have the eagle facing the right wing. The Eagle of the Komnenoi of Trebizond at the Pontian Hero in Kallithea, Athens, looks towards its right wing.\nConclusion: In the antiquity and era of the Komnena of Trebizond, the Greek Pontians had the monoheaded eagle on their emblem, with his head facing his right wing.\n\n===Colours===\nThe colours of the team are red and black. The red symbolizes the blood of the thousands of refugees who died in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. The black color symbolizes the mourning. The eternal mourning of uprooting, of the homelands and of the many lost lives.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main article|Kalamaria Stadium}}\n[[File:Aerial view of Kalamaria, Greece.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kalamaria Stadium]], aerial view]]\nThe stage of M.G.K.K. \"Apollon\" is located in the historical center of [[Kalamaria]], a district of [[Thessaloniki]]. More specifically, it is located at the corner of Papagou & Chilis Street. It is located in the center of Kalamaria and access to it is very easy. The Apollon Pontou Stadium is private and is owned by the amateur Apollon. It has never been a Municipal Stadium and has not had a name for it. Apollon Pontou Stadium was one of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games Training Centers]] and was last renovated in 2003 for the needs of the event.\n\nIt can accommodate 6,500 people (seated) but its capacity can exceed 8,000. It consists of a central rack divided into 6 doors. At Ports 3 & 4 there is a suitable space for the needs of journalists (journalistic theory). Port 6, with a capacity of about 1,000-1,500 people, is used for the needs of fans of the group. It is specially formulated and meets all safety requirements. The entire stadium is equipped with police cameras. In each door there are toilets of women and men and small cubs for the needs of the fans. Also, for any announcements that may arise there are loudspeakers at each door of the stage to inform the public.\n\nApollon Pontou's stadium is not only the headquarters of its football section, but it also offers many other possibilities. On the back of the ramp there is a floor with offices and halls. On the floor are hosted the offices of amateur and Footvall Club's management. There are also some small apartments for the hospitality of the athletes.\n\nBelow the pitch of the stadium there are also courts for training the athletes of Apollon Pontou. This year's basketball courts were also refurbished. In general, the coaching facilities under the stadium are made up of basketball, volleyball, boxing, but well-fitting gymnasiums. There are also showers, changing rooms and toilets. Apollon Stadium also hosts the team track division. There is a tartan with a coat suitable for the training of track and field athletes, who can visit the stadium in specific hours (public hours). In addition to racing and endurance events, track and field athletes have the ability to train in the long-distance sport as well as on sleigh rides.\n\nApart from the central stadium, Apollon's facilities also include the 2 auxiliary football fields (grass and not plastic) for the training of the football sections and 5 tennis courts for the needs of the department. In tennis courts there is a cinema stand and next to a small caf\u00e9. The auxiliary football pitches and tennis courts are respectively right and left of the central stadium.\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n\n====Leagues====\n* '''[[Football League (Greece)|Second Division]]'''\n: '''Winners (3):''' 1972\u201373, 1982\u201383, [[1991\u201392 Beta Ethniki|1991\u201392]]'''\n* '''[[Gamma Ethniki|Third Division]]'''\n: '''Winners (4):''' 1975\u201376, 1979\u201380, [[2012\u201313 Football League 2 (Greece)|2012\u201313]], [[2016\u201317 Gamma Ethniki|2016\u201317]]'''\n* '''[[Macedonia Football Clubs Association|Macedonia FCA]]'''\n: '''Winners (2):''' 1957\u201358, 1975\u201376'''\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|6 January 2020}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  1 | nat= GRE|pos=GK|name=Athanasios Batalamas}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  2 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Giannis Dalianopoulos}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  4 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=Sokratis Aidonidis}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  6 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Georgios Kallias}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  8 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Athanasios Staikos}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  9 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=Charalampos Mouratidis}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 10 | nat= GRE|pos=FW|name=Vasilios Fragos}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 13 | nat= MKD|pos=FW|name=Borce Laskov}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 14 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=[[Filoxenos Toursidis]]}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 15 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=[[Alexandros Kalogeris]]}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 17 | nat= GRE|pos=FW|name=Anestis Anastasiadis}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 18 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=[[Nikos Tsoumanis]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 19 | nat= GRE|pos=GK|name=[[Theofilos Profyllidis]]}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 20 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Marios Chatzikonstantinou}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 22 | nat= ALB|pos=MF|name=Markelo Nasto}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 23 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=[[Dimitrios Amarantidis]]|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 26 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Marios Christodoulou}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 29 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Leonidas Andreadis}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 33 | nat= CYP|pos=DF|name=Andreas Chatziathanasiou}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 44 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=Theofanis Tsiatas}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 77 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=Alexandros Giannakopoulos}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 91 | nat= GRE|pos=GK|name=Georgios Malesios}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 98 | nat= GRE|pos=FW|name=Daniil Damoulakis}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==Management team==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Staff\n|-\n|Head coach||{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Dimitris Kalaitzidis]]\n|-\n|Assistant coach||{{flagicon|GRE}} Ilias Abatzidis\n|-\n|Goalkeeper coach||TBA\n|-\n|Fitness coach||{{flagicon|GRE}} Christos Kalamaras\n|-\n|Medical director||TBA\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://apollonpontoufc.gr/ Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170919011645/https://apollonpontou.com// Omilos Filos Apollon Pontou - Fans' website]\n*[http://apollonkalamarias.com/ Apollon Kalamarias - Fans' website and blog]\n\n{{Apollon Pontou FC}}\n{{Navboxes|title = Apollon Pontou FC templates|titlestyle = background:#FF3333;

However, this passage of the team by the Super League was to indirectly judge the champion of that year, through the evolution of the quirky \"Wallner Case\" (from the name of the Austrian footballer, [[Roman Wallner]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apollonkalamarias.com/tag/balner|title=\"Wallner Case\"|publisher=apollonkalamarias.com|language=Greek|date=|accessdate=}}</ref> who arrived to the International Sports Court of Lausanne ([[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]]), but eventually two days before the trial he withdrew the appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/320186/article/epikairothta/a8lhtismos/prwta8lhths-me-sfragida-cas|title=Olympiacos is a champion with the CAS stamp|publisher=kathimerini.gr|language=Greek|date=|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the next few months, the club was in a difficult financial position, with its debts amounting to 3.5 million, according to Apollon's major shareholder, Eftimis Solomonides. In December, four footballers filed an appeal, asking for the due ones, and at the same time terminating their contracts. The decision makers sought an amount of 300,000 euros for the direct payment of players' appeals, overdue installments, IKA and tax arrangements and the participation of the team in the 2nd National Championship. The submission of a participation statement outside the deadline of the Championship announcement led the historic club to the 4th National Division.\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Apollon Kalamarias participated in the Championship of the 4th National Division taking the 6th place in the final classification of the 2nd group. In the following season, 2010\u201311, they took part in the 2nd Group Championship of the same category. Achieving the first place of the final rankings secured the rise in Football League 2. In the period 2012\u201313, Apollon Kalamarias took part in the Football League 2 Championship, where they managed to go to the Football League. In the period 2014\u201315, the club was downgraded but with a big win over PAOK, 1\u20130 in the Greek Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Paok/to-roteision-espase-to-ahtthto-seri.3047471.html|title=Apollon Kalamarias vs PAOK 1\u20130, in 25 September 2014 for the Greek Cup|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the years 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317, Apollon competes in the [[Gamma Ethniki]], while the football section has been taken over by the brothers Kalatzidis. In the period 2016\u201317, Apollon won the championship of the first group of the Gamma Ethniki and was promoted to the 2nd National Division.\n\n===New era (Apollon Pontou)===\nOn July 13, 2017, the team changed its name to Apollon Pontou and the new owner is Alex Kalas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestival.gr/sports/item/254184-aleks-kalas-kai-typika-ston-apollona-kalamarias|title=Official: Alex Kalas is the new owner of Apollon Pontou|publisher=thestival.gr|language=Greek|date=|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pontos-news.gr/article/167597/kai-episima-apollon-pontoy-o-apollon-kalamarias|title=Apollon of Kalamaria officially Apollon Pontou|publisher=pontos-news.gr|language=Greek|date=13 July 2017|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Crest and colours==\n===Crest===\n[[File:Flag of Pontus.svg|thumb|left|Flag of Pontus]]\nFrom the beginning, the official emblem of the Komnenoi of Trebizond was the two-eyed eagle, which was also the symbol of the Byzantine Empire of the Paleologues. However, the emperor of Trebizond, John II (1280\u20131297), during his formal reception in Constantinople 1282) was forced by the Byzantine emperor Michael Palaiologos to be presented in front of him with a despot outfit and without the official Byzantine emblems of the eagles and the purple sandals. Immediately after the blessings of the marriage to Evdokia, John VI was honored the permission of the father of Michael Palaiologos to have imperial emblems, but with the eagle monochet and not bicephal. The monocoque but eagle, as a symbol of power and importance of the Greeks of Pontus, is distinguished from the oldest years, as seen in the coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC century.\nIn coins, we see the eagle looking to the right. For proof we present the following:\nThe 4 silver coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC century. located at the British Museum in London, all show the eagle with his head facing the right wing (as shown in the show we are publishing). The silver coins of Sinope in the 4th century BC, located in the Numismatic Museum in Athens, show the eagle looking to his right wing. In DH's book. Economet \"Pontus and his Dikaia in this Hellenism\", printed in Athens in 1920, and on page 146, the eagle of Sinopi's coin in the 4th century BC, has the eagle to look to his right feather.In David Talbot Rice's book \"The Church of Hagia Sophia at Trebizond\" published in 1968 in [[England]], and on page 118, there is the full fresco painting of Emperor Manuel I who founded Hagia Sophia in Trebizond around 1250. This fresco, in normal size, was located in Hagia Sophia until 1850. Since then it has disappeared. In this fresco and the royal garments of the Emperor Manuel I there are over 15 eagles with their heads facing their right wing. All volumes of the Pontus archive have on the cover a coin of Sinope in the 4th century BC, showing the eagle's head tilted to the right of the wing. In 1961, titled \"1461\u20131961 Memory of Empire of Great Komnenos\" of the Pontian Studies Committee of Athens, the eagles are inclined to their right shoulders. The seal and the briefcases of the Pontian Studies Committee of Athens, since its foundation (1927), have the eagle facing the right wing. The Eagle of the Komnenoi of Trebizond at the Pontian Hero in Kallithea, Athens, looks towards its right wing.\nConclusion: In the antiquity and era of the Komnena of Trebizond, the Greek Pontians had the monoheaded eagle on their emblem, with his head facing his right wing.\n\n===Colours===\nThe colours of the team are red and black. The red symbolizes the blood of the thousands of refugees who died in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. The black color symbolizes the mourning. The eternal mourning of uprooting, of the homelands and of the many lost lives.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main article|Kalamaria Stadium}}\n[[File:Aerial view of Kalamaria, Greece.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kalamaria Stadium]], aerial view]]\nThe stage of M.G.K.K. \"Apollon\" is located in the historical center of [[Kalamaria]], a district of [[Thessaloniki]]. More specifically, it is located at the corner of Papagou & Chilis Street. It is located in the center of Kalamaria and access to it is very easy. The Apollon Pontou Stadium is private and is owned by the amateur Apollon. It has never been a Municipal Stadium and has not had a name for it. Apollon Pontou Stadium was one of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games Training Centers]] and was last renovated in 2003 for the needs of the event.\n\nIt can accommodate 6,500 people (seated) but its capacity can exceed 8,000. It consists of a central rack divided into 6 doors. At Ports 3 & 4 there is a suitable space for the needs of journalists (journalistic theory). Port 6, with a capacity of about 1,000-1,500 people, is used for the needs of fans of the group. It is specially formulated and meets all safety requirements. The entire stadium is equipped with police cameras. In each door there are toilets of women and men and small cubs for the needs of the fans. Also, for any announcements that may arise there are loudspeakers at each door of the stage to inform the public.\n\nApollon Pontou's stadium is not only the headquarters of its football section, but it also offers many other possibilities. On the back of the ramp there is a floor with offices and halls. On the floor are hosted the offices of amateur and Footvall Club's management. There are also some small apartments for the hospitality of the athletes.\n\nBelow the pitch of the stadium there are also courts for training the athletes of Apollon Pontou. This year's basketball courts were also refurbished. In general, the coaching facilities under the stadium are made up of basketball, volleyball, boxing, but well-fitting gymnasiums. There are also showers, changing rooms and toilets. Apollon Stadium also hosts the team track division. There is a tartan with a coat suitable for the training of track and field athletes, who can visit the stadium in specific hours (public hours). In addition to racing and endurance events, track and field athletes have the ability to train in the long-distance sport as well as on sleigh rides.\n\nApart from the central stadium, Apollon's facilities also include the 2 auxiliary football fields (grass and not plastic) for the training of the football sections and 5 tennis courts for the needs of the department. In tennis courts there is a cinema stand and next to a small caf\u00e9. The auxiliary football pitches and tennis courts are respectively right and left of the central stadium.\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n\n====Leagues====\n* '''[[Football League (Greece)|Second Division]]'''\n: '''Winners (3):''' 1972\u201373, 1982\u201383, 1991\u201392'''\n* '''[[Gamma Ethniki|Third Division]]'''\n: '''Winners (4):''' 1975\u201376, 1979\u201380, 2012\u201313, [[2016\u201317 Gamma Ethniki|2016\u201317]]'''\n* '''[[Macedonia Football Clubs Association|Macedonia FCA]]'''\n: '''Winners (2):''' 1957\u201358, 1975\u201376'''\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|6 January 2020}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  1 | nat= GRE|pos=GK|name=Athanasios Batalamas}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  2 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Giannis Dalianopoulos}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  4 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=Sokratis Aidonidis}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  6 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Georgios Kallias}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  8 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Athanasios Staikos}}\n{{Football squad player| no=  9 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=Charalampos Mouratidis}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 10 | nat= GRE|pos=FW|name=Vasilios Fragos}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 13 | nat= MKD|pos=FW|name=Borce Laskov}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 14 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=[[Filoxenos Toursidis]]}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 15 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=[[Alexandros Kalogeris]]}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 17 | nat= GRE|pos=FW|name=Anestis Anastasiadis}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 18 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=[[Nikos Tsoumanis]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 19 | nat= GRE|pos=GK|name=[[Theofilos Profyllidis]]}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 20 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Marios Chatzikonstantinou}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 22 | nat= ALB|pos=MF|name=Markelo Nasto}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 23 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=[[Dimitrios Amarantidis]]|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 26 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Marios Christodoulou}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 29 | nat= GRE|pos=DF|name=Leonidas Andreadis}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 33 | nat= CYP|pos=DF|name=Andreas Chatziathanasiou}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 44 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=Theofanis Tsiatas}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 77 | nat= GRE|pos=MF|name=Alexandros Giannakopoulos}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 91 | nat= GRE|pos=GK|name=Georgios Malesios}}\n{{Football squad player| no= 98 | nat= GRE|pos=FW|name=Daniil Damoulakis}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==Management team==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Staff\n|-\n|Head coach||{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Dimitris Kalaitzidis]]\n|-\n|Assistant coach||{{flagicon|GRE}} Ilias Abatzidis\n|-\n|Goalkeeper coach||TBA\n|-\n|Fitness coach||{{flagicon|GRE}} Christos Kalamaras\n|-\n|Medical director||TBA\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://apollonpontoufc.gr/ Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170919011645/https://apollonpontou.com// Omilos Filos Apollon Pontou - Fans' website]\n*[http://apollonkalamarias.com/ Apollon Kalamarias - Fans' website and blog]\n\n{{Apollon Pontou FC}}\n{{Navboxes|title = Apollon Pontou FC templates|titlestyle = background:#FF3333; color:#000000; {{box-shadow border|a|#000000|1px}}\n|list1=\n{{Apollon Pontou FC squad}}\n{{Apollon Pontou FC managers}}\n}}\n{{Greek Second Division/Football (soccer)}}\n{{Superleague Greece teamlist}}\n{{Football in Greece}}\n\n[[Category:Apollon Pontou FC| ]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1926]]\n[[Category:Thessaloniki (regional unit)]]\n[[Category:Sport in Thessaloniki]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Central Macedonia]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in Greece]]\n[[Category:Gamma Ethniki clubs]]\n", "name_user": "Jolicnikola", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHonours", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollon_Pontou_FC"}

The borough consisted of part of the town of [[Knaresborough]], a market town in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. In 1831, the population of the borough was approximately 4,852, and contained 970 houses.\n\nKnaresborough was a [[burgage]] borough, meaning that the right to vote was confined to the proprietors of certain specific properties (or \"burgage tenements\") in the borough; in Knaresborough there was no requirement for these proprietors to be resident, and normally the majority were not. This meant that the right to vote in Knaresborough could be legitimately bought and sold, and, for most of its history until the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 reformed the franchise, the majority of the burgages were concentrated in the hands of a single owner who could therefore nominate both MPs without opposition. Nevertheless, contested elections were possible, and in 1830, when there were theoretically about 90 qualified voters, 45 people actually voted. But the landowners had other resources beyond the votes they owned, as the bailiff of the [[lord of the manor]] was also the returning officer, and of the 45 who attempted to vote in 1830 the bailiff rejected the votes of 23.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century, the main landowners in the area were the Slingsby family, who on occasion occupied both seats themselves, though usually they found it more advantageous to allow one of their fellow county magnates to have at least one of the seats. During the latter part of the [[Elizabethan period]], the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] also seems to have been influential \u2013 the historian Sir John Neale considered that the Duchy probably nominated at least one of the two members in each Parliament from 1584 to 1597 \u2013 but the influence of the Slingsbys was consolidated later. By the mid-18th century, ownership had passed to the [[Duke of Devonshire|Dukes of Devonshire]], who retained it until the Reform Act.\n\n===After the Great Reform Act===\nThe Reform Act extended Knaresborough's boundaries, bringing in the remainder of the town and coinciding with the boundaries established during the previous decade for policing purposes. This increased the population by nearly a third, to 6,253. Nevertheless, Knaresborough was one of the smaller boroughs to retain both its seats, and the registered electorate for the first reformed election was only 278. In subsequent years this fell further, though by the 1860s it had recovered to reach around 270 once more, and inevitably Knaresborough's representation was reduced to one MP under the [[Representation of the People Act 1867]]. The extension of the franchise by the same Act trebled the electorate.\n\nIn 1880, after a disputed election with suspicion of corrupt practices, the result was declared void and the constituency's right to representation suspended while a [[Royal Commission]] investigated; however, unlike the investigations in some other constituencies at around the same period, nothing too damning was uncovered, and a by-election to fill the vacancies was held in 1881. It proved, nevertheless, to be Knaresborough's last Parliament, for its electorate was still too low and the borough was abolished by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]. Its electors were transferred to the new [[Ripon (UK Parliament constituency)|Ripon]] division of the West Riding, a [[county constituency]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n===1553\u20131640===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second member\n|-\n| 1553 (Oct)|| [[Reginald Beseley]]|| [[Ralph Scrope]]<ref name=HoP1>{{cite book|title=The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558|year=1982|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/knaresborough|editor=Bindoff, S.

constituencies|parliamentary constituency]] which returned two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] until 1868, and then one MP until its abolition in 1885.\n\n==History==\n===Before the Great Reform Act===\nKnaresborough was a [[parliamentary borough]], first enfranchised by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in 1553. The borough consisted of part of the town of [[Knaresborough]], a market town in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. In 1831, the population of the borough was approximately 4,852, and contained 970 houses.\n\nKnaresborough was a [[burgage]] borough, meaning that the right to vote was confined to the proprietors of certain specific properties (or \"burgage tenements\") in the borough; in Knaresborough there was no requirement for these proprietors to be resident, and normally the majority were not. This meant that the right to vote in Knaresborough could be legitimately bought and sold, and, for most of its history until the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 reformed the franchise, the majority of the burgages were concentrated in the hands of a single owner who could therefore nominate both MPs without opposition. Nevertheless, contested elections were possible, and in 1830, when there were theoretically about 90 qualified voters, 45 people actually voted. But the landowners had other resources beyond the votes they owned, as the bailiff of the [[lord of the manor]] was also the returning officer, and of the 45 who attempted to vote in 1830 the bailiff rejected the votes of 23.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century, the main landowners in the area were the Slingsby family, who on occasion occupied both seats themselves, though usually they found it more advantageous to allow one of their fellow county magnates to have at least one of the seats. During the latter part of the [[Elizabethan period]], the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] also seems to have been influential \u2013 the historian Sir John Neale considered that the Duchy probably nominated at least one of the two members in each Parliament from 1584 to 1597 \u2013 but the influence of the Slingsbys was consolidated later. By the mid-18th century, ownership had passed to the [[Duke of Devonshire|Dukes of Devonshire]], who retained it until the Reform Act.\n\n===After the Great Reform Act===\nThe Reform Act extended Knaresborough's boundaries, bringing in the remainder of the town and coinciding with the boundaries established during the previous decade for policing purposes. This increased the population by nearly a third, to 6,253. Nevertheless, Knaresborough was one of the smaller boroughs to retain both its seats, and the registered electorate for the first reformed election was only 278. In subsequent years this fell further, though by the 1860s it had recovered to reach around 270 once more, and inevitably Knaresborough's representation was reduced to one MP under the [[Representation of the People Act 1867]]. The extension of the franchise by the same Act trebled the electorate.\n\nIn 1880, after a disputed election with suspicion of corrupt practices, the result was declared void and the constituency's right to representation suspended while a [[Royal Commission]] investigated; however, unlike the investigations in some other constituencies at around the same period, nothing too damning was uncovered, and a by-election to fill the vacancies was held in 1881. It proved, nevertheless, to be Knaresborough's last Parliament, for its electorate was still too low and the borough was abolished by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]. Its electors were transferred to the new [[Ripon (UK Parliament constituency)|Ripon]] division of the West Riding, a [[county constituency]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n===1553\u20131640===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second member\n|-\n| 1553 (Oct)|| [[Reginald Beseley]]|| [[Ralph Scrope]]<ref name=HoP1>{{cite book|title=The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558|year=1982|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/knaresborough|editor=Bindoff, S.
