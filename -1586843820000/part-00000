At its Kallang Road headquarters, services are provided from \"cradle to grave\", starting from birth registration to the issuance of identity cards and finally to the registering of deaths. At the various checkpoints of Singapore, ICA carries out its border control duties on both goods and people.\n{|\n|+Organisation Identity\n!Mission\n!'''We secure our borders and uphold our laws on immigration and national registration'''\n|-\n|Vision\n|Secure Borders, Safe Singapore\n|-\n|Values\n|Integrity, Commitment and Accountability\n|}\n\n===== Legal Powers =====\nICA officers primarily enforce the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/IA1959 Immigration Act (Cap 133)] and the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PA2007 Passports Act (Cap 220)]. Immigration officers are authorised to act on behalf of the Controller of Immigration (who is de facto the Commissioner of ICA). Officers may also be empowered as registration officers under the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/NRA1965 National Registration Act] (Cap 201).\n\nImmigration officers can prohibit entry to any person or class of persons for any reason related to the conditions of Singapore.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/travel/singapore-explains-why-many-vietnamese-women-have-been-denied-entry-49360.html|title=Singapore explains why many Vietnamese women have been denied entry|date=2015-07-26|work=Thanh Nien Daily|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>  Since 2018, immigration officers have limited policing powers within the checkpoints and in their immediate vicinity.<ref name=\":2\" /> Under the Integrated Checkpoints Command (ICC) concept, ICA is ultimately responsible for border security at Singapore's checkpoints.\n\nTo facilitate entry for [[Alien (law)|aliens]] arriving in Singapore, ICA issues a variety of passes. The most common is the social visit pass, which allows aliens to remain in country for a specified number of days. Other types of passes include student passes, dependent's passes, landing passes and special passes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/IA1959-RG1?DocDate=20171102|title=Immigration Regulations - Singapore Statutes Online|website=sso.agc.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n===== Contraband smuggling =====\n\nICA officers deployed as cargo and baggage examination officers are empowered under the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CA1960 Customs Act (Cap 70)] to search people and conveyances at all [[Port of entry|ports of entry]] in Singapore..

Prosecution officers work together with public prosecutors at the [[Attorney-General's Chambers]] to ensure that offenders are lawfully detained and given trial. Examples of common offences include the harbouring of immigration offenders, employing immigrants illegally or entering [[Marriage of convenience|marriages of convenience]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/till-prison-do-us-part-ica-officers-crack-one-of-the-largest-9949218|title=Till prison do us part: ICA officers crack one of the largest sham marriage cases|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Home owners who have been found guilty of renting their houses to immigration offenders and not carrying out one or more of the mandatory checks may be sentenced to a jail term, fine or both.\n\n===== Counter-terrorism =====\nICA is Singapore's first line of defence against potential terrorist threats by restricting the movement of security sensitive persons across international borders. After the escape of [[Mas Selamat Kastari|Mas Selamat]] in 2008, all checkpoints immediately stepped up security checks. During the lead-up to the 2018 [[2018 North Korea\u2013United States summit|Trump-Kim Summit]], Home Affairs Minister [[K. Shanmugam]] revealed that four people had been turned away at the checkpoints for terrorism related reasons.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/shanmugam-confident-security-in-place-for-trump-kim-summit-10415630|title=Shanmugam confident security in place for Trump-Kim summit|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nICA is part of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group within the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]'s [[Maritime Security Task Force]].

The Registry of Births and Deaths is also under the Citizen Services Centre.\n\nThe Permanent Resident Centre issues the blue NRIC for permanent residents as well as entry and re-entry permits.\n\nThe Visitor Services Centre issues visit pass extensions, visas and long term visit passes.\n\n=== Structure ===\nICA is divided into staff and line units. Staff units are involved in manpower, training and corporate services. Line units deal with the front-line operations of ICA. The senior executive management is called the Leadership Group (LG).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica-annual-2018-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20ANNUAL%202004.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2004|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n[[File:ICA Organisation Chart.jpg|alt=|center|thumb|986x986px|ICA organization chart.

Entry control began when the [[Crown colony|colonial government]] enacted the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance in 1915.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_si|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref>  In 1933, the Immigration Department was established to administer the Aliens Ordinance which placed quotas on newcomers entering Singapore. This effectively ended the freedom of travel in Singapore.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite book | title=Policing | publisher=Straits Times Press | author=Asad Latif | year=2017 | location=Singapore | pages=80\u201386 | isbn=978-981-47-4720-2}}</ref>\n\nOrdinance No. 5 of 1952 (The Immigration Ordinance) came into force on 1 August 1953, setting the foundation of immigration law in Singapore. The Immigration Ordinance was amended in 1959 after Singapore was granted sovereignty. The amendment gave Singaporeans the right of entry into the Colony.<ref name=\":4\" /> A new Immigration Depot was built at Telok Ayer Basin (East Wharf) while the head office was moved to Empress Place Building. Round-the-clock immigration clearance for [[Ship|vessels]] was started 1 June 1961.\n\nBirth registration started in 1872 which was then used for health and statistical purposes. However, by 1938 registration of births became compulsory by [[Law of Singapore|law]]. At the start of the second World War, the British introduced paper identity cards for the first time. This was suspended after the British surrender in 1945. The colonial government began issuing identity cards again in 1948 to counter the [[Communism|communist]] [[Malayan Emergency|insurgency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_nrd|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref> The desire to limit the entry of those who might have communist sympathies extended to the creation of a new Immigration Bill in 1950. When Singapore merged with Malaya, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form the Federation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, immigration came under the jurisdiction of the federal government and the Immigration Department became a federal agency in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\n==== Customs and Excise ====\nCustoms control was started when the Monopolies Department was founded in 1910 to collect excise duties on goods such as [[hard liquor]]s and [[opium]]. In 1916, the colonial government began taxing [[tobacco products]] on import to raise funds for the war effort.<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_ced|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>  In 1932, the Customs headquarters was shifted to the Customs House from Cecil Street.  The Excise Department replaced the Monopolies Department in 1936 and in 1938, the Excise Department was renamed the Department of Customs & Excise.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Post-independence (1965 - 2002) ===\n\n==== Stricter immigration control ====\nAfter Singapore separated from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, freedom of movement continued to exist between the two countries for a short period of time. Two [[border checkpoint]]s were gazetted for travel between the two countries. They were the [[Tanjong Pagar Railway Station]] and the [[Woodlands Checkpoint]]. Malaysians had to produce [[identity card]]s to be able to enter Singapore, until passports were required on both sides in July 1967. To travel to [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Singapore restricted passport and the Singapore Certificate of Identity was required. The Restricted Passport Centre was at [[South Quay]] and was moved to [[Outram Road]] in 1976, but closed on 31 December 1994.\n\nIn the 1970s, illegal immigration and over-stayers became a serious problem in Singapore. A task force was set up in 1974 to deal with the immigration problem. Laws were introduced that allowed immigration officers to seize and detain vessels and vehicles used to convey illegal immigrants. Those who harboured or employed illegal immigrants could also be punished. Data on foreigners' movements within Singapore were processed by the new Immigration Data Processing Centre.\n\nThe Last Port Clearance was introduced in 1980 to attract more passenger liners to Singapore.\n\nA passport office was opened at Joo Chiat Complex in 1984. This office issued both international and restricted passports and was closed in 1999. The Immigration Department moved its head office to the Pidemco Centre in June 1986. Immigration officers were also deployed to places such as [[India]] and Hong Kong to open consulates and [[high commission]]s. All passports issued by Singapore immigration after 1990 were computerised and machine-readable. The Entry and Exit Control Integrated System implemented in the early 1990s was a computerized immigration system that was used at checkpoints to speed up the processing of travellers. A hotline for information was set up in 1992, with restricted access to countries lifted.\n\n==== National Registration Office ====\nThe independence of Singapore in 1965 brought with it the National Registration Act in 1966. The distinctive pink identity cards were issued for the first time. The National Registration Office (NRO) replaced the former Registry of Persons.\n\nAt the time, the NRO and the [[Registry of Births and Deaths]] (RBD) came under the former Ministry of Labour. The Registry of Societies (ROS), Martial Arts Control Unit (MACU) came under the Ministry of Home Affairs. On 16 October 1981, the NRO, RBD, ROC, MACU and ROS merged to form the National Registration Department (NRD). The NRD consisted of four registries: the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Registry of Citizens, the Registry of Societies and the National Registration Office. The NRD was located at the [[Empress Place Building]] until 1986 when the building was transformed into the now defunct Empress Place Museum.\n\n==== Customs and Excise Department ====\n[[Tobacco]], [[liquor]], [[motor vehicle]]s and [[petroleum]] became restricted goods after Singapore was granted independence as a sovereign nation. The Customs and Excise Department ([[Singapore Customs|CED]]) cooperated closely with other government agencies such as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority and the Central Narcotics Bureau. When the [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]] was introduced in 1994, the work scope of the CED was expanded. The red and green channel customs system was implemented in 1991 at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] and at sea checkpoints.\n\nThe CED was located first at [[Cecil Street]] from 1910 till 1932 and later the White House at Maxwell Road from 1932 until 1989 when it moved to [[World Trade Centre, Singapore|World Trade Centre]] (now [[HarbourFront Centre]]).\n\n==== Singapore Immigration and Registration ====\nIn 1995, the Immigration Department was renamed Singapore Immigration. An immigration checkpoint was established at the Changi Ferry Terminal in May that year. There was a change in the passport application and collection in the 1990s, reducing the need for applicants to report to the building. To further reduce that need, applications by mail and internet were introduced and rebates were given for such applications.\n\nA new logo was launched by then-[[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] [[Wong Kan Seng]] at the [[foundation stone]] ceremony for the SI Building in 1995. The West Coast Barter Trade Centre closed in June 1995. Singaporeans were sent renewal forms for passports nine months before their passports expired.\n\nSI became an autonomous agency in 1996 as well as launching its first website. All immigration offices moved from the Pidemco Centre to the new building at Kallang Road in 1997. The Singapore Immigration and the National Registration Department merged to form Singapore Immigration & Registration in 1998. A new land checkpoint at Tuas was opened on 2 January.\n\n=== 21st century: Merger and integration (2003 - Present) ===\nOn 1 April 2003, SIR and the border control functions of CED were merged to form ICA in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] plots. The remaining functions of the CED was reorganised and renamed into Singapore Customs. ICA was to be part of the Home Team and a new, blue uniform was introduced to reflect that change. The first Commissioner of ICA was Lock Wai Han, who was in the Singapore Police Force before he oversaw the merger of the two agencies.\n\nICA's first major challenge came with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, testing the agency's ability to control Singapore's borders and screen passengers for contagious diseases.\n\nIn 2005, the then-Director CNB Eric Tan became the Commissioner of ICA.\n[[File:Customs' Joint Statement Signing on CBP Global Entry Program (15802840708).jpg|thumb|Clarence Yeo (right), then-Commissioner of ICA]]\nIn 2010, Deputy Commissioner Clarence Yeo became the Commissioner of ICA. \n\nOn 1 July 2011, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad]] (KTMB) and the Malaysian CIQ agencies were relocated to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint (WTCP). From then on, all arriving and departing trains terminated and started at WTCP. \n\n==== Integrated Checkpoints Command ====\nOn 2 January 2015, the Integrated Checkpoints Command concept was introduced. Under the Integrated Checkpoints Command, ICA checkpoints are split into three domains: Land, Sea and Air.  Each domain is headed by a Domain Commander who reports directly to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20AR%202015-FINAL-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ICA website|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  All Home Team agencies deployed at the checkpoints must report to the Domain Commander.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ica-launches-integrated-checkpoints-command-to-strengthen-coordination-among-agencies|title=ICA launches Integrated Checkpoints Command to strengthen coordination among agencies|last=migration|date=2015-01-02|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the amended National Registration Act empowered ICA officers to investigate and enforce offences under said Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica_annual_2016.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nOn 30 March 2017, it was announced that Woodlands Town Centre would be absorbed by the new Woodlands Checkpoint extension.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/woodlands-checkpoint-to-be-expanded-to-old-woodlands-town-centre|title=Woodlands Checkpoint to be extended to Old Woodlands Town Centre; two land plots to be acquired|last=hermesauto|date=2017-03-30|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2018 the amended Immigration Act was introduced. ICA officers would now perform roles as first responders. The amendment gave immigration officers the legal powers of police officers in relation to offences committed in the vicinity of checkpoints.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-ica-officers-get-enhanced-powers-to-conduct-searches-arrest-people-at|title=Parliament: ICA officers get enhanced powers to conduct searches, arrest people at checkpoints|last=hermesauto|date=2018-01-08|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 September 2018, Marvin Sim became the Commissioner of ICA.

The organisation's values remain unchanged.\n\n==== 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic ====\nIn January 2020, ICA became the first line of defence against the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] outbreak. The Singapore government immediately started border health control procedures, announcing travel bans on foreign visitors arriving from affected areas and temperature screening at checkpoints. Incoming travellers were issued health advisories. [[Quarantine|Stay-Home Notices]] (SHN)  and other enhanced measures were later added to contain the outbreak. \n\nStay-Home Notices were issued by ICA to travellers who were deemed to be \"at-risk\", such as those returning from affected areas.

It was first re-gazetted as an immigration depot in 2008 to clear departing lorries. in 2009, it was expanded to be able to clear motorcycles and arriving lorries. In 2013, the installation of car booths enabled OWC to clear all forms of arriving traffic.\n\n=== Air Domain ===\n*Airport Command\n**[[Singapore Changi Airport]]\n**[[Seletar Airport]]\n*Air Cargo Command\n**[[Airport Logistics Park|Airport Logistics Park of Singapore]]\n**Changi Airfreight Centre\n**[[Singapore Post|Parcel Post Section]]\n\n=== Sea Domain ===\n*Coastal Command\n**[[Singapore Cruise Centre]]\n**[[Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore]]\n**Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal\n**Changi Ferry Terminal\n**Changi Point Ferry Terminal\n**Jurong Fishery Port\n**[[Marina South Pier]]\n**West Coast Pier\n\nICA's Coastal Command is the largest command in ICA in terms of the number of checkpoints, stretching from the East to the West of the country.\n\n*Ports Command\n**[[Port of Singapore]]\n**Sembawang Port\n**[[Jurong Port]]\n**Keppel Distripark\n**Ports Command HQ\n\n==Personnel==\n\n=== Officers ===\n\nImmigration officers in ICA are considered [[Civil service|public servants]] by law and are part of the [[Singapore civil service|Singapore Civil Service]].\n\nImmigration officers in ICA are divided generally into Junior Officers and Senior Officers. Under the current [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] Services (HAS) (ICA) Unified scheme, new junior officers and senior officers join as Direct-Entry Sergeants and Direct-Entry Inspectors respectively. Direct-Entry Sergeants range from [[Institute of Technical Education|ITE]] graduates to polytechnic diploma holders.  Direct-Entry Inspectors must be graduates from a university accredited by its home country.  New Sergeants will become Primary Screening Officers, while Inspectors will become Team Leaders in their foundation posting. Regardless, all new officers will be posted to Tuas, Woodlands or Coastal Command.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_position|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a separate scheme for Management Executives who are deployed to the Services Centres. These officers are not considered immigration officers and do not don the blue uniform.\n\n=== Training ===\nAll ICA direct-entry Sergeants and Inspectors must attend and pass the ICA Basic Course which is held regularly at the [[Home Team Academy]]. The Basic Course includes lessons on document examination, basic unarmed combat and basic firearms training. The Basic Course lasts twenty weeks for Direct-Entry Inspectors <ref name=\":1\" /> and sixteen weeks for Direct-Entry Sergeants.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both courses are non-residential, are fully paid-for the duration of the courses and trainees will receive their substantive rank pay as well. In return, officers have to serve bonds of one to two years after graduation. Direct-Entry Sergeants also receive sign-on bonuses and retention pay-outs. To remain in service, officers will have to pass law examinations and a firearms shooting test.\n\nAdvanced courses are also conducted by ICA's Training Command. Direct Entry Sergeants are typically trained into specialists in different fields such as profiling, cargo examination and firearms shooting. Senior officers will first be exposed to ICA's ground operations before being sent to enforcement, service or staff units. Overseas postings at Singapore's consulates are also available. Furthermore, suitable officers at any level below that of Inspector may also secure scholarships and promotion into the rank of senior officers as part of the new unified scheme. \n\nSpecialised courses are conducted by different units in ICA, such as the Court Etiquette, Protocol and Procedures course conducted by ICA's Enforcement Division\n\n=== Ranks ===\n\nBefore the merger, both SIR and CED had their own distinct rank progression. However, they were similar in that there was a separate scheme for Senior and Junior officers. This continued to be the case post-merger until 2017.\n\nSince 2017, ICA officer ranks have fallen under the HAS (ICA) Unified scheme.<ref>https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica_annual_2017.pdf</ref> All Immigration Officers are placed under this scheme regardless of education level.\n\nAs part of the unified scheme, the ranks of Corporal and Staff Sergeant were collapsed into a single Sergeant rank with numerical increments. The ranks of Senior Checkpoint Inspector were removed and suitable Checkpoint Inspectors would be promoted to Inspectors instead. A new rank, Deputy Assistant Commissioner was added to provide more opportunities for officers at the [[middle management]] level.\n\nAt present, ranks in the ICA are modelled after those in the [[Singapore Police Force]] with some changes in insignia and naming (see table below).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_joinica|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}</ref> The words \"ICA Singapore\" can be seen below the rank insignia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Rank||Abbreviation\n!Badge of rank\n|-\n|Corporal (obsolete;

In practice, only qualified officers serving in protective security related roles are issued firearms.\n\nThe service firearm is the 5-shot [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver. Other equipment include [[handcuffs]], [[Plastic handcuffs|flexicuffs]] and [[Baton (law enforcement)|expandable batons]].\n\n=== Uniform ===\nIn the early 1970s, Singapore Immigration had a brown and cream uniform. The colour of the uniforms did not vary for more than 20 years, with only modifications in style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_faf|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> In 1997, uniforms in green and white were introduced.\n\nIn 1996, the Customs uniforms and accessories were changed to a shade of blue reminiscent of the current design.\n\nIn 2003, the uniform was updated to its current design. The uniform became Navy Blue, which was chosen to establish ICA as a member of the Home Team.\n\nThe uniform comes in different designs to suit the varied operating environments of ICA. The basic field uniform consists of a short-sleeved dress shirt and pants with a dress or [[Police duty belt|duty belt]] as appropriate. This uniform can be most often seen in the Land and Sea checkpoints. Senior officers typically wear a [[Safari jacket|bush jacket]] (for men) or a tunic (for women). A dress skirt is also available for female staff officer. Air Domain officers working at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] wear two-piece suits with ties to conform with airport guidelines, while sea-going clearance team officers wear long-sleeve coastal uniforms that resemble the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]]'s Number 4 uniform. Cargo examination officers are issued [[polo shirt]]s due to their warm operational environment.\n\nIn 2016, a distinctive ICC domain insignia was designed for each domain to serve as a symbol of common identity for all HT officers operating in the domain. The domain insignia also encourages a greater sense of belonging and closer collaboration among Home Team officers.<ref name=\"ica badges\" />\n\n=== Technology ===\nICA integrates [[information technology]] to streamline the entry and exit procedure at checkpoints. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and other registered travelers can use automated lanes called enhanced-Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS). The Biometric Identification of Motorbikers (BIKES) System at ICA's land checkpoints can be used by residents and work pass holders entering and leaving Singapore by motorcycles.\n\nIn 2007, the Central Identification and Registration Information System (CIRIS) was introduced. CIRIS was a digital database which replaced the National Identification Databank/Passport and Employment (NID/PEM) System that was in use.\n\nIn 2018, the ICA released the MyICA app which allowed citizens to process multiple transactions in a single payment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/myica-e-services-web-portal-passport-entry-visa-applications-10482494|title=ICA launches web portal for passport, entry visa applications|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAt ICA's 2019 Workplan Seminar, the New Clearance Concept was introduced. Foreign visitors would fill in an electronic disembarkation card or e-DE card. They would be then allowed to use ICA's automated immigration gates upon arrival.  Singaporeans will no longer have to present their passports or their thumbprints for immigration clearance at the automated gates. Instead, facial recognition technology will be utilised.<ref>{{Citation|last=ICAOutreach|title=New Clearance Concept|date=2019-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq803fcfU5s|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, ICA announced the cessation of physical embarkation cards. Arriving travellers would be directed to use the SG Arrival Card, an electronic embarkation card with apps in [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)|Apple's App Store]]. In view of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore|COVID-19 pandemic]], all travellers entering Singapore from 27 March 2020 were to fill in electronic health declaration cards integrated into the SG Arrival Card website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/all-travellers-arriving-in-singapore-from-27-march-2020-0900-hours-must-submit-health-declaration-via-the-sg-arrival-card-e-service|title=ICA {{!}} All Travellers Arriving In Singapore From 27 March 2020, 0900 Hours, Must Submit Health Declaration Via The SG Arrival Card E-Service|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Biometric verification ====\nICA has progressively implemented the use of biometric verification to improve security at its checkpoints. ICA employs the use of biometry to find persons of interests and has deployed a suitcase sized facial recognition system to different checkpoints <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.htx.gov.sg/news/featured-news-identifying-a-face-amongst-thousands-at-our-borders|title=[Featured News] Identifying a Face amongst Thousands at Our Borders|website=HTX|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, ICA implemented the Checkpoint Access Cards. which used fingerprint data to facilitate entry. The system was called Immigration Automated Clearance System or IACS. Later in 2006, the system was upgraded to the Enhanced Automated Immigration Clearance System (EIACS).\n\nIn 2005, the Biometric Database for Immigration Clearance (BDIC) was introduced. This was a biometric database that contained all the biometric records of immigration offenders and police criminal records. This was used to supplement text-based blacklist screening and prevented undesirable travellers from entering Singapore with a fraudulent passport.\n\nIn October 2006, ICA began issuing biometric passports to Singapore citizens. \n\nIn October 2017, ICA started issuance of new biometric passports that comes with additional security features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-design-for-singapore-passport-with-additional-security-features-ica|title=New design for Singapore passport with additional security features: ICA|last=hermesauto|date=2017-10-26|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}</ref> This marked the second series of biometrics passports issued by Singapore.

At its Kallang Road headquarters, services are provided from \"cradle to grave\", starting from birth registration to the issuance of identity cards and finally to the registering of deaths. At the various checkpoints of Singapore, ICA carries out its border control duties on both goods and people.\n{|\n|+Organisation Identity\n!Mission\n!'''We secure our borders and uphold our laws on immigration and national registration'''\n|-\n|Vision\n|Secure Borders, Safe Singapore\n|-\n|Values\n|Integrity, Commitment and Accountability\n|}\n\n===== Legal Powers =====\nICA officers primarily enforce the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/IA1959 Immigration Act (Cap 133)] and the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PA2007 Passports Act (Cap 220)]. Immigration officers are authorised to act on behalf of the Controller of Immigration (who is de facto the Commissioner of ICA). Officers may also be empowered as registration officers under the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/NRA1965 National Registration Act] (Cap 201).\n\nImmigration officers can prohibit entry to any person or class of persons for any reason related to the conditions of Singapore.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/travel/singapore-explains-why-many-vietnamese-women-have-been-denied-entry-49360.html|title=Singapore explains why many Vietnamese women have been denied entry|date=2015-07-26|work=Thanh Nien Daily|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>  Since 2018, immigration officers have limited policing powers within the checkpoints and in their immediate vicinity.<ref name=\":2\" /> Under the Integrated Checkpoints Command (ICC) concept, ICA is ultimately responsible for border security at Singapore's checkpoints.\n\nTo facilitate entry for [[Alien (law)|aliens]] arriving in Singapore, ICA issues a variety of passes.

Examples of common offences include the harbouring of immigration offenders, employing immigrants illegally or entering [[Marriage of convenience|marriages of convenience]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/till-prison-do-us-part-ica-officers-crack-one-of-the-largest-9949218|title=Till prison do us part: ICA officers crack one of the largest sham marriage cases|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Home owners who have been found guilty of renting their houses to immigration offenders and not carrying out one or more of the mandatory checks may be sentenced to a jail term, fine or both.\n\n===== Counter-terrorism =====\nICA is Singapore's first line of defence against potential terrorist threats by restricting the movement of security sensitive persons across international borders. After the escape of [[Mas Selamat Kastari|Mas Selamat]] in 2008, all checkpoints immediately stepped up security checks. During the lead-up to the 2018 [[2018 North Korea\u2013United States summit|Trump-Kim Summit]], Home Affairs Minister [[K.

The Registry of Births and Deaths is also under the Citizen Services Centre.\n\nThe Permanent Resident Centre issues the blue NRIC for permanent residents as well as entry and re-entry permits.\n\nThe Visitor Services Centre issues visit pass extensions, visas and long term visit passes.\n\n=== Structure ===\nICA is divided into staff and line units. Staff units are involved in manpower, training and corporate services. Line units deal with the front-line operations of ICA.

Entry control began when the [[Crown colony|colonial government]] enacted the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance in 1915.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_si|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref>  In 1933, the Immigration Department was established to administer the Aliens Ordinance which placed quotas on newcomers entering Singapore. This effectively ended the freedom of travel in Singapore.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite book | title=Policing | publisher=Straits Times Press | author=Asad Latif | year=2017 | location=Singapore | pages=80\u201386 | isbn=978-981-47-4720-2}}</ref>\n\nOrdinance No. 5 of 1952 (The Immigration Ordinance) came into force on 1 August 1953, setting the foundation of immigration law in Singapore. The Immigration Ordinance was amended in 1959 after Singapore was granted sovereignty. The amendment gave Singaporeans the right of entry into the Colony.<ref name=\":4\" /> A new Immigration Depot was built at Telok Ayer Basin (East Wharf) while the head office was moved to Empress Place Building. Round-the-clock immigration clearance for [[Ship|vessels]] was started 1 June 1961.\n\nBirth registration started in 1872 which was then used for health and statistical purposes. However, by 1938 registration of births became compulsory by [[Law of Singapore|law]]. At the start of the second World War, the British introduced paper identity cards for the first time. This was suspended after the British surrender in 1945. The colonial government began issuing identity cards again in 1948 to counter the [[Communism|communist]] [[Malayan Emergency|insurgency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_nrd|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref> The desire to limit the entry of those who might have communist sympathies extended to the creation of a new Immigration Bill in 1950. When Singapore merged with Malaya, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form the Federation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, immigration came under the jurisdiction of the federal government and the Immigration Department became a federal agency in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\n==== Customs and Excise ====\nCustoms control was started when the Monopolies Department was founded in 1910 to collect excise duties on goods such as [[hard liquor]]s and [[opium]]. In 1916, the colonial government began taxing [[tobacco products]] on import to raise funds for the war effort.<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_ced|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>  In 1932, the Customs headquarters was shifted to the Customs House from Cecil Street.  The Excise Department replaced the Monopolies Department in 1936 and in 1938, the Excise Department was renamed the Department of Customs & Excise.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Post-independence (1965 - 2002) ===\n\n==== Stricter immigration control ====\nAfter Singapore separated from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, freedom of movement continued to exist between the two countries for a short period of time. Two [[border checkpoint]]s were gazetted for travel between the two countries. They were the [[Tanjong Pagar Railway Station]] and the [[Woodlands Checkpoint]]. Malaysians had to produce [[identity card]]s to be able to enter Singapore, until passports were required on both sides in July 1967. To travel to [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Singapore restricted passport and the Singapore Certificate of Identity was required. The Restricted Passport Centre was at [[South Quay]] and was moved to [[Outram Road]] in 1976, but closed on 31 December 1994.\n\nIn the 1970s, illegal immigration and over-stayers became a serious problem in Singapore. A task force was set up in 1974 to deal with the immigration problem. Laws were introduced that allowed immigration officers to seize and detain vessels and vehicles used to convey illegal immigrants. Those who harboured or employed illegal immigrants could also be punished. Data on foreigners' movements within Singapore were processed by the new Immigration Data Processing Centre.\n\nThe Last Port Clearance was introduced in 1980 to attract more passenger liners to Singapore.\n\nA passport office was opened at Joo Chiat Complex in 1984. This office issued both international and restricted passports and was closed in 1999. The Immigration Department moved its head office to the Pidemco Centre in June 1986. Immigration officers were also deployed to places such as [[India]] and Hong Kong to open consulates and [[high commission]]s. All passports issued by Singapore immigration after 1990 were computerised and machine-readable. The Entry and Exit Control Integrated System implemented in the early 1990s was a computerized immigration system that was used at checkpoints to speed up the processing of travellers. A hotline for information was set up in 1992, with restricted access to countries lifted.\n\n==== National Registration Office ====\nThe independence of Singapore in 1965 brought with it the National Registration Act in 1966. The distinctive pink identity cards were issued for the first time. The National Registration Office (NRO) replaced the former Registry of Persons.\n\nAt the time, the NRO and the [[Registry of Births and Deaths]] (RBD) came under the former Ministry of Labour. The Registry of Societies (ROS), Martial Arts Control Unit (MACU) came under the Ministry of Home Affairs. On 16 October 1981, the NRO, RBD, ROC, MACU and ROS merged to form the National Registration Department (NRD). The NRD consisted of four registries: the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Registry of Citizens, the Registry of Societies and the National Registration Office. The NRD was located at the [[Empress Place Building]] until 1986 when the building was transformed into the now defunct Empress Place Museum.\n\n==== Customs and Excise Department ====\n[[Tobacco]], [[liquor]], [[motor vehicle]]s and [[petroleum]] became restricted goods after Singapore was granted independence as a sovereign nation. The Customs and Excise Department ([[Singapore Customs|CED]]) cooperated closely with other government agencies such as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority and the Central Narcotics Bureau. When the [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]] was introduced in 1994, the work scope of the CED was expanded. The red and green channel customs system was implemented in 1991 at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] and at sea checkpoints.\n\nThe CED was located first at [[Cecil Street]] from 1910 till 1932 and later the White House at Maxwell Road from 1932 until 1989 when it moved to [[World Trade Centre, Singapore|World Trade Centre]] (now [[HarbourFront Centre]]).\n\n==== Singapore Immigration and Registration ====\nIn 1995, the Immigration Department was renamed Singapore Immigration. An immigration checkpoint was established at the Changi Ferry Terminal in May that year. There was a change in the passport application and collection in the 1990s, reducing the need for applicants to report to the building. To further reduce that need, applications by mail and internet were introduced and rebates were given for such applications.\n\nA new logo was launched by then-[[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] [[Wong Kan Seng]] at the [[foundation stone]] ceremony for the SI Building in 1995. The West Coast Barter Trade Centre closed in June 1995. Singaporeans were sent renewal forms for passports nine months before their passports expired.\n\nSI became an autonomous agency in 1996 as well as launching its first website. All immigration offices moved from the Pidemco Centre to the new building at Kallang Road in 1997. The Singapore Immigration and the National Registration Department merged to form Singapore Immigration & Registration in 1998. A new land checkpoint at Tuas was opened on 2 January.\n\n=== 21st century: Merger and integration (2003 - Present) ===\nOn 1 April 2003, SIR and the border control functions of CED were merged to form ICA in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] plots. The remaining functions of the CED was reorganised and renamed into Singapore Customs. ICA was to be part of the Home Team and a new, blue uniform was introduced to reflect that change. The first Commissioner of ICA was Lock Wai Han, who was in the Singapore Police Force before he oversaw the merger of the two agencies.\n\nICA's first major challenge came with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, testing the agency's ability to control Singapore's borders and screen passengers for contagious diseases.\n\nIn 2005, the then-Director CNB Eric Tan became the Commissioner of ICA.\n[[File:Customs' Joint Statement Signing on CBP Global Entry Program (15802840708).jpg|thumb|Clarence Yeo (right), then-Commissioner of ICA]]\nIn 2010, Deputy Commissioner Clarence Yeo became the Commissioner of ICA. \n\nOn 1 July 2011, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad]] (KTMB) and the Malaysian CIQ agencies were relocated to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint (WTCP). From then on, all arriving and departing trains terminated and started at WTCP. \n\n==== Integrated Checkpoints Command ====\nOn 2 January 2015, the Integrated Checkpoints Command concept was introduced. Under the Integrated Checkpoints Command, ICA checkpoints are split into three domains: Land, Sea and Air.  Each domain is headed by a Domain Commander who reports directly to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20AR%202015-FINAL-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ICA website|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  All Home Team agencies deployed at the checkpoints must report to the Domain Commander.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ica-launches-integrated-checkpoints-command-to-strengthen-coordination-among-agencies|title=ICA launches Integrated Checkpoints Command to strengthen coordination among agencies|last=migration|date=2015-01-02|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the amended National Registration Act empowered ICA officers to investigate and enforce offences under said Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica_annual_2016.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nOn 30 March 2017, it was announced that Woodlands Town Centre would be absorbed by the new Woodlands Checkpoint extension.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/woodlands-checkpoint-to-be-expanded-to-old-woodlands-town-centre|title=Woodlands Checkpoint to be extended to Old Woodlands Town Centre; two land plots to be acquired|last=hermesauto|date=2017-03-30|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2018 the amended Immigration Act was introduced.

The organisation's values remain unchanged.\n\n==== 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic ====\nIn January 2020, ICA became the first line of defence against the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] outbreak. The Singapore government immediately started border health control procedures, announcing travel bans on foreign visitors arriving from affected areas and temperature screening at checkpoints. Incoming travellers were issued health advisories. [[Quarantine|Stay-Home Notices]] (SHN)  and other enhanced measures were later added to contain the outbreak. \n\nStay-Home Notices were issued by ICA to travellers who were deemed to be \"at-risk\", such as those returning from affected areas. Such travellers were not allowed to leave their house for a 14-day period, starting from the day of arrival. A man who had been issued a SHN posted on [[Facebook|social media]] a photo of him eating [[Bak kut teh|Bak Kut Teh]], a popular meat soup dish in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/03/shn-eat-bak-kut-teh-kena-warning/|title=S\u2019porean man who breached Stay-Home Notice for bak kut teh receives warning from ICA|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> ICA subsequently said that the man would be referred to the Attorney-General Chambers for further action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/follow-up-response-to-media-queries-on-man-breaching-shn-requirements-to-eat-bak-kut-teh|title=ICA {{!}} Follow-up Response To Media Queries On Man Breaching SHN Requirements To Eat Bak Kut Teh|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nStarting from 23rd March 2020, no foreign visitors were allowed transit or entry into Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-all-short-term-visitors-barred-from-entering-and-transiting-in|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nFrom March 27 2020, Stay-Home Notices were issued by email. \n\nOn 28 March, entry requirements were extended to all Long Term Pass holders.

It was first re-gazetted as an immigration depot in 2008 to clear departing lorries. in 2009, it was expanded to be able to clear motorcycles and arriving lorries. In 2013, the installation of car booths enabled OWC to clear all forms of arriving traffic.\n\n=== Air Domain ===\n*Airport Command\n**[[Singapore Changi Airport]]\n**[[Seletar Airport]]\n*Air Cargo Command\n**[[Airport Logistics Park|Airport Logistics Park of Singapore]]\n**Changi Airfreight Centre\n**[[Singapore Post|Parcel Post Section]]\n\n=== Sea Domain ===\n*Coastal Command\n**[[Singapore Cruise Centre]]\n**[[Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore]]\n**Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal\n**Changi Ferry Terminal\n**Changi Point Ferry Terminal\n**Jurong Fishery Port\n**[[Marina South Pier]]\n**West Coast Pier\n\nICA's Coastal Command is the largest command in ICA in terms of the number of checkpoints, stretching from the East to the West of the country.\n\n*Ports Command\n**[[Port of Singapore]]\n**Sembawang Port\n**[[Jurong Port]]\n**Keppel Distripark\n**Ports Command HQ\n\n==Personnel==\n\n=== Officers ===\n\nImmigration officers in ICA are considered [[Civil service|public servants]] by law and are part of the [[Singapore civil service|Singapore Civil Service]].\n\nImmigration officers in ICA are divided generally into Junior Officers and Senior Officers. Under the current [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] Services (HAS) (ICA) Unified scheme, new junior officers and senior officers join as Direct-Entry Sergeants and Direct-Entry Inspectors respectively. Direct-Entry Sergeants range from [[Institute of Technical Education|ITE]] graduates to polytechnic diploma holders.  Direct-Entry Inspectors must be graduates from a university accredited by its home country.  New Sergeants will become Primary Screening Officers, while Inspectors will become Team Leaders in their foundation posting. Regardless, all new officers will be posted to Tuas, Woodlands or Coastal Command.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_position|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a separate scheme for Management Executives who are deployed to the Services Centres. These officers are not considered immigration officers and do not don the blue uniform.\n\n=== Training ===\nAll ICA direct-entry Sergeants and Inspectors must attend and pass the ICA Basic Course which is held regularly at the [[Home Team Academy]]. The Basic Course includes lessons on document examination, basic unarmed combat and basic firearms training. The Basic Course lasts twenty weeks for Direct-Entry Inspectors <ref name=\":1\" /> and sixteen weeks for Direct-Entry Sergeants.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both courses are non-residential, are fully paid-for the duration of the courses and trainees will receive their substantive rank pay as well. In return, officers have to serve bonds of one to two years after graduation. Direct-Entry Sergeants also receive sign-on bonuses and retention pay-outs. To remain in service, officers will have to pass law examinations and a firearms shooting test.\n\nAdvanced courses are also conducted by ICA's Training Command. Direct Entry Sergeants are typically trained into specialists in different fields such as profiling, cargo examination and firearms shooting. Senior officers will first be exposed to ICA's ground operations before being sent to enforcement, service or staff units. Overseas postings at Singapore's consulates are also available. Furthermore, suitable officers at any level below that of Inspector may also secure scholarships and promotion into the rank of senior officers as part of the new unified scheme. \n\nSpecialised courses are conducted by different units in ICA, such as the Court Etiquette, Protocol and Procedures course conducted by ICA's Enforcement Division\n\n=== Ranks ===\n\nBefore the merger, both SIR and CED had their own distinct rank progression. However, they were similar in that there was a separate scheme for Senior and Junior officers. This continued to be the case post-merger until 2017.\n\nSince 2017, ICA officer ranks have fallen under the HAS (ICA) Unified scheme.<ref>https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica_annual_2017.pdf</ref> All Immigration Officers are placed under this scheme regardless of education level.\n\nAs part of the unified scheme, the ranks of Corporal and Staff Sergeant were collapsed into a single Sergeant rank with numerical increments. The ranks of Senior Checkpoint Inspector were removed and suitable Checkpoint Inspectors would be promoted to Inspectors instead. A new rank, Deputy Assistant Commissioner was added to provide more opportunities for officers at the [[middle management]] level.\n\nAt present, ranks in the ICA are modelled after those in the [[Singapore Police Force]] with some changes in insignia and naming (see table below).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_joinica|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}</ref> The words \"ICA Singapore\" can be seen below the rank insignia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Rank||Abbreviation\n!Badge of rank\n|-\n|Corporal (obsolete;

In practice, only qualified officers serving in protective security related roles are issued firearms.\n\nThe service firearm is the 5-shot [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver. Other equipment include [[handcuffs]], [[Plastic handcuffs|flexicuffs]] and [[Baton (law enforcement)|expandable batons]].\n\n=== Uniform ===\nIn the early 1970s, Singapore Immigration had a brown and cream uniform. The colour of the uniforms did not vary for more than 20 years, with only modifications in style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_faf|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> In 1997, uniforms in green and white were introduced.\n\nIn 1996, the Customs uniforms and accessories were changed to a shade of blue reminiscent of the current design.\n\nIn 2003, the uniform was updated to its current design. The uniform became Navy Blue, which was chosen to establish ICA as a member of the Home Team.\n\nThe uniform comes in different designs to suit the varied operating environments of ICA. The basic field uniform consists of a short-sleeved dress shirt and pants with a dress or [[Police duty belt|duty belt]] as appropriate. This uniform can be most often seen in the Land and Sea checkpoints. Senior officers typically wear a [[Safari jacket|bush jacket]] (for men) or a tunic (for women). A dress skirt is also available for female staff officer. Air Domain officers working at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] wear two-piece suits with ties to conform with airport guidelines, while sea-going clearance team officers wear long-sleeve coastal uniforms that resemble the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]]'s Number 4 uniform. Cargo examination officers are issued [[polo shirt]]s due to their warm operational environment.\n\nIn 2016, a distinctive ICC domain insignia was designed for each domain to serve as a symbol of common identity for all HT officers operating in the domain. The domain insignia also encourages a greater sense of belonging and closer collaboration among Home Team officers.<ref name=\"ica badges\" />\n\n=== Technology ===\nICA integrates [[information technology]] to streamline the entry and exit procedure at checkpoints. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and other registered travelers can use automated lanes called enhanced-Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS). The Biometric Identification of Motorbikers (BIKES) System at ICA's land checkpoints can be used by residents and work pass holders entering and leaving Singapore by motorcycles.\n\nIn 2007, the Central Identification and Registration Information System (CIRIS) was introduced. CIRIS was a digital database which replaced the National Identification Databank/Passport and Employment (NID/PEM) System that was in use.\n\nIn 2018, the ICA released the MyICA app which allowed citizens to process multiple transactions in a single payment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/myica-e-services-web-portal-passport-entry-visa-applications-10482494|title=ICA launches web portal for passport, entry visa applications|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAt ICA's 2019 Workplan Seminar, the New Clearance Concept was introduced. Foreign visitors would fill in an electronic disembarkation card or e-DE card. They would be then allowed to use ICA's automated immigration gates upon arrival.  Singaporeans will no longer have to present their passports or their thumbprints for immigration clearance at the automated gates. Instead, facial recognition technology will be utilised.<ref>{{Citation|last=ICAOutreach|title=New Clearance Concept|date=2019-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq803fcfU5s|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, ICA announced the cessation of physical embarkation cards. Arriving travellers would be directed to use the SG Arrival Card, an electronic embarkation card with apps in [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)|Apple's App Store]]. In view of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore|COVID-19 pandemic]], all travellers entering Singapore from 27 March 2020 were to fill in electronic health declaration cards integrated into the SG Arrival Card website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/all-travellers-arriving-in-singapore-from-27-march-2020-0900-hours-must-submit-health-declaration-via-the-sg-arrival-card-e-service|title=ICA {{!}} All Travellers Arriving In Singapore From 27 March 2020, 0900 Hours, Must Submit Health Declaration Via The SG Arrival Card E-Service|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Biometric verification ====\nICA has progressively implemented the use of biometric verification to improve security at its checkpoints. ICA employs the use of biometry to find persons of interests and has deployed a suitcase sized facial recognition system to different checkpoints <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.htx.gov.sg/news/featured-news-identifying-a-face-amongst-thousands-at-our-borders|title=[Featured News] Identifying a Face amongst Thousands at Our Borders|website=HTX|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, ICA implemented the Checkpoint Access Cards. which used fingerprint data to facilitate entry. The system was called Immigration Automated Clearance System or IACS. Later in 2006, the system was upgraded to the Enhanced Automated Immigration Clearance System (EIACS).\n\nIn 2005, the Biometric Database for Immigration Clearance (BDIC) was introduced. This was a biometric database that contained all the biometric records of immigration offenders and police criminal records. This was used to supplement text-based blacklist screening and prevented undesirable travellers from entering Singapore with a fraudulent passport.\n\nIn October 2006, ICA began issuing biometric passports to Singapore citizens. \n\nIn October 2017, ICA started issuance of new biometric passports that comes with additional security features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-design-for-singapore-passport-with-additional-security-features-ica|title=New design for Singapore passport with additional security features: ICA|last=hermesauto|date=2017-10-26|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}</ref> This marked the second series of biometrics passports issued by Singapore.

They are picked up by Tyrus and Victor at a truck stop. Mike arranges to have the attackers' trucks and bodies removed, and gives Jimmy a cover story about his car breaking down a few miles from the pickup point and walking all night before finding a truck stop. \n\nJimmy turns the money to the bail office to release Lalo, which draws the district attorney's attention. Jimmy goes to meet Lalo when he is released, giving him the cover story, and warns him about the attention on his alias. Lalo assures Jimmy he will be in Mexico soon enough.  Jimmy returns home, where he gives the same story to Kim as she tends to his wounds. He scolds her about seeing Lalo. When she checks on the fee Jimmy got, she finds the bullet-ridden mug she had given Jimmy. Meanwhile, Mike reports to Gus on the attack, who affirms it was arranged by Juan Bolsa, attempting to protect Gus's business. Mike warns Gus that Nacho wants out of the operation, but Gus refuses.\n\nThe next day, Jimmy is still shaken by events and Kim calls in sick to help care for him. She knows his cover story was false but won't judge him if he comes clean, but he eludes her as he runs off to handle a client at the courthouse. She tries to do work at S&C but makes the decision to quit her job, otherwise keeping her ''pro bono'' work. Jimmy later meets with Mike, struggling with the trauma. Mike tells him that these bad choices they have made will lead to the same roads, providing little solace.\n\nAfter seeing Hector, Lalo has Nacho take him to the same dropoff spot he gave Jimmy near the Mexico border, unaware they are tracked by Victor. There, Lalo gets an idea and has Nacho follow the road back to Albuquerque, where they find Jimmy's shot-up car.\n\nKim tells Jimmy about quitting S&C that evening, which Jimmy scolds her for, just as both Jimmy's cell rings and a knock is at the door. Jimmy finds Mike on the cell line, telling him to leave the phone on and out of sight, while Kim tells Jimmy to come to the door. There, Lalo comes in, settles down, and asks Jimmy to repeat his cover story several times, while Mike listens and watches from a distance with a sniper rifle trained on Lalo. Each time Lalo asks, Jimmy's version changes. Eventually, Lalo reveals he saw the shot-up car, but Kim steps in and tells Lalo that Jimmy was just doing his job as his lawyer, and the car likely shot at by passersby. Lalo quietly leaves, and tells Nacho to drive all the way into Mexico.\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\n\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.amc.com/shows/better-call-saul/season-5/episode-09-bad-choice-road \"Bad Choice Road\"] at [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]\n*{{IMDb episode|8772220}}\n\n{{Better Call Saul}}\n\n[[Category:Better Call Saul (season 5) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title          = Bad Choice \n| series         = [[Better Call Saul]]\n| image          = \n| caption        = \n| season         = 5\n| episode        = 9\n| editor         = \n| airdate        = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n| writer         = [[Thomas Schnauz]]\n| director       = [[Thomas Schnauz]]\n| length         = 53 minutes\n| guests         = \n| music          = \n| prev           = [[Bagman (Better Call Saul)|Bagman]]\n| next           = [[Something Unforgivable]]\n| episode_list   = List of Better Call Saul episodes\n| season_article = Better Call Saul (season 5)\n}}\n\n\"'''Bad Choice Road'''\" is the ninth episode of the [[Better Call Saul (season 5)|fifth season]] of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', the spinoff series of ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay.

Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world.

Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]].

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships.

An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness.

Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City.

In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008).

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested.

Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in...

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away.

The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt [[Charcoal lighter fluid|lighter fluid]] into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, [[siren (alarm)|sirens]] were heard and fire trucks arrived.

[[Bob Kohler]], who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: \"I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because everybody else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill.\"<ref>Carter, p. 175.</ref> With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, \"Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon.\" His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, \"All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously.\"<ref>Carter, p. 174.</ref>\n\nThe TPF formed a [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] and attempted to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police.

All three papers covered the riots; the ''Daily News'' placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\".<ref name=\"teal4\"/> All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn.

Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. [[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out.

The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing.

One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF).

Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group.

The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot.

Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.<ref>Clendinen, pp. 62\u201364.</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&nbsp;city blocks.<ref name=\"fosburgh\">Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008.

The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay.

Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world.

Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R.

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships.

[[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles.<ref>Adam, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.<ref>Adam, pp. 63\u201364.</ref><ref>Marcus, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.<ref>Marcus, p. 21.</ref> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<ref>Gallo, pp. 1\u20135, 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the [[Alcohol laws of New York|New York State Liquor Authority]] (SLA). While no laws prohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving and revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become \"disorderly\".<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/><ref>Carter, p. 48.</ref> Despite the high population of gay men and lesbians who called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars, where they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested. In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008).

The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called \"Lily Law\", \"Alice Blue Gown\", or \"Betty Badge\"<ref name=\"duberman187\">Duberman, p. 187.</ref>), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private \"bottle club\", but rarely signed their real names.<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or [[black light]]s. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching.<ref name=\"duberman187\"/> In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by \"queens\"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go.<ref name=\"duberman189\">Duberman, p. 189.</ref> Only a few cross-dressers, or men in full [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], were allowed in by the bouncers.

Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their [[Conscription|draft card]]s as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested.<ref name=\"duberman192-193\"/> The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars\u2014including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots<ref>Carter, pp. 124\u2013125.</ref>\u2014and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.<ref name=\"teal4\"/><ref name=\"nyt62969\">{{Cite news |last=Eskow |first=Dennis |title=4 Policemen Hurt in 'Village' Raid: Melee Near Sheridan Square Follows Action at Bar |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DE5DB1639EF3BBC4151DFB0668382679EDE |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 29, 1969 |page=33}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Riots==\n\n===Police raid===\n[[File:Layout of the Stonewall Inn 1969-en.svg|thumb|alt=A color digital illustration of the station layout of the Stonewall Inn in 1969: a rectangular building with the front along Christopher Street; the entrance opens to a lobby where patrons could go to the larger part of the bar to the right that also featured a larger dance floor.

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"carter142\"/> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as \"a typical New York butch\" and \"a dyke\u2013stone butch\", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]] for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.<ref>Duberman, p. 196.</ref> Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown ([[Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie]] has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary<ref name=Chu>{{cite web|last=Chu |first=Grace |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/77167-an-interview-with-lesbian-stonewall-veteran-storm-delarverie|title=An interview with lesbian Stonewall veteran Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie |publisher=AfterEllen.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600&nbsp;people, grabbed several people, including folk singer and mentor of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]]\u2014who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in...

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away.

All three papers covered the riots; the ''Daily News'' placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\".<ref name=\"teal4\"/> All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. [[Graffiti]] appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \"Drag power\", \"They invaded our rights\", \"Support gay power\", and \"Legalize gay bars\", along with accusations of police looting, and\u2014regarding the status of the bar\u2014\"We are open.\"<ref name=\"teal4\">Teal, p. 4.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EFDB1E3AEE34BC4850DFB0668382679EDE |title=Police Again Rout Village Youths: Outbreak by 400 Follows a Near-Riot Over Raid |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 30, 1969 |page=22}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants remember differently which night was more frantic or violent.

More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth [[Organization of the New York City Police Department#Police precincts|Precinct]]s, but after 2:00&nbsp;a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as \"sissies\" or \"swishes\", the crowd surged to recapture them.<ref>Carter, p. 191.</ref> Street battling ensued again until 4:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"duberman204-205\">Duberman, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref>\n\n[[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet and longtime Greenwich Village resident [[Allen Ginsberg]] lived on Christopher Street, and happened upon the jubilant chaos. After he learned of the riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, \"Gay power! Isn't that great!... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves\", and visited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, \"You know, the guys there were so beautiful\u2014they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10&nbsp;years ago.\"<ref>Teal, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence===\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. [[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.<ref>Carter, p. 252.</ref>\n\n===Gay Pride===\n{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in U.S. history.<ref>Duberman, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref><ref>De la Croix, Sukie (2007).

The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.<ref>Clendinen, pp. 62\u201364.</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&nbsp;city blocks.<ref name=\"fosburgh\">Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

He states that he then left for India and arrived at the Indus river on 12 September 1333; however, although he does not specify exact dates, the description of his complex itinerary and the clues in the text to the chronology suggest that this journey to India lasted around three years. He must have therefore either left Mecca two years earlier than stated or arrived in India two years later.

One of the first things he noted was that Muslims referred to the city as \"Zaitun\" (meaning [[olive]]), but Ibn Battuta could not find any olives anywhere. He mentioned local artists and their mastery in making portraits of newly arrived foreigners; these were for security purposes. Ibn Battuta praised the craftsmen and their [[silk]] and [[porcelain]]; as well as fruits such as plums and watermelons and the advantages of paper money.{{sfn|Dunn|2005|p = 258}}\n\nHe described the manufacturing process of large ships in the city of Quanzhou.<ref>\u062a\u062d\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0639\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0641\u0627\u0631,\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0628\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0629,\u0635 398</ref> He also mentioned Chinese cuisine and its usage of animals such as frogs, pigs and even dogs which were sold in the markets, and noted that the chickens in China were larger than those in the west.

He states that he then left for India and arrived at the Indus river on 12 September 1333; however, although he does not specify exact dates, the description of his complex itinerary and the clues in the text to the chronology suggest that this journey to India lasted around three years.

He further wrote that the authority of the Sultan extended from [[Malindi]] in the north to [[Inhambane]] in the south and was particularly impressed by the planning of the city, believing it to be the reason for Kilwa's success along the coast.

to seek employment with the Muslim [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]].

From there he crossed the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to Palestine and then travelled north again through some of the towns that he had visited in 1326. From the Syrian port of [[Latakia]], a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] ship took him (and his companions) to [[Alanya]] on the southern coast of modern-day Turkey.{{sfn|Gibb|1962|pp=413\u201316 Vol. 2}}\n\nHe then journeyed westwards along the coast to the port of [[Antalya]].{{sfn|Gibb|1962|p=417 Vol. 2}} In the town he met members of one of the semi-religious ''fityan'' associations.{{sfn|Gibb|1962|pp=418\u201316 Vol. 2}} These were a feature of most Anatolian towns in the 13th and 14th centuries. The members were young artisans and had at their head a leader with the title of ''Akhis''.{{sfn|Taeschner|1986}} The associations specialised in welcoming travellers. Ibn Battuta was very impressed with the hospitality that he received and would later stay in their hospices in more than 25 towns in Anatolia.{{sfn|Dunn|2005|p=146}} From Antalya Ibn Battuta headed inland to [[E\u011firdir]] which was the capital of the [[Hamidids]].

Ibn Battuta describes travelling westwards from E\u011firdir to [[Milas]] and then skipping {{convert|420|km|abbr=on}} eastward past E\u011firdir to [[Konya]]. He then continues travelling in an easterly direction, reaching [[Erzurum]] from where he skips {{convert|1160|km|abbr=on}} back to [[Birgi]] which lies north of [[Milas]].{{sfn|Gibb|1962|pp=424\u201328 Vol. 2}} Historians believe that Ibn Battuta visited a number of towns in central Anatolia, but not in the order that he describes.<ref name=divag>{{harvnb|Dunn|2005|pp=149\u201350, 157 Note 13}}; {{harvnb|Gibb|1962|pp=533\u201335, Vol. 2}}; {{harvnb|Hrbek|1962|pp=455\u201362}}.</ref>{{efn|This is one of several occasions where Ibn Battuta interrupts a journey to branch out on a side trip only to later skip back and resume the original journey.

He left Majar to meet with [[Uzbeg Khan]]'s travelling court ([[ordo (palace)|''Orda'']]), which was at the time near [[Beshtau]] mountain.

Then he returned to the Khan's court and with it moved to [[Astrakhan]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIbn Battuta recorded that while in Bolghar he wanted to travel further north into the land of darkness. The land is snow-covered throughout (northern Siberia) and the only means of transport is dog-drawn sled. There lived a mysterious people who were reluctant to show themselves. They traded with southern people in a peculiar way. Southern merchants brought various goods and placed them in an open area on the snow in the night, then returned to their tents. Next morning they came to the place again and found their merchandise taken by the mysterious people, but in exchange they found fur-skins which could be used for making valuable coats, jackets, and other winter garments. The trade was done between merchants and the mysterious people without seeing each other.

On his way to Sylhet, Ibn Battuta was greeted by several of Shah Jalal's disciples who had come to assist him on his journey many days before he had arrived. At the meeting in 1345 CE, Ibn Battuta noted that Shah Jalal was tall and lean, fair in complexion and lived by the mosque in a cave, where his only item of value was a goat he kept for milk, butter, and yogurt. He observed that the companions of the Shah Jalal were foreign and known for their strength and bravery. He also mentions that many people would visit the Shah to seek guidance.

He met the ruler of Malacca and stayed as a guest for three days.\n\nIbn Battuta then sailed to a state called Kaylukari in the land of [[Tawalisi]], where he met [[Urduja]], a local princess. Urduja was a brave warrior, and her people were opponents of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. She was described as an \"idolater\", but could write the phrase [[Basmala|Bismillah]] in [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The locations of Kaylukari and Tawalisi are disputed. Kaylukari might referred to [[Po Klong Garai]] in [[Champa]] (now southern Vietnam), and Urduja might be an aristocrat of [[Champa]] or the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]].

One of the first things he noted was that Muslims referred to the city as \"Zaitun\" (meaning [[olive]]), but Ibn Battuta could not find any olives anywhere. He mentioned local artists and their mastery in making portraits of newly arrived foreigners; these were for security purposes.

A derailment as the train descended the Maurienne valley rail line caused a catastrophic crash and subsequent fire in which approximately 675 died.<ref>'Catastrophe ferroviaire de Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne,'</ref> France's deadliest rail accident, it occurred on the [[Culoz\u2013Modane railway]] line. \n\n== Background of the accident ==\n[[File:Marie \u00c9mile Fayolle (1852 \u2013 1928) .jpg|thumb|upright 0.55|left|General [[\u00c9mile Fayolle]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Caporetto]], which took place from 24 October to 19 November 1917, a [[British Army|British]] and [[French Army|French]] Expeditionary Corps was sent to northeast [[Italy]] in order to reinforce the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian]] front line. When the Italian Front stabilized a month later, General [[\u00c9mile Fayolle]], who was the new commander in chief of the French troops supporting the Italians, granted leave to soldiers who had previously fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] so that morale would improve in the wake of the [[1917 French Army mutinies]]. At the end of November 1917, a rail transport plan was organized to transport the French soldiers from [[Vicenza]], an Italian city, to [[railway station]]s in [[France]].\n\nOn the night of December 12/13, 1917, military train number 612 was returning from Italy filled with French soldiers who had spent a month helping Italian troops.\n\nAfter passing through the [[Mont Cenis Tunnel]] the train reached [[Modane]] station, where two additional cars were coupled to the train before the journey onward to [[Chamb\u00e9ry]]. From there they were to disperse to join their families throughout France for 15 days of leave covering the year-end holidays. The train stopped at Modane for 1&nbsp;hour to allow other trains to pass. Most of the officers left the train during this stop, to take the Modane-Paris express.\n\n== The train ==\nThe train consisted of 19 coaches of Italian construction: one baggage van at each end, 15 cars with bogies, and two fixed-axle coaches added at Modane, for a total length of 350 metres and total weight of 526 tonnes. By official count it was carrying 982 enlisted men of the 46th and 47th divisions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/bourgogne-franche-comte/histoires-14-18-catastrophe-ferroviaire-saint-michel-maurienne-1379367.html|title=Histoires 14-18 : la catastrophe ferroviaire de Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne|access-date=2018-04-01|language=fr}}</ref> The cars were of wooden construction with metal chassis. Due to a shortage of [[locomotive]]s in the area, the local commanding officer for rail traffic chose to couple two trains with a combined 19 coaches to a single [[4-6-0]] engine. Of those coaches, only the first three had [[Railway air brake|air brakes]], the remaining coaches had only [[Hand brake#Railroad hand brakes|hand brakes]] or no brakes at all. The compressed-air brakes worked on only the first three cars of the train, and seven brakemen (two of whom died in the derailment) had been distributed throughout the train, to set the brakes when signalled to do so by the locomotive whistle.\n\nThe train may have been carrying more than the official number of soldiers, and was overloaded for operation on the steep 3.3% grade between Modane (elevation 1040 metres) and Saint Michel de Maurienne (elevation 710 metres), with too many cars relative to the braking power of the single locomotive. Such a train normally would have had two engines. However, the second assigned locomotive had been requisitioned for a munitions train by the officer in charge of dispatching.\n\n==The accident ==\nThe train departed from [[Modane]] station at 11:15 pm., and descended into a valley. The downhill descent started normally, but from [[Freney]] onwards, a short distance from Modane, the train began accelerating to an eventual uncontrollable speed of 135&nbsp;km/h (84&nbsp;mph) as measured by the locomotive's speed indicator. The driver applied the brakes to no effect, owing to the heavy load, and quickly lost control of the train. Lacking sufficient braking power for the steep downgrade of 3.3%, the train derailed. \n\nThe first coach derailed while going at 102&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) where the authorized speed was 40&nbsp;km/h (25&nbsp;mph), and its coupler broke only 1,300 metres from [[Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne|Saint Michel de Maurienne]] station shortly after crossing the metal highway bridge at Saussaz, over the river Arc. The wooden coaches smashed into one another and promptly caught fire, triggered by the overheated brakes and lit candles which had been brought on board due to defective electric lighting. The fire was also fed by grenades and other explosives carried without authorization by the soldiers returning home. The fire did not burn out until the evening of the following day. The derailment occurred at a point where the railway line passed through a narrow gap in the mountain terrain, leaving little room for heat from the fire to escape.\n<br />\n<gallery>\nFile:Accident-Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne-D\u00e9cembre-1907.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Fatalities==\nThe driver (engineer) of the locomotive had been too preoccupied with his failing brakes and excessive speed to notice the absence of the cars until he reached the station at [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne|Saint Jean de Maurienne]]. Here he finally succeeded in stopping his locomotive and its tender. Together with some Scottish soldiers waiting to depart for Modane (two British divisions had also been sent to the Italian front in October) and railway employees from both stations, he went immediately to the accident site to assist. Their task was made more difficult by the rocky terrain where the wrecked cars lay, by the heat from the fires, and by the height of the piled-up wreckage. The station master at La Praz, seeing the train passing at an out-of-control speed, had notified the station master of the next station, Saint Jean de Maurienne, who held the departure of a train full of British soldiers, thereby preventing a second catastrophe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danger-ahead.railfan.net/accidents/modane/home.html|title=Modane, France (1917)|publisher=Danger Ahead|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoth the military hospital at Saint Jean de Maurienne and the Bozon-Verduraz pasta factory nearby were transformed into makeshift field hospitals\u2014and mortuaries\u2014for the victims.\n\nRescue teams pulled more than 424 corpses from the wreckage that could be officially identified. A further 135 could not be identified. Thirty-seven more bodies were found strewn along the ballast of the railway or the right-of-way, between La Praz and the metal bridge, belonging to soldiers who had jumped off the out-of-control train, or had been thrown off as it tossed wildly. They were interred in a communal grave next to the cemetery.\n\nOnly 183 men who had been on the train reported for roll-call on the next morning of December 13. More than 100 others either died in hospitals in the region, or while being transported to them, during the next 15 days. The number of fatalities came to approximately 675.\n\n==After the accident, investigation==\n[[File:St\u00e8le accident ferroviaire St-Michel-de-Maurienne.JPG|thumb|Commemorative stone on the site of the railway accident]]\nThe accident remained a classified military secret for many years. At the time, the French military enforced silence on the French press, which reported little or nothing about the accident because it implicated French officers. The daily '[[Le Figaro]]' devoted only 21 lines to the accident on December 17, four days after the accident.\n\nA [[court-martial]] was called to try six employees of the [[Chemins de fer de Paris \u00e0 Lyon et \u00e0 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e|PLM]] (Paris\u2013Lyon\u2013Mediterran\u00e9e) railway. They were acquitted.\n\nIn June 1923 the Minister of Defense, [[Andr\u00e9 Maginot]], inaugurated a monument to the victims in the cemetery of Saint Michel de Maurienne. In 1961 the remains of the victims were transferred to the national military cemetery of Lyon-La Doua. On December 12, 1998, a monument was inaugurated at the La Saussaz site, near the site of the accident.\n\nThe derailment remains the greatest rail catastrophe in French history. It also remains the second greatest rail catastrophe in the entirety of world history, superseded only by [[2004 Sri Lanka tsunami train wreck]]. This also makes the Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne derailment the deadliest railway disaster in world history that occurred as a result of an operational accident rather than being caused by a larger ongoing [[natural disaster]].\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n{{oldid|Turin\u2013Modane railway#1917 accident|413847202|This article was created from the \"1917 accident\" section of this version of \"Turin\u2013Modane railway\"}}\n\n<!-- Hmm, one cannot translate from the English, and I didn't actually use the French yet, but probably will\n{{Translation/Ref|fr|Accident ferroviaire de Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne|oldid=62020402}}\n-->\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Accident ferroviaire de Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne}}\n\n{{coord|45|12|40|N|6|29|11|E|region:FR-73_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{1910s railway accidents}}\n\n[[Category:Railway accidents in 1917]]\n[[Category:Derailments in France]]\n[[Category:1917 in France]]\n[[Category:Savoie]]\n[[Category:December 1917 events]]\n[[Category:Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox public transit accident\n| name                = Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne train derailment\n<!-- Image          -->\n| image               = File:Accident ferroviaire de Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne (1917).jpg\n| image_size          = \n| image_alt           = \n| caption             =Wreckage of the French military train, 13 December 1917 \n\n| image_map           = \n| image_map_alt       = \n| image_map_caption   = \n| pushpin_map         = \n| alternative_map     = \n| pushpin_map_alt     = \n| pushpin_map_caption = \n| mapframe            = \n| qid                 = \n| mapframe_zoom       = \n| coordinates         = \n\n| date                = December 12, 1917\n| time                = \n| location            = [[Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne]]\n| location_dir        = \n| location_city       = \n| location_dist_km    = \n| location_dist_mi    = \n| country             = [[France]]\n| line                = Maurienne valley rail line, [[Culoz\u2013Modane railway]]\n| operator            = [[French Military]]\n| owner               = \n| service             = \n| type                = \n| cause               = Very steep slope of the railway line, insufficient braking power, overloaded coaches.\n<!-- Statistics     --> \n| bus                 = \n| trains              = 1\n| vehicles            = \n| passengers          = 982\n| crew                = \n| pedestrians         = \n| deaths              = 675\n| injuries            = \n| damage              = \n| property            = \n<!-- Route map      -->\n| route_map           = \n| route_map_state     = \n| route_map_name      = \n<!-- Footnotes      --> \n| footnotes           = \n}}\n\nThe '''Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne derailment''' of December 12, 1917 was a railway accident involving a troop train carrying at least 1,000 French soldiers on their way home for leave from the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] in [[World War I]].

The daily '[[Le Figaro]]' devoted only 21 lines to the accident on December 17, four days after the accident.\n\nA [[court-martial]] was called to try six employees of the [[Chemins de fer de Paris \u00e0 Lyon et \u00e0 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e|PLM]] (Paris\u2013Lyon\u2013Mediterran\u00e9e) railway. They were acquitted.\n\nIn June 1923 the Minister of Defense, [[Andr\u00e9 Maginot]], inaugurated a monument to the victims in the cemetery of Saint Michel de Maurienne. In 1961 the remains of the victims were transferred to the national military cemetery of Lyon-La Doua. On December 12, 1998, a monument was inaugurated at the La Saussaz site, near the site of the accident.\n\nThe derailment remains the greatest rail catastrophe in French history. It also remains the second greatest rail catastrophe in the entirety of world history, superseded only by [[2004 Sri Lanka tsunami train wreck]]. This also makes the Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne derailment the deadliest railway disaster in world history that occurred as a result of an operational accident rather than being caused by a larger ongoing [[natural disaster]].\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n{{oldid|Turin\u2013Modane railway#1917 accident|413847202|This article was created from the \"1917 accident\" section of this version of \"Turin\u2013Modane railway\"}}\n\n<!-- Hmm, one cannot translate from the English, and I didn't actually use the French yet, but probably will\n{{Translation/Ref|fr|Accident ferroviaire de Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne|oldid=62020402}}\n-->\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Accident ferroviaire de Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne}}\n\n{{coord|45|12|40|N|6|29|11|E|region:FR-73_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{1910s railway accidents}}\n\n[[Category:Railway accidents in 1917]]\n[[Category:Derailments in France]]\n[[Category:1917 in France]]\n[[Category:Savoie]]\n[[Category:December 1917 events]]\n[[Category:Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne]]\n", "name_user": "Daniel Case", "label": "safe", "comment": "consistent date format in lede", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne_derailment"}

Ceaser argues that the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view of [[reason]] and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] American project. The German poet [[Nikolaus Lenau]] commented: \"With the expression ''Bodenlosigkeit'' (absence of ground), I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme\". Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada nor Mexico.<ref name=\"Ceaser\"/> Lenau had [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated]] to the United States in 1833 and found that the country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the U.S. were the subject of a novel titled ''The America-exhaustion'' (''Der Amerika-M\u00fcde'') (1855) by fellow German [[Ferdinand K\u00fcrnberger]].<ref>''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1974) edited by William Rose Bennet: 556</ref>\n\nThe nature of American [[democracy]] was also questioned. The sentiment was that the country lacked \"[a] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system,\" according to Judy Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans in the early nineteenth century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure.<ref name=\"Rubin\"/> The [[French Revolution]], which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles.<ref name=\"Ceaser\"/> That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].<ref name=\"Schama\"/> \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?\" asked [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1775.<ref>{{cite news |last=Staples |first=Brent |title=Give Us Liberty |work=The New York Times |date=4 June 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/books/review/04staples.html |accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> He famously stated, that \"I am willing to love all mankind, except an American\".<ref name=\"Rubin\"/>\n\n=== 20th century ===\n \n==== Intellectuals ====\n[[File:Vreeswijk Akerstrom Cervin 1965.jpg|thumb|Protest march against the [[Vietnam War]] in Stockholm, Sweden, 1965]]\n[[Sigmund Freud]] was vehemently anti-American.

They sponsored anti-Americanism among followers and sympathizers. Russell A.

Anyone who expressed support for the west would be investigated by the [[Stasi]] (secret police).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The official line followed [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] theory of [[imperialism]] as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and in [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov's]] theory of [[fascism]] as the dictatorship of the most [[reactionary]] elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. The official party line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. It was now the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering for the benefit of the \"terrorist international of murderers on [[Wall Street]]\".<ref>Rainer Schnoor, \"The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR,\" in Detlef Junker, et al. eds.

They had seen enough of the Russians since 1945\u2014a half-million Soviet troops were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989. Furthermore, they were exposed to information from relatives in the West, as well as the American [[Radio Free Europe]] broadcasts, and [[West Germany|West German]] media. The official communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and [[rock and roll]]. The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture. The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany. Professionals in East Germany were watched for any sign of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk. The solution was to either comply or flee to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the [[Berlin Wall|Berlin wall]] of 1961.<ref>Schnoor, \"The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR,\" 2:618-26</ref>\n\n==== Fascist critiques ====\n{{Further|Melting pot}}\nDrawing on the ideas of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816\u20131882), [[Fascism in Europe|European fascists]] decried the supposed degenerating effect of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] on the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial mix]] of the American population.

Although the American [[Articles of Confederation]] later pre-approved Canada as a U.S. state, public opinion had turned against them. Soon 40,000 [[United Empire Loyalists|loyalist refugees]] arrived from the United States, including 2,000 [[Black Loyalists]], many of whom had fought for [[the Crown]] against the American Revolution. To them, the republic they left behind was violent and anarchic, [[Plutocracy|ruled by money]] and [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].<ref>Nossal, Kim Richard, \"Anti-Americanism in Canada\", ''Anti-Americanism: comparative perspectives'' (2007), ed.

The United States had abandoned the British Empire, and as a result, America was supposedly disorderly, greedy, and selfishly individualistic. By the 1930s, there was less concern with the United States, and more attention given to Canada's peaceful society, and its efforts on behalf of Civilization in the World War. Close cooperation in the Second World War led to much more favorable image. In the 1945-1965 era, the friendly and peaceful border was stressed. Textbooks emphasized the role of the United States as an international power and champion of freedom with Canada as its influential partner.<ref>Amy Von Heyking, \"Talking about Americans: The image of the United States in English-Canadian schools, 1900\u20131965.\" ''History of Education Quarterly'' 46.3 (2006): 382-408.</ref>\n\nIn 1945-65, there was wide consensus in Canada on foreign and defense policies 1948 to 1957. Bothwell, Drummond and English state:\n:That support was remarkably uniform geographically and racially, both coast to coast and among French and English. From the CCF on the left to the Social Credit on the right, the political parties agreed that NATO was a good thing, and communism a bad thing, that a close association with Europe was desirable, and that the Commonwealth embodied a glorious past.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M.

By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. \"Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one.\"<ref>Bothwell et al., p. 131</ref> Apart from the far left, which admired the USSR, anti-Americanism was first adopted by a few leading historians. As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, [[Harold Innis]] grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. \"We are indeed fighting for our lives,\" he warned, pointing especially to the \"pernicious influence of American advertising....We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Harold A.

They had seen enough of the Russians since 1945\u2014a half-million Soviet troops were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989. Furthermore, they were exposed to information from relatives in the West, as well as the American [[Radio Free Europe]] broadcasts, and [[West Germany|West German]] media. The official communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and [[rock and roll]]. The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture. The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany. Professionals in East Germany were watched for any sign of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk. The solution was to either comply or flee to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the [[Berlin Wall|Berlin wall]] of 1961.<ref>Schnoor, \"The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR,\" 2:618-26</ref>\n\n==== Fascist critiques ====\n{{Further|Melting pot}}\nDrawing on the ideas of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816\u20131882), [[Fascism in Europe|European fascists]] decried the supposed degenerating effect of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] on the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial mix]] of the American population.

In Europe, there is growing concern about excess Americanization through Google, Facebook, Twitter, the iPhone and Uber, among many other U.S. Internet-based corporations. European governments have increasingly expressed concern regarding privacy issues, as well as antitrust and taxation issues regarding the new American giants.

relations#Anti-Americanism|label 1=Canada\u2013United States relations}}\nAnti-Americanism in Canada has unique historic roots. When the [[Continental Congress]] was called in 1774, an invitation was sent to [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. However Canadians expressed little interest in joining the Congress, and the following year the [[Continental Army]] invaded Canada, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]]. Although the American [[Articles of Confederation]] later pre-approved Canada as a U.S. state, public opinion had turned against them. Soon 40,000 [[United Empire Loyalists|loyalist refugees]] arrived from the United States, including 2,000 [[Black Loyalists]], many of whom had fought for [[the Crown]] against the American Revolution. To them, the republic they left behind was violent and anarchic, [[Plutocracy|ruled by money]] and [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].<ref>Nossal, Kim Richard, \"Anti-Americanism in Canada\", ''Anti-Americanism: comparative perspectives'' (2007), ed. Brendon O'Connor, pp. 62\u201366</ref>\n\nPro-British imperialists repeatedly warned against American-style republicanism and democracy as little more than mob rule.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sara Jeannette Duncan|author2=Misao Dean|title=The Imperialist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54osezQz_eQC&pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Broadview Press|page=19}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Canadian textbooks portrayed the United States in a negative fashion. The United States had abandoned the British Empire, and as a result, America was supposedly disorderly, greedy, and selfishly individualistic. By the 1930s, there was less concern with the United States, and more attention given to Canada's peaceful society, and its efforts on behalf of Civilization in the World War. Close cooperation in the Second World War led to much more favorable image. In the 1945-1965 era, the friendly and peaceful border was stressed. Textbooks emphasized the role of the United States as an international power and champion of freedom with Canada as its influential partner.<ref>Amy Von Heyking, \"Talking about Americans: The image of the United States in English-Canadian schools, 1900\u20131965.\" ''History of Education Quarterly'' 46.3 (2006): 382-408.</ref>\n\nIn 1945-65, there was wide consensus in Canada on foreign and defense policies 1948 to 1957. Bothwell, Drummond and English state:\n:That support was remarkably uniform geographically and racially, both coast to coast and among French and English. From the CCF on the left to the Social Credit on the right, the political parties agreed that NATO was a good thing, and communism a bad thing, that a close association with Europe was desirable, and that the Commonwealth embodied a glorious past.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M.

By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. \"Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one.\"<ref>Bothwell et al., p. 131</ref> Apart from the far left, which admired the USSR, anti-Americanism was first adopted by a few leading historians. As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, [[Harold Innis]] grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. \"We are indeed fighting for our lives,\" he warned, pointing especially to the \"pernicious influence of American advertising....We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Harold A.

Imperialists explained that Canadians had narrowly escaped American conquest, with its rejection of tradition, its worship of \"progress\" and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and social harmony. There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as [[F. R.

They are usually referred to as \"[[pigeon post]]\" if used in post service, or \"[[war pigeon]]\" during wars. Until the introduction of telephones, homing pigeons were used commercially to deliver communication.\n\nMessenger  pigeons are often incorrectly categorized as [[English Carrier pigeon]]s, an ancient breed of [[fancy pigeons]]. They were used historically to send messages but lost the  [[homing instinct]] long ago. Modern-day homing pigeons (homers) or racing pigeons ([[Racing_Homer|racing homers]]) do have \"Carrier blood\" in them because they are in part descendants of the old-style Carriers. This is one reason why they are still commonly but erroneously called \"carrier pigeons\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Great Barrier Island Pigeon-Gram stamp 1899.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Stamp for early Pigeon-Gram service]]\nBy 3000 BC, Egypt was using  [[homing pigeon]]s for [[pigeon post]], taking advantage of a singular quality of this bird, which when taken far from its nest is able to find its way home due to a particularly developed sense of orientation. Messages were then tied around the legs of the pigeon, which was freed and could reach its original nest. By the 19th century homing pigeons were used extensively for military communications. <ref>Carter W.

The pigeon ear, being far too small to interpret such a long wave, directs pigeons to fly in a circle when first taking air, in order to mentally map such long infrasound waves.\n\nVarious experiments suggest that different breeds of homing pigeons rely on different cues to different extents.
