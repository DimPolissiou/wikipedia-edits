VanArts offers one-year diploma programs for the visual, media and performing arts plus degree pathways with university partners.\n\nVanArts is designated through the Private Training Institutions Branch (PTIB).<ref>[https://www.privatetraininginstitutions.gov.bc.ca/]</ref>\n\n==History==\nVanArts was founded in 1995 with [[Lee Mishkin]] as its founding program director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanarts.com/about-us|title=VanArts - About Us|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe first campus for VanArts was on West Broadway in Vancouver, and by January 1997 it had moved downtown to 837 Beatty Street.  Originally offering programs for Classical Animation, then [[computer animation]] in 1998, the school expanded to offer [[Video game graphics|Game Art]] & [[Game design|Design]] in 2003 and [[Visual Effects]] in 2004.  Upon adding the first [[Digital Photography]] program in [[North America]] in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |title=VanArts Launches First Digital Photography Program in North America |url=https://www.vanarts.com/news-article/vanarts-launches-first-digital-photography-program-north-america/ |accessdate=22 January 2019 |publisher=VanArts |date=January 3, 2007}}</ref> VanArts needed to expand and moved to a new campus at 626 West Pender Street.  In 2008, the [[William Davis Centre for Actors Study]] joined up with VanArts and became its Acting department.  Another move happened in July 2010 to its current location at 570 Dunsmuir Street.  2011 brought new departments for [[Web Development]] & Interactive Design, and the addition of [[Broadcasting]] and Online Media.\n\n===The William Davis Centre for Actors Study===\nThe William Davis Centre for Actors Study was opened in 1989 by [[William B.
