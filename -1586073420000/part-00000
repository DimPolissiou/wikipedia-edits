The two antigens are antigen A and antigen B. The two antibodies are antibody A and antibody B. The antigens are present on the red blood cells and the antibodies in the serum. Regarding the antigen property of the blood all human beings can be classified into 4 groups, those with antigen A (group A), those with antigen B (group B), those with both antigen A and B (group AB) and those with neither antigen (group O). The antibodies present together with the antigens are found as follows:\n# Antigen\tA\twith antibody  B\n# Antigen\tB\twith antibody  A\n# Antigen\tAB\thas no antibodies\n# Antigen \tnil (group O) with antibody A and B.\n\nThere is an [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] reaction between similar antigen and antibody (for example, antigen A agglutinates the antibody A and antigen B agglutinates the antibody B). Thus, transfusion can be considered safe as long as the serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor.\n\nThe ''ABO system'' is the most important blood-group system in human-blood transfusion. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually ''[[immunoglobulin M]]'', abbreviated [[IgM]], antibodies. It has been hypothesized that ABO IgM [[antibodies]] are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es, although blood group compatibility rules are applied to newborn and infants as a matter of practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Position statement: Red blood cell transfusion in newborn infants |url=https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/red-blood-cell-transfusion-newborn-infants |publisher=Canadian Pediatric Society |date=April 14, 2014}}</ref> The original terminology used by [[Karl Landsteiner]] in 1901 for the classification was A/B/C; in later publications \"C\" became \"O\".<ref name=Oor0>{{Citation | last1  = Schmidt | first1 = P | last2  = Okroi | first2 = M  | title = Also sprach Landsteiner \u2013 Blood Group 'O' or Blood Group 'NULL' | journal = Infus Ther Transfus Med | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 206\u20138 | year = 2001 | pmid = | doi = 10.1159/000050239}}</ref> Type O is often called ''0'' (''zero'', or ''null'') in other languages.<ref name=\"Oor0\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |title=Your blood&nbsp;\u2013 a textbook about blood and blood donation |accessdate=2008-07-15 |page=63 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626184746/http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|[[Phenotype]]\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|[[Genotype]]\n|-\n| A  || AA or AI\n|-\n| B  || BB or BI\n|-\n| AB || AB\n|-\n| O  || II\n|}\n\n===Rh blood group system===\n{{Main|Rh blood group system}}\nThe Rh system (Rh meaning ''[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus]]'') is the second most significant blood-group system in human-blood transfusion with currently 50 antigens. The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen, because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main Rh antigens. It is common for D-negative individuals not to have any anti-D IgG or IgM antibodies, because anti-D antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances.  However, D-negative individuals can produce [[IgG]] anti-D antibodies following a sensitizing event: possibly a fetomaternal transfusion of blood from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with D positive [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s.<ref name=\"Talaro, Kathleen P. 2005 510\u20131\">{{cite book|author=Talaro, Kathleen P.|title=Foundations in microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/foundationsinmic00kath|url-access=registration|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foundationsinmic00kath/page/510 510\u20131]|isbn=0-07-111203-0 |edition=5th}}</ref> [[Rh disease]] can develop in these cases.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Moise KJ|title=Management of rhesus alloimmunization in pregnancy|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=112|issue=1|pages=164\u201376|date=July 2008|pmid=18591322|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817d453c}}</ref> Rh negative blood types are much less common in Asian populations (0.3%) than they are in European populations (15%).<ref name=\"Rh group and its origin\">{{cite web|url=http://hospital.kingnet.com.tw/activity/blood/html/a.html|title=Rh\u8840\u578b\u7684\u7531\u4f86|publisher=Hospital.kingnet.com.tw|accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref>\nThe presence or absence of the Rh(D) antigen is signified by the + or \u2212 sign, so that, for example, the A\u2212 group is ABO type A and does not have the Rh (D) antigen.\n\n===ABO and Rh distribution by country===\n{{main|Blood type distribution by country}}\n\nAs with many other genetic traits, the distribution of ABO and Rh blood groups varies significantly between populations.\n\n===Other blood group systems===\n{{Main|Human blood group systems}}\nTwenty-eight blood-group systems have been identified by the International Society for Blood Transfusion in addition to the common ABO and Rh systems.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/?Page=news&storyID=13259\n|title=Blood Mystery Solved\n|author=Joshua E.

For example, an individual can be AB, D positive, and at the same time M and N positive ([[MNS antigen system|MNS system]]), K positive ([[Kell antigen system|Kell system]]), Le<sup>a</sup> or Le<sup>b</sup> negative ([[Lewis antigen system|Lewis system]]), and so on, being positive or negative for each blood group system antigen. Many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Blood transfusion===\n{{Main|Blood transfusion}}\nTransfusion medicine is a specialized branch of [[hematology]] that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a [[blood bank]] to provide a [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed [[physician]] or [[surgeon]]) in a similar way as medicines.\n\n[[File:Main symptoms of acute hemolytic reaction.png|thumb|right|220px|Main symptoms of [[acute hemolytic reaction]] due to blood type mismatch.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_1_4x_Possible_Risks_of_Blood_Product_Transfusions.asp Possible Risks of Blood Product Transfusions] from American Cancer Society.

Version July 2004, Revised 11/5/08</ref>]]\n\nMuch of the routine work of a [[blood bank]] involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible.   If a unit of incompatible blood is [[Blood transfusion|transfused]] between a [[Blood donation|donor]] and recipient, a severe [[acute hemolytic reaction]] with [[hemolysis]] (RBC destruction), [[kidney failure]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] is likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the [[complement system]] to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.\n\nPatients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a [[transfusion reaction]].  Risks can be further reduced by [[cross-matching]] blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture ''agglutinates'', or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] with a [[microscope]]. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient.  In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a [[barcode]] system known as [[ISBT 128]].\n\nThe blood group may be included on [[Dog tag (identifier)|identification tags]] or on [[tattoo]]s worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German [[SS blood group tattoo|Waffen-SS had blood group tattoos]] during [[World War II]].\n\nRare blood types can cause supply problems for [[blood bank]]s and hospitals. For example, [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]]-negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nickel RG |title=Determination of Duffy genotypes in three populations of African descent using PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotides |journal=Human Immunology |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=738\u201342 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10439320 |doi=10.1016/S0198-8859(99)00039-7 |author2=Willadsen SA |author3=Freidhoff LR |display-authors=3 |last4=Huang |first4=Shau-Ku |last5=Caraballo |first5=Luis |last6=Naidu |first6=Raana P |last7=Levett |first7=Paul |last8=Blumenthal |first8=Malcolm |last9=Banks-Schlegel |first9=Susan}}</ref> and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for these patients.

If a D-negative patient has developed anti-D antibodies, a subsequent exposure to D-positive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous transfusion reaction. Rh D-positive blood should never be given to D-negative women of child-bearing age or to patients with D antibodies, so blood banks must conserve Rh-negative blood for these patients. In extreme circumstances, such as for a major bleed when stocks of D-negative blood units are very low at the blood bank, D-positive blood might be given to D-negative females above child-bearing age or to Rh-negative males, providing that they did not have anti-D antibodies, to conserve D-negative blood stock in the blood bank. The converse is not true; Rh D-positive patients do not react to D negative blood.\n\nThis same matching is done for other antigens of the Rh system as C, c, E and e and for other blood group systems with a known risk for immunization such as the Kell system in particular for females of child-bearing age or patients with known need for many transfusions.\n\n===Plasma compatibility===\n[[File:Plasma donation compatibility path.svg|right|190px|thumb|'''Plasma compatibility chart'''<br />In addition to donating to the same blood group; plasma from type AB can be given to A, B and O; plasma from types A, B and AB can be given to O.]]\n[[Blood plasma]] compatibility is the inverse of red blood cell compatibility.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blood Component ABO Compatibility Chart Red Blood Cells and Plasma|url=http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu|website=Blood Bank Labsite|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref> Type AB plasma carries neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies and can be transfused to individuals of any blood group; but type AB patients can only receive type AB plasma.

Assumes absence of strong atypical antibodies in donor plasma\n</small>\n\nRh D antibodies are uncommon, so generally neither D negative nor D positive blood contain anti-D antibodies.  If a potential donor is found to have anti-D antibodies or any strong atypical blood group antibody by antibody screening in the blood bank, they would not be accepted as a donor (or in some blood banks the blood would be drawn but the product would need to be appropriately labeled); therefore, donor blood plasma issued by a blood bank can be selected to be free of D antibodies and free of other atypical antibodies, and such donor plasma issued from a blood bank would be suitable for a recipient who may be D positive or D negative, as long as blood plasma and the recipient are ABO compatible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Universal donors and universal recipients===\n[[File:US Navy 060105-N-8154G-010 A hospital corpsman with the Blood Donor Team from Portsmouth Naval Hospital takes samples of blood from a donor for testing.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A hospital corpsman with the Blood Donor Team from [[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth]] takes samples of blood from a donor for testing]]\n\nIn transfusions of packed red blood cells, individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients. However, these terms are only generally true with respect to possible reactions of the recipient's anti-A and anti-B antibodies to transfused red blood cells, and also possible sensitization to Rh D antigens. One exception is individuals with [[hh antigen system]] (also known as the Bombay phenotype) who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors, because they form antibodies against the H antigen present on all red blood cells.<ref>{{cite book |title=Harrison's Principals of Internal Medicine |last=Fauci |first=Anthony S. |author2=Eugene Braunwald |author3=Kurt J.

In general, while the plasma fraction of a blood transfusion may carry donor antibodies not found in the recipient, a significant reaction is unlikely because of dilution.\n\nAdditionally, red blood cell surface antigens other than A, B and Rh D, might cause adverse reactions and sensitization, if they can bind to the corresponding antibodies to generate an immune response.  Transfusions are further complicated because [[platelet]]s and [[white blood cell]]s (WBCs) have their own systems of surface antigens, and sensitization to platelet or WBC antigens can occur as a result of transfusion.\n\nFor transfusions of [[Plasma (blood)|plasma]], this situation is reversed.  Type O plasma, containing both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, can only be given to O recipients.  The antibodies will attack the antigens on any other blood type.  Conversely, AB plasma can be given to patients of any ABO blood group, because it does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies.\n\n==Blood typing==\n{{main|Blood typing}}\nTypically, blood type tests are performed through addition of a blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen. The presence of an antigen on the surface of the blood cells is indicated by [[Hemagglutination|agglutination]]. An alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at [[Imperial College London]] which makes use of [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[molecularly imprinted polymer]] nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Piletsky SS, Rabinowicz S, Yang Z, Piletska EV, Guerreiro A, Piletsky SA |title= Development of molecularly imprinted polymers specific for blood antigens for application in antibody-free blood typing |journal=Chemical Communications |volume= 53 |issue=11|year= 2017|doi= 10.1039/C6CC08716G|pmid= 27966700 | pages=1793\u201396}}</ref>  In these tests, rather than agglutination, a positive result is indicated by decolorization as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution.\n\n===Blood group genotyping===\nIn addition to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types, the progress in molecular diagnostics allows the increasing use of blood group genotyping. In contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype, genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens. This allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion, which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent allo-immunization.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anstee DJ |title=Red cell genotyping and the future of pretransfusion testing |journal=Blood |volume=114|issue=2|year= 2009|doi= 10.1182/blood-2008-11-146860|pmid=19411635| pages=248\u201356|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f5eef89dbbf7a0f33accfc2633d39868143ada4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Avent ND |title=Large-scale blood group genotyping: clinical implications |journal=Br J Haematol |volume=144|issue=1|year= 2009|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07285.x|pmid=19016734| pages=3\u201313}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBlood types were first discovered by an Austrian physician, [[Karl Landsteiner]], working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now [[Medical University of Vienna]]). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes, and not only that, some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Landsteiner K |title=Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe |journal=Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde und Infektionskrankheiten|volume=27 |issue= |pages=357\u2013362 |year=1900}}</ref> He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\n{{Quote|The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells, but also often those of human origin, from other individuals.

The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Landsteiner |first1=Karl |title=On Agglutination of Normal Human Blood |journal=Transfusion |date=1961 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5\u20138 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.1961.tb00005.x |orig-year=1901 |pmid=13758692| postscript=Originally published in German in ''Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift'', '''46''', 1132\u20131134}}</ref> This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930.

The antibodies present together with the antigens are found as follows:\n# Antigen\tA\twith antibody  B\n# Antigen\tB\twith antibody  A\n# Antigen\tAB\thas no antibodies\n# Antigen \tnil (group O) with antibody A and B.\n\nThere is an [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] reaction between similar antigen and antibody (for example, antigen A agglutinates the antibody A and antigen B agglutinates the antibody B). Thus, transfusion can be considered safe as long as the serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor.\n\nThe ''ABO system'' is the most important blood-group system in human-blood transfusion. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually ''[[immunoglobulin M]]'', abbreviated [[IgM]], antibodies. It has been hypothesized that ABO IgM [[antibodies]] are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es, although blood group compatibility rules are applied to newborn and infants as a matter of practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Position statement: Red blood cell transfusion in newborn infants |url=https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/red-blood-cell-transfusion-newborn-infants |publisher=Canadian Pediatric Society |date=April 14, 2014}}</ref> The original terminology used by [[Karl Landsteiner]] in 1901 for the classification was A/B/C; in later publications \"C\" became \"O\".<ref name=Oor0>{{Citation | last1  = Schmidt | first1 = P | last2  = Okroi | first2 = M  | title = Also sprach Landsteiner \u2013 Blood Group 'O' or Blood Group 'NULL' | journal = Infus Ther Transfus Med | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 206\u20138 | year = 2001 | pmid = | doi = 10.1159/000050239}}</ref> Type O is often called ''0'' (''zero'', or ''null'') in other languages.<ref name=\"Oor0\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |title=Your blood&nbsp;\u2013 a textbook about blood and blood donation |accessdate=2008-07-15 |page=63 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626184746/http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|[[Phenotype]]\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|[[Genotype]]\n|-\n| A  || AA or AI\n|-\n| B  || BB or BI\n|-\n| AB || AB\n|-\n| O  || II\n|}\n\n===Rh blood group system===\n{{Main|Rh blood group system}}\nThe Rh system (Rh meaning ''[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus]]'') is the second most significant blood-group system in human-blood transfusion with currently 50 antigens. The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen, because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main Rh antigens. It is common for D-negative individuals not to have any anti-D IgG or IgM antibodies, because anti-D antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances.  However, D-negative individuals can produce [[IgG]] anti-D antibodies following a sensitizing event: possibly a fetomaternal transfusion of blood from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with D positive [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s.<ref name=\"Talaro, Kathleen P. 2005 510\u20131\">{{cite book|author=Talaro, Kathleen P.|title=Foundations in microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/foundationsinmic00kath|url-access=registration|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foundationsinmic00kath/page/510 510\u20131]|isbn=0-07-111203-0 |edition=5th}}</ref> [[Rh disease]] can develop in these cases.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Moise KJ|title=Management of rhesus alloimmunization in pregnancy|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=112|issue=1|pages=164\u201376|date=July 2008|pmid=18591322|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817d453c}}</ref> Rh negative blood types are much less common in Asian populations (0.3%) than they are in European populations (15%).<ref name=\"Rh group and its origin\">{{cite web|url=http://hospital.kingnet.com.tw/activity/blood/html/a.html|title=Rh\u8840\u578b\u7684\u7531\u4f86|publisher=Hospital.kingnet.com.tw|accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref>\nThe presence or absence of the Rh(D) antigen is signified by the + or \u2212 sign, so that, for example, the A\u2212 group is ABO type A and does not have the Rh (D) antigen.\n\n===ABO and Rh distribution by country===\n{{main|Blood type distribution by country}}\n\nAs with many other genetic traits, the distribution of ABO and Rh blood groups varies significantly between populations.\n\n===Other blood group systems===\n{{Main|Human blood group systems}}\nTwenty-eight blood-group systems have been identified by the International Society for Blood Transfusion in addition to the common ABO and Rh systems.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/?Page=news&storyID=13259\n|title=Blood Mystery Solved\n|author=Joshua E.

For example, an individual can be AB, D positive, and at the same time M and N positive ([[MNS antigen system|MNS system]]), K positive ([[Kell antigen system|Kell system]]), Le<sup>a</sup> or Le<sup>b</sup> negative ([[Lewis antigen system|Lewis system]]), and so on, being positive or negative for each blood group system antigen. Many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Blood transfusion===\n{{Main|Blood transfusion}}\nTransfusion medicine is a specialized branch of [[hematology]] that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a [[blood bank]] to provide a [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed [[physician]] or [[surgeon]]) in a similar way as medicines.\n\n[[File:Main symptoms of acute hemolytic reaction.png|thumb|right|220px|Main symptoms of [[acute hemolytic reaction]] due to blood type mismatch.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_1_4x_Possible_Risks_of_Blood_Product_Transfusions.asp Possible Risks of Blood Product Transfusions] from American Cancer Society.

Version July 2004, Revised 11/5/08</ref>]]\n\nMuch of the routine work of a [[blood bank]] involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible.   If a unit of incompatible blood is [[Blood transfusion|transfused]] between a [[Blood donation|donor]] and recipient, a severe [[acute hemolytic reaction]] with [[hemolysis]] (RBC destruction), [[kidney failure]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] is likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the [[complement system]] to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.\n\nPatients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a [[transfusion reaction]].  Risks can be further reduced by [[cross-matching]] blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture ''agglutinates'', or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] with a [[microscope]]. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient.  In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a [[barcode]] system known as [[ISBT 128]].\n\nThe blood group may be included on [[Dog tag (identifier)|identification tags]] or on [[tattoo]]s worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German [[SS blood group tattoo|Waffen-SS had blood group tattoos]] during [[World War II]].\n\nRare blood types can cause supply problems for [[blood bank]]s and hospitals. For example, [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]]-negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nickel RG |title=Determination of Duffy genotypes in three populations of African descent using PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotides |journal=Human Immunology |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=738\u201342 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10439320 |doi=10.1016/S0198-8859(99)00039-7 |author2=Willadsen SA |author3=Freidhoff LR |display-authors=3 |last4=Huang |first4=Shau-Ku |last5=Caraballo |first5=Luis |last6=Naidu |first6=Raana P |last7=Levett |first7=Paul |last8=Blumenthal |first8=Malcolm |last9=Banks-Schlegel |first9=Susan}}</ref> and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for these patients.  Similarly for RhD negative people, there is a risk associated with travelling to parts of the world where supplies of RhD negative blood are rare, particularly [[East Asia]], where blood services may endeavor to encourage Westerners to donate blood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodcare.org.uk/html/resources_chairman_2001.htm |title=BCF&nbsp;\u2013 Members&nbsp;\u2013 Chairman's Annual Report |accessdate=2008-07-15 |last=Bruce |first=MG |date=May 2002 |publisher=The Blood Care Foundation |quote=As Rhesus Negative blood is rare amongst local nationals, this Agreement will be of particular value to Rhesus Negative expatriates and travellers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410111425/http://www.bloodcare.org.uk/html/resources_chairman_2001.htm |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)===\n{{Main|Hemolytic disease of the newborn}}\n[[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] women may carry a [[fetus]] with a blood type which is different from their own.

This can happen if some of the fetus' blood cells pass into the mother's blood circulation (e.g. a small fetomaternal [[bleeding|hemorrhage]] at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention), or sometimes after a therapeutic [[blood transfusion]].

FFP is quick-frozen to retain the labile [[clotting factor]]s [[Factor V|V]] and [[Factor VIII|VIII]], which are usually administered to patients who have a potentially fatal clotting problem caused by a condition such as advanced [[liver]] disease, overdose of [[anticoagulant]], or [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).\n\nUnits of packed red cells are made by removing as much of the plasma as possible from whole blood units.\n\n[[Clotting factors]] synthesized by modern [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] methods are now in routine clinical use for [[hemophilia]], as the risks of infection transmission that occur with pooled blood products are avoided.\n\n===Red blood cell compatibility===\n*'''Blood group AB'''  individuals have both A and B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their [[blood plasma]] does not contain any antibodies against either A or B antigen.

Therefore, a group O individual can receive blood only from a group O individual, but can donate blood to individuals of any ABO blood group (i.e., A, B, O or AB). If a patient needs an urgent blood transfusion, and if the time taken to process the recipient's blood would cause a detrimental delay, O negative blood can be issued.

If a D-negative patient has developed anti-D antibodies, a subsequent exposure to D-positive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous transfusion reaction. Rh D-positive blood should never be given to D-negative women of child-bearing age or to patients with D antibodies, so blood banks must conserve Rh-negative blood for these patients. In extreme circumstances, such as for a major bleed when stocks of D-negative blood units are very low at the blood bank, D-positive blood might be given to D-negative females above child-bearing age or to Rh-negative males, providing that they did not have anti-D antibodies, to conserve D-negative blood stock in the blood bank. The converse is not true; Rh D-positive patients do not react to D negative blood.\n\nThis same matching is done for other antigens of the Rh system as C, c, E and e and for other blood group systems with a known risk for immunization such as the Kell system in particular for females of child-bearing age or patients with known need for many transfusions.\n\n===Plasma compatibility===\n[[File:Plasma donation compatibility path.svg|right|190px|thumb|'''Plasma compatibility chart'''<br />In addition to donating to the same blood group; plasma from type AB can be given to A, B and O; plasma from types A, B and AB can be given to O.]]\n[[Blood plasma]] compatibility is the inverse of red blood cell compatibility.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blood Component ABO Compatibility Chart Red Blood Cells and Plasma|url=http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu|website=Blood Bank Labsite|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref> Type AB plasma carries neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies and can be transfused to individuals of any blood group; but type AB patients can only receive type AB plasma.

Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients. However, these terms are only generally true with respect to possible reactions of the recipient's anti-A and anti-B antibodies to transfused red blood cells, and also possible sensitization to Rh D antigens. One exception is individuals with [[hh antigen system]] (also known as the Bombay phenotype) who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors, because they form antibodies against the H antigen present on all red blood cells.<ref>{{cite book |title=Harrison's Principals of Internal Medicine |last=Fauci |first=Anthony S. |author2=Eugene Braunwald |author3=Kurt J.

In general, while the plasma fraction of a blood transfusion may carry donor antibodies not found in the recipient, a significant reaction is unlikely because of dilution.\n\nAdditionally, red blood cell surface antigens other than A, B and Rh D, might cause adverse reactions and sensitization, if they can bind to the corresponding antibodies to generate an immune response.  Transfusions are further complicated because [[platelet]]s and [[white blood cell]]s (WBCs) have their own systems of surface antigens, and sensitization to platelet or WBC antigens can occur as a result of transfusion.\n\nFor transfusions of [[Plasma (blood)|plasma]], this situation is reversed.  Type O plasma, containing both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, can only be given to O recipients.  The antibodies will attack the antigens on any other blood type.  Conversely, AB plasma can be given to patients of any ABO blood group, because it does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies.\n\n==Blood typing==\n{{main|Blood typing}}\nTypically, blood type tests are performed through addition of a blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen. The presence of an antigen on the surface of the blood cells is indicated by [[Hemagglutination|agglutination]]. An alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at [[Imperial College London]] which makes use of [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[molecularly imprinted polymer]] nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Piletsky SS, Rabinowicz S, Yang Z, Piletska EV, Guerreiro A, Piletsky SA |title= Development of molecularly imprinted polymers specific for blood antigens for application in antibody-free blood typing |journal=Chemical Communications |volume= 53 |issue=11|year= 2017|doi= 10.1039/C6CC08716G|pmid= 27966700 | pages=1793\u201396}}</ref>  In these tests, rather than agglutination, a positive result is indicated by decolorization as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution.\n\n===Blood group genotyping===\nIn addition to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types, the progress in molecular diagnostics allows the increasing use of blood group genotyping. In contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype, genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens. This allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion, which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent allo-immunization.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anstee DJ |title=Red cell genotyping and the future of pretransfusion testing |journal=Blood |volume=114|issue=2|year= 2009|doi= 10.1182/blood-2008-11-146860|pmid=19411635| pages=248\u201356|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f5eef89dbbf7a0f33accfc2633d39868143ada4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Avent ND |title=Large-scale blood group genotyping: clinical implications |journal=Br J Haematol |volume=144|issue=1|year= 2009|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07285.x|pmid=19016734| pages=3\u201313}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBlood types were first discovered by an Austrian physician, [[Karl Landsteiner]], working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now [[Medical University of Vienna]]). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes, and not only that, some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Landsteiner K |title=Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe |journal=Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde und Infektionskrankheiten|volume=27 |issue= |pages=357\u2013362 |year=1900}}</ref> He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\n{{Quote|The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells, but also often those of human origin, from other individuals.

The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Landsteiner |first1=Karl |title=On Agglutination of Normal Human Blood |journal=Transfusion |date=1961 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5\u20138 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.1961.tb00005.x |orig-year=1901 |pmid=13758692| postscript=Originally published in German in ''Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift'', '''46''', 1132\u20131134}}</ref> This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930.

These differ from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential primaries and caucuses in that they do not appoint delegates to represent a candidate at the party's convention to select the party's presidential nominee. The party's nominee will be chosen directly by registered delegates at the [[2020 Libertarian National Convention]] from May 21\u201325, 2020 in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[2020 United States Presidential election]] will be the thirteenth contested presidential election that the Libertarian Party will participate in. The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] saw the highest vote total and percentage of votes for a Libertarian presidential ticket ever, with former [[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico governor]] [[Gary Johnson]] and his [[running mate]], former [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts governor]] [[Bill Weld]], receiving over four million votes and 3.28% of the total vote. During [[Gary Johnson 2016 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] in 2016, Johnson often stated that it would be his last run for the presidency.<ref>{{cite web

During [[Gary Johnson 2016 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] in 2016, Johnson often stated that it would be his last run for the presidency.<ref>{{cite web

''Bukit'' means \"[[hill]]\" in Malay, thus the name of the town gives the impression of it being hilly. ''Batok'', however, has several interpretations.\n\nOne version has it that, according to a [[Java (island)|Javanese]] village chief in the tiny village of Gassing, [[coconut]] trees grew on the hills in the area. Hence the name ''batok'', the Javanese term for coconuts.\n\nThe Chinese interpretation is that the hills were formed from solid [[granite]], which is called ''batu'' in Malay, and this was corrupted to ''bato'' and finally ''batok''. Another story has it that the hill resembles a [[skull]] top and ''batok'' could also be construed to mean \"skull top\".\n\nOthers believe that ''batok'', the Malay word for [[cough]], is linked to the place either because of its cool air (causing [[cough]]s and [[colds]]), or due to the sound of [[explosives]] historically used at its granite [[quarry]], Little Guilin.\n\n== History ==\n'''1928''': Bukit Batok was heavily dominated by rubber and pineapple plantations.\n\n'''1940''': At the start of the 1940s, industrialization began to gradually occur in Bukit Timah. Ford factory was one of the first factories to be built along Bukit Timah road near the current day\u2019s site.\n\n'''WWII''': In the early stages of the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II]], Bukit Batok became a significant ground for both the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] powers.<ref name=\"NLBBB\" /> The failed attempt by the [[British Armed Forces|British]] to defend the vicinity during the [[Battle of Bukit Timah]] and their subsequent surrender on 15 February 1942 to the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] at the [[Old Ford Motor Factory|Ford Motor Factory]] in present-day [[Hillview, Singapore|Hillview]] subzone was described by [[Winston Churchill]] as the \"[[Battle of Singapore#Fall of Singapore|largest capitulation]]\" in British military history.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Second World War (book series)|The Second World War]]|publisher=[[Random House|Pimlico]]|year=2002|isbn=9780712667029|edition=Abridged|location=[[London]]|author=[[Winston Churchill]]|origyear=1959}}</ref> Singapore consequently underwent four years of [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], which eventually ended following [[Operation Tiderace]] in early-September 1945.\n\nConsequently, the British\u2019s plans to industrialize Bukit Timah was short-lived and put to an abrupt halt during World War II. The factories that were built before 1942 were swiftly taken over by the Japanese during their occupation of Singapore. Ford Factory, which sits at the bottom of the Bukit Batok Hill, was occupied by Nissan, the Japanese Multination Corporation, to supply military vehicles for the Imperial Japanese Army Force. Both Bukit Batok hill (current day Bukit Batok Nature Park) and Bukit Timah hill were considered as strategic hill grounds (Figure 6) during the Japanese Occupation. These locations were key to controlling the surrounding areas and thus were the site of the fiercest battles of the war. In addition, Bukit Timah Hill was also the British Commonwealth\u2019s last line of defence against the Imperial Japanese Army Force.\n\n'''The Syonan Chureito Shrine'''\n\nFollowing the successful conquest of Singapore, General Yamashita ordered 500 Australian Prisoners of War to construct the Japanese war memorial, Syonan Chureito shrine, at the top of Bukit Batok Hill. Throughout the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese officials and military personnel would frequently worship their emperor in the Syonan Chureito shrine. In addition, footages of these ceremonies would be broadcast as propaganda in Japan to ensure the citizens\u2019 continuous support for the war. However, the shrine was ultimately destroyed by the Japanese themselves at the end of the World War II as they feared that the honour of the memorial would be tarnished by the returning British troops.\n\n'''Post-War''': After World War II, the British returned to Singapore. The areas around Ford Factory became known as the British\u2019s \u2018colonial estate factories\u2019 as the British resumed their plans to industrialize Bukit Timah.\nIn addition to the development of factories, Bukit Timah began to be extensively quarried for granite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sgurbex.blogspot.sg/2011/02/forsaken-quarry-of-west-and-mysterious.html?m=1|title=The Forsaken Quarry of the West And the Mysterious Shrine|date=23 February 2011|publisher=One-North Explorers|author=Aaron Chan}}</ref> The Poh Kim Quarry, which lies in the heart of Bukit Batok Nature Park today, was one of the quarry sites in the vicinity. It was quarried for granite between the 1950s to the 1970s but was later abandoned due to the damage that the activities was causing to the earth\u2019s core.\n\n'''1965-1975''': After Singapore gained independence in 1965, the newly formed People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) government aggressively promoted the site as a lightweight industrial area. \n \n'''1975-''': Development of Bukit Batok New Town began in December 1975,<ref name=\"BBT\" /> transforming the former quarrying village into a self-sustainable new town in the rough span of a decade.<ref name=\"NLBBB\" /> As a testament to its heritage, several norite formations and [[ridge]]s remained preserved, most of which can be found at both [[Bukit Batok Nature Park]] and [[Bukit Batok Town Park]] as a characteristic feature of the modern-day town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19810916-1.2.54.aspx|title=Bukit Batok to have 26,000 flats|date=16 September 1981|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19810916-1.2.3.aspx|title=New HDB estate|date=16 September 1981|publisher=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]]}}</ref>\n\nEarthworks to build Bukit Batok started in 1979.

It offers a golf driving range, swimming pool, bowling alley and sports facilities for relatively affordable prices.\n\nThe Civil Service Club Bukit Batok Clubhouse offers swimming, bowling and related recreational facilities to civil servants, their families and the public. It is located near Bukit Batok Town Centre and was opened on 1 March 2006.\n\n==Politics==\nThe jurisdiction of Bukit Batok is shared by the [[Jurong Group Representation Constituency]] (Jurong GRC), which has an office at Bukit Batok Central and manages much of Bukit Batok; and [[Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency]] (Chua Chu Kang GRC), which manages areas north of Bukit Batok West Avenue 3 and Bukit Batok Central. There are four [[Members of the Singapore Parliament|members of Parliament]], two from each GRC, representing various areas in Bukit Batok.\n\nBukit Batok was a single-member constituency by itself prior to the [[1991 Singaporean general election|1991 elections]], which was later mainly consolidated into Jurong GRC until in the [[2015 Singaporean general election|2015 elections]], where it carved out as a SMC again.

''Bukit'' means \"[[hill]]\" in Malay, thus the name of the town gives the impression of it being hilly. ''Batok'', however, has several interpretations.\n\nOne version has it that, according to a [[Java (island)|Javanese]] village chief in the tiny village of Gassing, [[coconut]] trees grew on the hills in the area. Hence the name ''batok'', the Javanese term for coconuts.\n\nThe Chinese interpretation is that the hills were formed from solid [[granite]], which is called ''batu'' in Malay, and this was corrupted to ''bato'' and finally ''batok''. Another story has it that the hill resembles a [[skull]] top and ''batok'' could also be construed to mean \"skull top\".\n\nOthers believe that ''batok'', the Malay word for [[cough]], is linked to the place either because of its cool air (causing [[cough]]s and [[colds]]), or due to the sound of [[explosives]] historically used at its granite [[quarry]], Little Guilin.\n\n== History ==\n'''1928''': Bukit Batok was heavily dominated by rubber and pineapple plantations.\n\n'''1940''': At the start of the 1940s, industrialization began to gradually occur in Bukit Timah. Ford factory was one of the first factories to be built along Bukit Timah road near the current day\u2019s site.\n\n'''WWII''': In the early stages of the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II]], Bukit Batok became a significant ground for both the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] powers.<ref name=\"NLBBB\" /> The failed attempt by the [[British Armed Forces|British]] to defend the vicinity during the [[Battle of Bukit Timah]] and their subsequent surrender on 15 February 1942 to the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] at the [[Old Ford Motor Factory|Ford Motor Factory]] in present-day [[Hillview, Singapore|Hillview]] subzone was described by [[Winston Churchill]] as the \"[[Battle of Singapore#Fall of Singapore|largest capitulation]]\" in British military history.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Second World War (book series)|The Second World War]]|publisher=[[Random House|Pimlico]]|year=2002|isbn=9780712667029|edition=Abridged|location=[[London]]|author=[[Winston Churchill]]|origyear=1959}}</ref> Singapore consequently underwent four years of [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], which eventually ended following [[Operation Tiderace]] in early-September 1945.\n\nConsequently, the British\u2019s plans to industrialize Bukit Timah was short-lived and put to an abrupt halt during World War II. The factories that were built before 1942 were swiftly taken over by the Japanese during their occupation of Singapore. Ford Factory, which sits at the bottom of the Bukit Batok Hill, was occupied by Nissan, the Japanese Multination Corporation, to supply military vehicles for the Imperial Japanese Army Force. Both Bukit Batok hill (current day Bukit Batok Nature Park) and Bukit Timah hill were considered as strategic hill grounds (Figure 6) during the Japanese Occupation. These locations were key to controlling the surrounding areas and thus were the site of the fiercest battles of the war. In addition, Bukit Timah Hill was also the British Commonwealth\u2019s last line of defence against the Imperial Japanese Army Force.\n\n'''The Syonan Chureito Shrine'''\n\nFollowing the successful conquest of Singapore, General Yamashita ordered 500 Australian Prisoners of War to construct the Japanese war memorial, Syonan Chureito shrine, at the top of Bukit Batok Hill. Throughout the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese officials and military personnel would frequently worship their emperor in the Syonan Chureito shrine. In addition, footages of these ceremonies would be broadcast as propaganda in Japan to ensure the citizens\u2019 continuous support for the war. However, the shrine was ultimately destroyed by the Japanese themselves at the end of the World War II as they feared that the honour of the memorial would be tarnished by the returning British troops.\n\n'''Post-War''': After World War II, the British returned to Singapore. The areas around Ford Factory became known as the British\u2019s \u2018colonial estate factories\u2019 as the British resumed their plans to industrialize Bukit Timah.\nIn addition to the development of factories, Bukit Timah began to be extensively quarried for granite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sgurbex.blogspot.sg/2011/02/forsaken-quarry-of-west-and-mysterious.html?m=1|title=The Forsaken Quarry of the West And the Mysterious Shrine|date=23 February 2011|publisher=One-North Explorers|author=Aaron Chan}}</ref> The Poh Kim Quarry, which lies in the heart of Bukit Batok Nature Park today, was one of the quarry sites in the vicinity. It was quarried for granite between the 1950s to the 1970s but was later abandoned due to the damage that the activities was causing to the earth\u2019s core.\n\n'''1965-1975''': After Singapore gained independence in 1965, the newly formed People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) government aggressively promoted the site as a lightweight industrial area. \n \n'''1975-''': Development of Bukit Batok New Town began in December 1975,<ref name=\"BBT\" /> transforming the former quarrying village into a self-sustainable new town in the rough span of a decade.<ref name=\"NLBBB\" /> As a testament to its heritage, several norite formations and [[ridge]]s remained preserved, most of which can be found at both [[Bukit Batok Nature Park]] and [[Bukit Batok Town Park]] as a characteristic feature of the modern-day town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19810916-1.2.54.aspx|title=Bukit Batok to have 26,000 flats|date=16 September 1981|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19810916-1.2.3.aspx|title=New HDB estate|date=16 September 1981|publisher=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]]}}</ref>\n\nEarthworks to build Bukit Batok started in 1979.

From November 1963 to January 1964, Buhari attended the Platoon Commanders' Course at the Nigerian Military Training College, [[Kaduna]]. In 1964, he facilitated his military training by attending the Mechanical Transport Officer's Course at the Army Mechanical Transport School in Borden, [[United Kingdom]]. From 1965 to 1967, Buhari served as commander of the Second Infantry Battalion and appointed [[brigade major]], Second Sector, First Infantry Division, April 1967 to July 1967.\n\n=== Civil war ===\nBuhari was assigned to the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1st Division]] under the command of Lt.

However, before the move to Enugu, he was posted to Nsukka as Brigade Major of the 3rd Infantry Brigade under Joshua Gin who would later become battle fatigued and replaced by Isa Bukar.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} Buhari stayed with the infantry for a few months as the Nigerian army began to adjust tactics learnt from early battle experiences. Instead of swift advances, the new tactics involved securing and holding on to the lines of communications and using captured towns as training ground to train new recruits brought in from the army depots in [[Abeokuta]] and Zaria.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} In 1968, he was posted to the 4 Sector also called the Awka sector which was charged to take over the capture of Onitsha from Division 2.

At the time of the coup plot, Buhari was the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Third Armoured Division of [[Jos]].<ref>Matthews, Martin P. ''Nigeria: current issues and historical background.'' p. 121.</ref> With the successful execution of the coup by General Buhari, [[Tunde Idiagbon]] was appointed Chief of General Staff (the de facto No. 2 in the administration). The coup ended Nigeria's short-lived [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]], a period of multi-party [[democracy]] started in 1979. \n\nAccording to ''The New York Times'', the officers who took power argued that \"a flawed democracy was worse than no democracy at all\". Buhari justified the military's seizure of power by castigating the civilian government as hopelessly corrupt and promptly suspended the [[Constitution of Nigeria|constitution]]. Another rationale for the coup was to correct economic decline in Nigeria. Sani Abacha in the military's first broadcast after the coup linked ' an inept and corrupt leadership'{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}} with general economic decline. In Buhari's New Year day speech, he too mentioned the corrupt class of the [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]] but also as the cause of a general decline in morality in the society.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}}\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nThe structure of the new military leadership which was also the fifth in Nigeria since independence resembled the last military regime, the Obasanjo/Yaradua administration. The new regime established a Supreme Military Council, a Federal Executive Council and a Council of States.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=150}} The number of ministries was trimmed to 18 while the administration carried out a retrenchment exercise among the senior ranks of the civil service and police. It retired 17 permanent secretaries and some senior police and naval officers. In addition, the new military administration promulgated new laws to achieve its aim. These laws included the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Decree for the prosecution of armed robbery cases, the State Security (Detention of Person) Decree which gave powers to the military to detain individuals suspected of jeopardizing state security or causing economic adversity.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}} Other decrees included the Civil Service Commission and Public Offenders Decree which constituted the legal and administrative basis to conduct a purge in the civil service.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}} \n\nAccording to Decree Number 2 of 1984, the state security and the chief of staff were given the power to detain, without charges, individuals deemed to be a security risk to the state for up to three months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ab5d3c.html|title=Nigeria: Repeal of Decree 2|date=1 October 1998|website=refworld.org|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref> Strikes and popular demonstrations were banned and Nigeria's security agency, the [[National Security Organization]] (NSO) was entrusted with unprecedented powers.

From November 1963 to January 1964, Buhari attended the Platoon Commanders' Course at the Nigerian Military Training College, [[Kaduna]]. In 1964, he facilitated his military training by attending the Mechanical Transport Officer's Course at the Army Mechanical Transport School in Borden, [[United Kingdom]]. From 1965 to 1967, Buhari served as commander of the Second Infantry Battalion and appointed [[brigade major]], Second Sector, First Infantry Division, April 1967 to July 1967.\n\n=== Civil war ===\nBuhari was assigned to the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1st Division]] under the command of Lt.

However, before the move to Enugu, he was posted to Nsukka as Brigade Major of the 3rd Infantry Brigade under Joshua Gin who would later become battle fatigued and replaced by Isa Bukar.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} Buhari stayed with the infantry for a few months as the Nigerian army began to adjust tactics learnt from early battle experiences. Instead of swift advances, the new tactics involved securing and holding on to the lines of communications and using captured towns as training ground to train new recruits brought in from the army depots in [[Abeokuta]] and Zaria.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} In 1968, he was posted to the 4 Sector also called the Awka sector which was charged to take over the capture of Onitsha from Division 2.

''Nigeria: current issues and historical background.'' p. 121.</ref> With the successful execution of the coup by General Buhari, [[Tunde Idiagbon]] was appointed Chief of General Staff (the de facto No. 2 in the administration). The coup ended Nigeria's short-lived [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]], a period of multi-party [[democracy]] started in 1979. \n\nAccording to ''The New York Times'', the officers who took power argued that \"a flawed democracy was worse than no democracy at all\". Buhari justified the military's seizure of power by castigating the civilian government as hopelessly corrupt and promptly suspended the [[Constitution of Nigeria|constitution]]. Another rationale for the coup was to correct economic decline in Nigeria. Sani Abacha in the military's first broadcast after the coup linked ' an inept and corrupt leadership'{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}} with general economic decline. In Buhari's New Year day speech, he too mentioned the corrupt class of the [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]] but also as the cause of a general decline in morality in the society.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}}\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nThe structure of the new military leadership which was also the fifth in Nigeria since independence resembled the last military regime, the Obasanjo/Yaradua administration. The new regime established a Supreme Military Council, a Federal Executive Council and a Council of States.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=150}} The number of ministries was trimmed to 18 while the administration carried out a retrenchment exercise among the senior ranks of the civil service and police. It retired 17 permanent secretaries and some senior police and naval officers. In addition, the new military administration promulgated new laws to achieve its aim. These laws included the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Decree for the prosecution of armed robbery cases, the State Security (Detention of Person) Decree which gave powers to the military to detain individuals suspected of jeopardizing state security or causing economic adversity.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}} Other decrees included the Civil Service Commission and Public Offenders Decree which constituted the legal and administrative basis to conduct a purge in the civil service.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}} \n\nAccording to Decree Number 2 of 1984, the state security and the chief of staff were given the power to detain, without charges, individuals deemed to be a security risk to the state for up to three months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ab5d3c.html|title=Nigeria: Repeal of Decree 2|date=1 October 1998|website=refworld.org|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref> Strikes and popular demonstrations were banned and Nigeria's security agency, the [[National Security Organization]] (NSO) was entrusted with unprecedented powers.
