Of the operations against national minorities, the [[Polish Operation of the NKVD]] was the largest one, second only to the \"Kulak Operation\" in terms of number of victims.

Historians debate the causes of the purge, such as Stalin's paranoia, or his desire to remove dissenters from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] or to consolidate his authority.  The purges began in the Red Army, and the techniques developed there were quickly adapted to purges in other sectors.<ref>Peter Whitewood,  \"The Purge of the Red Army and the Soviet Mass Operations, 1937\u201338.\" ''Slavonic & East European Review'' 93.2 (2015): 286-314. [http://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/958/1/slaveasteurorev2.93.2.0286.pdf online]</ref>  Most public attention was focused on the [[purge (communist)|purge]] of certain parts of the leadership of the Communist Party, as well as of government bureaucrats and leaders of the armed forces, most of whom were Party members. The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as \"too rich for a peasant\" ([[kulak]]s), and professionals.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=250,&nbsp;257\u20138}} A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"[[fifth column]]\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the [[Polish Military Organisation]] and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Soviet citizens of Polish origin]].\n\nAccording to [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 speech, \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]\", and historian Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow show trial]]s, were based on [[forced confession]]s, often obtained through [[torture]],{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=121 which cites his secret speech}} and on loose interpretations of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by [[NKVD troika]]s.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=286}}\n\nHundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, [[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], [[sabotage]], [[anti-Soviet agitation]], conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups); they were quickly executed by shooting, or sent to the [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. In Moscow, the use of [[Soviet gas van|gas van]]s used to kill the victims during their transportation to the [[Butovo firing range|Butovo firing range was documented]].<ref group=note>This information was published first in 1990 in a [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] article (October 28, 1990, p. 2).

The campaigns were carried out according to the [[general line (party)|general line]], often by direct orders of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Politburo]] headed by Stalin.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nFrom 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \"social disorder\" caused by the upheavals of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization of peasants]] and the resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933|famine of 1932\u20131933]], as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\" (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).<ref name=werth/>\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leon Trotsky]], in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union.]]\nThe term \"[[purge]]\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression ''purge of the Party ranks''. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.\n\nThe political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], respectively. Following the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \"temporary\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The [[Ryutin Affair]] seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending [[democratic centralism]].\n\nIn the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \"old guard\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Kun]], as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \"heretical\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before [[Leon Trotsky#Assassination|killing]] him in Mexico; the NKVD agent [[Ram\u00f3n Mercader]] was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], under the personal orders of Stalin.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|2000|pp=86\u20137}}\n\n[[Image:Sergei Kirov and Joseph Stalin, 1934.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] party leader [[Sergey Kirov|Sergei Kirov]] with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] (and his daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]) in 1934.]]\nIn 1934, Stalin used the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]] as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see {{section link||Number of people executed}}). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}} Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|1934 Party Congress]] elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.\n\nAnother justification for the purge was to remove any possible \"fifth column\" in case of a war. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]], participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=239}} Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan. The Soviet press portrayed the country as threatened from within by fascist spies.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}}\n\nFrom the [[October Revolution]]{{sfn|Gellately|2007}} onward,<ref>Robert Gellately, ''Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'', 2007, Knopf, 720 pages. {{ISBN|1-4000-4005-1}}</ref> Lenin had used repression against perceived enemies of the Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating social control, especially during the campaign commonly referred to as the [[Red Terror]]. This policy continued and intensified under Stalin, periods of heightened repression including the [[Dekulakization|deportation of kulaks]] who opposed collectivization, and a severe famine in Ukraine.

Among other accusations, they were incriminated with the assassination of Kirov and plotting to kill Stalin.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} After confessing to the charges, all were sentenced to death and executed.<ref name=\":0\">Rogovin (1998), pp. 36\u201338</ref>\n*The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures known as the \"anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre\" which included [[Karl Radek]], [[Yuri Piatakov]] and [[Grigory Sokolnikov]], and were accused of plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.\n*There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937.\n\n[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]]]]\nSome Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament [[D.N. Pritt]], for example, wrote: \"Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties\", but \"once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted\".\n\nIt is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [[OGPU]] officer [[Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.\n\nZinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \"confessing\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \"commission\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=87}}\n\n====Dewey Commission====\n[[File:Vassily Blokhin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The chief executioner of the NKVD, [[Vasili Blokhin]], carried out some of the high-profile executions during the purges.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]]. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=137}}\n\nFor example, [[Georgy Pyatakov]] testified that he had flown to [[Oslo]] in December 1935 to \"receive terrorist instructions\" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Not guilty : report of the Commission of Inquiry Into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials|last=Dewey|first=John|publisher=Sam Sloan and Ishi Press International|others=1859-1952|year=2008|isbn=978-0923891312|location=New York|pages=154\u2013155|oclc=843206645}}</ref> Another defendant, [[Ivan N. Smirnov|Ivan Smirnov]], confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.\n\nThe Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled ''Not Guilty''. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote:\n{{quote|Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:\n*That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain the truth.\n*That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to obtain them.\n*That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.}}\n\nThe commission concluded: \"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\"\n\n====Implication of the Rightists====\nIn the second trial, Karl Radek testified that there was a \"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937</ref> as well as \"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\"{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=164}}\n\nBy the \"third organization\", he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the [[Right Opposition|Rightists]], led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:\n\n{{quote|I feel guilty of one thing more: even after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted Bukharin himself to lay down his arms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\n===Third Moscow Trial===\n[[File:1934 agranov yagoda unknown redens.jpg|thumb|NKVD chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions:  From l. to r.: [[Yakov Agranov]]; [[Genrikh Yagoda]]; unknown; [[Stanislav Redens]]. All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed.]]\nThe third and final trial, in March 1938, known as [[The Trial of the Twenty-One]], is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the [[Communist International]], former premier [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] and [[Genrikh Yagoda]], recently disgraced head of the NKVD.\n\nThe fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder [[Maxim Gorky]] by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.\n\nEven previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\">Corey Robin, \"Fear\", Page 96</ref> For some prominent communists such as [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Jay Lovestone]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Heinrich Brandler]], the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually.<ref>Bertram David Wolfe, \"Breaking with communism\", p. 10</ref>{{sfn|Koestler|1940|p=258}} To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the\ndepredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\"/>\n\nThe preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov.\n\n====Bukharin's confession====\n[[File:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Nikolai Bukharin]], Russian [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] executed in 1938]]\nOn the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \"special measures\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=352}}\n\n[[Anastas Mikoyan]] and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order \"beating permitted\", and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \"star\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \"methods of physical influence\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=364\u20135}}\n\nBukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror''. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \"sum total of crimes\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.\n\nThe result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \"degenerate fascist\" working for \"restoration of capitalism\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin \"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case\".<ref>Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, 21 March 1938</ref> He continued by saying that \"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\" in a trial that was solely based on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words: \"the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.\"<ref>Robert Tucker, \"Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Block of Rights and Trotskyites\", pp. 667\u201368</ref>\n\n[[Romain Rolland]] and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in [[Medvedev Forest massacre|NKVD prisoner massacres]] in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, [[Anna Larina]], was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] a half-century later by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.\n\n==\"De-kulakization\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\"==\nOn 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and \"criminals\" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of \"suspect\" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the \"kulak and criminal elements\" among the two categories are not clear.\n\nOn 30 July 1937 the [[NKVD Order no. 00447]] was issued, directed against \"ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\" (such as former officials of the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist regime]], former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.\n\nThe following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: \"ex-kulaks\" previously deported to \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" in inhospitable parts of the country ([[Siberia]], [[Urals]], Kazakhstan, [[Extreme North (Russia)|Far North]]), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the [[White Army]], participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \"socially harmful elements\". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, [[kolkhoz]] peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the \"Kulak Operation\" just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937\u20131938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to \"sabotage\" or \"wrecking\" (Werth, 2009).\n\n[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|170px|thumb|[[Yevgeny Miller|Yevgeny-Ludvig Karlovich Miller]], one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later.]]\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox clergy]], including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \"special settlers\" (''spetzpereselentsy'') who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \"enemies\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nCommon criminals such as thieves, \"violators of the passport regime\", etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the [[Butovo firing range]] were charged with a non-political criminal offence.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nAs soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people \"to be repressed\" by 120,000 (63,000 \"in the first category\" and 57,000 \"in the second category\"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed.\n\nThe police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD \u2013 approximately 25,000 officers \u2013 were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or [[Komsomol]] ([[Young Communist League]]) members.\n\nEvery NKVD local unit had a \"casework minimum\" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to \"unmask conspiracies\". The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged \"counter-revolutionary\" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession.\n\nAfter the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in secluded areas run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.<ref>[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=2-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)]</ref><ref>[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=3-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)]</ref>\n\nThe \"Kulak Operation\" was largest single campaign of repression in 1937\u201338, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sge44FaZDREC&pg=PA240 240]}}\n\n==Campaigns targeting nationalities==\n{{Main|Mass operations of the NKVD}}\n[[File:Izrail Pliner NKVD.jpg|alt=|thumb|186x186px|[[Israel Pliner|Israil Pliner]]; (1896-1939)  chief of [[Gulag]] [[NKVD]] (1937-1938), later arrested and executed]]\nA series of [[mass operations of the NKVD]] was carried out from 1937 through 1938 until the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, based on NKVD directives against the so-called diversionist element, according to the notion of the \"hostile capitalist surrounding\" as defined by Nikolai Yezhov. \n\nThe [[Polish operation of the NKVD]] was the largest of this kind.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=103\u2013104}} The Polish operation claimed the largest number of the NKVD victims: 143,810 arrests and 111,091 executions according to records.

Knickerbocker also wrote about dekulakization: \"It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years.\"<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA133#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions on the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=133\u2013134| isbn=9781417992775 }}</ref>\n\nEvidence and the results of research began to appear after Stalin's death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges.

In his secret speech to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \"abuse of power\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\"[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]\") in 1957. The former Politburo members [[Yan Rudzutak]] and [[Stanislav Kosior]] and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to [[Marxist theory]], was never rehabilitated by the USSR.

They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956\u20131957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky ''et al.'' should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \"evidence\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \"use of physical influence\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\".\n\nThe second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\"[[Shvernik Commission]]\"). It included [[Alexander Shelepin|Shelepin]], Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \"spy\", etc.). The commission stated:\n\n<blockquote>Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov....{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}</blockquote>\n\nMolotov stated \"We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value.

According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \"Old Bolsheviks\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).<ref name=werth>{{cite web|first=Nicolas|last=Werth |authorlink=Nicolas Werth|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/nkvd-mass-secret-national-operations-august-1937-november-1938|title=Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)|publisher=Mass Violence and Resistance \u2013 Research Network|date=15 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \"rather large holes in the traditional story\" weaved by Conquest and others.{{sfn|Harris|2017|pp=2\u20134}} His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.{{sfn|Harris|2017|p=16}}\n\n<blockquote>So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163498|title=Historian James Harris says Russian archives show we've misunderstood Stalin|last=Harris |first=James |date=July 26, 2016 |website=[[History News Network]]|access-date=December 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians.  One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position.  Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that,  Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army.<ref>James Harris, \"Encircled by Enemies: Stalin\u2019s Perceptions of the Capitalist World, 1918\u20131941,\u201d ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 30#3 [2007]: 513\u2013545.</ref> It was not a ploy \u2013 Stalin truly believed it. \u201cStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\u201d; thus \u201cStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign\u2010backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\u201d  The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed.

Together these two actions accounted for nine-tenths of the death sentences and three-fourths of [[Gulag]] sentences. Of the operations against national minorities, the [[Polish Operation of the NKVD]] was the largest one, second only to the \"Kulak Operation\" in terms of number of victims. According to historian [[Timothy Snyder]], ethnic Poles constituted the largest group of victims in the Great Terror, comprising less than 0.5% of the country's population but comprising 12.5% of those executed.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

Historians debate the causes of the purge, such as Stalin's paranoia, or his desire to remove dissenters from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] or to consolidate his authority.  The purges began in the Red Army, and the techniques developed there were quickly adapted to purges in other sectors.<ref>Peter Whitewood,  \"The Purge of the Red Army and the Soviet Mass Operations, 1937\u201338.\" ''Slavonic & East European Review'' 93.2 (2015): 286-314.

The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as \"too rich for a peasant\" ([[kulak]]s), and professionals.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=250,&nbsp;257\u20138}} A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"[[fifth column]]\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the [[Polish Military Organisation]] and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Soviet citizens of Polish origin]].\n\nAccording to [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 speech, \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]\", and historian Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow show trial]]s, were based on [[forced confession]]s, often obtained through [[torture]],{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=121 which cites his secret speech}} and on loose interpretations of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by [[NKVD troika]]s.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=286}}\n\nHundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, [[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], [[sabotage]], [[anti-Soviet agitation]], conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups); they were quickly executed by shooting, or sent to the [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis.

The campaigns were carried out according to the [[general line (party)|general line]], often by direct orders of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Politburo]] headed by Stalin.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nFrom 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \"social disorder\" caused by the upheavals of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization of peasants]] and the resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933|famine of 1932\u20131933]], as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\" (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).<ref name=werth/>\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leon Trotsky]], in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union.]]\nThe term \"[[purge]]\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression ''purge of the Party ranks''. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.\n\nThe political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], respectively. Following the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \"temporary\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The [[Ryutin Affair]] seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending [[democratic centralism]].\n\nIn the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \"old guard\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Kun]], as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \"heretical\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before [[Leon Trotsky#Assassination|killing]] him in Mexico; the NKVD agent [[Ram\u00f3n Mercader]] was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], under the personal orders of Stalin.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|2000|pp=86\u20137}}\n\n[[Image:Sergei Kirov and Joseph Stalin, 1934.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] party leader [[Sergey Kirov|Sergei Kirov]] with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] (and his daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]) in 1934.]]\nIn 1934, Stalin used the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]] as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see {{section link||Number of people executed}}). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}} Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|1934 Party Congress]] elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.\n\nAnother justification for the purge was to remove any possible \"fifth column\" in case of a war. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]], participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=239}} Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan.

These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.\n\n*The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called \"Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc\",{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} held in August 1936,<ref>Rogovin (1998), pp. 17\u201318</ref> at which the chief defendants were [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], two of the most prominent former party leaders.

Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.\n*There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937.\n\n[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]]]]\nSome Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament [[D.N. Pritt]], for example, wrote: \"Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties\", but \"once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted\".\n\nIt is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [[OGPU]] officer [[Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.\n\nZinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \"confessing\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \"commission\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=87}}\n\n====Dewey Commission====\n[[File:Vassily Blokhin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The chief executioner of the NKVD, [[Vasili Blokhin]], carried out some of the high-profile executions during the purges.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]]. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=137}}\n\nFor example, [[Georgy Pyatakov]] testified that he had flown to [[Oslo]] in December 1935 to \"receive terrorist instructions\" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Not guilty : report of the Commission of Inquiry Into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials|last=Dewey|first=John|publisher=Sam Sloan and Ishi Press International|others=1859-1952|year=2008|isbn=978-0923891312|location=New York|pages=154\u2013155|oclc=843206645}}</ref> Another defendant, [[Ivan N. Smirnov|Ivan Smirnov]], confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.\n\nThe Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled ''Not Guilty''. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote:\n{{quote|Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:\n*That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain the truth.\n*That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to obtain them.\n*That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.}}\n\nThe commission concluded: \"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\"\n\n====Implication of the Rightists====\nIn the second trial, Karl Radek testified that there was a \"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937</ref> as well as \"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\"{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=164}}\n\nBy the \"third organization\", he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the [[Right Opposition|Rightists]], led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:\n\n{{quote|I feel guilty of one thing more: even after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted Bukharin himself to lay down his arms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\n===Third Moscow Trial===\n[[File:1934 agranov yagoda unknown redens.jpg|thumb|NKVD chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions:  From l. to r.: [[Yakov Agranov]]; [[Genrikh Yagoda]]; unknown; [[Stanislav Redens]]. All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed.]]\nThe third and final trial, in March 1938, known as [[The Trial of the Twenty-One]], is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the [[Communist International]], former premier [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] and [[Genrikh Yagoda]], recently disgraced head of the NKVD.\n\nThe fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder [[Maxim Gorky]] by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.\n\nEven previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\">Corey Robin, \"Fear\", Page 96</ref> For some prominent communists such as [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Jay Lovestone]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Heinrich Brandler]], the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually.<ref>Bertram David Wolfe, \"Breaking with communism\", p. 10</ref>{{sfn|Koestler|1940|p=258}} To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the\ndepredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\"/>\n\nThe preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov.\n\n====Bukharin's confession====\n[[File:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Nikolai Bukharin]], Russian [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] executed in 1938]]\nOn the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \"special measures\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=352}}\n\n[[Anastas Mikoyan]] and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order \"beating permitted\", and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \"star\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \"methods of physical influence\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=364\u20135}}\n\nBukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror''. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \"sum total of crimes\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.\n\nThe result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \"degenerate fascist\" working for \"restoration of capitalism\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin \"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case\".<ref>Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, 21 March 1938</ref> He continued by saying that \"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\" in a trial that was solely based on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words: \"the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.\"<ref>Robert Tucker, \"Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Block of Rights and Trotskyites\", pp. 667\u201368</ref>\n\n[[Romain Rolland]] and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in [[Medvedev Forest massacre|NKVD prisoner massacres]] in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, [[Anna Larina]], was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] a half-century later by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.\n\n==\"De-kulakization\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\"==\nOn 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and \"criminals\" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of \"suspect\" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the \"kulak and criminal elements\" among the two categories are not clear.\n\nOn 30 July 1937 the [[NKVD Order no. 00447]] was issued, directed against \"ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\" (such as former officials of the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist regime]], former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.\n\nThe following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: \"ex-kulaks\" previously deported to \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" in inhospitable parts of the country ([[Siberia]], [[Urals]], Kazakhstan, [[Extreme North (Russia)|Far North]]), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the [[White Army]], participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \"socially harmful elements\". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, [[kolkhoz]] peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the \"Kulak Operation\" just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937\u20131938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to \"sabotage\" or \"wrecking\" (Werth, 2009).\n\n[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|170px|thumb|[[Yevgeny Miller|Yevgeny-Ludvig Karlovich Miller]], one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later.]]\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox clergy]], including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \"special settlers\" (''spetzpereselentsy'') who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \"enemies\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nCommon criminals such as thieves, \"violators of the passport regime\", etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the [[Butovo firing range]] were charged with a non-political criminal offence.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nAs soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people \"to be repressed\" by 120,000 (63,000 \"in the first category\" and 57,000 \"in the second category\"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed.\n\nThe police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD \u2013 approximately 25,000 officers \u2013 were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or [[Komsomol]] ([[Young Communist League]]) members.\n\nEvery NKVD local unit had a \"casework minimum\" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to \"unmask conspiracies\". The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged \"counter-revolutionary\" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession.\n\nAfter the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused.

Lavrentiy Beria, a fellow Georgian and Stalin confidant, succeeded him as head of NKVD. On 17 November 1938 a joint decree of [[Sovnarkom]] USSR and [[Central Committee]] of VKP(b) ([[Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation]]) and the subsequent order of NKVD undersigned by Beria, cancelled most of the [[Mass operations of the NKVD|NKVD orders of systematic repression]] and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree signaled the end of massive Soviet purges.{{Sfn|Hedeler, Wladislaw|Rosenblum, Nadja 2001|p=23}}\n\nNevertheless, the practice of mass arrest and exile continued until Stalin's death in 1953. Political executions also continued, but, with the exception of [[Katyn Massacre|Katyn]] and other [[NKVD prisoner massacres|NKVD massacres]] during [[World War II]], on a vastly smaller scale. One notorious example is the \"[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]\", in which at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed on 12 August 1952. Historians such as [[Michael Parrish]] have argued that while the Great Terror ended in 1938, a lesser terror continued in the 1940s.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=32}} [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (a Soviet Army officer who became a prisoner for a decade in the Gulag system) presents in ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' the most holistic view of the timeline of ''all'' the Leninist and Stalinist purges (1918\u20131956), in which the 1936\u20131938 purge may have been simply the one that got the most attention from people in a position to record its magnitude for posterity\u2014the intelligentsia\u2014by directly targeting them, whereas several other waves of the ongoing flow of purges, such as the [[first five-year plan|1928\u20131933 collectivization and dekulakization]], were just as huge and just as devoid of justice but were more successfully swallowed into oblivion in the popular memory of the (surviving) Soviet public.{{sfn|Solzhenitsyn|1973}} For example, in one such passage Solzhenitsyn mentions 1938 and says that 1948 was in some ways hardly better.\n\nIn some cases, high military command arrested under Yezhov were later executed under Beria.

He called them in 1941 \"the great purges\", and described how over four years they affected \"the top fourth or fifth, to estimate it conservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air Force leaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the foremost technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists\". Knickerbocker also wrote about dekulakization: \"It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years.\"<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA133#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions on the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=133\u2013134| isbn=9781417992775 }}</ref>\n\nEvidence and the results of research began to appear after Stalin's death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges. The first of these sources were the revelations of Nikita Khrushchev, which particularly affected the American editors of the [[Communist Party USA]] newspaper, the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', who, following the lead of ''The New York Times'', published the [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] in full.<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/hf/onleave.htm On Leaving the Communist Party] by Howard Fast, 16 November 1957</ref>\n\n==Rehabilitation==\n{{Main|Rehabilitation (Soviet)}}\n[[Image:USSR stamp M.Tukhachevsky 1963 4k.jpg|thumb|right|Posthumously rehabilitated, Tukhachevsky on a 1963 postage stamp of the Soviet Union]]\n[[File:WP 20130802 006.jpg|thumb|Monument to victims of the repressions in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia]]\nThe Great Purge was denounced by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev following Stalin's death. In his secret speech to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \"abuse of power\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\"[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]\") in 1957. The former Politburo members [[Yan Rudzutak]] and [[Stanislav Kosior]] and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to [[Marxist theory]], was never rehabilitated by the USSR. The book ''Rehabilitation: The Political Processes of the 1930s\u201350s'' (\u0420\u0435\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u044b 30-50-\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432) (1991) contains a large amount of newly presented original archive material: transcripts of interrogations, letters of convicts, and photos.

They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956\u20131957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky ''et al.'' should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \"evidence\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \"use of physical influence\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\".\n\nThe second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\"[[Shvernik Commission]]\"). It included [[Alexander Shelepin|Shelepin]], Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \"spy\", etc.). The commission stated:\n\n<blockquote>Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov....{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}</blockquote>\n\nMolotov stated \"We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value.

In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former [[Solovki prison camp]] in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all \"the victims of political repression\" since 1917.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/17/russia.gulag.grave/index.html \"Pictorial essay: Death trenches bear witness to Stalin's purges\"] [[CNN]], 17 July 1997</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2131954.stm \"Mass grave found at Ukrainian monastery\"], [[BBC]], 12 July 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1010/p01s02-woeu.html \"Wary of its past, Russia ignores mass grave site\"], by [[Fred Weir]], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 October 2002</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6584HJ20100609 Stalin-era mass grave yields tons of bones] [[Reuters]]. 9 June 2010</ref> Some, such as the killing fields [[Bykivnia]] near [[Kiev]], are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/battles.htm#Bykivnia|title=WAR STATS REDIRECT|publisher=erols.com}}</ref>{{Better source|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism.

According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \"Old Bolsheviks\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).<ref name=werth>{{cite web|first=Nicolas|last=Werth |authorlink=Nicolas Werth|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/nkvd-mass-secret-national-operations-august-1937-november-1938|title=Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)|publisher=Mass Violence and Resistance \u2013 Research Network|date=15 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \"rather large holes in the traditional story\" weaved by Conquest and others.{{sfn|Harris|2017|pp=2\u20134}} His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.{{sfn|Harris|2017|p=16}}\n\n<blockquote>So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163498|title=Historian James Harris says Russian archives show we've misunderstood Stalin|last=Harris |first=James |date=July 26, 2016 |website=[[History News Network]]|access-date=December 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians.  One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position.  Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that,  Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army.<ref>James Harris, \"Encircled by Enemies: Stalin\u2019s Perceptions of the Capitalist World, 1918\u20131941,\u201d ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 30#3 [2007]: 513\u2013545.</ref> It was not a ploy \u2013 Stalin truly believed it. \u201cStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\u201d; thus \u201cStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign\u2010backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\u201d  The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.<ref>Peter Whitewood, ''The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin\u2019s Purge of the Soviet Military'' (2015) Quoting pp 12, 276.</ref><ref>Ronald Grigor Suny, review, ''Historian'' (2018) 80#1:177-79.</ref><ref>For a critique of Whitewood see Alexander Hill, review, ''American Historical Review'' (2017) 122#5 pp 1713-1714.</ref> Historians often cite the disruption as factors in the Red Army's disastrous military performance during the German invasion.<ref>Roger R.

The lawsuit also alleged Block received a \"substantial portion of the loan fees\", in some cases purchasing up to 49.9 percent of the loans, and further alleged that H&R Block at times held onto a customer's tax refund for purposes of paying off RAL-related debt from previous years, including that claimed by other banks or tax preparers.

Railways such as this are important and heavily used infrastructure in [[India]]. It is the largest suburban railway network in India by track length and number of stations. It has 393 stations with track length of 1,332&nbsp;km. The suburban railway operates 1497 [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]] services carrying 3.5 million (35 lakhs) people daily. It runs from 03:00 until 02:00<ref>[http://indiansss.org/pdf/pdfset-8/issueset-9/Art_017.pdf Survey on Kolkata Suburban Railway] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222211115/http://indiansss.org/pdf/pdfset-8/issueset-9/Art_017.pdf |date=22 December 2018 }}, ''indiansss.org'', 1 January 2013</ref>.\n\n==History==\nThe Kolkata Suburban Railway is an offshoot of the second passenger railway to be built by the [[British in India]] and is also the second oldest railway system in Asia. The first train ran between [[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah]] and [[Hooghly railway station|Hooghly]] on 15 August 1854. The train left Howrah Station at 8:30&nbsp;a.m. and reached Hooghly in 91 minutes.\n\nLater, On 1 February 1957, The EMU services were introduced on Howrah \u2013 Bandel section of Howrah Division of Eastern Railway. The services were gradually extended to Barddhaman in the year 1963 and also on Sealdah Division of Eastern Railway introduced on Sealdah Division on Sealdah \u2013 Ranaghat route.<ref>[https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-mu.html Multiple Units (EMU/DMU) and other self-propelled vehicles], ''irfca.org'',28 November 2018</ref>\n\nOn South Eastern Railway side, EMU services were launched on 1 May 1968 on Howrah - Mecheda Section of Kharagpur Division and after that on 1 February 1969, EMU Services were extended up to Kharagpur and on 1 May 1976 EMU Services were also started on Panskura - Haldia section.<ref>[http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/1383718660467-new%20EMU.pdf History of EMU on Eastern Railway and South Eastern Railway], ''South Eastern Railway'', 27 November 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&dcd=2505&id=0,4,423 SER Completes 50th anniversary on successful operations of EMU services.]</ref>\n\n==Network==\n{{Main|List of Kolkata Suburban Railway stations}}\nThe Kolkata Suburban Railway system is operated by two zonal divisions (under [[Indian Railways]]) [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railways]] (ER) and [[South Eastern Railway zone|South Eastern Railways]] (SER). The fast [[commuter rail]] corridors on Eastern Railway as well as South Eastern Railway are shared with long distance and freight trains, while inner suburban services operate on exclusive parallel tracks. SER operates the South Eastern Line and ER operates the Eastern Line, Circular Line, Chord link Line as well as the South lines.<ref>[https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-map-suburban.html Suburban Railway Maps], ''irfca.org'', 5 June 2005</ref>\n\n===South Eastern line===\n{{main|South Eastern line (Kolkata Suburban Railway)}}\nThe South Eastern line in Kolkata consists of 3 major corridors, which bifurcate as they run into the suburban satellite towns. Two corridors (one local and other through) follow the South Eastern Railway run from [[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah Junction]] to Midnapore (128&nbsp;km). The mainline bifurcates into two branch lines \u2013 the Panskura-Haldia line at [[Panskura Junction railway station|Panskura Junction]] (69&nbsp;km) in the south-east and the Santragachi-Amta line at [[Santragachi Junction railway station|Santragachi Junction]] (45&nbsp;km) in the north. These two corridors constitute the 'main' South Eastern line.\n\nThe South Eastern line has one interchange station with the Eastern Line at Howrah Junction. Rolling stock consists of a fleet of AC as well as dual-powered DC-AC EMUs. The major car sheds on this line are at [[Tikiapara]] and [[Panskura]].\n\nThe South Eastern line also includes two branch lines connecting Santragachi to Shalimar line with a length of 5&nbsp;km and [[Tamluk Junction railway station|Tamluk]] to [[Digha railway station|Digha]] with the length of 94&nbsp;km.\n\n===Eastern line===\n{{main|Eastern line (Kolkata Suburban Railway)}}\n\nThe Eastern line in Kolkata is the biggest network in Kolkata Suburban Railway consists of two divisions, Howrah division & Sealdah division (named after their respective terminals) which serves both sides of River Hooghly.\n\nOn Howrah division of Eastern line, there are 5 corridors, which also bifurcates and runs into north western suburbs. First two corridors are [[Howrah\u2013Bardhaman main line|Howrah-Bardhaman main line]] with a length of 107&nbsp;km and the [[Howrah\u2013Bardhaman chord|chord line]] with the length of 94&nbsp;km. On this two corridors, the Howrah-Tarakeswar branch line bifurcates at [[Seoraphuli Junction railway station|Seoraphuli Junction]] and terminating at Goghat with a length of 69&nbsp;km elevating over the chord line at [[Kamarkundu railway station|Kamarkundu]]. The Bandel-Katwa branch line bifurcates at [[Bandel Junction railway station|Bandel Jn]] with a length of 105&nbsp;km and Bardhaman-Katwa branch line bifurcates at Bardhaman Jn with a length of 53&nbsp;km.\n\nOn the other side (Sealdah division of Eastern line), there are 7 corridors, bifurcating into branch lines to serve northeastern suburbs. Sealdah-Gede line is considered to be a mainline, terminating in [[Gede railway station|Gede]], a small town on the India-Bangladesh Border with the length of 116&nbsp;km. On this corridor, the first branch line birfurcates from [[Dum Dum Junction railway station|Dum Dum Junction]] terminating at [[Bangaon Junction railway station|Bangaon Junction]] with a length of 70&nbsp;km. The second branch line bifurcates at [[Ranaghat Junction railway station|Ranaghat Junction]] terminating at [[Bangaon Junction railway station|Bangaon Junction]] with the length of 33&nbsp;km. The third branch line bifurcates at [[Ranaghat Junction railway station|Ranaghat Junction]] terminating at [[Krishnanagar City Junction railway station|Krishnanagar City Junction]] passing through Kalinarayanpur Jn and Shantipur with a length of 35&nbsp;km or by bypassing Shantipur, passing only through Kalinarayanpur with a length of 26&nbsp;km. Fourth branch line bifurcates at [[Kalyani Junction railway station|Kalyani Jn]] terminating at Kalyani Simanta with a line length of 5&nbsp;km. Fifth branch line bifurcates at [[Barasat Junction railway station|Barasat Junction]] terminating at Hasnabad with a line length of 53&nbsp;km.[[File:Local train.png|thumb|A [[Howrah]] bound EMU train]]The major car sheds (depots) on this line are at [[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah Jn]] and [[Bandel Junction railway station|Bandel]] on Howrah division & at Narkeldanga, Barasat & Ranaghat on Sealdah division.<ref>[http://www.er.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,6,442,462,468 TRS Organisation of Sealdah Division], ''Eastern Railways'', 28 November 2018</ref>\n\nThe Eastern line also includes a connection from Bandel Junction to Naihati Junction with a length of 8&nbsp;km which is an important link between Howrah and Sealdah division.\n\n===Circular Railway===\n{{main|Kolkata Circular Railway}}\nThis corridor encircles the inner city neighborhoods of [[Kolkata]] with a length of 36&nbsp;km with 19 stations, this line runs under the Jursidiction of Eastern Railway Sealdah Division. From Dum Dum Junction to Tala, the line is double-track, while from Tala to Majerhat, the line is single-tracked. Circular Railway starts in a tunnel under the Sealdah division mainline before Tala. Running by the side of River Hooghly from Tala to Majerhat, it joins and runs parallel to the Sealdah South tracks after Majerhat and elevates at Park Circus in order to bypass Sealdah (which is a terminal station). After bypassing Sealdah, it rejoins the mainline at Bidhannagar Road, terminating at Dum Dum Jn.\n\n===Sealdah South lines===\n{{main|Sealdah South lines}}\nThis line is an Important link to Sundarbans of West Bengal from Kolkata. It is also a part of the Eastern Railway. This line has four corridors and it bifurcates as branch lines linking southern suburbs to Kolkata. The mainline starts from Sealdah terminating at Namkhana with the length of 108&nbsp;km. Mainline is double-tracked till Lakshmikantapur and single-tracked from Lakshmikantapur to Namkhana. The first branch line at this corridor starts from Ballygunge Junction terminating at Budge Budge with a length of 19&nbsp;km, second branch line starts from Sonarpur Junction terminating at Canning with a length of 28&nbsp;km and third branch line starts from Baruipur Junction terminating at Diamond Harbour with the length of 35&nbsp;km.\n\nThis line has a sole depot at Sonarpur Jn.\n\nThis line has three interchange stations. Interchange is possible at Majerhat & Park Circus for Circular Railway, and at Sealdah for Eastern line.\n\n===Chord link line===\n{{main|Chord link line (Kolkata Suburban Railway)}}\nChord link line connects Sealdah to Dankuni Junction on Howrah-Barddhaman Chord. This line plays an important role in connecting the Sealdah DIvision's mainline with the Howrah-Bardhaman chord, which is primarily used by freight and passenger trains heading towards North India (Howrah-Bardhaman chord is part of the [[Howrah\u2013Delhi main line|Howrah-Delhi mainline]] and the [[Grand Chord]]). Chord link crosses the River Hooghly on the [[Vivekananda Setu]] road-rail bridge.\n\nIn this corridor, there are some tourist hotspots such as Dakshineswar known for the famous Kali Temple where [[Ramakrishna]] Paramhansa served as a priest & [[Vivekananda Setu]] locally known as Bally Bridge.\n\nIt has three Interchange stations. Interchange is possible at Dum Dum Junction for Eastern line (Sealdah-Gede mainline), Dankuni Junction for Eastern line (Howrah-Barddhaman Chord) & Bally Halt (lying above Bally station) for Eastern Line (Howrah - Barddhaman mainline).\n\n==Services and traffic==\nThere are 2 categories of trains in Kolkata Suburban Railway-\n\n* '''Normal local:''' These trains stop at every stations.\n* '''Galloping local:''' These trains have limited stops, and skip the smaller stations.\n*'''Matribhoomi local:''' These are women-only trains and the first women-only train in Indian Railway\u2019s history<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/first-all-women-train-chugs-out-of-sealdah/articleshow/66093696.cms|title=First all-women train chugs out of Sealdah {{!}} Kolkata News - Times of India|last=Oct 6|first=Jayanta Gupta {{!}} TNN {{!}} Updated:|last2=2018|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17|last3=Ist|first3=17:29}}</ref>\n\n=== Travel classes ===\n\n* '''Class II:''' These are regular compartments, where anyone can travel.

To connect people on these routes, passenger trains run on these routes helping in transportation of people in small towns and villages to Kolkata Metropolitan Area and vice versa. There are two routes which bypass the Kolkata Suburban Railway and are not connected to any other network. First route is from [[Tamluk Junction railway station|Tamluk]] to [[Digha railway station|Digha]] which comes under the jurisdiction of South Eastern Railway with a length of 94&nbsp;km and second route is from [[Krishnanagar City Junction railway station|Krishnanagar City Junction]] to [[Lalgola railway station|Lalgola]] which comes under the jurisdiction of Eastern Railway with the length of 128&nbsp;km.<ref>[http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&id=0,4,423&dcd=985&did=1443526720337F751B9FB511D5AE5F402F22FDCA5E793.web91 Introduction of New Services], ''South Eastern Railways'', 29 September 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.er.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&dcd=643&id=0,4,268 New trains Introduction], ''Eastern Railways'', 29 September 2015</ref>\n\n=== Traffic ===\nIn the period of 2010\u201311, the average train services per day were 1275 and average passengers capacity per rake were 6207 and In 2014\u201315, the average train services were 1511 and average passenger capacity per rake was 4141. which it concludes from last five years, there was an increase of 3% in average services per day and deduction of 8% in average passenger capacity per rake.<ref>[https://cag.gov.in/sites/default/files/audit_report_files/Union_Railways_Suburban_Train_Services_Report_14_2016.pdf CAG report on Suburban Rail Performance],''cag.gov.in'', 30 November 2018</ref>\n\nAnd the no. of passengers moved in period 2013\u201314 was 115 crores and in the period of 2014\u201315 was 112 crores which means a reduction of 3 per cent in total trips.\n\n=== Security ===\nThe [[Railway Protection Force]] (RPF) and the [[Government Railway Police]] (GRP) are responsible for the security of the Kolkata Suburban Railway.\n\n==Fares and ticketing==\nPer the 2013 [[Railway Budget]], the Railway Board increased the Kolkata suburban ticket fare by eight paise per kilometre, although the railway ministry has hiked it by two paise per kilometre.

In 1895 the [[Canton Mint|Guangzhou Machine Mint]] had 90 presses becoming the largest mint in the world followed by the British [[Royal Mint]] with only 16 presses.\n\nMany provinces were still slow to adopt machine mints, often due to the high costs associated with them, the machine mint of [[Tianjin]] cost 27,000 taels of silver but the cost of making a single string of machine-struck 1 ''qi\u00e1n'' cash coins more than twice as high as their face value forcing the Tianjin mint to buy more furnaces until it eventually had to close down in 1900.{{sfn|Hartill|2005|p=405}}\n\nGuangxu's reign saw [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang|the reclamation of Xinjiang]] and the presuming of minting red cash there, while Japanese experts revitalised the copper mining industry in Yunnan and many new veins of copper were discovered giving the government more resources to cast (and later strike) coins again.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekQingDynastyCashCoins\"/>\n\nThe new coins often bore the inscription ''[[Guangxu Yuanbao|Gu\u0101ng X\u00f9 Yu\u00e1n B\u01ceo]]'' (\u5149\u7dd2\u5143\u5bf6) with an image of a [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] and featured [[English language|English]], [[Traditional Chinese characters|Chinese]], and [[Manchu script|Manchu]] inscriptions.

(in [[Mandarin Chinese]]).</ref><ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> A depreciation of the silver meant that the cheaper exchange rate between silver and copper-alloy cash coins would make these exports more expensive, despite the rural prices remaining relatively stable.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The sudden and permanent decrease of the global price of silver had greatly destabilised the price relationship between copper and silver in China which was the basis for its bimetallic system, and therefore this depreciation challenged the entire monetary system of the Qing dynasty and would push it to be drastically changed.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nDuring this period the rural Chinese hinterland began to develop more [[cash crop]]s for export as more treaty ports were forced to open, and while formerly it were the coastal regions that had a more export-oriented economy, the Chinese hinterland started to focus more on export.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Traditionally, Chinese farmers sold their produce to middlemen who would then sell the products in treaty ports, but the \"cheap silver\" had made it more expensive for the middlemen to purchase these goods and the farmers would be less likely to accept silver for their products the further away from commercial cities or from the well-developed financial facilities they were.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The higher exchange rate between silver and copper-alloy cash coins favouring the latter caused [[deflation]] and made the business of the middlemen less profitable.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The government also minted less copper-alloy cash coins during this period because of the high cost of minting them, which further contributed to the shortage of copper-alloy cash coins in the Chinese economy.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> While the trade impact of the global \"cheap silver\" was largely confined to the coastal areas, the monetary impact of  \"cheap silver\" was felt nationwide.<ref>Loren Brandt, Commercialization and Agricultural Development: Central and Eastern China, 1870-1937 (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1989).</ref><ref>Junya Ma, \"Traditional Finance and China's Agricultural Trade, 1920-1933,\" Modern China 34, no. 3 (2008).</ref><ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> A drop in the price of silver had further aggravated the shortage of copper-alloy cash coinage: the imperial mints in Beijing then consequently suspended the production of copper-alloy cash coinage due to the increased cost of production;<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> and the existing cash as \"undervalued money\" ([[Gresham's law]]) were then melted down for their intrinsic value. Additionally, the provision of cash coinage was a centralised decision which was also implemented by regional governments throughout China.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Because of these factors the Chinese were not able to seize the opportunity to increase their exports due to the \"cheap silver\" as Japan, India, and Vietnam had.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> In fact, rather than being an opportunity for China, \"cheap silver\" presented itself as a challenge for China, especially for the Chinese bimetallic monetary system.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Despite a large silver inflow to treaty ports and urban centres throughout China, the vast Chinese rural population was now suffering from a shortage of copper-alloy cash coins.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Only when the Chinese copper coinage was adequately depreciated could the trade benefits presented by \"cheap silver\" be realised and benefit the economy of the Qing dynasty.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> This could only be realised by once again devaluing the copper coinage.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\n=== Effects of the scarcity of copper-alloy cash coins on the economic prospects of rural China during the late 19th century === \n\nDue to the prevalence of \"cheap silver\" (an enormous decrease of the global price of silver) the copper-alloy cash coin-based economy of China suffered [[deflation]] which discouraged the export of Chinese products.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> International trade was further discouraged because of the scarcity of copper-alloy cash coins in rural China during the late 19th century.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> This scarcity not only discouraged international trade, but also long-distance exchanges within China because of the deflationary pressure.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Furthermore, this scarcity of small denomination copper-alloy cash coins in China was having a negative impact on daily transactions, especially in the inland rural areas where absolutely no business was done in silver and the local people had an inelastic demand for these coins.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The rural Chinese workers tended to only receive their salaries in copper-alloy cash coins and would pay their taxes in silver using the official government set exchange rates between the two metal currencies.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> When the scarcity started causing deflation the rural workers would receive lower salaries, but the government kept maintaining a relatively high exchange rate between the two currencies.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nAccording to reports published by provincial governors in the year 1896, the official exchange rate between copper-alloy cash coins and silver was 2200 ''w\u00e9n'' for only 1 tael of silver;<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> while at the time a tael of silver traded on the private market for 1600 ''w\u00e9n'' to 1700 ''w\u00e9n''.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =\"A real difficulty the government has to face is the scarcity of [[Cash (Chinese coin)|copper cash]] \u2013 a difficulty which is likely to increase, as the intrinsic value of the cash as metal is actually greater than that of the silver for which they at present exchange. The copper money purchasable for a tael of silver costs the Government for metal (copper and zinc) not less that [[Tael|Tls.]] 1,354, which does not include the cost of minting. This condition has not only restricted coinage but has resulted in a serious disappearance of the coins, due to melting down for the sake of the copper.

This was because debased coinages will be discounted on the market and always invite widespread counterfeiting.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The solution to this problem was by introducing new machine-struck coinages that were produced by [[steam power]]ed machines, this would make it more difficult for counterfeiters to produce fake coinages as the initial costs to purchase the machines needed for counterfeiting were very high and discouraged many would-be counterfeiters.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The new technology allowed the Qing government to cast high-quality, standardised coins with machined edges.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Therefore the new technology provided a for the government of the Qing dynasty a way to mint sufficient token coins at an affordable cost without inviting forgers to debase the new coinages even further.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nWhile the new technology allowed the Qing government to mint sufficient amounts of copper-alloy coins at an affordable cost, the new technology wasn't implemented throughout China at the same time as some provinces would adopt the technology later.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Initially the new machine-struck coinages were well received where they were introduced, which helped other provincial mints adopt the new technology faster.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/>\n\n=== Machine-struck cash coins and other milled coinages === \n{{Main|Da-Qing Tongbi}} \n[[File:D\u00e0 Q\u012bng T\u00f3ng B\u00ec (\u5927\u6e05\u9285\u5e63) - scanned image.png|thumb|left|A [[Milled coinage|machine-struck]] ''D\u00e0 Q\u012bng t\u00f3ngb\u00ec'' (\u5927\u6e05\u9285\u5e63) cash coin of 10 w\u00e9n.]]\n\nDue to a shortage of copper at the end of the Qing dynasty, the mint of [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]] began striking round copper coins without square holes in 1900.

Mayhew, \"Coinage and Money in England, 1086-C.1500,\" in Medieval Money Matters, ed. Diana Wood ([[Oxford]]: Oxbow, 2004), page 72.</ref><ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> But unlike the [[English Crown]], which had set up royal mints in England to strike the silver bullion into coins with a nominal (or face) value, the Chinese Emperor allowed only silver bullion itself to circulate in various forms throughout his empire.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The government of the Qing dynasty provided only the standard unit (known as the Kuping tael) that a silver ingot should be melted into, which itself evolved into one of the many different \"taels\" that was used for silver bullion to be traded.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nBecause the [[purchasing power]] of silver bullion was so much higher than that of copper-alloy cash coins, silver was used primarily for larger transactions and long-distance trade as well as international trade, while copper-alloy cash coinage was therefore not taken as subsidiary money:<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> it was the currency for daily and smaller transactions and copper was the only currency in rural China during the Qing dynasty period.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Silver also enjoyed a special status as it was also the major form of currency that was used for the payment taxes and government expenditures.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nBecause of this, the government of the Qing dynasty had attempted to establish a [[Fixed exchange rate system|fixed rate]] for the exchange of copper-alloy cash coins and silver bullion.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> During the majority of the Qing dynasty period, the official ratio between silver (in taels) and copper-alloy cash coins (in ''w\u00e9n'') was maintained at 1:1,000. The ratio was later revised to 1:2,000 during the 1840s, due to the rising price of silver.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nThis theoretical official exchange rate was in practice not enforced by any government institution as because the imperial government did not coin any silver, it had no control over how silver circulated on the market.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> As the silver flow was primarily based on foreign trade and silver both entered and left China in large numbers, the market exchange rate between silver and copper changed drastically over time and tended to fluctuate, furthermore this exchange rate also varied from region to region.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Services specialising in money exchanges, known as [[Qianzhuang|money-changers]], developed in this currency system, and the exchange normally took place in commercial centres and trade ports where different trades were frequently carried out.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nThe currency system in China during the Qing dynasty is sometimes called a \"parallel bimetallic system\", in order to distinguish it from the more conventional model of a bimetallic system.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The term \"parallel bimetallic system\" is given to this system because it functioned more like a form of coexistence of \"two currency systems, each using a different metal\" than an actual bimetallic system.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Also unlike real bimetallism in other countries, the actual exchange ratio between the two different metal currencies was not actually fixed; the exchange ratio tended to vary depending on time and place.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/>\n\n=== Imperial government produced silver coinages === \n\n==== Government produced silver coins during the Qianlong era ==== \n\nDuring the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] commemorative silver coins with the portrait of the [[Tibet under Qing rule|Tibetan]] [[Panchen Lama]] are known to have been produced.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\n==== Government produced silver coins during the Daoguang era ==== \n\nDuring the reign of the [[Daoguang Emperor]] several attempts were made in China for the native production of government backed silver coinage, the first of such attempts were tried in the year 1821.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> Machine-struck Chinese silver coins were known to have been first produced in the year 1822, by the modern Jilin Arsenal Mint (\u5409\u6797\u6a5f\u5668\u5c40).<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> These early milled silver coins were known as the Changpingliang (\u5ee0\u5e73\u5169, literally \"factory tael\") and only had the denomination of one tael. These silver Changpingliang were not manufactured in any high numbers and are consequently very rare today.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nOther models of modern silver coinages, which are known as ''ban'' (\u677f), that were known to have been produced in the cities of [[Guangzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], and [[Jiangxi]].<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The models of milled silver coins produced in Wuxi are known as ''xiban'' (\u932b\u677f) and the ones produced in Jiangxi are known as ''tuban'' (\u571f\u677f).<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> There were also the models known as Wuzhuang (\u5433\u838a) and Xingzhuang (\u884c\u838a).<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nAnother early attempt at creating a native government-produced silver Chinese coinage was made by [[Lin Zexu]], he created a system of silver coinages known as the Yinbing (\u9280\u9905, literally \"Silver cakes\") which had a standard weight of 0.72 tael, but the Yinbing was eventually rejected by the Jiangsu market.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nThe earliest known surviving modern silver coins of the Qing dynasty period were manufactured in the city of [[Zhangtai]], [[Fujian]].<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> There are two types of these modern silver Zhangtai coins, one featured an image, this image either consisted of [[Shouxing]], the God of longevity, a pair of crossed [[Ruyi (scepter)|Ruyi scepters]], or a pair of crossed writing brushes, which are known as ''bibao'' (\u7b46\u5bf6).<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nThe other known type of Zhangtai silver coins featured both ornaments and inscriptions, the first type of these inscribed silver coins featured the inscriptions Daoguang Nian Zhu (\u9053\u5149\u5e74\u9444) and Zuwen Yinbing (\u8db3\u7d0b\u9280\u9905), and the indication of the value of the coin, namely the inscription Kuping Qi-Er (\u5eab\u5e73\u67d2\u5f0d, \"0.72 Kuping tael\").<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The reverse side of these coins featured a tripod with a [[Manchu language]] inscription indicating the mint where it was produced.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The coins without images were inscribed with the Chinese characters for \"[[Junxiang]]\" (\u8ecd\u9909), this inscription being a rather clear indication of the method that the government of the Qing dynasty used to throw money on the Chinese local markets.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The ornaments on the second type of silver coins were mostly imitations of the decorations that are depicted on the various foreign coins that circulated in the region at the time, but sometimes these ornaments just merged Chinese characters, like ''jinshen'' (\u8b39\u614e, \"reverentially\").<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nThese silver coins were brought into general circulation through military salaries (Junxiang), and unlike the earlier attempts were accepted by the local Jiangsu market.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The date when these modern silver coins of [[southeast China]] were exactly produced remains unclear today, but they were certainly not produced before the 19th century.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\n==== Government produced silver coins during the Xianfeng era ==== \n{{See also|Hubu Guanpiao}} \n\nDuring the [[Xianfeng Emperor|Xianfeng]] period the government did not issue its own silver coins, but it did issue a [[Hubu Guanpiao|series of banknotes]] that were nominally worth silver in weight (taels).<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/>\n\n==== Government produced silver coins during the Guangxu era ==== \n\nPrior to 1 tael being standardised at 50 g. by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1959, the weight \"tael\" differed substantially from province to province, the Qing government maintained that 1 tael equals 37.5 g. and this measurement was referred to as the ''Kuping tael'' ({{linktext|\u5eab|\u5e73|\u4e24}}), and by official Qing government standards 1 ''Kuping tael'' = 10 Mace = 100 Candareens. Under the [[Guangxu Emperor]] several ''Kuping tael'' coins were struck in [[Tianjin]] from 1903 until 1907, and mostly served as salary for the soldiers.

Simultaneously banning the import of silver coins from Nepal. Though due to a shortage of silver the Qing allowed the Tibetan government to strike coins derived from the Nepalese silver coins to circulate in Tibet under the supervision of both the Qing and Tibetan governments. In 1791 the Qing planned to cast copper cash coins in Tibet, however this was deemed too expensive to transport copper from [[China proper]] to [[Lhasa]]. From this point onward Tibetan silver coinage bore the reign names and eras of Qing Emperors.\n\nDuring the second part of the 19th and the first third of the 20th century numerous foreign silver coins circulated in Tibet. Most of them were traded by weight, such as [[Mexican peso|Mexican]] and [[Spanish dollar|Spanish American silver dollars]], Russian [[rouble]]s and German [[German gold mark|mark]]s. The exception were British Indian [[rupee]]s, particularly the ones with the portrait of [[Queen Victoria]], which widely circulated in Tibet and were mostly preferred to Tibetan coins. These rupees were of good silver and had a fixed value, exchanging for three tangkas until about 1920,<ref>China Ancient Coins Collection Blog (\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u9322\u96c6\u85cf\u7db2\u8a8c) - To share my collection and what I have know related to the Chinese Ancient Coins to global coins collectors.

The Qing government saw the popularity of the Indian rupees among Tibetan traders with misgivings and in 1902 started striking their own rupees which were close copies of the Indian Victoria rupees, the portrait of the Queen being replaced by that of a Chinese mandarin, or, as most numismatists believe, of the [[Guangxu Emperor]] of China.

General Zhao Hui set the exchange rate between p\u016bls and Qing cash coins at 2 Dzungar p\u016bls for 1 cash, further Xinjiang cash coins being the same weight as Dzungar p\u016bl coins weighed 2 ''[[Mace (unit)|qi\u00e1n]]'' (7.46 g) as opposed to the 1.2 ''qi\u00e1n'' (4.476 g) circulating in contemporary [[China proper]].

The coins produced at this mint show the [[mint mark]] both in the [[Manchu language|Manchu]] and [[Uyghur language]]s. The Qing dynasty was able to claim 2.6 million p\u016bl coins from the population at an exchange rate of 2 p\u016bls for 1 cash, but in 1762 the exchange rate was placed at par causing the Qing to eventually discontinue the exchange in 1768 as the p\u016bl would continue circulate, and the Yarkant mint was forced to import copper from the [[Turfan]] mint.

The mint itself was large housing 6 furnaces and employing 360 people including technical staff from China proper to oversee the production of \"Red Cash\" in Aksu. Most cash coins produced in Aksu almost exclusively circulated in the 4 largest cities of the former Dzungar Khanate.<ref>Yan, Song: \"Dui Qiuci bendi zhubi Han-Qiu erti tongqiande tantao\".

At first the standard weight of 2 ''qi\u00e1n'' (the same as Dzungar p\u016bl coins circulating at the time) was maintained but a copper shortage in 1771 caused the \"Red Cash\" from Turfan to become a half ''qi\u00e1n'' lighter, and 3 years later had its weight brought at par with cash coins from China proper. In 1799 the Turfan mint was brought back to Aksu because of that city's increasing economic dominance over the region of Southern Xinjiang.<ref>Tang, Shifu: ''Zhongguo gu qianbi''.

Mostly in the north the people that lived there were [[nomads]] and didn't have an established monetary system in place, and there were no prior government regulations on trade. Also many [[Han Chinese]] people started migrating from other parts of China to the northern and eastern regions of Xinjiang bringing with them their cash coins. Because of these reasons the Qing dynasty didn't create a new monetary system as they had done in the former Dzungar Khanate but implemented the system used by the rest of the Qing.<ref>Huo: ''Guqian xiao cidian''.

In 1776 copper was found near Yining causing the production of cash coins at the mint to rise.\n\n=== Daoguang era ===\n\nIn 1826 [[Jahangir Khoja]] with soldiers from the [[Khanate of Kokand]] occupied the southern circuit of Xinjiang temporarily losing [[Kashgar]], Yarkant, and Hot\u00e4n to this rebellion. The [[Daoguang Emperor]] sent 36 thousand Manchu soldiers to defeat this rebellion. As more soldiers had entered Xinjiang the price of silver went down, while that of copper went up. In 1826 1 tael of silver was worth 250 or 260 \"Red Cash\" while in 1827 good had decreased to 100 or sometimes even as low as 80. Despite the soldiers returning to [[Manchuria]] the original exchange rates did not restore causing the mint of Aksu to close, as the Aksu mint closed down less money was circulating on the market. In 1828 monetary reforms were implemented to keep the current weight of \"Red Cash\" but increase their denominations to 5, and 10 w\u00e9n (while weighing the same) with 70% of Aksu's annual production being 5 w\u00e9n coins, and 30% being 10 w\u00e9n but the production of \"Red Cash\" itself was reduced by two and a half thousand strings. Later the Daoguang Emperor ordered the weight of \"Red Cash\" to further decrease in order to maximise profits.<ref>Li, Xianzhang: \"'Dangshi' lei hongqian ji banshi banbie\".

As the [[Taiping rebellion]] and the [[Second Opium War]] had prompted the Qing government to start issuing high denomination cash coins in other parts of the Qing dynasty, this soon spread to Xinjiang mainly due to the decreased subsidies for military expenditures in Xinjiang lowering the soldiers' salaries. In 1855 new denominations of 4 w\u00e9n and 8 w\u00e9n were introduced at the Yining mint, further the [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] mint started issuing cash coins with high denominations in response. New mints were established at [[Kucha]], and [[Kashgar]] while the Yarkant mint was re-opened. Coins also started being cast in [[bronze]], [[brass]], [[lead]], and [[iron]]; this system received a chaotic response from Xinjiang's market. From 1860 denominations higher than 10 w\u00e9n were discontinued.<ref>Lin, Ran: \"Qiuci wuzhu you liangge zhuxing jieduan\". (\"Two Phases in Issuing Qiuci Wuzhu Coins\".)

The Aksu mint was transferred to Kucha mint. Though the Kashgar mint re-opened in 1888 it outsourced some of the production of \"Red Cash\" to Kucha and Aksu resulting in cash coins being cast with the Chinese mint mark of Kashgar but the Manchu and Arabic mint marks of the actual mint of casting. The kashgar mint closed down in 1908. The Kucha mint introduced new obverse inscriptions for cash coins minted there with the ''Guang Xu Ding Wei'' (\u5149\u7dd2\u4e01\u672a) in 1907, and ''Guang Xu Wu Shen'' (\u5149\u7dd2\u620a\u7533) in 1908, however production didn't last very long as the Kucha mint finally closed down in 1909.<ref>Miliguli: \"Baoyi xiao tongqian chutan\".

By the end of the eighteenth century China was also trading with the newly established [[United States of America]].<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> Despite Chinese merchants valuing both foreign silver coins (\u9280\u5143) and Chinese silver ingots (\u9280\u5169) based on their silver content, the government of the Qing dynasty still enforced the opinion that the silver coins that originated in foreign countries was somehow of inferior value than the Chinese sycees.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> Yet the private Chinese markets didn't share this opinion with the imperial Qing government as the populations of the coastal provinces (and Guangdong most in particular) held the foreign silver coins in high esteem due to various advantages such as their fixed nominal values and their consistently reliable fineness of their silver content which all made them be used for transactions without having to undergo a process of assaying or weighing as is expected of sycees.{{sfn|Peng (\u5f6d) - 1954 (2007)|p=577\u2013580}}<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\nThe year 1814 the market value of 1 silver foreign coin in Guangzhou was never less than 723 Chinese cash coins, while in other provinces like [[Jiangsu]] and [[Zhejiang]] they were even worth more eight hundred cash coins, or foreign silver coins could be traded for 0.73 tael of silver each.<ref>Cong Hanxiang (\u5f9e\u7ff0\u9999), Hong Jiaguan (\u6d2a\u846d\u7ba1) (1992). \"Yinding (\u9280\u9320)\", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu (\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u66f8), Zhongguo lishi (\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u53f2) (Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), Vol. 3, 1408.</ref><ref>Cai Maoshui (\u8521\u8302\u6c34) (1997). \"Wenyin (\u7d0b\u9280)\", in Men Kui (\u9580\u5dcb), Zhang Yanjin (\u5f35\u71d5\u747e), ed.

The Chinese authorities during this period for this reason often raised the proposition to ban the circulation of foreign silver coins within Chinese territory, on the suspicion that \"good\" Chinese silver went to foreign markets, while the \"inferior\" foreign silver coins caused the markets of southern China to inundate. There was evidence that the Qing dynasty indeed suffered a net loss of 11% when changing Chinese into foreign silver.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> During the initial period of the 19th century the imperial Chinese administration suspected that more silver was being exported than imported causing the Chinese to slowly develop a silver deficit as the trade balance fell on the negative side of the spectrum for the Qing.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> However, as the government of the Qing dynasty never collected and compiled any statistics on the private trade of silver it is very difficult to generate any accurate hard numbers on these claims.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> According to [[Hosea Ballou Morse]] the turning point for the Chinese trade balance was in the year 1826, during this year the trade balance allegedly fell from a positive balance of 1,300,000 pesos to a negative one of 2,100,000 pesos.{{sfn|Peng (\u5f6d) - 1954 (2007)|p=577\u2013580}}<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\nAccording to the memorial by the governor of [[Fujian]], L. Tsiuen-Sun published on November 7, 1855 it is noted that the governor witnessed that the foreign silver coins that had been circulating in Jiangnan were held in great esteem by the local people and that the most excellent of these coins weighed 7 Mace and 2 Candareens while their silver content was only of 6 Mace and 5 Candareens.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> He also noted that these coins were greatly used in Fujian and Guangdong and that even the most defaced and mutilated of these coins were valued on par with Chinese sycees, in fact he noted that everyone in possession of a sycee would exchange these for foreign silver coins known as Fanbing (\u756a\u9905, \"foreign cakes\") due to their standard weights and sizes.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> Meanwhile, the governor noted that in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu these chopped dollars didn't circulate as much in favour of a currency he calls \"bright money\". Originally a dollar was worth upwards of seven Mace; the value gradually rose over time to eight Mace, and by 1855 it exceeded nine Mace.<ref>The Memorial by L.

The Japanese supplied 11,250 kilograms of silver to China by merchants in direct trade annually prior to the year 1600, after the [[Sakoku]] policy was enacted by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the year 1633 only 350 Japanese trade vessels sailed for China, however each of these ships had more than one thousand tons of silver.{{sfn|Peng (\u5f6d) - 1954 (2007)|p=577\u2013580}}<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\n=== Names used by the Chinese for foreign silver coins ===\n\nList of names used for foreign silver coins during the reign of the Qing dynasty:<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>{{sfn|Peng (\u5f6d) - 1954 (2007)|p=577\u2013580}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1900, 8 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] converted into 32.6587 kilograms of copper cash coins and it was noted that if one of the straw strings holding the coins would break that it would cost more picking those coins up in time than the value retrieved from those coins.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://primaltrek.com/blog/2013/07/20/carrying-cash-in-imperial-china/|title= Carrying Cash in Imperial China.|date=20 July 2013|accessdate=5 July 2017|work= Gary Ashkenazy / \u05d2\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d6\u05d9 (Primaltrek \u2013 a journey through Chinese culture)|language=en}}</ref><ref>Isabella Lucy Bird [https://thebamboosea.wordpress.com/2010/01/20/chinese-pictures-by-mrs-j-f-bishop/ \"Chinese Pictures: Notes on Photographs\"].

Additionally, the provision of cash coinage was a centralised decision which was also implemented by regional governments throughout China.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Because of these factors the Chinese were not able to seize the opportunity to increase their exports due to the \"cheap silver\" as Japan, India, and Vietnam had.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> In fact, rather than being an opportunity for China, \"cheap silver\" presented itself as a challenge for China, especially for the Chinese bimetallic monetary system.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Despite a large silver inflow to treaty ports and urban centres throughout China, the vast Chinese rural population was now suffering from a shortage of copper-alloy cash coins.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Only when the Chinese copper coinage was adequately depreciated could the trade benefits presented by \"cheap silver\" be realised and benefit the economy of the Qing dynasty.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> This could only be realised by once again devaluing the copper coinage.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\n=== Effects of the scarcity of copper-alloy cash coins on the economic prospects of rural China during the late 19th century === \n\nDue to the prevalence of \"cheap silver\" (an enormous decrease of the global price of silver) the copper-alloy cash coin-based economy of China suffered [[deflation]] which discouraged the export of Chinese products.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> International trade was further discouraged because of the scarcity of copper-alloy cash coins in rural China during the late 19th century.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> This scarcity not only discouraged international trade, but also long-distance exchanges within China because of the deflationary pressure.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Furthermore, this scarcity of small denomination copper-alloy cash coins in China was having a negative impact on daily transactions, especially in the inland rural areas where absolutely no business was done in silver and the local people had an inelastic demand for these coins.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The rural Chinese workers tended to only receive their salaries in copper-alloy cash coins and would pay their taxes in silver using the official government set exchange rates between the two metal currencies.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> When the scarcity started causing deflation the rural workers would receive lower salaries, but the government kept maintaining a relatively high exchange rate between the two currencies.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nAccording to reports published by provincial governors in the year 1896, the official exchange rate between copper-alloy cash coins and silver was 2200 ''w\u00e9n'' for only 1 tael of silver;<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> while at the time a tael of silver traded on the private market for 1600 ''w\u00e9n'' to 1700 ''w\u00e9n''.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =\"A real difficulty the government has to face is the scarcity of [[Cash (Chinese coin)|copper cash]] \u2013 a difficulty which is likely to increase, as the intrinsic value of the cash as metal is actually greater than that of the silver for which they at present exchange.

Diana Wood ([[Oxford]]: Oxbow, 2004), page 72.</ref><ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> But unlike the [[English Crown]], which had set up royal mints in England to strike the silver bullion into coins with a nominal (or face) value, the Chinese Emperor allowed only silver bullion itself to circulate in various forms throughout his empire.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The government of the Qing dynasty provided only the standard unit (known as the Kuping tael) that a silver ingot should be melted into, which itself evolved into one of the many different \"taels\" that was used for silver bullion to be traded.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nBecause the [[purchasing power]] of silver bullion was so much higher than that of copper-alloy cash coins, silver was used primarily for larger transactions and long-distance trade as well as international trade, while copper-alloy cash coinage was therefore not taken as subsidiary money:<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> it was the currency for daily and smaller transactions and copper was the only currency in rural China during the Qing dynasty period.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Silver also enjoyed a special status as it was also the major form of currency that was used for the payment taxes and government expenditures.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nBecause of this, the government of the Qing dynasty had attempted to establish a [[Fixed exchange rate system|fixed rate]] for the exchange of copper-alloy cash coins and silver bullion.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> During the majority of the Qing dynasty period, the official ratio between silver (in taels) and copper-alloy cash coins (in ''w\u00e9n'') was maintained at 1:1,000. The ratio was later revised to 1:2,000 during the 1840s, due to the rising price of silver.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nThis theoretical official exchange rate was in practice not enforced by any government institution as because the imperial government did not coin any silver, it had no control over how silver circulated on the market.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> As the silver flow was primarily based on foreign trade and silver both entered and left China in large numbers, the market exchange rate between silver and copper changed drastically over time and tended to fluctuate, furthermore this exchange rate also varied from region to region.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Services specialising in money exchanges, known as [[Qianzhuang|money-changers]], developed in this currency system, and the exchange normally took place in commercial centres and trade ports where different trades were frequently carried out.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> \n\nThe currency system in China during the Qing dynasty is sometimes called a \"parallel bimetallic system\", in order to distinguish it from the more conventional model of a bimetallic system.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> The term \"parallel bimetallic system\" is given to this system because it functioned more like a form of coexistence of \"two currency systems, each using a different metal\" than an actual bimetallic system.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/> Also unlike real bimetallism in other countries, the actual exchange ratio between the two different metal currencies was not actually fixed; the exchange ratio tended to vary depending on time and place.<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/>\n\n=== Imperial government produced silver coinages === \n\n==== Government produced silver coins during the Qianlong era ==== \n\nDuring the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] commemorative silver coins with the portrait of the [[Tibet under Qing rule|Tibetan]] [[Panchen Lama]] are known to have been produced.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\n==== Government produced silver coins during the Daoguang era ==== \n\nDuring the reign of the [[Daoguang Emperor]] several attempts were made in China for the native production of government backed silver coinage, the first of such attempts were tried in the year 1821.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> Machine-struck Chinese silver coins were known to have been first produced in the year 1822, by the modern Jilin Arsenal Mint (\u5409\u6797\u6a5f\u5668\u5c40).<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> These early milled silver coins were known as the Changpingliang (\u5ee0\u5e73\u5169, literally \"factory tael\") and only had the denomination of one tael. These silver Changpingliang were not manufactured in any high numbers and are consequently very rare today.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nOther models of modern silver coinages, which are known as ''ban'' (\u677f), that were known to have been produced in the cities of [[Guangzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], and [[Jiangxi]].<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The models of milled silver coins produced in Wuxi are known as ''xiban'' (\u932b\u677f) and the ones produced in Jiangxi are known as ''tuban'' (\u571f\u677f).<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> There were also the models known as Wuzhuang (\u5433\u838a) and Xingzhuang (\u884c\u838a).<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nAnother early attempt at creating a native government-produced silver Chinese coinage was made by [[Lin Zexu]], he created a system of silver coinages known as the Yinbing (\u9280\u9905, literally \"Silver cakes\") which had a standard weight of 0.72 tael, but the Yinbing was eventually rejected by the Jiangsu market.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nThe earliest known surviving modern silver coins of the Qing dynasty period were manufactured in the city of [[Zhangtai]], [[Fujian]].<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> There are two types of these modern silver Zhangtai coins, one featured an image, this image either consisted of [[Shouxing]], the God of longevity, a pair of crossed [[Ruyi (scepter)|Ruyi scepters]], or a pair of crossed writing brushes, which are known as ''bibao'' (\u7b46\u5bf6).<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nThe other known type of Zhangtai silver coins featured both ornaments and inscriptions, the first type of these inscribed silver coins featured the inscriptions Daoguang Nian Zhu (\u9053\u5149\u5e74\u9444) and Zuwen Yinbing (\u8db3\u7d0b\u9280\u9905), and the indication of the value of the coin, namely the inscription Kuping Qi-Er (\u5eab\u5e73\u67d2\u5f0d, \"0.72 Kuping tael\").<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The reverse side of these coins featured a tripod with a [[Manchu language]] inscription indicating the mint where it was produced.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The coins without images were inscribed with the Chinese characters for \"[[Junxiang]]\" (\u8ecd\u9909), this inscription being a rather clear indication of the method that the government of the Qing dynasty used to throw money on the Chinese local markets.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The ornaments on the second type of silver coins were mostly imitations of the decorations that are depicted on the various foreign coins that circulated in the region at the time, but sometimes these ornaments just merged Chinese characters, like ''jinshen'' (\u8b39\u614e, \"reverentially\").<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> \n\nThese silver coins were brought into general circulation through military salaries (Junxiang), and unlike the earlier attempts were accepted by the local Jiangsu market.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> The date when these modern silver coins of [[southeast China]] were exactly produced remains unclear today, but they were certainly not produced before the 19th century.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\n==== Government produced silver coins during the Xianfeng era ==== \n{{See also|Hubu Guanpiao}} \n\nDuring the [[Xianfeng Emperor|Xianfeng]] period the government did not issue its own silver coins, but it did issue a [[Hubu Guanpiao|series of banknotes]] that were nominally worth silver in weight (taels).<ref name=\"LondonSchoolOfEconomicsXunYan\"/>\n\n==== Government produced silver coins during the Guangxu era ==== \n\nPrior to 1 tael being standardised at 50 g. by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1959, the weight \"tael\" differed substantially from province to province, the Qing government maintained that 1 tael equals 37.5 g. and this measurement was referred to as the ''Kuping tael'' ({{linktext|\u5eab|\u5e73|\u4e24}}), and by official Qing government standards 1 ''Kuping tael'' = 10 Mace = 100 Candareens. Under the [[Guangxu Emperor]] several ''Kuping tael'' coins were struck in [[Tianjin]] from 1903 until 1907, and mostly served as salary for the soldiers.

Simultaneously banning the import of silver coins from Nepal. Though due to a shortage of silver the Qing allowed the Tibetan government to strike coins derived from the Nepalese silver coins to circulate in Tibet under the supervision of both the Qing and Tibetan governments. In 1791 the Qing planned to cast copper cash coins in Tibet, however this was deemed too expensive to transport copper from [[China proper]] to [[Lhasa]]. From this point onward Tibetan silver coinage bore the reign names and eras of Qing Emperors.\n\nDuring the second part of the 19th and the first third of the 20th century numerous foreign silver coins circulated in Tibet. Most of them were traded by weight, such as [[Mexican peso|Mexican]] and [[Spanish dollar|Spanish American silver dollars]], Russian [[rouble]]s and German [[German gold mark|mark]]s. The exception were British Indian [[rupee]]s, particularly the ones with the portrait of [[Queen Victoria]], which widely circulated in Tibet and were mostly preferred to Tibetan coins.

The mint itself was large housing 6 furnaces and employing 360 people including technical staff from China proper to oversee the production of \"Red Cash\" in Aksu. Most cash coins produced in Aksu almost exclusively circulated in the 4 largest cities of the former Dzungar Khanate.<ref>Yan, Song: \"Dui Qiuci bendi zhubi Han-Qiu erti tongqiande tantao\".

At first the standard weight of 2 ''qi\u00e1n'' (the same as Dzungar p\u016bl coins circulating at the time) was maintained but a copper shortage in 1771 caused the \"Red Cash\" from Turfan to become a half ''qi\u00e1n'' lighter, and 3 years later had its weight brought at par with cash coins from China proper. In 1799 the Turfan mint was brought back to Aksu because of that city's increasing economic dominance over the region of Southern Xinjiang.<ref>Tang, Shifu: ''Zhongguo gu qianbi''.

Mostly in the north the people that lived there were [[nomads]] and didn't have an established monetary system in place, and there were no prior government regulations on trade. Also many [[Han Chinese]] people started migrating from other parts of China to the northern and eastern regions of Xinjiang bringing with them their cash coins. Because of these reasons the Qing dynasty didn't create a new monetary system as they had done in the former Dzungar Khanate but implemented the system used by the rest of the Qing.<ref>Huo: ''Guqian xiao cidian''.

In 1776 copper was found near Yining causing the production of cash coins at the mint to rise.\n\n=== Daoguang era ===\n\nIn 1826 [[Jahangir Khoja]] with soldiers from the [[Khanate of Kokand]] occupied the southern circuit of Xinjiang temporarily losing [[Kashgar]], Yarkant, and Hot\u00e4n to this rebellion. The [[Daoguang Emperor]] sent 36 thousand Manchu soldiers to defeat this rebellion. As more soldiers had entered Xinjiang the price of silver went down, while that of copper went up. In 1826 1 tael of silver was worth 250 or 260 \"Red Cash\" while in 1827 good had decreased to 100 or sometimes even as low as 80. Despite the soldiers returning to [[Manchuria]] the original exchange rates did not restore causing the mint of Aksu to close, as the Aksu mint closed down less money was circulating on the market. In 1828 monetary reforms were implemented to keep the current weight of \"Red Cash\" but increase their denominations to 5, and 10 w\u00e9n (while weighing the same) with 70% of Aksu's annual production being 5 w\u00e9n coins, and 30% being 10 w\u00e9n but the production of \"Red Cash\" itself was reduced by two and a half thousand strings. Later the Daoguang Emperor ordered the weight of \"Red Cash\" to further decrease in order to maximise profits.<ref>Li, Xianzhang: \"'Dangshi' lei hongqian ji banshi banbie\".

As the [[Taiping rebellion]] and the [[Second Opium War]] had prompted the Qing government to start issuing high denomination cash coins in other parts of the Qing dynasty, this soon spread to Xinjiang mainly due to the decreased subsidies for military expenditures in Xinjiang lowering the soldiers' salaries. In 1855 new denominations of 4 w\u00e9n and 8 w\u00e9n were introduced at the Yining mint, further the [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] mint started issuing cash coins with high denominations in response. New mints were established at [[Kucha]], and [[Kashgar]] while the Yarkant mint was re-opened. Coins also started being cast in [[bronze]], [[brass]], [[lead]], and [[iron]]; this system received a chaotic response from Xinjiang's market. From 1860 denominations higher than 10 w\u00e9n were discontinued.<ref>Lin, Ran: \"Qiuci wuzhu you liangge zhuxing jieduan\". (\"Two Phases in Issuing Qiuci Wuzhu Coins\".)

However, at the end of the reign of the [[Guangxu Emperor]] \"Red Cash\" was discontinued at the Aksu mint in 1892 because of the rising costs of [[charcoal]] needed to produce the coins. The Aksu mint was transferred to Kucha mint. Though the Kashgar mint re-opened in 1888 it outsourced some of the production of \"Red Cash\" to Kucha and Aksu resulting in cash coins being cast with the Chinese mint mark of Kashgar but the Manchu and Arabic mint marks of the actual mint of casting. The kashgar mint closed down in 1908. The Kucha mint introduced new obverse inscriptions for cash coins minted there with the ''Guang Xu Ding Wei'' (\u5149\u7dd2\u4e01\u672a) in 1907, and ''Guang Xu Wu Shen'' (\u5149\u7dd2\u620a\u7533) in 1908, however production didn't last very long as the Kucha mint finally closed down in 1909.<ref>Miliguli: \"Baoyi xiao tongqian chutan\".

By the end of the eighteenth century China was also trading with the newly established [[United States of America]].<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> Despite Chinese merchants valuing both foreign silver coins (\u9280\u5143) and Chinese silver ingots (\u9280\u5169) based on their silver content, the government of the Qing dynasty still enforced the opinion that the silver coins that originated in foreign countries was somehow of inferior value than the Chinese sycees.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> Yet the private Chinese markets didn't share this opinion with the imperial Qing government as the populations of the coastal provinces (and Guangdong most in particular) held the foreign silver coins in high esteem due to various advantages such as their fixed nominal values and their consistently reliable fineness of their silver content which all made them be used for transactions without having to undergo a process of assaying or weighing as is expected of sycees.{{sfn|Peng (\u5f6d) - 1954 (2007)|p=577\u2013580}}<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\nThe year 1814 the market value of 1 silver foreign coin in Guangzhou was never less than 723 Chinese cash coins, while in other provinces like [[Jiangsu]] and [[Zhejiang]] they were even worth more eight hundred cash coins, or foreign silver coins could be traded for 0.73 tael of silver each.<ref>Cong Hanxiang (\u5f9e\u7ff0\u9999), Hong Jiaguan (\u6d2a\u846d\u7ba1) (1992). \"Yinding (\u9280\u9320)\", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu (\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u66f8), Zhongguo lishi (\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u53f2) (Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), Vol. 3, 1408.</ref><ref>Cai Maoshui (\u8521\u8302\u6c34) (1997). \"Wenyin (\u7d0b\u9280)\", in Men Kui (\u9580\u5dcb), Zhang Yanjin (\u5f35\u71d5\u747e), ed.

The Chinese authorities during this period for this reason often raised the proposition to ban the circulation of foreign silver coins within Chinese territory, on the suspicion that \"good\" Chinese silver went to foreign markets, while the \"inferior\" foreign silver coins caused the markets of southern China to inundate. There was evidence that the Qing dynasty indeed suffered a net loss of 11% when changing Chinese into foreign silver.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> During the initial period of the 19th century the imperial Chinese administration suspected that more silver was being exported than imported causing the Chinese to slowly develop a silver deficit as the trade balance fell on the negative side of the spectrum for the Qing.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> However, as the government of the Qing dynasty never collected and compiled any statistics on the private trade of silver it is very difficult to generate any accurate hard numbers on these claims.<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/> According to [[Hosea Ballou Morse]] the turning point for the Chinese trade balance was in the year 1826, during this year the trade balance allegedly fell from a positive balance of 1,300,000 pesos to a negative one of 2,100,000 pesos.{{sfn|Peng (\u5f6d) - 1954 (2007)|p=577\u2013580}}<ref name=\"ChinaKnowledgeQingPeriodMoney\"/>\n\nAccording to the memorial by the governor of [[Fujian]], L.

Originally a dollar was worth upwards of seven Mace; the value gradually rose over time to eight Mace, and by 1855 it exceeded nine Mace.<ref>The Memorial by L.

However, no successful proposal was ever introduced.<ref name=\"Standards\" />\n\nCastille ordered a study of the constabulary in order to get a better reign on the situation in the state. The result was the 2014 Joint State Government Committee Constable Study. In addition to providing history of the constabulary and comparisons to other law enforcement entities, the 100-plus page review cited issues with the constabulary and offered ideas to fix them, including modification of '''Act 49 of 2009'''. The JSGC study was never acted upon during 2014 or 2015.\n\nIn 2014, new Constable Rules of Court were implemented by the Pa Supreme Court applicable to all constables. However, lacking a mechanism of enforcement and penalties for failure to follow, many counties and constables alike have chosen to ignore them.

It is at the same level as a prefecture for administrative purposes. It contains the [[Chengguan District, Lhasa|Chengguan District]], [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]], [[Dagz\u00ea District]], and other rural areas.{{sfn|Barnett|1996|p=82}} }} is a [[prefecture-level city]], one of the main administrative divisions of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of China. It covers an area of {{convert|29274|km2}} of rugged and sparsely populated terrain. Its capital and largest city is [[Lhasa]], with around 300,000 residents, which mostly corresponds with the administrative Chengguan District, while its suburbs extend into [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]] and [[Dagz\u00ea District]]. The consolidated prefecture-level city contains additional five, mostly rural, counties.\n\nThe city boundaries roughly correspond to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], a major tributary of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]]. It lies on the [[Lhasa terrane]], the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the [[Himalayas]]. The terrane is high, contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active. The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter. Most of the rain falls in summer. The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks, sheep and goats, while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley, wheat and vegetables. Wildlife is not abundant, but includes the rare [[snow leopard]] and [[black-necked crane]]. Mining has caused some environmental problems.\n\nThe 2000 census gave a total population of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population at the time was mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway]], which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the [[Yangbajain Geothermal Station|Yangbajain Geothermal Field]]. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nLhasa lies in south-central Tibet, to the north of the Himalayas.\nThe prefecture-level city is {{convert|277|km}} from east to west and {{convert|202|km}} from north to south.

\"Lhasa City\" or \"Lhasa Municipality\". It is at the same level as a prefecture for administrative purposes. It contains the [[Chengguan District, Lhasa|Chengguan District]], [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]], [[Dagz\u00ea District]], and other rural areas.{{sfn|Barnett|1996|p=82}} }} is a [[prefecture-level city]], one of the main administrative divisions of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of China. It covers an area of {{convert|29274|km2}} of rugged and sparsely populated terrain. Its capital and largest city is [[Lhasa]], with around 300,000 residents, which mostly corresponds with the administrative Chengguan District, while its suburbs extend into [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]] and [[Dagz\u00ea District]]. The consolidated prefecture-level city contains additional five, mostly rural, counties.\n\nThe city boundaries roughly correspond to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], a major tributary of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]]. It lies on the [[Lhasa terrane]], the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the [[Himalayas]]. The terrane is high, contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active. The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter. Most of the rain falls in summer. The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks, sheep and goats, while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley, wheat and vegetables. Wildlife is not abundant, but includes the rare [[snow leopard]] and [[black-necked crane]]. Mining has caused some environmental problems.\n\nThe 2000 census gave a total population of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population at the time was mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway]], which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the [[Yangbajain Geothermal Station|Yangbajain Geothermal Field]]. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nLhasa lies in south-central Tibet, to the north of the Himalayas.\nThe prefecture-level city is {{convert|277|km}} from east to west and {{convert|202|km}} from north to south.

He is often openly aggressive and intimidating toward suspects, which can either complicate the case further or lead to speedy confessions. When his wife Kathy ([[Isabel Gillies]]) leaves him in Season 6, Stabler's anger rises closer to the surface and in a few episodes threatens to boil over. One such instance occurs when Stabler investigates [[serial killer]] Gordon Rickett ([[Matthew Modine]]), whom he had investigated 14 years earlier. During interrogation, Ricketts tells Stabler that they harbor the same kind of rage, and that if it weren't for his family and his job, Stabler would be just like him. When Benson and Stabler catch Rickett about to murder a young girl, Stabler appears ready to kill him in cold blood; it's only Benson's intervention that prevents him from doing so.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Rage|series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit|serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit|network= [[NBC]]|airdate=March 1, 2005|season=6|number=17}}</ref>\n\nIn Season 7, he goes to see a police psychiatrist, Dr. Rebecca Hendrix ([[Mary Stuart Masterson]]), after using [[excessive force]] on an abusive parent.

(1997; 2003) Tel Aviv: Am Oved. During the month of Elul, two weeks before Yom Kippur, when Jewish tradition maintains that God judges man for his sins, Nachman undertakes a regime of penance. He vows himself to silence and later gives up eating and sleeping, devoting himself to sacred study and thoughts of repentance. The purification he longs for confronts a repulsive reality, suffocating, fanatical and fraught with superstition. Elbaum describes the yeshiva world during the seventies and eighties in Jerusalem in a unique language derived from the orthodox Jewish slang. This book was crowned with wonderful reviews and paved Elbaum his literary path within the Israeli society.\n*2001: ''My Life with the Ancestors''. Tel Aviv: Am Oved. An autobiographical fantasy which locates the biblical forefathers in modern Israel. This book was awarded the President's Prize for Young Writers in 2002. \"It is a carefully written, friendly novel that one could read without intermission. The story might easily extract loud laughter, move one to tears, and fill the heart with sympathy for the narrator and the three lost souls who unfold before our eyes\" (a review by Golan, Avirma in ''Ha\u2019Aretz'' newspaper, 9 May 2001). \n*2006: ''The Lion, his Mane and the Giraffe''. Tel Aviv: Am Oved. A humorous children's book, carrying hidden autobiographical elements, which presents the relationship between a giraffe and a lion after the lion has shaved his mane. It is a story on a true friendship, changes and personal identity.\n*2008: ''The Octopus and the Sea Horse''. Tel Aviv: Am Oved. Children's book on a young octopus with itchy tentacles which get him in trouble, until he finds a friend.\n*2009: ''Into the Fullness of the Void: A Spiritual Autobiography''. (2007; 2013) USA: Jewish Lights Publishers, Tel Aviv: Am Oved. Dov Elbaum grew up in an ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem family, and was a prodigy who seemed destined for greatness in the world of Talmud study. But in his late teens, he abruptly broke away and set off into secular Israeli society. In this fascinating, courageous and compelling autobiography, Elbaum seeks to understand his decision and its consequences. With the structure of Kabbalah as his road map, Elbaum journeys into the deep recesses of his self and his soul. This is an intimate, honest, revealing work, both deeply personal and strikingly universal. The Hebrew edition was a bestseller and sold over 50,000 copies.  \"Brilliant, courageous and innovative.\u2026 Serves as a modern continuation of the literary and scholarly work of Martin Buber [and] follows in the footsteps of Abraham Joshua Heschel\u2019s work.\u2026 Makes present and internalizes the ancient Kabbalistic perceptions in his personal life [and] creates a renewed understanding\u2014both personal and spiritual\u2014of a Jewish tradition that today non-Jews and non-Israelis worldwide are also fascinated by.\" (a review by Moshe Idel, Max Cooper Professor of Jewish Thought, Hebrew University, Jerusalem). \n*2012: ''The Eagle\u2019s Island''.

(1997; 2003) Tel Aviv: Am Oved. During the month of Elul, two weeks before Yom Kippur, when Jewish tradition maintains that God judges man for his sins, Nachman undertakes a regime of penance. He vows himself to silence and later gives up eating and sleeping, devoting himself to sacred study and thoughts of repentance. The purification he longs for confronts a repulsive reality, suffocating, fanatical and fraught with superstition. Elbaum describes the yeshiva world during the seventies and eighties in Jerusalem in a unique language derived from the orthodox Jewish slang. This book was crowned with wonderful reviews and paved Elbaum his literary path within the Israeli society.\n*2001: ''My Life with the Ancestors''. Tel Aviv: Am Oved. An autobiographical fantasy which locates the biblical forefathers in modern Israel. This book was awarded the President's Prize for Young Writers in 2002. \"It is a carefully written, friendly novel that one could read without intermission. The story might easily extract loud laughter, move one to tears, and fill the heart with sympathy for the narrator and the three lost souls who unfold before our eyes\" (a review by Golan, Avirma in ''Ha\u2019Aretz'' newspaper, 9 May 2001). \n*2006: ''The Lion, his Mane and the Giraffe''. Tel Aviv: Am Oved. A humorous children's book, carrying hidden autobiographical elements, which presents the relationship between a giraffe and a lion after the lion has shaved his mane. It is a story on a true friendship, changes and personal identity.\n*2008: ''The Octopus and the Sea Horse''. Tel Aviv: Am Oved. Children's book on a young octopus with itchy tentacles which get him in trouble, until he finds a friend.\n*2009: ''Into the Fullness of the Void: A Spiritual Autobiography''. (2007; 2013) USA: Jewish Lights Publishers, Tel Aviv: Am Oved. Dov Elbaum grew up in an ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem family, and was a prodigy who seemed destined for greatness in the world of Talmud study. But in his late teens, he abruptly broke away and set off into secular Israeli society. In this fascinating, courageous and compelling autobiography, Elbaum seeks to understand his decision and its consequences. With the structure of Kabbalah as his road map, Elbaum journeys into the deep recesses of his self and his soul. This is an intimate, honest, revealing work, both deeply personal and strikingly universal. The Hebrew edition was a bestseller and sold over 50,000 copies.  \"Brilliant, courageous and innovative.\u2026 Serves as a modern continuation of the literary and scholarly work of Martin Buber [and] follows in the footsteps of Abraham Joshua Heschel\u2019s work.\u2026 Makes present and internalizes the ancient Kabbalistic perceptions in his personal life [and] creates a renewed understanding\u2014both personal and spiritual\u2014of a Jewish tradition that today non-Jews and non-Israelis worldwide are also fascinated by.\" (a review by Moshe Idel, Max Cooper Professor of Jewish Thought, Hebrew University, Jerusalem). \n*2012: ''The Eagle\u2019s Island''. Tel Aviv: Am Oved.

B. Priestley]].\n\nWritten in 1929, it follows the fortunes of a [[Concert Party (entertainment)|concert party]] on a tour of England. It is Priestley's most famous novel, and it established him as a national figure. It won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] and was adapted twice into film.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\n[[File:Judi_Dench_\"The_Good_Companions\"_2013-06-22_12-28.jpg|thumbnail|[[Judi Dench]] in \"The Good Companions\"]]\n\nThe novel is written in [[picaresque]] style, and opens with the middle aged, discontented Jess Oakroyd in the fictional [[Yorkshire]] town of Bruddersford. He opts to leave his family and seek adventure \"on t'road\" (throughout the novel Priestley uses dialect for all non-[[Received Pronunciation|RP]] speakers of English). He heads south down the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]].\n\nIntertwined with the story of Oakroyd's travels are those of Elizabeth Trant and Inigo Jollifant, two similarly malcontented individuals. Miss Trant is an upper-middle class \"spinster\" and Jollifant is a teacher at a down-at-heel private school. All three ultimately encounter each other when a failing concert troupe ('The Dinky Doos') are disbanding as a result of their manager's running off with the takings. The independently wealthy Miss Trant, against the advice of her relatives, decides to refloat the troupe, now known as 'The Good Companions'. Inigo plays piano and writes songs, Oakroyd is the odd-job man, and the troupe has also been joined by Mr Morton Mitcham (a travelling banjo player and conjuror whom Inigo met earlier on his own odyssey). The other members of the troupe are comedian Jimmy Nunn; song-and-dance man Jerry Jerningham; singers Elsie Longstaff, Courtney (aka Joe) Brundit, and Joe's wife (referred to as \"Mrs. Joe\"); and singer-comedienne Susie Dean. The troupe have various adventures round the shires of middle England.\n\nAfter a sabotaged performance, the troupe disband: Jerry marries Lady Partlit, a fan; Susie and Inigo become successful and famous in London; Miss Trant marries a long lost sweetheart; Jess Oakroyd emigrates to Canada and the other performers carry on with their life on the road.\n\n== Literary significance and reception ==\n\n''The Good Companions'' was an instant hit on publication, but was not particularly well regarded by critics. Despite this, it remained popular for over forty years. It then fell out of favour, not only because the novel was written from a (rather old fashioned) middle class perspective but also because it deals with a phenomenon (a travelling [[Concert party (entertainment)|music hall troupe]]) which no longer exists.\n\nMore recently there has been a reappraisal of this and other Priestley works: a new edition of ''The Good Companions'' appeared in October 2007 with a foreword by Dame [[Judi Dench]], accompanying a reappraisal of the various versions by [[Ronald Harwood]], [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] and [[Alan Plater]] amongst others.\n\n== Dramatic adaptations ==\n\n=== 1931 theatrical adaptation ===\n{{Main|The Good Companions (play)}}\nPriestley collaborated with [[Edward Knoblock]] on a stage version of his novel, which opened at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], London on 14 May 1931.
