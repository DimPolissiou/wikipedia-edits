He befriends Henri ([[Patrick d'Assum\u00e7ao]]), an older man who seeks solitude at the beach after breaking up with his girlfriend, and Michel (Christophe Paou), a handsome man to whom Franck is instantly attracted.\n\nOne evening, Franck observes Michel drowning another man in the lake. Though terrified by what he has seen, Franck is unable to resist his attraction to Michel, and continues to pursue him. When the body of the drowned man is discovered and identified, a police investigator begins to question the men at the beach; Franck tells the investigator that he did not see anything unusual on the evening the man drowned. Franck and Michel's relationship progresses, though Franck becomes increasingly frustrated by Michel's refusal to meet him anywhere other than at the beach.\n\nHenri, who has correctly intuited the events that have occurred over the past several days, warns Franck about Michel. When Franck goes swimming, Henri confronts Michel, and tells him that he knows he is the murderer. Henri leaves to take a walk in the woods, casting a glance back at Michel as he departs. When Franck returns, he discovers that the beach is suddenly deserted. He enters the woods, where he sees Michel walking away from a patch of tall grass. Upon entering the grass, he finds Henri, whose throat has been slit. Henri tells him that he got what he wanted. Franck, now being pursued by Michel, runs into the woods to hide. He sees Michel run into the inspector, whom he hits violently and stabs in the stomach with a knife.\n\nNight falls, and Franck remains in hiding. Michel calls out to Franck, saying that he needs his love and wants to spend the night with him. Franck does not respond, and Michel walks away to search for him deeper in the woods. After a time, Franck stands up from his hiding place, and calls out Michel's name repeatedly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierre Deladonchamps]] as Franck\n* Christophe Paou as Michel\n* [[Patrick d'Assum\u00e7ao]] as Henri\n\n==Production==\n[[image:LacdeStCroix12A.jpg|thumb|center|500px|View of the Lake.]]\nThe film contained [[unsimulated sex]], which was filmed using [[body double]]s.

He befriends Henri ([[Patrick d'Assum\u00e7ao]]), an older man who seeks solitude at the beach after breaking up with his girlfriend, and Michel (Christophe Paou), a handsome man to whom Franck is instantly attracted.\n\nOne evening, Franck observes Michel drowning another man in the lake. Though terrified by what he has seen, Franck is unable to resist his attraction to Michel, and continues to pursue him. When the body of the drowned man is discovered and identified, a police investigator begins to question the men at the beach; Franck tells the investigator that he did not see anything unusual on the evening the man drowned. Franck and Michel's relationship progresses, though Franck becomes increasingly frustrated by Michel's refusal to meet him anywhere other than at the beach.\n\nHenri, who has correctly intuited the events that have occurred over the past several days, warns Franck about Michel. When Franck goes swimming, Henri confronts Michel, and tells him that he knows he is the murderer. Henri leaves to take a walk in the woods, casting a glance back at Michel as he departs. When Franck returns, he discovers that the beach is suddenly deserted. He enters the woods, where he sees Michel walking away from a patch of tall grass. Upon entering the grass, he finds Henri, whose throat has been slit. Franck, now being pursued by Michel, runs into the woods to hide. Michel runs into the inspector, whom he hits violently and stabs in the stomach with a knife.\n\nNight falls, and Franck remains in hiding. Michel calls out to Franck, saying that he needs his love and wants to spend the night with him. Franck does not respond, and Michel walks away to search for him deeper in the woods. Franck stands up from his hiding place, and calls out Michel's name.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierre Deladonchamps]] as Franck\n* Christophe Paou as Michel\n* [[Patrick d'Assum\u00e7ao]] as Henri\n\n==Production==\n[[image:LacdeStCroix12A.jpg|thumb|center|500px|View of the Lake.]]\nThe film contained [[unsimulated sex]], which was filmed using [[body double]]s.

Specific gravity for liquids is nearly always measured with respect to [[water (molecule)|water]] at its densest (at {{cvt|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}}); for gases, air at [[room temperature]] ({{cvt|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|disp=or}}) is the reference. The term \"relative density\" is often preferred in scientific usage. It is defined as a ratio of density of particular substance with that of water.\n\nIf a substance's relative density is less than one then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference. If the relative density is exactly 1 then the densities are equal; that is, equal volumes of the two substances have the same mass.  If the reference material is water, then a substance with a relative density (or specific gravity) less than 1 will float in water. For example, an ice cube, with a relative density of about 0.91, will float. A substance with a relative density greater than 1 will sink.\n\nTemperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (101.325 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]). Where it is not, it is more usual to specify the density directly. Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British brewing practice, the specific gravity, as specified above, is multiplied by 1000.<ref name=briggs>Hough, J.S., Briggs, D.E., Stevens, R and Young, T.W. Malting and Brewing Science, Vol. II Hopped Wort and Beer, Chapman and Hall, London, 1991, p. 881</ref> Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as [[brine]]s, [[sugar]] solutions ([[syrup]]s, juices, honeys, brewers [[wort]], [[must]], etc.) and acids.\n\n==Basic calculation==\nRelative density(''RD'') or specific gravity (''SG'') is a [[dimensionless quantity]], as it is the ratio of either densities or weights\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{RD} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{substance}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{reference}}\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''RD'' is relative density, ''\u03c1<sub>substance</sub>'' is the density of the substance being measured, and ''\u03c1<sub>reference</sub>'' is the density of the reference. (By convention ''\u03c1'', the Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]], denotes density.)\n\nThe reference material can be indicated using subscripts: ''RD''<sub>substance/reference</sub>, which means \"the relative density of ''substance'' with respect to ''reference''\". If the reference is not explicitly stated then it is normally assumed to be [[water]] at 4&nbsp;\u00b0[[Celsius|C]] (or, more precisely, 3.98&nbsp;\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], which is the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density). In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, the density of water is (approximately) 1000&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]/[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] or 1&nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/[[Cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], which makes relative density calculations particularly convenient: the density of the object only needs to be divided by 1000 or 1, depending on the units.\n\nThe relative density of gases is often measured with respect to dry [[air]] at a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and a pressure of 101.325 kPa absolute, which has a density of 1.205&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Relative density with respect to air can be obtained by\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{RD} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{gas}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{air}}} \\approx \\frac{M_\\mathrm{gas}}{M_{\\mathrm{air}}}\n</math>\n\nWhere ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] and the approximately equal sign is used because equality pertains only if 1 [[Mole (unit)|mol]] of the gas and 1&nbsp;mol of air occupy the same volume at a given temperature and pressure i.e. they are both [[Ideal gas]]es. Ideal behaviour is usually only seen at very low pressure. For example, one mol of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 L at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1 atmosphere whereas [[carbon dioxide]] has a molar volume of 22.259 L under those same conditions.\n\nThose with SG greater than 1 are denser than water and will, disregarding [[surface tension]] effects, sink in it. Those with an SG less than 1 are less dense than water and will float on it. In scientific work, the relationship of mass to volume is usually expressed directly in terms of the density (mass per unit volume) of the substance under study. It is in industry where specific gravity finds wide application, often for historical reasons.\n\nTrue specific gravity of a liquid can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{true} = \\frac {\\rho_\\text{sample}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1''<sub>sample</sub> is the density of the sample and ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the density of water.\n\nThe apparent specific gravity is simply the ratio of the weights of equal volumes of sample and water in air:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{apparent} = \\frac {W_{\\mathrm{A},\\text{sample}}}{W_{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{H_2O}}} </math>\n\nwhere ''W''<sub>A,sample</sub> represents the weight of the sample measured in air and ''W''<sub>A,H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> the weight of an equal volume of water  measured in air.\n\nIt can be shown that true specific gravity can be computed from different properties:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{true} = \\frac {\\rho_\\text{sample}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}} = \\frac {\\frac{m_\\text{sample}}{V}}{\\frac{m_\\mathrm{H_2O}}{V}} = \\frac {m_\\text{sample}}{m_\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\frac{g}{g} = \\frac {W_{\\mathrm{V},\\text{sample}}}{W_{\\mathrm{V},\\mathrm{H_2O}}} </math> \n\nwhere ''g'' is the local acceleration due to gravity, ''V'' is the volume of the sample and of water (the same for both), ''\u03c1''<sub>sample</sub> is the density of the sample, ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the density of water, ''W''<sub>V</sub> represents a weight obtained in vacuum, <math>\\mathit{m}_{\\text{sample}}</math> is the mass of the sample and <math>\\mathit{m}_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}</math>is the mass of an equal volume of water.\n\nThe density of water varies with temperature and pressure as does the density of the sample. So it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or weights were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at 1 nominal atmosphere (101.325&nbsp;kPa \u00b1 variations from changing weather patterns). But as specific gravity usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products), variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent specific gravity is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') specific gravity calculations, air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (''T''<sub>s</sub>/''T''<sub>r</sub>), with ''T''<sub>s</sub> representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T''<sub>r</sub> the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and of the water at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, we note that, while ''SG''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{val|1.000000}} (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C), it is also the case that ''SG''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{frac|{{val|0.998203}}|{{val|0.999840}}}} = {{val|0.998363}} (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C).

In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries, sucrose concentration by weight is taken from a table prepared by [[Brix|A. Brix]], which uses SG (17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). As a final example, the British SG units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&nbsp;\u00b0F and are thus (15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C/15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nGiven the specific gravity of a substance, its actual density can be calculated by rearranging the above formula:\n\n:<math>{\\rho_\\text{substance}} = SG \\times \\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}.</math>\n\nOccasionally a reference substance other than water is specified (for example, air), in which case specific gravity means density relative to that reference.\n\n==Temperature dependence==\n:''See [[Density]] for a table of the measured densities of water at various temperatures.''\n\nThe density of substances varies with temperature and pressure so that it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or masses were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at nominally 1 atmosphere (101.325&nbsp;kPa ignoring the variations caused by changing weather patterns) but as relative density usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products) variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent relative density is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') relative density calculations air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (''T<sub>s</sub>''/''T<sub>r</sub>'') with ''T<sub>s</sub>'' representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T<sub>r</sub>'' the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified.

Relative density is often used by [[Geology|geologists]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] to help determine the [[mineral]] content of a rock or other sample. [[Gemology|Gemologists]] use it as an aid in the identification of [[gemstone]]s. Water is preferred as the reference because measurements are then easy to carry out in the field (see below for examples of measurement methods).\n\nAs the principal use of relative density measurements in the industry is the determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and these are found in tables of RD vs concentration it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of relative density. For example, in the brewing industry, the [[Plato scale|Plato table]], which lists sucrose concentration by mass against true RD, were originally (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>ASBC Methods of Analysis Preface to Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer, American Society of Brewing Chemists, St Paul, 2009</ref> that is based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20&nbsp;\u00b0C) but referenced to the density of water at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density of ''\u03c1''({{chem|H|2|O}}) equal to 0.999972&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (or 62.43&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft<sup>\u22123</sup>).

In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by mass is taken from this work<ref name=briggs/> which uses SG (17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). As a final example, the British RD units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&nbsp;\u00b0F and are thus (15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C/15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=briggs/>\n\n==Measurement==\nRelative density can be calculated directly by measuring the density of a sample and dividing it by the (known) density of the reference substance. The density of the sample is simply its mass divided by its volume. Although mass is easy to measure, the volume of an irregularly shaped sample can be more difficult to ascertain. One method is to put the sample in a water-filled [[graduated cylinder]] and read off how much water it displaces. Alternatively the container can be filled to the brim, the sample immersed, and the volume of overflow measured. The [[surface tension]] of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small samples. For this reason it is desirable to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.\n\nFor each substance, the density, ''\u03c1'', is given by\n\n:<math>\\rho = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}}\n = \\frac{\\text{Deflection} \\times \\frac{\\text{Spring Constant}}{\\text{Gravity}}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Water Line} \\times \\text{Area}_\\mathrm{Cylinder}}\\,\n</math>\n\nWhen these densities are divided, references to the spring constant, gravity and cross-sectional area simply cancel, leaving\n\n:<math>\nRD=\\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{object}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{ref}}\n= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{Deflection}_\\mathrm{Obj.}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Obj.}}}{\\frac{\\text{Deflection}_\\mathrm{Ref.}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Ref.}}}\n = \\frac{\\frac{3\\ \\mathrm{in}}{20\\ \\mathrm{mm}}}{\\frac{5\\ \\mathrm{in}}{34\\ \\mathrm{mm}}}=\\frac{3\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 34\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{5\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 20\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = 1.02\\,\n</math>\n\n===Hydrostatic weighing===\n{{main article|Hydrostatic weighing}}\nRelative density is more easily and perhaps more accurately measured without measuring volume. Using a spring scale, the sample is weighed first in air and then in water. Relative density (with respect to water) can then be calculated using the following formula:\n\n:<math>\nRD = \\frac{W_\\mathrm{air}}{W_\\mathrm{air} - W_\\mathrm{water}}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n:''W''<sub>air</sub> is the weight of the sample in air (measured in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, [[pound-force|pounds-force]] or some other unit of force)\n:''W''<sub>water</sub> is the weight of the sample in water (measured in the same units).\n\nThis technique cannot easily be used to measure relative densities less than one, because the sample will then float. ''W''<sub>water</sub> becomes a negative quantity, representing the force needed to keep the sample underwater.\n\nAnother practical method uses three measurements. The sample is weighed dry. Then a container filled to the brim with water is weighed, and weighed again with the sample immersed, after the displaced water has overflowed and been removed. Subtracting the last reading from the sum of the first two readings gives the weight of the displaced water. The relative density result is the dry sample weight divided by that of the displaced water. This method works with scales that can't easily accommodate a suspended sample, and also allows for measurement of samples that are less dense than water.\n\n===Hydrometer===\n{{main article|hydrometer}}\n[[File:Hydro.PNG|right|300px]]\nThe relative density of a liquid can be measured using a hydrometer. This consists of a bulb attached to a stalk of constant cross-sectional area, as shown in the adjacent diagram.\n\nFirst the hydrometer is floated in the reference liquid (shown in light blue), and the [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] (the level of the liquid on the stalk) is marked (blue line). The reference could be any liquid, but in practice it is usually water.\n\nThe hydrometer is then floated in a liquid of unknown density (shown in green). The change in displacement, \u0394''x'', is noted. In the example depicted, the hydrometer has dropped slightly in the green liquid; hence its density is lower than that of the reference liquid. It is, of course, necessary that the hydrometer floats in both liquids.\n\nThe application of simple physical principles allows the relative density of the unknown liquid to be calculated from the change in displacement. (In practice the stalk of the hydrometer is pre-marked with graduations to facilitate this measurement.)\n\nIn the explanation that follows,\n\n:'''''\u03c1<sub>ref</sub>''''' is the known density ([[mass]] per unit [[volume]]) of the reference liquid (typically water).\n:'''''\u03c1<sub>new</sub>''' is the unknown density of the new (green) liquid.\n:'''''RD''<sub>new/ref</sub>''' is the relative density of the new liquid with respect to the reference.\n:'''''V''''' is the volume of reference liquid displaced, i.e. the red volume in the diagram.\n:'''''m''''' is the mass of the entire hydrometer.\n:'''''g''''' is the [[Earth's gravity|local gravitational constant]].\n:'''''\u0394x''''' is the change in displacement. In accordance with the way in which hydrometers are usually graduated, \u0394''x'' is here taken to be negative if the displacement line rises on the stalk of the hydrometer, and positive if it falls. In the example depicted, \u0394''x'' is negative.\n:'''''A''''' is the cross sectional area of the shaft.\n\nSince the floating hydrometer is in [[static equilibrium]], the downward gravitational force acting upon it must exactly balance the upward buoyancy force. The gravitational force acting on the hydrometer is simply its weight, ''mg''. From the [[Archimedes]] [[buoyancy]] principle, the buoyancy force acting on the hydrometer is equal to the weight of liquid displaced. This weight is equal to the mass of liquid displaced multiplied by ''g'', which in the case of the reference liquid is ''\u03c1<sub>ref</sub>Vg''. Setting these equal, we have\n\n:<math>mg = \\rho_\\mathrm{ref}Vg\\,</math>\n\nor just\n\n<!-- these nasty tables are the only way I can find to get the equation number to align properly. Something like <div align=\"right\">(2)</div> doesn't work properly. -->\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>m = \\rho_\\mathrm{ref} V\\,</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(1)\n|}\n\nExactly the same equation applies when the hydrometer is floating in the liquid being measured, except that the new volume is ''V''&nbsp;-&nbsp;''A''\u0394''x'' (see note above about the sign of \u0394''x''). Thus,\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>m = \\rho_\\mathrm{new} (V - A \\Delta x)\\,</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(2)\n|}\n\nCombining (1) and (2) yields\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>RD_{\\mathrm{new/ref}} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{new}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{V}{V - A \\Delta x}</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(3)\n|}\n\nBut from (1) we have ''V'' = ''m''/''\u03c1''<sub>ref</sub>. Substituting into (3) gives\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>RD_{\\mathrm{new/ref}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{A \\Delta x}{m} \\rho_\\mathrm{ref}}</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(4)\n|}\n\nThis equation allows the relative density to be calculated from the change in displacement, the known density of the reference liquid, and the known properties of the hydrometer. If \u0394''x'' is small then, as a [[Orders of approximation|first-order approximation]] of the [[geometric series]] equation (4) can be written as:\n\n:<math>RD_\\mathrm{new/ref} \\approx 1 + \\frac{A \\Delta x}{m} \\rho_\\mathrm{ref} </math>\n\nThis shows that, for small \u0394''x'', changes in displacement are approximately proportional to changes in relative density.\n\n===Pycnometer===\n[[File:PycnometerEmpty.jpg|thumb|upright|An empty glass pycnometer and stopper]]\n[[File:Pycnometer full.jpg|thumb|upright|A filled pycnometer]]\nA '''pycnometer''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: \u03c0\u03c5\u03ba\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (puknos) meaning \"dense\"), also called '''pyknometer''' or '''specific gravity bottle''', is a device used to determine the [[density]] of a liquid.  A pycnometer is usually made of [[glass]], with a close-fitting [[ground glass joint|ground glass]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] with a [[capillary tube]] through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus.  This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as [[water]] or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], using an [[analytical balance]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIf the flask is weighed empty, full of water, and full of a liquid whose relative density is desired, the relative density of the liquid can easily be calculated. The [[particle density (packed density)|particle density]] of a powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied, can also be determined with a pycnometer. The powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample.  The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble.  The weight of the displaced liquid can then be determined, and hence the relative density of the powder.\n\nA [[gas pycnometer]], the gas-based manifestation of a pycnometer, compares the change in pressure caused by a measured change in a closed volume containing a reference (usually a steel sphere of known volume) with the change in pressure caused by the sample under the same conditions.  The difference in change of pressure represents the volume of the sample as compared to the reference sphere, and is usually used for solid particulates that may dissolve in the liquid medium of the pycnometer design described above, or for porous materials into which the liquid would not fully penetrate.\n\nWhen a pycnometer is filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, ''V'' and is placed upon a balance, it will exert a force\n\n:<math> F_b = g(m_b - \\rho_a{m_b\\over \\rho_b}) </math>\n\nwhere ''m<sub>b</sub>'' is the mass of the bottle and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]] at the location at which the measurements are being made. ''\u03c1''<sub>a</sub> is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and ''\u03c1''<sub>b</sub> is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by [[Archimedes' principle#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes Principle]] must be subtracted. The bottle is, of course, filled with air but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:\n\n:<math> F_w = g(m_b - \\rho_a{m_b\\over \\rho_b} + V\\rho_w - V\\rho_a). </math>\n\nIf we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.\n\n:<math>F_{w,n} = gV( \\rho_w - \\rho_a) </math>\n\nwhere the subscript n indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:\n\n:<math>F_{s,n} = gV(\\rho_s - \\rho_a) </math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1''<sub>s</sub> is the density of the sample. The ratio of the sample and water forces is:\n\n:<math>SG_A = {gV(\\rho_s - \\rho_a) \\over gV( \\rho_w - \\rho_a)} = {( \\rho_s - \\rho_a) \\over ( \\rho_w - \\rho_a)}. </math>\n\nThis is called the Apparent Relative Density, denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a [[hydrometer]] (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does ''RD<sub>A</sub>'' depend on the actual volume of the pycnometer.\n\nFurther manipulation and finally substitution of ''RD<sub>V</sub>'', the true relative density (the subscript V is used because this is often referred to as the relative density ''in vacuo''), for ''\u03c1''<sub>s</sub>/''\u03c1''<sub>w</sub> gives the relationship between apparent and true relative density.\n\n:<math>RD_A= {{\\rho_s \\over \\rho_w}-{\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w} \\over 1 - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w}} ={RD_V-{\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w} \\over 1 - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w}}</math>\n\nIn the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true relative density. This is found from\n\n:<math>RD_V = RD_A - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w }(RD_A-1)</math>\n\nSince the density of dry air at 101.325&nbsp;kPa at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C is<ref>DIN51 757 (04.1994): Testing of mineral oils and related materials; determination of density</ref> 0.001205 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and that of water is 0.998203 g/cm<sup>3</sup> we see that the difference between true and apparent relative densities for a substance with relative density (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the relative density of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.\n\nThe pycnometer is used in ISO standard: ISO 1183-1:2004, ISO 1014\u20131985 and [[ASTM International|ASTM]] standard: ASTM D854.\n\n'''Types'''\n\n* [[Gay-Lussac]], pear shaped, with perforated stopper, adjusted, capacity 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mL\n* as above, with ground-in [[thermometer]], adjusted, side tube with cap\n* Hubbard, for [[bitumen]] and [[heavy crude oil]]s, cylindrical type, [[ASTM]] D 70, 24 mL\n* as above, conical type, ASTM D 115 and D 234, 25 mL\n* Boot, with vacuum jacket and thermometer, capacity 5, 10, 25 and 50 mL\n\n===Digital density meters===\n''Hydrostatic Pressure-based Instruments'': This technology relies upon Pascal's Principle which states that the pressure difference between two points within a vertical column of fluid is dependent upon the vertical distance between the two points, the density of the fluid and the gravitational force. This technology is often used for tank gaging applications as a convenient means of liquid level and density measure.\n\n''Vibrating Element Transducers'': This type of instrument requires a vibrating element to be placed in contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using [[oscillating U-tube]] meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/coriolis-flowmeter |via= sciencedirect.com | title=MPD with Flow Measurement as the Primary Control| first= Erdem |last= Catak| work= Managed Pressure Drilling| year= 2008  |access-date= July 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Ultrasonic Transducer'': Ultrasonic waves are passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a detector which measures the acoustic spectroscopy of the waves.

Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring relative density with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.005 RD units. The submersible probe head contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors.

Specific gravity for liquids is nearly always measured with respect to [[water (molecule)|water]] at its densest (at {{cvt|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}}); for gases, air at [[room temperature]] ({{cvt|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|disp=or}}) is the reference. The term \"relative density\" is often preferred in scientific usage. It is defined as a ratio of density of particular substance with that of water.\n\nIf a substance's relative density is less than one then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference. If the relative density is exactly 1 then the densities are equal; that is, equal volumes of the two substances have the same mass.  If the reference material is water, then a substance with a relative density (or specific gravity) less than 1 will float in water. For example, an ice cube, with a relative density of about 0.91, will float. A substance with a relative density greater than 1 will sink.\n\nTemperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (101.325 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]). Where it is not, it is more usual to specify the density directly. Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British brewing practice, the specific gravity, as specified above, is multiplied by 1000.<ref name=briggs>Hough, J.S., Briggs, D.E., Stevens, R and Young, T.W. Malting and Brewing Science, Vol. II Hopped Wort and Beer, Chapman and Hall, London, 1991, p. 881</ref> Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as [[brine]]s, [[sugar]] solutions ([[syrup]]s, juices, honeys, brewers [[wort]], [[must]], etc.) and acids.\n\n==Basic calculation==\nRelative density(''RD'') or specific gravity (''SG'') is a [[dimensionless quantity]], as it is the ratio of either densities or weights\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{RD} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{substance}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{reference}}\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''RD'' is relative density, ''\u03c1<sub>substance</sub>'' is the density of the substance being measured, and ''\u03c1<sub>reference</sub>'' is the density of the reference. (By convention ''\u03c1'', the Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]], denotes density.)\n\nThe reference material can be indicated using subscripts: ''RD''<sub>substance/reference</sub>, which means \"the relative density of ''substance'' with respect to ''reference''\". If the reference is not explicitly stated then it is normally assumed to be [[water]] at 4&nbsp;\u00b0[[Celsius|C]] (or, more precisely, 3.98&nbsp;\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], which is the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density). In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, the density of water is (approximately) 1000&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]/[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] or 1&nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/[[Cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], which makes relative density calculations particularly convenient: the density of the object only needs to be divided by 1000 or 1, depending on the units.\n\nThe relative density of gases is often measured with respect to dry [[air]] at a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and a pressure of 101.325 kPa absolute, which has a density of 1.205&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Relative density with respect to air can be obtained by\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{RD} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{gas}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{air}}} \\approx \\frac{M_\\mathrm{gas}}{M_{\\mathrm{air}}}\n</math>\n\nWhere ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] and the approximately equal sign is used because equality pertains only if 1 [[Mole (unit)|mol]] of the gas and 1&nbsp;mol of air occupy the same volume at a given temperature and pressure i.e. they are both [[Ideal gas]]es. Ideal behaviour is usually only seen at very low pressure. For example, one mol of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 L at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1 atmosphere whereas [[carbon dioxide]] has a molar volume of 22.259 L under those same conditions.\n\nThose with SG greater than 1 are denser than water and will, disregarding [[surface tension]] effects, sink in it. Those with an SG less than 1 are less dense than water and will float on it. In scientific work, the relationship of mass to volume is usually expressed directly in terms of the density (mass per unit volume) of the substance under study. It is in industry where specific gravity finds wide application, often for historical reasons.\n\nTrue specific gravity of a liquid can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{true} = \\frac {\\rho_\\text{sample}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1''<sub>sample</sub> is the density of the sample and ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the density of water.\n\nThe apparent specific gravity is simply the ratio of the weights of equal volumes of sample and water in air:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{apparent} = \\frac {W_{\\mathrm{A},\\text{sample}}}{W_{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{H_2O}}} </math>\n\nwhere ''W''<sub>A,sample</sub> represents the weight of the sample measured in air and ''W''<sub>A,H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> the weight of an equal volume of water  measured in air.\n\nIt can be shown that true specific gravity can be computed from different properties:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{true} = \\frac {\\rho_\\text{sample}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}} = \\frac {\\frac{m_\\text{sample}}{V}}{\\frac{m_\\mathrm{H_2O}}{V}} = \\frac {m_\\text{sample}}{m_\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\frac{g}{g} = \\frac {W_{\\mathrm{V},\\text{sample}}}{W_{\\mathrm{V},\\mathrm{H_2O}}} </math> \n\nwhere ''g'' is the local acceleration due to gravity, ''V'' is the volume of the sample and of water (the same for both), ''\u03c1''<sub>sample</sub> is the density of the sample, ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the density of water, ''W''<sub>V</sub> represents a weight obtained in vacuum, <math>\\mathit{m}_{\\text{sample}}</math> is the mass of the sample and <math>\\mathit{m}_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}</math>is the mass of an equal volume of water.\n\nThe density of water varies with temperature and pressure as does the density of the sample. So it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or weights were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at 1 nominal atmosphere (101.325&nbsp;kPa \u00b1 variations from changing weather patterns). But as specific gravity usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products), variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent specific gravity is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') specific gravity calculations, air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (''T''<sub>s</sub>/''T''<sub>r</sub>), with ''T''<sub>s</sub> representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T''<sub>r</sub> the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and of the water at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, we note that, while ''SG''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{val|1.000000}} (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C), it is also the case that ''SG''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{frac|{{val|0.998203}}|{{val|0.999840}}}} = {{val|0.998363}} (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C). Here, temperature is being specified using the current [[ITS-90]] scale and the densities<ref>{{cite book|last=Bettin|first=H.|last2=Spieweck|first2=F.|chapter=Die Dichte des Wassers als Funktion der Temperatur nach Einf\u00fchrung des Internationalen Temperaturskala von 1990|title=PTB-Mitteilungen 100|date=1990|pp=195\u2013196}}</ref> used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale.

In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries, sucrose concentration by weight is taken from a table prepared by [[Brix|A. Brix]], which uses SG (17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). As a final example, the British SG units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&nbsp;\u00b0F and are thus (15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C/15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nGiven the specific gravity of a substance, its actual density can be calculated by rearranging the above formula:\n\n:<math>{\\rho_\\text{substance}} = SG \\times \\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}.</math>\n\nOccasionally a reference substance other than water is specified (for example, air), in which case specific gravity means density relative to that reference.\n\n==Temperature dependence==\n:''See [[Density]] for a table of the measured densities of water at various temperatures.''\n\nThe density of substances varies with temperature and pressure so that it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or masses were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at nominally 1 atmosphere (101.325&nbsp;kPa ignoring the variations caused by changing weather patterns) but as relative density usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products) variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent relative density is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') relative density calculations air pressure must be considered (see below).

Relative density is often used by [[Geology|geologists]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] to help determine the [[mineral]] content of a rock or other sample. [[Gemology|Gemologists]] use it as an aid in the identification of [[gemstone]]s. Water is preferred as the reference because measurements are then easy to carry out in the field (see below for examples of measurement methods).\n\nAs the principal use of relative density measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and these are found in tables of RD vs concentration it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of relative density. For example, in the brewing industry, the [[Plato scale|Plato table]], which lists sucrose concentration by mass against true RD, were originally (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>ASBC Methods of Analysis Preface to Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer, American Society of Brewing Chemists, St Paul, 2009</ref> that is based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20&nbsp;\u00b0C) but referenced to the density of water at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density of ''\u03c1''({{chem|H|2|O}}) equal to 0.999972&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (or 62.43&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft<sup>\u22123</sup>). The [[American Society of Brewing Chemists|ASBC]] table<ref>ASBC Methods of Analysis ''op. cit.'' Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer</ref> in use today in North America, while it is derived from the original Plato table is for apparent relative density measurements at (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C) on the IPTS-68 scale where the density of water is 0.9982071&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by mass is taken from this work<ref name=briggs/> which uses SG (17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). As a final example, the British RD units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&nbsp;\u00b0F and are thus (15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C/15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=briggs/>\n\n==Measurement==\nRelative density can be calculated directly by measuring the density of a sample and dividing it by the (known) density of the reference substance. The density of the sample is simply its mass divided by its volume. Although mass is easy to measure, the volume of an irregularly shaped sample can be more difficult to ascertain. One method is to put the sample in a water-filled [[graduated cylinder]] and read off how much water it displaces. Alternatively the container can be filled to the brim, the sample immersed, and the volume of overflow measured. The [[surface tension]] of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small samples. For this reason it is desirable to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.\n\nFor each substance, the density, ''\u03c1'', is given by\n\n:<math>\\rho = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}}\n = \\frac{\\text{Deflection} \\times \\frac{\\text{Spring Constant}}{\\text{Gravity}}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Water Line} \\times \\text{Area}_\\mathrm{Cylinder}}\\,\n</math>\n\nWhen these densities are divided, references to the spring constant, gravity and cross-sectional area simply cancel, leaving\n\n:<math>\nRD=\\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{object}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{ref}}\n= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{Deflection}_\\mathrm{Obj.}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Obj.}}}{\\frac{\\text{Deflection}_\\mathrm{Ref.}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Ref.}}}\n = \\frac{\\frac{3\\ \\mathrm{in}}{20\\ \\mathrm{mm}}}{\\frac{5\\ \\mathrm{in}}{34\\ \\mathrm{mm}}}=\\frac{3\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 34\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{5\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 20\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = 1.02\\,\n</math>\n\n===Hydrostatic weighing===\n{{main article|Hydrostatic weighing}}\nRelative density is more easily and perhaps more accurately measured without measuring volume. Using a spring scale, the sample is weighed first in air and then in water. Relative density (with respect to water) can then be calculated using the following formula:\n\n:<math>\nRD = \\frac{W_\\mathrm{air}}{W_\\mathrm{air} - W_\\mathrm{water}}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n:''W''<sub>air</sub> is the weight of the sample in air (measured in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, [[pound-force|pounds-force]] or some other unit of force)\n:''W''<sub>water</sub> is the weight of the sample in water (measured in the same units).\n\nThis technique cannot easily be used to measure relative densities less than one, because the sample will then float. ''W''<sub>water</sub> becomes a negative quantity, representing the force needed to keep the sample underwater.\n\nAnother practical method uses three measurements. The sample is weighed dry. Then a container filled to the brim with water is weighed, and weighed again with the sample immersed, after the displaced water has overflowed and been removed. Subtracting the last reading from the sum of the first two readings gives the weight of the displaced water. The relative density result is the dry sample weight divided by that of the displaced water. This method works with scales that can't easily accommodate a suspended sample, and also allows for measurement of samples that are less dense than water.\n\n===Hydrometer===\n{{main article|hydrometer}}\n[[File:Hydro.PNG|right|300px]]\nThe relative density of a liquid can be measured using a hydrometer. This consists of a bulb attached to a stalk of constant cross-sectional area, as shown in the adjacent diagram.\n\nFirst the hydrometer is floated in the reference liquid (shown in light blue), and the [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] (the level of the liquid on the stalk) is marked (blue line). The reference could be any liquid, but in practice it is usually water.\n\nThe hydrometer is then floated in a liquid of unknown density (shown in green). The change in displacement, \u0394''x'', is noted. In the example depicted, the hydrometer has dropped slightly in the green liquid; hence its density is lower than that of the reference liquid. It is, of course, necessary that the hydrometer floats in both liquids.\n\nThe application of simple physical principles allows the relative density of the unknown liquid to be calculated from the change in displacement. (In practice the stalk of the hydrometer is pre-marked with graduations to facilitate this measurement.)\n\nIn the explanation that follows,\n\n:'''''\u03c1<sub>ref</sub>''''' is the known density ([[mass]] per unit [[volume]]) of the reference liquid (typically water).\n:'''''\u03c1<sub>new</sub>''' is the unknown density of the new (green) liquid.\n:'''''RD''<sub>new/ref</sub>''' is the relative density of the new liquid with respect to the reference.\n:'''''V''''' is the volume of reference liquid displaced, i.e. the red volume in the diagram.\n:'''''m''''' is the mass of the entire hydrometer.\n:'''''g''''' is the [[Earth's gravity|local gravitational constant]].\n:'''''\u0394x''''' is the change in displacement. In accordance with the way in which hydrometers are usually graduated, \u0394''x'' is here taken to be negative if the displacement line rises on the stalk of the hydrometer, and positive if it falls. In the example depicted, \u0394''x'' is negative.\n:'''''A''''' is the cross sectional area of the shaft.\n\nSince the floating hydrometer is in [[static equilibrium]], the downward gravitational force acting upon it must exactly balance the upward buoyancy force. The gravitational force acting on the hydrometer is simply its weight, ''mg''. From the [[Archimedes]] [[buoyancy]] principle, the buoyancy force acting on the hydrometer is equal to the weight of liquid displaced. This weight is equal to the mass of liquid displaced multiplied by ''g'', which in the case of the reference liquid is ''\u03c1<sub>ref</sub>Vg''. Setting these equal, we have\n\n:<math>mg = \\rho_\\mathrm{ref}Vg\\,</math>\n\nor just\n\n<!-- these nasty tables are the only way I can find to get the equation number to align properly. Something like <div align=\"right\">(2)</div> doesn't work properly. -->\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>m = \\rho_\\mathrm{ref} V\\,</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(1)\n|}\n\nExactly the same equation applies when the hydrometer is floating in the liquid being measured, except that the new volume is ''V''&nbsp;-&nbsp;''A''\u0394''x'' (see note above about the sign of \u0394''x'').

A pycnometer is usually made of [[glass]], with a close-fitting [[ground glass joint|ground glass]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] with a [[capillary tube]] through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus.  This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as [[water]] or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], using an [[analytical balance]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIf the flask is weighed empty, full of water, and full of a liquid whose relative density is desired, the relative density of the liquid can easily be calculated. The [[particle density (packed density)|particle density]] of a powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied, can also be determined with a pycnometer. The powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample.  The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble.  The weight of the displaced liquid can then be determined, and hence the relative density of the powder.\n\nA [[gas pycnometer]], the gas-based manifestation of a pycnometer, compares the change in pressure caused by a measured change in a closed volume containing a reference (usually a steel sphere of known volume) with the change in pressure caused by the sample under the same conditions.  The difference in change of pressure represents the volume of the sample as compared to the reference sphere, and is usually used for solid particulates that may dissolve in the liquid medium of the pycnometer design described above, or for porous materials into which the liquid would not fully penetrate.\n\nWhen a pycnometer is filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, ''V'' and is placed upon a balance, it will exert a force\n\n:<math> F_b = g(m_b - \\rho_a{m_b\\over \\rho_b}) </math>\n\nwhere ''m<sub>b</sub>'' is the mass of the bottle and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]] at the location at which the measurements are being made. ''\u03c1''<sub>a</sub> is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and ''\u03c1''<sub>b</sub> is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by [[Archimedes' principle#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes Principle]] must be subtracted. The bottle is, of course, filled with air but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:\n\n:<math> F_w = g(m_b - \\rho_a{m_b\\over \\rho_b} + V\\rho_w - V\\rho_a). </math>\n\nIf we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.\n\n:<math>F_{w,n} = gV( \\rho_w - \\rho_a) </math>\n\nwhere the subscript n indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:\n\n:<math>F_{s,n} = gV(\\rho_s - \\rho_a) </math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1''<sub>s</sub> is the density of the sample. The ratio of the sample and water forces is:\n\n:<math>SG_A = {gV(\\rho_s - \\rho_a) \\over gV( \\rho_w - \\rho_a)} = {( \\rho_s - \\rho_a) \\over ( \\rho_w - \\rho_a)}. </math>\n\nThis is called the Apparent Relative Density, denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a [[hydrometer]] (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does ''RD<sub>A</sub>'' depend on the actual volume of the pycnometer.\n\nFurther manipulation and finally substitution of ''RD<sub>V</sub>'', the true relative density (the subscript V is used because this is often referred to as the relative density ''in vacuo''), for ''\u03c1''<sub>s</sub>/''\u03c1''<sub>w</sub> gives the relationship between apparent and true relative density.\n\n:<math>RD_A= {{\\rho_s \\over \\rho_w}-{\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w} \\over 1 - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w}} ={RD_V-{\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w} \\over 1 - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w}}</math>\n\nIn the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true relative density. This is found from\n\n:<math>RD_V = RD_A - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w }(RD_A-1)</math>\n\nSince the density of dry air at 101.325&nbsp;kPa at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C is<ref>DIN51 757 (04.1994): Testing of mineral oils and related materials; determination of density</ref> 0.001205 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and that of water is 0.998203 g/cm<sup>3</sup> we see that the difference between true and apparent relative densities for a substance with relative density (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the relative density of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.\n\nThe pycnometer is used in ISO standard: ISO 1183-1:2004, ISO 1014\u20131985 and [[ASTM International|ASTM]] standard: ASTM D854.\n\n'''Types'''\n\n* [[Gay-Lussac]], pear shaped, with perforated stopper, adjusted, capacity 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mL\n* as above, with ground-in [[thermometer]], adjusted, side tube with cap\n* Hubbard, for [[bitumen]] and [[heavy crude oil]]s, cylindrical type, [[ASTM]] D 70, 24 mL\n* as above, conical type, ASTM D 115 and D 234, 25 mL\n* Boot, with vacuum jacket and thermometer, capacity 5, 10, 25 and 50 mL\n\n===Digital density meters===\n''Hydrostatic Pressure-based Instruments'': This technology relies upon Pascal's Principle which states that the pressure difference between two points within a vertical column of fluid is dependent upon the vertical distance between the two points, the density of the fluid and the gravitational force. This technology is often used for tank gaging applications as a convenient means of liquid level and density measure.\n\n''Vibrating Element Transducers'': This type of instrument requires a vibrating element to be placed in contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using [[oscillating U-tube]] meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/coriolis-flowmeter |via= sciencedirect.com | title=MPD with Flow Measurement as the Primary Control| first= Erdem |last= Catak| work= Managed Pressure Drilling| year= 2008  |access-date= July 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Ultrasonic Transducer'': Ultrasonic waves are passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a detector which measures the acoustic spectroscopy of the waves. Fluid properties such as density and viscosity can be inferred from the spectrum.\n\n''Radiation-based Gauge'': Radiation is passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a scintillation detector, or counter. As the fluid density increases, the detected radiation \"counts\" will decrease. The source is typically the radioactive isotope [[cesium-137]], with a half-life of about 30 years. A key advantage for this technology is that the instrument is not required to be in contact with the fluid\u2014typically the source and detector are mounted on the outside of tanks or piping.<ref>[http://www.ohmartvega.com/en/nuclear_density_DSG.htm Density \u2013 VEGA Americas, Inc]. Ohmartvega.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-30.</ref>\n\n''Buoyant Force Transducer'': the buoyancy force produced by a float in a homogeneous liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced by the float. Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring relative density with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.005 RD units. The submersible probe head contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors. The output signals of the sensors are mixed in a dedicated electronics module that provides a single output voltage whose magnitude is a direct linear measure of the quantity to be measured.<ref>[http://www.gardco.com/pages/density/electric_hydrometer.cfm Process Control Digital Electronic Hydrometer].

It was just after the end of WW2 and rationing had caused a flourishing black market in USA made cloth. People used to try and pass off inferior cloth as American-made when in fact it was not: so it was called \"bodgie\". The first bodgie gang was the \u2018Woolloomooloo Yanks\u2019 who congregated in Cathedral Street Woolloomooloo. By 1948 about 200 bodgies were regularly frequenting Kings Cross milk bars. Soon, bodgie gangs formed at other inner-Sydney locations. After a time, moccasins and American drape suits complete with pegged trousers replaced their attire of blue jeans and leather American Airline jackets or zoot suits.\n\nThe mid 1960s saw the arrival of the \"sharpie\" culture - The sharpie gangs were particularly prominent in Melbourne, but were also found in Sydney and Perth to lesser extents. The focus was again on fashion with the guys wearing tight fitting jeans from Lee, Levi, Westco & Eastcoast brands - and some wearing bib and brace denim overalls. The sharpie cardigan or \"connie\" was an essential and expensive piece of knitwear with many sharps spending up to two weeks wages on a particular design. Shoes were also a key component of the look with sharps wearing leather platform shoes or others with Cuban heels sourced from local shoe manufacturers. The sharpie gangs were highly territorial and wild brawls were common place at dance halls or disco's when two different gangs happened to both attend. The sharpie culture went through three distinct waves of popularity from the mid 1960s through to around 1980. The sharpies were huge fans of local Aussie rock music and listened to bands such as Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs, Lobby Loyde's Coloured Balls, Buster Brown and of course AC/DC. The movement essentially died out as many sharps had grown up and were tired of the constant fighting with other gangs and being targeted by law enforcement - many more had drifted off to become immersed in newer and less violent influences such as punk, ska, rocksteady & reggae.\n\nThe early 1980s saw the rise of various ethnically based gangs in Sydney & Melbourne - the surge of migrants fleeing wars in the Middle East saw young males from these countries forming various street gangs including (in Melbourne), the Black Dragons, the Lebanese Tigers and the Turkish Lions.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Melbourne youth gangs included: \n3174, based around Noble Park and Springvale; Keyzy/Burra boys, based in Keysborough; LSC (Lake Side Crew), Euro Boyz based in St. Albans through to Taylors Lakes; 14K, based in Footscray; BST, based in Sunshine, Deerpark & Werribee; MC3, based in Dandenong South; Oakleigh Wogs, based in Oakleigh; Springy Nips, based in Springvale; RT Criminals, based in Camberwell and Ashburton; WTP, based in Glen Iris and East Malvern; HTL, based in Kew, Hawthorn and Shepparton;\n{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nPrevious gangs in Melbourne include Brothers for Life (B4L), Sunshine Boys, Young St Albans and Kings Park (YSNK), Yellow Klique (YK) the Springvale-based Springvale Boys (SB). More current gangs include Straight Sunshine (SSS), Liberty Loyalty Life Knowledge (3LK), Young Thirty Twenty (YTT), Kings Park St Albans (KPS) and Richmond based gang Hard 2 Kill (H2K).

Increased involvement has resulted in larger and more sophisticated clandestine laboratories being detected in Australia. In 2008\u201309, a record 449 clandestine laboratories were detected in Australia (a 26 per cent increase from 2007\u201308). \n67.7 per cent of clandestine laboratories continue to be detected in residential locations. Over two tonnes of precursor chemicals for the production of meth/amphetamines were detected at the Australian border in 2008\u201309, nearly double the weight detected in 2007\u201308. In 2008\u201309, clandestine laboratory detections increased across most jurisdictions,  the largest occurring in Western Australia, which increased from 30 laboratories in 2007\u201308 to 78 in 2008\u201309, an increase of 160 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clandestine Laboratories and Precursors |url=http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/iddr/_files/2008_09/ACC%20CLANLAB.pdf|publisher=ACC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Clandestine drug laboratories in Australia |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/cfi/141-160/cfi160.aspx|publisher=AIC}}</ref> In the context of the Australian Illicit Drug Report, a clandestine laboratory is any concealed place where chemicals are used to produce illicit drugs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clandestine laboratories|url=http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/iddr/_files/1997_98/aidr_1997_98_clan_laboratories.pdf|publisher=ACC}}</ref>  Such laboratories range from crude, makeshift operations using simple processes to highly sophisticated operations using technically advanced facilities. They can be located virtually anywhere\u2014in private residences, motel and hotel rooms, apartments, horse trailers, houseboats, boats, vehicles, buses, trucks, campgrounds and commercial establishments\u2014and are usually very portable. Some clandestine laboratories use very simple processes such as extracting [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] oil from plants using solvents; others use complex processes involving a number of chemicals and a range of equipment to manufacture drugs such as methylamphetamine and ecstasy. Clan labs are usually discovered after they have exploded.\n\nMainly clan labs manufacture methylamphetamine but other drugs produced in Australia and reported on in connection with clandestine laboratories are ecstasy, methcathinone, cannabis oil, \u2018crack\u2019 cocaine, pethidine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB, or fantasy). Because of the increase in the number of clandestine laboratories detected in Australia, it was determined that there was a need for better exchange of information between the various jurisdictions. As a result, in August 1997 the first Chemical Diversion Conference was held at the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence; among other things, a categorisation of the various types of clandestine laboratories was developed. Initially there were three categories but a fourth has since been added. The categories are as follows:\n* Category A\u2014active (chemicals and equipment in use);\n* Category B\u2014stored/used (equipment or chemicals);\n* Category C\u2014stored/unused (equipment or chemicals);\n* Category D\u2014used site/evidence or admissions of a prior laboratory (ABCI 1998).\n\nClan lab activity may include but are not limited to strong unusual odours, traffic at extremely late hours, covered windows and reinforced doors, exhaust fans and pipes on windows, high security measures such as bars on windows and an accumulation of chemical containers and waste. On 13 April 2011 the Minister for Home Affairs and Justice launched the Clandestine Drug Laboratory Remediation Guidelines. These Guidelines provide a framework for regulatory authorities and environmental specialists to investigate and remediate sites that may have been contaminated due to being used as clandestine drug laboratories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clandestine Drug Laboratory Remediation Guidelines|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/(9A5D88DBA63D32A661E6369859739356)~2109+Remediation+Guidelines_WEB.PDF/$file/2109+Remediation+Guidelines_WEB.PDF|publisher=Attorney-General|access-date=9 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000726/https://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/(9A5D88DBA63D32A661E6369859739356)~2109+Remediation+Guidelines_WEB.PDF/$file/2109+Remediation+Guidelines_WEB.PDF|archive-date=4 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Clan labs produce substances that are toxic, corrosive, explosive and carcinogenic.

Of the clan labs discovered in 2010, 26 were in the cities of Armadale and Gosnells and the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale. In Western Australia, Gosnells has proved to be the hotspot for drug manufacture, with six clan labs uncovered by police. Five labs were shut down in Armadale. Almost all drug labs were found to manufacture methlyamphetamine. The suburbs of Kelmscott, Huntingdale, Bedfordale and Southern River harboured two clan labs each until these were uncovered and shut down by officers.\nClan labs have also been detected in Camillo, Maddington, Thornlie, Mundijong, Byford, Brookdale and Karrakup.\n\n====[[Heroin]]====\n* Source countries / production: \"three major regions known as the golden triangle (Burma, Laos, Thailand), golden crescent (Afghanistan) and Central and South America.

Division 400 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code) contains the principal criminal offences of money laundering in Australia. Division 400 was inserted into the Criminal Code by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in January 2003. There are currently 19 different offences of money laundering available under the Criminal Code, and these can be classified into two types: those linked to the proceeds of crime (funds generated by an illegal activity) and those linked to the instruments of crime (funds used to conduct an illegal activity). Possessing the proceeds or instruments of crime is a single offence under the Criminal Code. Persons receiving, possessing, concealing, importing into Australia, exporting from Australia, or disposing of the proceeds of crime may be guilty of this offence. Possessing the proceeds of crime attracts a maximum custodial sentence of two years. The remaining 18 offences of money laundering are those of dealing with the proceeds or instruments of crime. 'Dealing with' the proceeds of crime includes all the actions considered as possession of the proceeds of crime as well as engaging in banking transactions using the illicit funds. These 18 offences are distinguished by the value of the property involved and the intent of the offender. The punishments' severity increases with the value and with the offender's knowledge of the source of the funds. The Criminal Code classifies offences according to the value of the funds involved into bands of $1,000,000 or more; $100,000 to $999,999; $50,000 to $99,999; $10,000 to $49,999; $1,000 to $9,999; and funds of any value.\n\n* [[Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] - [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005A00127/Html/Text#_Toc1204511582239 Schedule 1\u2014Amendments to terrorism offences]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/mtcsaoca2001436/index.html  Measures to Combat Serious and Organised Crime Act 2001]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ncaa1984270/ National Crime Authority Act 1984] now [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/accea2002423/index.html Australian Crime Commission Establishment Act 2002]\n* [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2009B00131 Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/asioa1979472/ Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO Act)]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taaa1979410/ Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/isa2001216/ Intelligence Services Act 2001]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ioiasa1986436/ Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986]\n* [http://www.federationpress.com.au/pdf/SA%20v%20Totani.pdf South Australia v Totani (2010) HCA 39]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706111129/http://www.projectstop.com.au/ Project Stop]\n* [http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/oca/_files/2011/oca2011.pdf Organised Crime in Australia Report, ACC 2011]\n* [http://www.pfa.org.au/files/uploads/Submission.pdf Inquiry into the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009 (PFA, 2009)]\n* [http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/media/speeches/_files/2009/090728_michael_outram.pdf A Collaborative Approach to Fighting Serious Organised Crime in Australia, 2009]\n* [http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/other/_files/submissions/2007_pjc_submission_impact_of_serious%20_organised_crime.pdf Submission to Parliamentary Joint Committee, Inquiry into The future impact of serious and organised crime on Australian society, ACC 2007]\n\n===State===\n\n====South Australia====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/num_act/saa200346o2003436/index.html Statutes Amendment (Anti-Fortification) Act 2003]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/num_act/sagasia200522o2005663/ Statutes Amendment (Liquor, Gambling and Security Industries) Act 2005]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/num_act/satba200848o2008387/index.html Statutes Amendment (Power to Bar) Act 2008]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/saoca2008352/index.html Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/ Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935]\n\n====New South Wales====\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114131744/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/coca2009391/index.html Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2009]\n* [http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/2009-99.pdf Crimes Amendment (Fraud, Identity and Forgery Offences) Act 2009 (NSW)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110607104453/http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/about_us/structure/specialist_operations/state_crime_command NSW Police]: Asian Crime Squad; Drug Squad; Firearms & Organised Crime Squad; Gangs Squad; Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad; Organised Crime (Targeting) Squad\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/ Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)]\nSection 24A states that: (1) A person who has possession of: (a) a precursor, or (b) a drug manufacture apparatus, intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence. A common example of this offence includes being in possession of the chemicals and ingredients required to manufacture a drug.\n\nOffences including possession of precursors and certain apparatus for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs fall under Part 2, Division 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). This means that these offences are considered indictable offences, and are heard in the District or Supreme Court. Defences to this offence include but are not limited to duress and necessity. Also, those licensed or authorised under the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/patga1966307/ Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966] or somebody given authority by the Director General of the Department of Health are exempt from liability. Section 35A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) outlines a further defence: it is legal to possess or manufacture a prohibited substance if the substance is contained in a product where the substance cannot be readily extracted, or in a product not for human consumption, or if the substance is possessed for the purpose of its disposal as waste or its destruction. The maximum penalty for this offence is a fine of $220,000, 10 years imprisonment or both.\n\n====Western Australia====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/ccaca1913252/ Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/moda1981184/ Misuse of Drugs Act 1981]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928105422/http://www.austlii.org/au/legis/wa/consol_act/fa1973102/ Firearms Act 1973]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114132149/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/cacca2003338/index.html Corruption and Crime Commission Act 2003]\n* [http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3812458a842f0b0bd82b51c14825779a000b8a7c/$file/2458+-+jscccc+-+how+the+corruption+and+crime+commission+can+.pdf Proposed Anti-Association Laws and other Measures]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/bill/ccacb2009346/ Criminal Code Amendment (Identity Crime) Bill 2009]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_reg/pbo82r2011374/ Prohibited Behaviour Orders Regulations 2011]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110301170256/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol%5fact/twaa1996540/ Telecommunications (Interception) Western Australia Act 1996]\n* Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kamal [2011] WASCA 55\n* R v Quaid [2009] WASC 202\n* Nguyen v State of Western Australia [2009] WASCA 81\n* [WA Police]: Serious and Organised Crime Division which includes the Gang Crime Squad; Drug and Firearm Squad; Financial Crime Squad and Proceeds of Crime Squad\n\n====Queensland====\n* [http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf Criminal Code Act 1899]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cpca2002285/index.html Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/index.html Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000]\n* [[Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act 2013]]\n* [[Tattoo Parlours Act 2013]]\n* [[Criminal Law (Criminal Organisations Disruption) Amendment Act 2013]]\n\n====Victoria====\nCriminal Organisations Control Act 2012 (Vic)\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cia2004261/index.html Crimes (Assumed Identities) Act 2004]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/coa2004312/index.html Crimes (Controlled Operations) Act 2004]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/eipa200460o2004451/index.html Evidence (Witness Identity Protection) Act 2004]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/mcpa2004355/index.html Major Crimes (Investigative Powers) Act 2004]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/sda200426o2004336/index.html Surveillance Devices (Amendment) Act 2004]\n* Mokbel v R [2011] VSCA 106\n* Major Crime (Investigative Powers) Act 2004 (No 9), Re [2007] VSC 128\n* Poynder v Kent; Sodomacco v O'Bryan [2008] VSCA 245\n\n====Tasmania====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/num_act/poaa200739o2007266/index.html Police Offences Amendment Act 2007]\n\n====Northern Territory====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/num_act/jlacaa200636o2006589/index.html Justice Legislation (Group Criminal Activities) Act 2006]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/num_act/scca200932o2009299/index.html Serious Crime Control Act 2009]\n\n====Australian Capital Territory====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/coa2008312/index.html Crimes (Controlled Operations) Act 2008]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114134605/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/cia2009261/index.html Crimes (Assumed Identities) Act 2009]\n\n===International and other jurisdictions===\n'''[[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]]''' (the 'Palermo Convention') including the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] and [[Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air]] - 2000 (UN)\n* Article 5 \u2013 Criminalization of participation in an organized criminal group.\n* 6 \u2013 Criminalization of the laundering of proceeds of crime;\n* 8 \u2013 Criminalization of corruption;\n* 23 \u2013 Criminalization of obstruction of justice;\n* 3 and 5 of the Protocol on Trafficking in Persons; and,\n* 3, 5 and 6 of the Protocol Against Smuggling of Migrants\n\n[[Organized Crime Control Act]] - 1970 (US)\n\n[[Title 21 of the United States Code]] - 1970 (US) Ch. 12 Sub.

It was just after the end of WW2 and rationing had caused a flourishing black market in USA made cloth. People used to try and pass off inferior cloth as American-made when in fact it was not: so it was called \"bodgie\". The first bodgie gang was the \u2018Woolloomooloo Yanks\u2019 who congregated in Cathedral Street Woolloomooloo. By 1948 about 200 bodgies were regularly frequenting Kings Cross milk bars. Soon, bodgie gangs formed at other inner-Sydney locations. After a time, moccasins and American drape suits complete with pegged trousers replaced their attire of blue jeans and leather American Airline jackets or zoot suits.\n\nThe mid 1960s saw the arrival of the \"sharpie\" culture - The sharpie gangs were particularly prominent in Melbourne, but were also found in Sydney and Perth to lesser extents. The focus was again on fashion with the guys wearing tight fitting jeans from Lee, Levi, Westco & Eastcoast brands - and some wearing bib and brace denim overalls. The sharpie cardigan or \"connie\" was an essential and expensive piece of knitwear with many sharps spending up to two weeks wages on a particular design. Shoes were also a key component of the look with sharps wearing leather platform shoes or others with Cuban heels sourced from local shoe manufacturers. The sharpie gangs were highly territorial and wild brawls were common place at dance halls or disco's when two different gangs happened to both attend. The sharpie culture went through three distinct waves of popularity from the mid 1960s through to around 1980. The sharpies were huge fans of local Aussie rock music and listened to bands such as Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs, Lobby Loyde's Coloured Balls, Buster Brown and of course AC/DC. The movement essentially died out as many sharps had grown up and were tired of the constant fighting with other gangs and being targeted by law enforcement - many more had drifted off to become immersed in newer and less violent influences such as punk, ska, rocksteady & reggae.\n\nThe early 1980s saw the rise of various ethnically based gangs in Sydney & Melbourne - the surge of migrants fleeing wars in the Middle East saw young males from these countries forming various street gangs including (in Melbourne), the Black Dragons, the Lebanese Tigers and the Turkish Lions.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Melbourne youth gangs included: \n3174, based around Noble Park and Springvale; Keyzy/Burra boys, based in Keysborough; LSC (Lake Side Crew), Euro Boyz based in St. Albans through to Taylors Lakes; 14K, based in Footscray; BST, based in Sunshine, Deerpark & Werribee; MC3, based in Dandenong South; Oakleigh Wogs, based in Oakleigh; Springy Nips, based in Springvale; RT Criminals, based in Camberwell and Ashburton; WTP, based in Glen Iris and East Malvern; HTL, based in Kew, Hawthorn and Shepparton;\n{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nPrevious gangs in Melbourne include Brothers for Life (B4L), Sunshine Boys, Young St Albans and Kings Park (YSNK), Yellow Klique (YK) the Springvale-based Springvale Boys (SB). More current gangs include Straight Sunshine (SSS), Liberty Loyalty Life Knowledge (3LK), Young Thirty Twenty (YTT), Kings Park St Albans (KPS) and Richmond based gang Hard 2 Kill (H2K).

Increased involvement has resulted in larger and more sophisticated clandestine laboratories being detected in Australia. In 2008\u201309, a record 449 clandestine laboratories were detected in Australia (a 26 per cent increase from 2007\u201308). \n67.7 per cent of clandestine laboratories continue to be detected in residential locations. Over two tonnes of precursor chemicals for the production of meth/amphetamines were detected at the Australian border in 2008\u201309, nearly double the weight detected in 2007\u201308. In 2008\u201309, clandestine laboratory detections increased across most jurisdictions,  the largest occurring in Western Australia, which increased from 30 laboratories in 2007\u201308 to 78 in 2008\u201309, an increase of 160 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clandestine Laboratories and Precursors |url=http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/iddr/_files/2008_09/ACC%20CLANLAB.pdf|publisher=ACC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Clandestine drug laboratories in Australia |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/cfi/141-160/cfi160.aspx|publisher=AIC}}</ref> In the context of the Australian Illicit Drug Report, a clandestine laboratory is any concealed place where chemicals are used to produce illicit drugs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clandestine laboratories|url=http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/iddr/_files/1997_98/aidr_1997_98_clan_laboratories.pdf|publisher=ACC}}</ref>  Such laboratories range from crude, makeshift operations using simple processes to highly sophisticated operations using technically advanced facilities. They can be located virtually anywhere\u2014in private residences, motel and hotel rooms, apartments, horse trailers, houseboats, boats, vehicles, buses, trucks, campgrounds and commercial establishments\u2014and are usually very portable. Some clandestine laboratories use very simple processes such as extracting [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] oil from plants using solvents; others use complex processes involving a number of chemicals and a range of equipment to manufacture drugs such as methylamphetamine and ecstasy. Clan labs are usually discovered after they have exploded.\n\nMainly clan labs manufacture methylamphetamine but other drugs produced in Australia and reported on in connection with clandestine laboratories are ecstasy, methcathinone, cannabis oil, \u2018crack\u2019 cocaine, pethidine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB, or fantasy). Because of the increase in the number of clandestine laboratories detected in Australia, it was determined that there was a need for better exchange of information between the various jurisdictions. As a result, in August 1997 the first Chemical Diversion Conference was held at the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence; among other things, a categorisation of the various types of clandestine laboratories was developed. Initially there were three categories but a fourth has since been added. The categories are as follows:\n* Category A\u2014active (chemicals and equipment in use);\n* Category B\u2014stored/used (equipment or chemicals);\n* Category C\u2014stored/unused (equipment or chemicals);\n* Category D\u2014used site/evidence or admissions of a prior laboratory (ABCI 1998).\n\nClan lab activity may include but are not limited to strong unusual odours, traffic at extremely late hours, covered windows and reinforced doors, exhaust fans and pipes on windows, high security measures such as bars on windows and an accumulation of chemical containers and waste. On 13 April 2011 the Minister for Home Affairs and Justice launched the Clandestine Drug Laboratory Remediation Guidelines. These Guidelines provide a framework for regulatory authorities and environmental specialists to investigate and remediate sites that may have been contaminated due to being used as clandestine drug laboratories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clandestine Drug Laboratory Remediation Guidelines|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/(9A5D88DBA63D32A661E6369859739356)~2109+Remediation+Guidelines_WEB.PDF/$file/2109+Remediation+Guidelines_WEB.PDF|publisher=Attorney-General|access-date=9 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000726/https://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/(9A5D88DBA63D32A661E6369859739356)~2109+Remediation+Guidelines_WEB.PDF/$file/2109+Remediation+Guidelines_WEB.PDF|archive-date=4 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Clan labs produce substances that are toxic, corrosive, explosive and carcinogenic.

Of the clan labs discovered in 2010, 26 were in the cities of Armadale and Gosnells and the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale. In Western Australia, Gosnells has proved to be the hotspot for drug manufacture, with six clan labs uncovered by police. Five labs were shut down in Armadale. Almost all drug labs were found to manufacture methlyamphetamine. The suburbs of Kelmscott, Huntingdale, Bedfordale and Southern River harboured two clan labs each until these were uncovered and shut down by officers.\nClan labs have also been detected in Camillo, Maddington, Thornlie, Mundijong, Byford, Brookdale and Karrakup.\n\n====[[Heroin]]====\n* Source countries / production: \"three major regions known as the golden triangle (Burma, Laos, Thailand), golden crescent (Afghanistan) and Central and South America.

Division 400 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code) contains the principal criminal offences of money laundering in Australia. Division 400 was inserted into the Criminal Code by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in January 2003. There are currently 19 different offences of money laundering available under the Criminal Code, and these can be classified into two types: those linked to the proceeds of crime (funds generated by an illegal activity) and those linked to the instruments of crime (funds used to conduct an illegal activity). Possessing the proceeds or instruments of crime is a single offence under the Criminal Code. Persons receiving, possessing, concealing, importing into Australia, exporting from Australia, or disposing of the proceeds of crime may be guilty of this offence. Possessing the proceeds of crime attracts a maximum custodial sentence of two years. The remaining 18 offences of money laundering are those of dealing with the proceeds or instruments of crime. 'Dealing with' the proceeds of crime includes all the actions considered as possession of the proceeds of crime as well as engaging in banking transactions using the illicit funds. These 18 offences are distinguished by the value of the property involved and the intent of the offender. The punishments' severity increases with the value and with the offender's knowledge of the source of the funds. The Criminal Code classifies offences according to the value of the funds involved into bands of $1,000,000 or more; $100,000 to $999,999; $50,000 to $99,999; $10,000 to $49,999; $1,000 to $9,999; and funds of any value.\n\n* [[Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] - [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005A00127/Html/Text#_Toc1204511582239 Schedule 1\u2014Amendments to terrorism offences]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/mtcsaoca2001436/index.html  Measures to Combat Serious and Organised Crime Act 2001]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ncaa1984270/ National Crime Authority Act 1984] now [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/accea2002423/index.html Australian Crime Commission Establishment Act 2002]\n* [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2009B00131 Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/asioa1979472/ Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO Act)]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taaa1979410/ Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/isa2001216/ Intelligence Services Act 2001]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ioiasa1986436/ Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986]\n* [http://www.federationpress.com.au/pdf/SA%20v%20Totani.pdf South Australia v Totani (2010) HCA 39]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706111129/http://www.projectstop.com.au/ Project Stop]\n* [http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/oca/_files/2011/oca2011.pdf Organised Crime in Australia Report, ACC 2011]\n* [http://www.pfa.org.au/files/uploads/Submission.pdf Inquiry into the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009 (PFA, 2009)]\n* [http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/media/speeches/_files/2009/090728_michael_outram.pdf A Collaborative Approach to Fighting Serious Organised Crime in Australia, 2009]\n* [http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/other/_files/submissions/2007_pjc_submission_impact_of_serious%20_organised_crime.pdf Submission to Parliamentary Joint Committee, Inquiry into The future impact of serious and organised crime on Australian society, ACC 2007]\n\n===State===\n\n====South Australia====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/num_act/saa200346o2003436/index.html Statutes Amendment (Anti-Fortification) Act 2003]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/num_act/sagasia200522o2005663/ Statutes Amendment (Liquor, Gambling and Security Industries) Act 2005]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/num_act/satba200848o2008387/index.html Statutes Amendment (Power to Bar) Act 2008]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/saoca2008352/index.html Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/ Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935]\n\n====New South Wales====\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114131744/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/coca2009391/index.html Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2009]\n* [http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/2009-99.pdf Crimes Amendment (Fraud, Identity and Forgery Offences) Act 2009 (NSW)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110607104453/http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/about_us/structure/specialist_operations/state_crime_command NSW Police]: Asian Crime Squad; Drug Squad; Firearms & Organised Crime Squad; Gangs Squad; Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad; Organised Crime (Targeting) Squad\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/ Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)]\nSection 24A states that: (1) A person who has possession of: (a) a precursor, or (b) a drug manufacture apparatus, intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence. A common example of this offence includes being in possession of the chemicals and ingredients required to manufacture a drug.\n\nOffences including possession of precursors and certain apparatus for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs fall under Part 2, Division 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). This means that these offences are considered indictable offences, and are heard in the District or Supreme Court. Defences to this offence include but are not limited to duress and necessity. Also, those licensed or authorised under the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/patga1966307/ Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966] or somebody given authority by the Director General of the Department of Health are exempt from liability. Section 35A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) outlines a further defence: it is legal to possess or manufacture a prohibited substance if the substance is contained in a product where the substance cannot be readily extracted, or in a product not for human consumption, or if the substance is possessed for the purpose of its disposal as waste or its destruction. The maximum penalty for this offence is a fine of $220,000, 10 years imprisonment or both.\n\n====Western Australia====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/ccaca1913252/ Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/moda1981184/ Misuse of Drugs Act 1981]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928105422/http://www.austlii.org/au/legis/wa/consol_act/fa1973102/ Firearms Act 1973]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114132149/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/cacca2003338/index.html Corruption and Crime Commission Act 2003]\n* [http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3812458a842f0b0bd82b51c14825779a000b8a7c/$file/2458+-+jscccc+-+how+the+corruption+and+crime+commission+can+.pdf Proposed Anti-Association Laws and other Measures]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/bill/ccacb2009346/ Criminal Code Amendment (Identity Crime) Bill 2009]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_reg/pbo82r2011374/ Prohibited Behaviour Orders Regulations 2011]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110301170256/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol%5fact/twaa1996540/ Telecommunications (Interception) Western Australia Act 1996]\n* Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kamal [2011] WASCA 55\n* R v Quaid [2009] WASC 202\n* Nguyen v State of Western Australia [2009] WASCA 81\n* [WA Police]: Serious and Organised Crime Division which includes the Gang Crime Squad; Drug and Firearm Squad; Financial Crime Squad and Proceeds of Crime Squad\n\n====Queensland====\n* [http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf Criminal Code Act 1899]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cpca2002285/index.html Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/index.html Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000]\n* [[Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act 2013]]\n* [[Tattoo Parlours Act 2013]]\n* [[Criminal Law (Criminal Organisations Disruption) Amendment Act 2013]]\n\n====Victoria====\nCriminal Organisations Control Act 2012 (Vic)\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cia2004261/index.html Crimes (Assumed Identities) Act 2004]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/coa2004312/index.html Crimes (Controlled Operations) Act 2004]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/eipa200460o2004451/index.html Evidence (Witness Identity Protection) Act 2004]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/mcpa2004355/index.html Major Crimes (Investigative Powers) Act 2004]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/sda200426o2004336/index.html Surveillance Devices (Amendment) Act 2004]\n* Mokbel v R [2011] VSCA 106\n* Major Crime (Investigative Powers) Act 2004 (No 9), Re [2007] VSC 128\n* Poynder v Kent; Sodomacco v O'Bryan [2008] VSCA 245\n\n====Tasmania====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/num_act/poaa200739o2007266/index.html Police Offences Amendment Act 2007]\n\n====Northern Territory====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/num_act/jlacaa200636o2006589/index.html Justice Legislation (Group Criminal Activities) Act 2006]\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/num_act/scca200932o2009299/index.html Serious Crime Control Act 2009]\n\n====Australian Capital Territory====\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/coa2008312/index.html Crimes (Controlled Operations) Act 2008]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114134605/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/cia2009261/index.html Crimes (Assumed Identities) Act 2009]\n\n===International and other jurisdictions===\n'''[[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]]''' (the 'Palermo Convention') including the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] and [[Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air]] - 2000 (UN)\n* Article 5 \u2013 Criminalization of participation in an organized criminal group.\n* 6 \u2013 Criminalization of the laundering of proceeds of crime;\n* 8 \u2013 Criminalization of corruption;\n* 23 \u2013 Criminalization of obstruction of justice;\n* 3 and 5 of the Protocol on Trafficking in Persons; and,\n* 3, 5 and 6 of the Protocol Against Smuggling of Migrants\n\n[[Organized Crime Control Act]] - 1970 (US)\n\n[[Title 21 of the United States Code]] - 1970 (US) Ch. 12 Sub.
