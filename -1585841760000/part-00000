The Association Montessori Internationale is headquartered in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands.

AMS insisted that all teacher educators have a college degree so that the coursework could, potentially, be recognized by state education departments. AMS also broadened the curriculum for teachers and sought to connect with mainstream education by offering Montessori coursework in traditional teacher preparation programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.holisticmontessorisolutions.com/montessori-teachers/qualifications-need-become-montessori-teacher/|title=What are the Qualifications I Need to Become a Montessori Teacher?|date=2017-05-19|website=Holistic Montessori Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nNancy Rambusch believed there was a need for cultural accommodation. Professor John J. McDermott, a colleague and friend, agreed, arguing that the popular idea of the universality of children displayed a basic naivet\u00e9 about the interrelationships between a culture and the child\u2019s development of consciousness. McDermott also stressed the need to move Montessori into the public sector so that it would be available to all children, regardless of their circumstances\u2014a conviction that remains a vital underpinning of the organization, along with a belief in the need for adaptability.\n\n=== Archives ===\nThe American Montessori Society Archives are housed at the [http://www.lib.uconn.edu/online/research/speclib/ASC/ Thomas J.

The only 44-minute episode of the series, it was directed by Joe Johnston, Kat Morris and Liz Artinian, and written and storyboarded by Johnston, Morris, Lamar Abrams, Miki Brewster, Danny Cragg, Hilary Florido, [[Ian Jones-Quartey]], Christine Liu, Jeff Liu, Katie Mitroff, Paul Villeco, and series creator and executive producer [[Rebecca Sugar]].\n\nThe conclusion of the original storyline conceived by Sugar when developing ''Steven Universe'', the episode serves as the culmination of the ongoing story arcs developed during the show's first five seasons, most notably the Crystal Gems' conflict with the Gem Homeworld and the healing of the monstrous corrupted Gems encountered throughout the series. It also features the debut of new designs for most of the main characters and several previously unseen [[List of Steven Universe characters#Fusions|fusions]]. In \"Change Your Mind\", [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] must reunite with the Crystal Gems and open the eyes of the three Diamonds to the dysfunctionality of their family dynamic.\n\nOfficially promoted under the alternative title \"'''Steven Universe: Battle of Heart and Mind'''\", the episode premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on January 21, 2019. It received a viewership of 0.989 million people and was acclaimed by critics, with most praise going to its themes, scale, animation, writing, and voice performances, as well as White Diamond's treatment, characterization, and confrontation with Steven. Reviewers unanimously agreed that \"Change Your Mind\" felt like a crucial turning point for the series that could have effectively served as a [[series finale]], with ''[[The Post (Ohio newspaper)|The Post]]'' stating \"''Steven Universe'' can never go back to how it was before.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nImprisoned in a tower on the Gem Homeworld, Steven ([[Zach Callison]]) dreams a memory of his mother, Pink Diamond, being scolded by Blue Diamond ([[Lisa Hannigan]]) millennia ago. When he wakes up, Blue, thinking he is Pink Diamond, arrives to scold him again. However, he helps her understand that Pink abandoned the Diamonds because of their dysfunctional family dynamic, and she decides to help the Crystal Gems escape. Yellow Diamond ([[Patti LuPone]]) tries to stop them, but Steven helps her realize that deferring to White Diamond's perfectionism has made her miserable. Steven and Connie ([[Grace Rolek]]) prepare to escape with the dormant gems of [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (singer)|Estelle]]), [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]]), and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]]), but are intercepted by White Diamond's spaceship.\n\nMoments later, Bismuth ([[Uzo Aduba]]), Lapis Lazuli ([[Jennifer Paz]]), and Peridot ([[Shelby Rabara]]) arrive from Earth in Yellow and Blue's spaceships, and attack White's ship. After a brief battle, Yellow and Blue finally tell White about how they feel, but she responds by turning them into colorless drones acting as extensions of herself. Steven helps Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet regenerate their bodies by briefly fusing with each, and ultimately, all four fuse into Obsidian to reach White's chamber.\n\nWhite Diamond ([[Christine Ebersole]]) turns Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl into drones, and tries to convince Steven that he really is Pink Diamond, wrongly convincing herself that she is someone else. Attempting to restore Pink to her true self, White pulls Steven's gem from his body. It regenerates a body in Steven's form, which rebukes White by yelling \"She's GONE!\" and blocks White's attempts to control it. Connie carries Steven's weakened human body over to his Gem counterpart, and the two fuse back into Steven. White refuses to acknowledge that Pink is gone, saying that Pink is just \"acting like a child\"; Steven responds, \"I ''am'' a child\u2014what's your excuse?\" White blushes in embarrassment, releasing the others from her control. As White, realizing for the first time she is fallible, suffers an [[existential crisis]], Steven suggests that she should let everyone, including herself, \"be whoever they are\".\n\nThe Crystal Gems and Diamonds travel back to Earth. Shortly after they arrive, Steven's friend Lars ([[Matthew Moy]]) arrives as well, in his starship crewed by [[Off Colors|Off-Color rebel Gems]]. The Diamonds help Steven heal the corrupted Gems before returning to Homeworld. The episode ends with Steven spending a peaceful evening with his friends and family. He sings the song \"Change Your Mind\", celebrating his newfound emotional security.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing, art and animation ===\nThe episode was directed by supervising directors Joe Johnston and Kat Morris and art director Liz Artinian, and written and storyboarded by Johnston, Morris, Lamar Abrams, Miki Brewster, Danny Cragg, Hilary Florido, [[Ian Jones-Quartey]], Christine Liu, Jeff Liu, Katie Mitroff, Paul Villeco, and series creator and executive producer [[Rebecca Sugar]]. Former supervising director Jones-Quartey, who had departed from the series to create ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'', returned to storyboard a brief segment of the episode.

[...] And beyond all of this plot, thematic material, and character development, \"Change Your Mind\" is still an animated episode of television\u2014one with some pretty visually stunning sequences.\" He praised White Diamond's character and  Christine Ebersole's performance, calling White \"the perfect villain\" for the series' themes, and called the moment White removes Steven's gem \"the best, most gut-wrenching moment of the episode, and probably of the series\". He also stated \"Do [the Diamonds'] epiphanies happen too quickly? Maybe! As thrilling as all of this is, and as bold as it is that it\u2019s all happening at once, there are some moments in 'Change Your Mind' that veer a little too much into outright corniness, above and beyond the normal level we should expect from the show.\u201d<ref name=AVClub/>\n\nIn a highly positive review for ''[[The Post (Ohio newspaper)|The Post]]'' Joseph Stanichar stated: \"The first half of 'Change Your Mind' is action-packed and filled to the brim with answers to fans' pleas.

[...] Instead of punching White Diamond in retaliation or giving in to her manipulation, Steven remains insistently himself \u2014 even as White Diamond does the unthinkable and removes Steven\u2019s Gem from his body. [...] She has, essentially, been infected with Steven\u2019s feelings, and with her own. He\u2019s won.\"<ref name=Polygon/>\n\n''[[The Post (Ohio newspaper)|The Post]]'' stated that despite the large battle preceding it, \"it isn\u2019t until when the Crystal Gems finally reach White Diamond (Christine Ebersole) that things truly get serious. White Diamond doesn\u2019t throw a single punch or kick, but instead fights with her mind and words. After draining the color from Steven\u2019s friends, new and old, and possessing them, White digs into Steven\u2019s greatest insecurities, both about himself, his friends and about his past as Rose [and Pink Diamond]. Steven perseveres, though. Following a traumatic series of events, Steven resolves his dedication to his friends, positivity in the face of danger, and most of all, accepting himself as his own person. 'I\u2019ve always been me,' Steven tells White Diamond. This pure love exposes White as imperfect, and she finally gives up, agreeing to help Steven.\"<ref name=ThePost/>\n\n''Bubble Blabber'' stated: \"White is stuck in her head, yes, but it is because of a sense of responsibility she feels. She sees herself as the ultimate being, and so she doesn\u2019t really believe in the abilities of anyone other than herself. It\u2019s the \u2018if you want to do it right, do it yourself\u2019 taken to extremes, because she believes that she has no flaws, and by contrast, is very aware of everyone else\u2019s. This includes independent thought, personality traits, and really anything that makes someone beyond a function, but an actual person. White fundamentally doesn\u2019t trust other people, and so she can\u2019t imagine ideas that don\u2019t match her own.\"<ref name=BubbleBlabber/>\n\n==== Story arcs conclusion ====\n\"Change Your Mind\" marks the conclusion of the story arcs originally conceived by [[Rebecca Sugar]] when she first created the series.<ref name=Polygon/> Reviewers unanimously agreed that it felt like a landmark and turning point for ''Steven Universe'', as it completed all the ongoing storyline arcs for the series up until then, and that the episode would have been a fitting [[series finale]]; as such, it also led them to question the direction the show was going to take afterwards.<ref name=EconoTimes/><ref name=BubbleBlabber/><ref name=TVWeb>{{cite web | url = https://tvweb.com/steven-universe-movie-teaser-video-release-date-fall-2019/ | title =Steven Universe: The Movie Teaser Confirms Fall Premiere | last=Scott | first=Ryan |date=January 22, 2019 | accessdate=January 24, 2019 | work=TV Web}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Post (Ohio newspaper)|The Post]]'' called \"Change Your Mind\" \"the end of an era. With a new revelation nearly every second of the episode\u2019s 45-minute runtime, ''Steven Universe'' can never go back to how it was before. [...] ''Steven Universe'' is not over, but what it was certainly is. It\u2019s future is uncertain, and it\u2019s hard to even imagine the show continuing from what was once intended to be the series\u2019 definitive end. But even if by some disaster the show goes to crap after this, at least this era of the series ended with not with a bang \u2014 although there were plenty of those along the way \u2014 but with a song. A song of love.\" Analyzing the ending of the episode, they concluded that \"''Steven Universe'' has been rightly hailed as a haven for the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] community, and others who have been demonized or ostracized by society. Paralleling Steven\u2019s message to the Diamonds, [the 'Change Your Mind' song] makes one last plea to those who still won\u2019t accept these people. Not all of them will listen. But maybe, in time, those of future generations will.\"<ref name=ThePost/>\n\n''Bubble Blabber'' stated \"We know that a sixth season is confirmed, but what could that entail? A lot of the major plot points have been wrapped up, and this seemed like as good of an ending as we\u2019d get. More problems could occur, of course, but the big issues that had been set up since the start have now been resolved. What else is there left to do?\"<ref name=BubbleBlabber/> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' stated \"In this week\u2019s episode, 'Change Your Mind,' which marks the conclusion of creator Rebecca Sugar\u2019s originally planned five-season arc for the series (but is not the series finale), Steven prevails over the entire Gem empire by flexing his sentimental muscles. The bulk of the hour (also dubbed the Battle of Heart and Mind) is devoted to Steven opening the eyes of the three other Diamond rulers of the Gem civilization to his, and his mother Pink\u2019s, view of humanity. It\u2019s an impressive feat of compassion, and the narrative endpoint of 156 episodes of television.\"<ref name=Polygon/> \n\n''[[The Mary Sue]]'' stated \"This certainly had the feel of things coming to an end [...] When an hour-long special closes the book on the show\u2019s major antagonists and ends by mirroring the final shot of the show\u2019s opening theme, it\u2019s hard not to call it an ending of sorts, even if more content arrives at a later date. As a finale, it\u2019s in fine form.\" Questioning the future of the series, they claimed that \"If the show wants to carry on, it has to open [its own] questions back up and answer them. Where are the corrupted gems going to go? How far have the Diamonds actually come in dismantling millennia of toxic mentalities, which 'Change Your Mind' only really has to represent as a one-off change of heart done in an intense moment of connection rather than the hard day-to-day work of becoming a better person. And what about that oppressive totalitarian regime, though?\"<ref name=MarySue/>\n\n==== Other themes ====\n''[[The A.V. Club]]'' stated \"The nature of White\u2019s ability, and the way her character forms around it (or vice versa), are the cause of so many small, careful moments of storytelling in 'Change Your Mind' that it feels like a daunting task to list even half of them. She forces Pearl to fight Connie, forcing the student to confront the master.{{efn|Pearl is the one that taught Connie how to fight by giving her [[Swordsmanship|sword fighting]] lessons in the [[List of Steven Universe episodes#Season 2 (2015\u201316)|season two]] episode \"Sworn to the Sword\".}} [...] Her Pearl, we learn, was originally Pink\u2019s Pearl\u2014a neat piece of writing, given the way the episode starts. And her ability is a kind of combination of Yellow\u2019s force blasts and Blue\u2019s empathetic field, transforming other Gems into puppet-like extensions of her own being. And she first does this to Yellow and Blue after they express their feelings, in a scene that also confirms the Diamonds\u2019 redemption as Steven refers to them with the formal Crystal Gems salutation, 'Guys?' [...] The show\u2019s position has long been that no one in its universe is fundamentally evil, and that just talking to people is often enough to get them to open up\u2014especially for Steven, who is inhumanly kind and understanding.\"<ref name=AVClub/>\n\n''Cord Cutters'' believed that the fact that Peridot and Lapis Lazuli do not perform fusion in the episode despite their strong relationship was a meaningful choice from the crew of ''Steven Universe'': \"Lapis Lazuli was in an abusive relationship for months before she was set free by Steven and the Crystal Gems.{{efn|Lapis previously showed signs of [[psychological trauma]] after a lengthy reluctant fusion with Jasper, which lasted from the [[List of Steven Universe episodes#Season 1 (2013\u201315)|season one]] finale \"[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]\" to the [[List of Steven Universe episodes#Season 3 (2016)|season three]] premiere \"[[Super Watermelon Island]]\".}} Peridot, on the other hand, was someone who never got to learn how to love herself because she spent most of her life being looked down on or forced to think logically to the point of self-deprivation. Now look at them. Lapis stands tall while sporting a smile instead of cowering with her arms folded across her chest. Peridot never stops trying to do better things and smiles with her friends instead of finding the little moments to be useless.

The Diamonds murdered so many people. Are we just supposed to forget about that? How do the other Gems feel? What about the rest of Crystal Gem society? It leaves the episode on a sour note, which is unfortunate because the rest is so good. [...] Not everyone can be reasoned with. Not everyone will come around to your side.

Eric Thurm of ''The A.V.

The only 44-minute episode of the series, it was directed by Joe Johnston, Kat Morris and Liz Artinian, and written and storyboarded by Johnston, Morris, Lamar Abrams, Miki Brewster, Danny Cragg, Hilary Florido, [[Ian Jones-Quartey]], Christine Liu, Jeff Liu, Katie Mitroff, Paul Villeco, and series creator and executive producer [[Rebecca Sugar]].\n\nThe conclusion of the original storyline conceived by Sugar when developing ''Steven Universe'', the episode serves as the culmination of the ongoing story arcs developed during the show's first five seasons, most notably the Crystal Gems' conflict with the Gem Homeworld and the healing of the monstrous corrupted Gems encountered throughout the series. It also features the debut of new designs for most of the main characters and several previously unseen [[List of Steven Universe characters#Fusions|fusions]]. In \"Change Your Mind\", [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] must reunite with the Crystal Gems and open the eyes of the three Diamonds to the dysfunctionality of their family dynamic.\n\nOfficially promoted under the alternative title \"'''Steven Universe: Battle of Heart and Mind'''\", the episode premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on January 21, 2019. It received a viewership of 0.989 million people and was acclaimed by critics, with most praise going to its themes, scale, animation, writing, and voice performances, as well as White Diamond's treatment, characterization, and confrontation with Steven. Reviewers unanimously agreed that \"Change Your Mind\" felt like a crucial turning point for the series that could have effectively served as a [[series finale]], with ''[[The Post (Ohio newspaper)|The Post]]'' stating \"''Steven Universe'' can never go back to how it was before.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nImprisoned in a tower on the Gem Homeworld, Steven ([[Zach Callison]]) dreams a memory of his mother, Pink Diamond, being scolded by Blue Diamond ([[Lisa Hannigan]]) millennia ago. When he wakes up, Blue, thinking he is Pink Diamond, arrives to scold him again. However, he helps her understand that Pink abandoned the Diamonds because of their dysfunctional family dynamic, and she decides to help the Crystal Gems escape. Yellow Diamond ([[Patti LuPone]]) tries to stop them, but Steven helps her realize that deferring to White Diamond's perfectionism has made her miserable. Steven and Connie ([[Grace Rolek]]) prepare to escape with the dormant gems of [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (singer)|Estelle]]), [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]]), and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]]), but are intercepted by White Diamond's spaceship.\n\nMoments later, Bismuth ([[Uzo Aduba]]), Lapis Lazuli ([[Jennifer Paz]]), and Peridot ([[Shelby Rabara]]) arrive from Earth in Yellow and Blue's spaceships, and attack White's ship. After a brief battle, Yellow and Blue finally tell White about how they feel, but she responds by turning them into colorless drones acting as extensions of herself. Steven helps Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet regenerate their bodies by briefly fusing with each, and ultimately, all four fuse into Obsidian to reach White's chamber.\n\nWhite Diamond ([[Christine Ebersole]]) turns Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl into drones, and tries to convince Steven that he really is Pink Diamond, wrongly convincing herself that she is someone else. Attempting to restore Pink to her true self, White pulls Steven's gem from his body. It regenerates a body in Steven's form, which rebukes White by yelling \"She's GONE!\" and blocks White's attempts to control it. Connie carries Steven's weakened human body over to his Gem counterpart, and the two fuse back into Steven. White refuses to acknowledge that Pink is gone, saying that Pink is just \"acting like a child\"; Steven responds, \"I ''am'' a child\u2014what's your excuse?\" White blushes in embarrassment, releasing the others from her control. As White, realizing for the first time she is fallible, suffers an [[existential crisis]], Steven suggests that she should let everyone, including herself, \"be whoever they are\".\n\nThe Crystal Gems and Diamonds travel back to Earth. Shortly after they arrive, Steven's friend Lars ([[Matthew Moy]]) arrives as well, in his starship crewed by [[Off Colors|Off-Color rebel Gems]]. The Diamonds help Steven heal the corrupted Gems before returning to Homeworld. The episode ends with Steven spending a peaceful evening with his friends and family.

Former supervising director Jones-Quartey, who had departed from the series to create ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'', returned to storyboard a brief segment of the episode.

The handling of the episode's themes was largely praised in regard to the overall themes of the series, particularly during the final face-off between Steven and White Diamond.

Despite this, some minor criticism was made towards the pacing of its first half and resolution.\n\nIn a positive review published at ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Eric Thurm called the episode \"an impressive feat of compassion, and the narrative endpoint of 156 episodes of television\", praising how the episode illustrated the evolution of Steven from being \"irritating\" and \"a huge goofball incapable of taking anything seriously\" at the beginning of the series to \"a remarkably mature, emotionally intelligent person\", stating \"''Steven Universe'' isn\u2019t about Steven discarding the things that made, and still make, him childish \u2014 it\u2019s about figuring out how to use them in more specific, salutary ways.\"<ref name=Polygon>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/21/18190441/steven-universe-change-your-mind-recap-season-5-finale | title = Steven Universe\u2019s climactic showdown delivered a complicated lesson on childhood | last=Thurm | first=Eric |date=January 21, 2019 | accessdate=January 24, 2019 | work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The A.V.

[...] And beyond all of this plot, thematic material, and character development, \"Change Your Mind\" is still an animated episode of television\u2014one with some pretty visually stunning sequences.\" He praised White Diamond's character and  Christine Ebersole's performance, calling White \"the perfect villain\" for the series' themes, and called the moment White removes Steven's gem \"the best, most gut-wrenching moment of the episode, and probably of the series\". He also stated \"Do [the Diamonds'] epiphanies happen too quickly? Maybe! As thrilling as all of this is, and as bold as it is that it\u2019s all happening at once, there are some moments in 'Change Your Mind' that veer a little too much into outright corniness, above and beyond the normal level we should expect from the show.\u201d<ref name=AVClub/>\n\nIn a highly positive review for ''[[The Post (Ohio newspaper)|The Post]]'' Joseph Stanichar stated: \"The first half of 'Change Your Mind' is action-packed and filled to the brim with answers to fans' pleas.

[...] Instead of punching White Diamond in retaliation or giving in to her manipulation, Steven remains insistently himself \u2014 even as White Diamond does the unthinkable and removes Steven\u2019s Gem from his body. [...] She has, essentially, been infected with Steven\u2019s feelings, and with her own. He\u2019s won.\"<ref name=Polygon/>\n\n''[[The Post (Ohio newspaper)|The Post]]'' stated that despite the large battle preceding it, \"it isn\u2019t until when the Crystal Gems finally reach White Diamond (Christine Ebersole) that things truly get serious. White Diamond doesn\u2019t throw a single punch or kick, but instead fights with her mind and words. After draining the color from Steven\u2019s friends, new and old, and possessing them, White digs into Steven\u2019s greatest insecurities, both about himself, his friends and about his past as Rose [and Pink Diamond]. Steven perseveres, though. Following a traumatic series of events, Steven resolves his dedication to his friends, positivity in the face of danger, and most of all, accepting himself as his own person. 'I\u2019ve always been me,' Steven tells White Diamond. This pure love exposes White as imperfect, and she finally gives up, agreeing to help Steven.\"<ref name=ThePost/>\n\n''Bubble Blabber'' stated: \"White is stuck in her head, yes, but it is because of a sense of responsibility she feels. She sees herself as the ultimate being, and so she doesn\u2019t really believe in the abilities of anyone other than herself. It\u2019s the \u2018if you want to do it right, do it yourself\u2019 taken to extremes, because she believes that she has no flaws, and by contrast, is very aware of everyone else\u2019s. This includes independent thought, personality traits, and really anything that makes someone beyond a function, but an actual person. White fundamentally doesn\u2019t trust other people, and so she can\u2019t imagine ideas that don\u2019t match her own.\"<ref name=BubbleBlabber/>\n\n==== Story arcs conclusion ====\n\"Change Your Mind\" marks the conclusion of the story arcs originally conceived by [[Rebecca Sugar]] when she first created the series.<ref name=Polygon/> Reviewers unanimously agreed that it felt like a landmark and turning point for ''Steven Universe'', as it completed all the ongoing storyline arcs for the series up until then, and that the episode would have been a fitting [[series finale]]; as such, it also led them to question the direction the show was going to take afterwards.<ref name=EconoTimes/><ref name=BubbleBlabber/><ref name=TVWeb>{{cite web | url = https://tvweb.com/steven-universe-movie-teaser-video-release-date-fall-2019/ | title =Steven Universe: The Movie Teaser Confirms Fall Premiere | last=Scott | first=Ryan |date=January 22, 2019 | accessdate=January 24, 2019 | work=TV Web}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Post (Ohio newspaper)|The Post]]'' called \"Change Your Mind\" \"the end of an era. With a new revelation nearly every second of the episode\u2019s 45-minute runtime, ''Steven Universe'' can never go back to how it was before. [...] ''Steven Universe'' is not over, but what it was certainly is. It\u2019s future is uncertain, and it\u2019s hard to even imagine the show continuing from what was once intended to be the series\u2019 definitive end. But even if by some disaster the show goes to crap after this, at least this era of the series ended with not with a bang \u2014 although there were plenty of those along the way \u2014 but with a song. A song of love.\" Analyzing the ending of the episode, they concluded that \"''Steven Universe'' has been rightly hailed as a haven for the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] community, and others who have been demonized or ostracized by society. Paralleling Steven\u2019s message to the Diamonds, [the 'Change Your Mind' song] makes one last plea to those who still won\u2019t accept these people. Not all of them will listen. But maybe, in time, those of future generations will.\"<ref name=ThePost/>\n\n''Bubble Blabber'' stated \"We know that a sixth season is confirmed, but what could that entail? A lot of the major plot points have been wrapped up, and this seemed like as good of an ending as we\u2019d get. More problems could occur, of course, but the big issues that had been set up since the start have now been resolved. What else is there left to do?\"<ref name=BubbleBlabber/> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' stated \"In this week\u2019s episode, 'Change Your Mind,' which marks the conclusion of creator Rebecca Sugar\u2019s originally planned five-season arc for the series (but is not the series finale), Steven prevails over the entire Gem empire by flexing his sentimental muscles. The bulk of the hour (also dubbed the Battle of Heart and Mind) is devoted to Steven opening the eyes of the three other Diamond rulers of the Gem civilization to his, and his mother Pink\u2019s, view of humanity. It\u2019s an impressive feat of compassion, and the narrative endpoint of 156 episodes of television.\"<ref name=Polygon/> \n\n''[[The Mary Sue]]'' stated \"This certainly had the feel of things coming to an end [...] When an hour-long special closes the book on the show\u2019s major antagonists and ends by mirroring the final shot of the show\u2019s opening theme, it\u2019s hard not to call it an ending of sorts, even if more content arrives at a later date. As a finale, it\u2019s in fine form.\" Questioning the future of the series, they claimed that \"If the show wants to carry on, it has to open [its own] questions back up and answer them. Where are the corrupted gems going to go? How far have the Diamonds actually come in dismantling millennia of toxic mentalities, which 'Change Your Mind' only really has to represent as a one-off change of heart done in an intense moment of connection rather than the hard day-to-day work of becoming a better person. And what about that oppressive totalitarian regime, though?\"<ref name=MarySue/>\n\n==== Other themes ====\n''[[The A.V. Club]]'' stated \"The nature of White\u2019s ability, and the way her character forms around it (or vice versa), are the cause of so many small, careful moments of storytelling in 'Change Your Mind' that it feels like a daunting task to list even half of them. She forces Pearl to fight Connie, forcing the student to confront the master.{{efn|Pearl is the one that taught Connie how to fight by giving her [[Swordsmanship|sword fighting]] lessons in the [[List of Steven Universe episodes#Season 2 (2015\u201316)|season two]] episode \"Sworn to the Sword\".}} [...] Her Pearl, we learn, was originally Pink\u2019s Pearl\u2014a neat piece of writing, given the way the episode starts. And her ability is a kind of combination of Yellow\u2019s force blasts and Blue\u2019s empathetic field, transforming other Gems into puppet-like extensions of her own being. And she first does this to Yellow and Blue after they express their feelings, in a scene that also confirms the Diamonds\u2019 redemption as Steven refers to them with the formal Crystal Gems salutation, 'Guys?' [...] The show\u2019s position has long been that no one in its universe is fundamentally evil, and that just talking to people is often enough to get them to open up\u2014especially for Steven, who is inhumanly kind and understanding.\"<ref name=AVClub/>\n\n''Cord Cutters'' believed that the fact that Peridot and Lapis Lazuli do not perform fusion in the episode despite their strong relationship was a meaningful choice from the crew of ''Steven Universe'': \"Lapis Lazuli was in an abusive relationship for months before she was set free by Steven and the Crystal Gems.{{efn|Lapis previously showed signs of [[psychological trauma]] after a lengthy reluctant fusion with Jasper, which lasted from the [[List of Steven Universe episodes#Season 1 (2013\u201315)|season one]] finale \"[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]\" to the [[List of Steven Universe episodes#Season 3 (2016)|season three]] premiere \"[[Super Watermelon Island]]\".}} Peridot, on the other hand, was someone who never got to learn how to love herself because she spent most of her life being looked down on or forced to think logically to the point of self-deprivation. Now look at them. Lapis stands tall while sporting a smile instead of cowering with her arms folded across her chest. Peridot never stops trying to do better things and smiles with her friends instead of finding the little moments to be useless.

The Diamonds murdered so many people. Are we just supposed to forget about that? How do the other Gems feel? What about the rest of Crystal Gem society? It leaves the episode on a sour note, which is unfortunate because the rest is so good. [...] Not everyone can be reasoned with. Not everyone will come around to your side. It\u2019s a nice aspirational idea but not practical. ''Steven Universe'' should be better than this.\"<ref name=DenOfGeek>{{cite web | url = https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/steven-universe/278760/steven-universe-change-your-mind-review | title = Steven Universe: Change Your Mind Review | last=Kelley | first=Shamus |date=January 21, 2019 | accessdate=January 24, 2019 | work=[[Den of Geek!]]}}</ref>\n\nSteven's efforts to get the Diamonds to recognize his identity has been interpreted as an allegory for [[transgender]] individuals struggling to get their families to accept their [[gender identity]]. Eric Thurm of ''The A.V. Club'' notes \"When Blue forcefully tells Yellow, 'She prefers to be called Steven,' she\u2019s finally listening to Steven when he says that he\u2019s not his mom\u2014but she could just as easily be talking about a [[Transgender|trans]] relative asking to be called by their chosen name\";<ref name=AVClub/> and Julie Muncy at [[io9]] also identifies White Diamond's assumption that Steven is \"just an expression of Pink\u2019s own psychological issues\" as \"a rhetorical gesture that\u2019s bound to be sadly familiar to a lot of trans viewers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-powerful-transgender-narrative-in-steven-universe-1832084052|title=The Powerful Transgender Narrative in ''Steven Universe''|last=Muncy|first=Julie|date=January 27, 2019|accessdate=January 27, 2019|work=[[io9]] }}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Steven Universe}}\n{{Cartoon Network pilots, films and specials}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Change Your Mind (''Steven Universe'')}}\n[[Category:2019 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Steven Universe episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Television episodes set in space]]\n", "name_user": "2601:584:4101:d2b0:1832:a97f:2bf:e74", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eProduction)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Your_Mind_(Steven_Universe)"}

The sculptor of the Eastman is Elizabeth MacQueen.  Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School.

The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n===Pat Summitt Rotunda===\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions.

Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948.

Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the [[Church of Satan]] in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various [[Christianity|Christian]] groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the [[Devil in popular culture|concept of Satan]], has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression.\n\nAccusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the [[Inquisition]] attached to the [[Catholic Church]] alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Cathars]], performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent [[Early Modern period]], belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in [[Witch trials in the early modern period|mass trials of alleged witches]] across Europe and the North American colonies. Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active, and behind events such as [[Protestantism]] (and conversely, the [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation#Antichrist|Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist]]) and the [[French Revolution]] continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century. The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential [[Taxil hoax]] of France in the 1890s, which claimed that [[Freemasonry]] worshiped Satan, [[Lucifer]], and [[Baphomet]] in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom, amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites. In most of these cases, there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them.\n\nSince the 19th century, various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography. Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural [[deity]], viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a [[patriarch]]. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\">{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n \nContemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet.<ref name=\"crsi\">{{cite book |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |author= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= Introduction: Embracing Satan}}</ref> The Internet spreads awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for Satanist disputes.<ref name=\"crsi\" /> Satanism started to reach [[Central and Eastern Europe]] in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], and most noticeably in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], predominantly Roman Catholic countries.<ref name=\"crs8\">{{cite book |last= Alisauskiene |first= Milda |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |editor= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= The Peculiarities of Lithuanian Satanism}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title =Satanism stalks Poland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/778438.stm |work= BBC News |date= 2000-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|224px|''[[Wolfgang of Regensburg|Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'', by [[Michael Pacher]].]]\n\nIn their study of Satanism, the [[religious studies]] scholars Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal, [[James R.

Petersen stated that the term ''Satanism'' \"has a history of being a designation made by people against those whom they dislike; it is a term used for '[[othering]]'\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=7}} The concept of Satanism is an invention of Christianity, for it relies upon the figure of Satan, a character deriving from [[Christian mythology]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=16}}\n\nElsewhere, Petersen noted that \"Satanism as something others do is very different from Satanism as a self-designation\".{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=92}}\nEugene Gallagher noted that, as commonly used, ''Satanism'' was usually \"a [[polemical]], not a descriptive term\".{{sfn|Gallagher|2006|p=151}}\n\nIn 1994, the Italian sociologist [[Massimo Introvigne]] suggested to define Satanism with the simultaneous presence of \"1) the worship of the character identified with the name of Satan or Lucifer in the Bible, 2) by organized groups with at least a minimal organization and hierarchy, 3) through ritual or liturgical practices.\" The definition applies regardless the way in which \"each group perceives Satan, as personal or impersonal, real or symbolical.<ref>{{cite book | first = Massimo | last1 = Introvigne | author-link = Massimo Introvigne | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=nt8zDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 | title = Satanism: A Social History | publisher = Brill | date = September 29, 2016 | language = en | access-date = February 20, 2020 | location = \tLeiden ;

in this context, it appears at several points in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=19}} For instance, in the [[Book of Samuel]], [[David]] is presented as the satan (\"adversary\") of the [[Philistines]], while in the [[Book of Numbers]] the term appears as a verb, when God sent an angel to ''satan'' (\"to oppose\") [[Balaam]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=51}} Prior to the composition of the [[New Testament]], the idea developed within Jewish communities that Satan was the name of an angel who had rebeled against God and had been cast out of Heaven along with his followers; this account would be incorporated into contemporary texts like the [[Book of Enoch]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=52}} This Satan was then featured in parts of the New Testament, where he was presented as a figure who tempted humans to commit [[sin]]; in the [[Book of Matthew]] and the [[Book of Luke]], he attempted to tempt [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the latter fasted in the wilderness.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=53}}\n\nThe word \"Satanism\" was adopted into English from the [[French language|French]] ''satanisme''.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} The terms \"Satanism\" and \"Satanist\" are first recorded as appearing in the English and French languages during the sixteenth century, when they were used by Christian groups to attack other, rival Christian groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=2}} In a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] tract of 1565, the author condemns the \"heresies, blasphemies, and sathanismes [sic]\" of the [[Protestantism|Protestants]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} In an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] work of 1559, [[Anabaptists]] and other Protestant sects are condemned as \"swarmes of Satanistes [sic]\".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} As used in this manner, the term \"Satanism\" was not used to claim that people literally worshipped Satan, but rather presented the view that through deviating from what the speaker or writer regarded as the true variant of Christianity, they were regarded as being essentially in league with the [[devil]]. {{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} During the nineteenth century, the term \"Satanism\" began to be used to describe those considered to lead a broadly immoral lifestyle,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} and it was only in the late nineteenth century that it came to be applied in English to individuals who were believed to consciously and deliberately venerate Satan.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} This latter meaning had appeared earlier in the [[Swedish language]]; the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Bishop [[Laurentius Paulinus Gothus]] had described devil-worshipping sorcerers as ''Sathanister'' in his ''Ethica Christiana'', produced between 1615 and 1630.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=44}}\n\n== Antagonism towards Satanism ==\n<!-- Groups or individuals alleged to have practiced Satanism before the appearance of modern Satanism in the 1960s -->\n\nHistorical and anthropological research suggests that nearly all societies have developed the idea of a sinister and anti-human force that can hide itself within society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=13\u201314}} This commonly involves a belief in [[witchcraft|witches]], a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in [[incest]], [[murder]], and [[cannibalism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=14}} Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}} For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}}\n\nAnother contributing factor to the idea of Satanism is the concept that there is an agent of misfortune and evil who operates on a cosmic scale,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=19}} something usually associated with a strong form of ethical dualism that divides the world clearly into forces of good and forces of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=20}} The earliest such entity known is [[Angra Mainyu]], a figure that appears in the Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=19|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=18}} This concept was also embraced by [[Judaism]] and early Christianity, and although it was soon marginalized within Jewish thought, it gained increasing importance within early Christian understandings of the cosmos.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=21}} While the early Christian idea of the Devil was not well developed, it gradually adapted and expanded through the creation of folklore, art, theological treatises, and morality tales, thus providing the character with a range of extra-Biblical associations.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n===Medieval and Early Modern Christendom===\n\n[[File:Praetorius Blocksberg.jpg|thumb|Title illustration of [[Johannes Praetorius (writer)]] ''Blocksbergs Verrichtung'' (1668) showing many traditional features of the medieval [[Witches' Sabbath]]]]\n{{See also|European witchcraft|Maleficium (sorcery)|Witch-cult hypothesis}}\n\nAs Christianity expanded throughout the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and Europe, it came into contact with a variety of other religions, which it regarded as \"[[paganism|pagan]]\". Christian theologians claimed that the gods and goddesses venerated by these \"pagans\" were not genuine divinities, but were actually demons.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=23}} However, they did not believe that \"pagans\" were deliberately devil-worshippers, instead claiming that they were simply misguided.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}} In Christian iconography, the Devil and demons were given the physical traits of figures from [[Classical mythology]] such as the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], [[faun]]s, and [[satyr]]s.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}}\n\nThose Christian groups regarded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were treated differently, with theologians arguing that they were deliberately worshipping the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=24\u201326}} This was accompanied by claims that such individuals engaged in incestuous sexual orgies, murdered infants, and committed acts of [[cannibalism]], all stock accusations that had previously been leveled at Christians themselves in the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=25\u201326}}\nThe first recorded example of such an accusation being made within [[Western Christianity]] took place in [[Toulouse]] in 1022, when two clerics were tried for allegedly venerating a demon.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=25}} Throughout the middle ages, this accusation would be applied to a wide range of Christian heretical groups, including the [[Paulicians]], [[Bogomils]], [[Cathars]], [[Waldensians]], and the [[Hussites]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=28}} The [[Knights Templar]] were accused of worshipping an [[Cult image|idol]] known as [[Baphomet]], with Lucifer having appeared at their meetings in the form of a cat.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=126}} As well as these Christian groups, these claims were also made about Europe's Jewish community.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=28\u201329}} In the thirteenth century, there were also references made to a group of \"Luciferians\" led by a woman named Lucardis which hoped to see Satan rule in Heaven. References to this group continued into the fourteenth century, although historians studying the allegations concur that these Luciferians were likely a fictitious invention.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=29\u201331}}\n\nWithin Christian thought, the idea developed that certain individuals could make [[Deal with the Devil|a pact with Satan]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=57}} This may have emerged after observing that pacts with gods and goddesses played a role in various pre-Christian belief systems, or that such pacts were also made as part of the Christian cult of saints.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=58}} Another possibility is that it derives from a misunderstanding of [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s condemnation of [[augury]] in his ''[[On the Christian Doctrine]]'', written in the late fourth century. Here, he stated that people who consulted augurs were entering \"''quasi pacts''\" (covenants) with demons.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=57\u201358}} The idea of the diabolical pact made with demons was popularized across Europe in the story of [[Faust]], likely based in part on the real life [[Johann Georg Faust]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=60\u201363}}\n\n[[File:CompendiumMaleficarumEngraving15.jpg|thumb|left|''The Obscene Kiss'', an illustration of witches kissing the Devil's anus from [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]]'s ''Compendium Maleficarum'' (1608).]]\n\nAs the late medieval gave way to the [[early modern period]], European Christendom experienced a schism between the established [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the breakaway [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movement. In the ensuing [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], both Catholics and Protestants accused each other of deliberately being in league with Satan.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=35}} It was in this context that the terms \"Satanist\" and \"Satanism\" emerged.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=2}}\n\nThe early modern period also saw fear of Satanists reach its \"historical apogee\" in the form of the [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}} This came about as the accusations which had been leveled at medieval heretics, among them that of devil-worship, were applied to the pre-existing idea of [[European witchcraft|the witch]], or practitioner of malevolent [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=133|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=37}} The idea of a conspiracy of Satanic witches was developed by educated elites, although the concept of malevolent witchcraft was a widespread part of popular belief and [[folklore|folkloric]] ideas about the [[night witch]], the [[wild hunt]], and the dance of the fairies were incorporated into it.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=38}} The earliest trials took place in Northern Italy and France, before spreading it out to other areas of Europe and to Britain's North American colonies, being carried out by the legal authorities in both Catholic and Protestant regions.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}}\nBetween 30,000 and 50,000 individuals were executed as accused Satanic witches.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}}\nMost historians agree that the majority of those persecuted in these witch trials were innocent of any involvement in Devil worship.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=70}} However, in their summary of the evidence for the trials, the historians Geoffrey Scarre and John Callow thought it \"without doubt\" that some of those accused in the trials had been guilty of employing magic in an attempt to harm their enemies, and were thus genuinely guilty of witchcraft.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=2}}\n\nIn seventeenth-century Sweden, a number of highway robbers and other outlaws living in the forests informed judges that they venerated Satan because he provided more practical assistance than God.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=44\u201345}}\nThe historian of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] regarded these practices as \"folkloric Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=44}}\n\n===18th to 20th century Christendom===\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, gentleman's social clubs became increasingly prominent in Britain and Ireland, among the most secretive of which were the [[Hellfire Clubs]], which were first reported in the 1720s.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1pp=58\u201359|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=66}} The most famous of these groups was the [[Order of the Knights of Saints Francis]], which was founded circa 1750 by the aristocrat [[Sir Francis Dashwood]] and which assembled first at his estate at [[West Wycombe]] and later in [[Medmenham Abbey]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=66\u201367}} A number of contemporary press sources portrayed these as gatherings of [[atheism|atheist]] [[Rake (character)|rakes]] where Christianity was mocked and toasts were made to the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=66}} Beyond these sensationalist accounts, which may not be accurate portrayals of actual events, little is known about the activities of the Hellfire Clubs.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=66}} Introvigne suggested that they may have engaged in a form of \"playful Satanism\" in which Satan was invoked \"to show a daring contempt for conventional morality\" by individuals who neither believed in his literal existence nor wanted to pay homage to him.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=60\u201361}}\n\n[[Image:SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png|thumb|right|Stanislas de Guaita drew the original goat pentagram, which first appeared in the book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' in 1897. This symbol would later become synonymous with [[Baphomet]], and is commonly referred to as the Sabbatic Goat.]]\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] of 1789 dealt a blow to the hegemony of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in parts of Europe, and soon a number of Catholic authors began making claims that it had been masterminded by a conspiratorial group of Satanists.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=71}} Among the first to do so was French Catholic priest [[Jean-Baptiste Fiard]], who publicly claimed that a wide range of individuals, from the [[Jacobins]] to [[tarot|tarot card readers]], were part of a Satanic conspiracy.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=71\u201373}} Fiard's ideas were furthered by [[Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier]], who devoted a lengthy book to this [[conspiracy theory]]; he claimed that Satanists had supernatural powers allowing them to curse people and to shapeshift into both cats and fleas.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=74\u201378}} Although most of his contemporaries regarded Berbiguier as mad,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=84\u201385}} his ideas gained credence among many occultists, including [[Stanislas de Guaita]], a [[Christian Cabala|Cabalist]] who used them for the basis of his book, ''The Temple of Satan''.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nIn the early 20th century, the British novelist [[Dennis Wheatley]] produced a range of influential novels in which his protagonists battled Satanic groups.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=266\u2013267}} At the same time, non-fiction authors like [[Montague Summers]] and [[Rollo Ahmed]] published books claiming that Satanic groups practicing black magic were still active across the world, although they provided no evidence that this was the case.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=141\u2013142}} During the 1950s, various British tabloid newspapers repeated such claims, largely basing their accounts on the allegations of one woman, Sarah Jackson, who claimed to have been a member of such a group.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=143\u2013149}} In 1973, the British Christian [[Doreen Irvine]] published ''From Witchcraft to Christ'', in which she claimed to have been a member of a Satanic group that gave her supernatural powers, such as the ability to [[levitation|levitate]], before she escaped and embraced Christianity.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=159\u2013161}}\nIn the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, various Christian preachers\u2014the most famous being [[Mike Warnke]] in his 1972 book ''The Satan-Seller''\u2014claimed that they had been members of Satanic groups who carried out sex rituals and animal sacrifices before discovering Christianity.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=164\u2013170}} According to Gareth Medway in his historical examination of Satanism, these stories were \"a series of inventions by insecure people and hack writers, each one based on a previous story, exaggerated a little more each time\".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=161}}\n\nOther publications made allegations of Satanism against historical figures. The 1970s saw the publication of the Romanian Protestant preacher [[Richard Wurmbrand]]'s book in which he argued\u2014without corroborating evidence\u2014that the socio-political theorist [[Karl Marx]] had been a Satanist.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1pp=262\u2013263|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=66}}\n\n===Satanic ritual abuse hysteria===\n{{main|Satanic ritual abuse}}\n\nAt the end of the twentieth century, a [[moral panic]] developed around claims regarding a Devil-worshipping cult that made use of sexual abuse, murder, and cannibalism in its rituals, with children being among its victims.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=13}} Initially, the alleged perpetrators of such crimes were labeled \"witches\", although the term \"Satanist\" was soon adopted as a favored alternative,{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=13}} and the phenomenon itself came to be called \"the Satanism Scare\".{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=15}} Promoters of the claims alleged that there was a conspiracy of organized Satanists who occupied prominent positions throughout society, from the police to politicians, and that they had been powerful enough to cover up their crimes.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=2016|1p=13|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=381}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Preceded by some significant but isolated episodes in the 1970s, a great Satanism scare exploded in the 1980s in the United States and Canada and was subsequently exported towards England, Australia, and other countries. It was unprecedented in history. It surpassed even the results of [[Taxil hoax|Taxil]]'s propaganda, and has been compared with the most virulent periods of witch hunting. The scare started in 1980 and declined slowly between 1990... and 1994, when official British and American reports denied the real existence of ritual satanic crimes.

Smith had claimed that as a child she had been abused by her family in Satanic rituals in which babies were sacrificed and Satan himself appeared.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1pp=175\u2013177|2a1=Dyrendal|2a2=Lewis|2a3=Petersen|2y=2016|2pp=115\u2013116|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3pp=374\u2013376}} In 1983, allegations were made that the McMartin family\u2014owners of a preschool in [[California]]\u2014were guilty of sexually abusing the children in their care during Satanic rituals. The allegations resulted in a [[McMartin preschool trial|lengthy and expensive trial]], in which all of the accused would eventually be

in similar allegations being made in various other parts of the United States.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=183}}\n\nA prominent aspect of the Satanic Scare was the claim by those in the developing \"anti-Satanism\" movement that any child's claim about Satanic ritual abuse must be true, because children would not lie.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=16}} Although some involved in the anti-Satanism movement were from Jewish and secular backgrounds,{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=369|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=2016|2p=15}} a central part was played by fundamentalist and evangelical forms of Christianity, in particular [[Pentecostalism]], with Christian groups holding conferences and producing books and videotapes to promote belief in the conspiracy.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=15}} Various figures in law enforcement also came to be promoters of the conspiracy theory, with such \"cult cops\" holding various conferences to promote it.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=191\u2013195}} The scare was later imported to the United Kingdom through visiting evangelicals and became popular among some of the country's social workers,{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=220\u2013221}} resulting in a range of accusations and trials across Britain.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=234\u2013248}}\n\nThe Satanic ritual abuse hysteria died down between 1990 and 1994.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=372}} In the late 1980s, the Satanic Scare had lost its impetus following increasing skepticism about such allegations,{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=210\u2013211}} and a number of those who had been convicted of perpetrating Satanic ritual abuse saw their convictions overturned.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=213}}\nIn 1990, an agent of the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Ken Lanning]], revealed that he had investigated 300 allegations of Satanic ritual abuse and found no evidence for Satanism or ritualistic activity in any of them.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=213}} In the UK, the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] commissioned the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine to examine the allegations of SRA.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=249}} She noted that while approximately half did reveal evidence of genuine sexual abuse of children, none revealed any evidence that Satanist groups had been involved or that any murders had taken place.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|pp=13\u201314}} She noted three examples in which lone individuals engaged in child molestation had created a ritual performance to facilitate their sexual acts, with the intent of frightening their victims and justifying their actions, but that none of these child molestors were involved in wider Satanist groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=118|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=2016|2p=14}} By the 21st century, hysteria about Satanism has waned in most Western countries, although

===\n[[Image:GustaveDoreParadiseLostSatanProfile.jpg|right|thumb|Satan in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', as illustrated by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\n\nFrom the late seventeenth through to the nineteenth century, the character of Satan was increasingly rendered unimportant in Western philosophy and ignored in Christian theology, while in folklore he came to be seen as a foolish rather than a menacing figure.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=29}} The development of new values in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]\u2014in particular those of [[reason]] and [[individualism]]\u2014contributed to a shift in how many Europeans viewed Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=29}} In this context, a number of individuals took Satan out of the traditional Christian narrative and reread and reinterpreted him in light of their own time and their own interests, in turn generating new and different portraits of Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe shifting view of Satan owes many of its origins to [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), in which Satan features as the protagonist.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=28|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=70}} Milton was a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] and had never intended for his depiction of Satan to be a sympathetic one.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=28, 30}} However, in portraying Satan as a victim of his own pride who rebeled against God he humanized him and also allowed him to be interpreted as a rebel against tyranny.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} This was how Milton's Satan was understood by later readers like the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1pp=28, 30|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=69\u201370}} and the [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosopher [[William Godwin]], who reflected it in his 1793 book ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} ''Paradise Lost'' gained a wide readership in the eighteenth century, both in Britain and in continental Europe, where it had been translated into French by [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=70}} Milton thus became \"a central character in rewriting Satanism\" and would be viewed by many later religious Satanists as a \"''de facto'' Satanist\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe nineteenth century saw the emergence of what has been termed \"literary Satanism\" or \"romantic Satanism\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} According to Van Luijk, this cannot be seen as a \"coherent movement with a single voice, but rather as a ''post factum'' identified group of sometimes widely divergent authors among whom a similar theme is found\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}} For the literary Satanists, Satan was depicted as a benevolent and sometimes heroic figure,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=69}} with these more sympathetic portrayals proliferating in the art and poetry of many [[romanticism|romanticist]] and [[Decadent movement|decadent]] figures.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}} For these individuals, Satanism was not a religious belief or ritual activity, but rather a \"strategic use of a symbol and a character as part of artistic and political expression\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}}\n\nAmong the romanticist poets to adopt this view of Satan was the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who had been influenced by Milton.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=71\u201372}} In his poem ''[[Laon and Cythna]]'', Shelley praised the \"Serpent\", a reference to Satan, as a force for good in the universe.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=97\u201398}}\nAnother was Shelley's fellow British poet [[Lord Byron]], who included Satanic themes in his 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', which was a dramatization of the Biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} These more positive portrayals also developed in France; one example was the 1823 work ''[[Eloa]]'' by [[Alfred de Vigny]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=74\u201375}} Satan was also adopted by the French poet [[Victor Hugo]], who made the character's fall from Heaven a central aspect of his ''[[La Fin de Satan]]'', in which he outlined his own [[cosmogony]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=105\u2013107}}\nAlthough the likes of Shelley and Byron promoted a positive image of Satan in their work, there is no evidence that any of them performed religious rites to venerate him, and thus it is problematic to regard them as religious Satanists.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}}\n\nRadical left-wing political ideas had been spread by the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u201383 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789\u201399, and the figure of Satan, who was interpreted as having rebelled against the tyranny imposed by God, was an appealing one for many of the radical leftists of the period.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=77\u201379}} For them, Satan was \"a symbol for the struggle against tyranny, injustice, and oppression... a mythical figure of rebellion for an age of revolutions, a larger-than-life individual for an age of individualism, a free thinker in an age struggling for free thought\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}} The French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who was a staunch critic of Christianity, embraced Satan as a symbol of liberty in several of his writings.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=117\u2013119}} Another prominent 19th century anarchist, the Russian [[Mikhail Bakunin]], similarly described the figure of Satan as \"the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds\" in his book ''[[God and the State]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=119\u2013120}} These ideas likely inspired the American [[feminism|feminist]] activist [[Moses Harman]] to name his anarchist periodical ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=120}} The idea of this \"Leftist Satan\" declined during the twentieth century,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=120}} although it was used on occasion by authorities within the [[Soviet Union]], who portrayed Satan as a symbol of freedom and equality.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=66}}\n\n===Metal and rock music ===\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, several rock bands\u2014namely the American [[Coven (band)|Coven]] and the British [[Black Widow (band)|Black Widow]]\u2014employed the imagery of Satanism and witchcraft in their work.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=462\u2013463}} References to Satan also appeared in the work of those rock bands which were pioneering the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre in Britain during the 1970s.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=467}} [[Black Sabbath]] for instance made mention of Satan in their lyrics, although several of the band's members were practicing Christians and other lyrics affirmed the power of the Christian God over Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=467\u2013468}} In the 1980s, greater use of Satanic imagery was made by heavy metal bands like [[Slayer]], [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=468}} Bands active in the subgenre of [[death metal]]\u2014among them [[Deicide

come to be more closely associated with the subgenre of [[black metal]],{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=467}} in which it was foregrounded over the other themes that had been used in death metal.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=469}} A number of black metal performers incorporated self-injury into their act, framing this as a manifestation of Satanic devotion.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=469}} The

black metal act to more seriously adopt Satanism was [[Mercyful Fate]], whose vocalist, [[King Diamond]], joined the [[Church of Satan]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=471}} More often than not musicians associating themselves with black metal say they do not believe in legitimate Satanic ideology and often profess to being atheists, agnostics, or [[Religious skepticism|religious

Diamond, various black metal Satanists sought to distance themselves from LaVeyan Satanism, for instance by referring to their beliefs as \"devil worship\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} These individuals regarded Satan as a literal entity,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=479}} and in contrast to LaVey's views, they associated Satanism with criminality, suicide, and terror.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} For them, Christianity was regarded as a plague which required eradication.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=482}} Many of these individuals\u2014such as [[Varg Vikernes]] and [[Euronymous]]\u2014were Norwegian,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=479\u2013481}} and influenced by the strong anti-Christian views of this milieu, between 1992 and 1996 around fifty Norwegian churches were destroyed in arson attacks.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=481}} Within the black metal scene, a number of musicians later replaced Satanic themes with those deriving from [[Heathenry (new religious

exist in a single form, as there are multiple different religious Satanisms, each with different ideas about what being a Satanist entails.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=3}} The historian of

set of features that were common to the groups in this Satanic milieu: these were the positive use of the term \"Satanist\" as a designation, an emphasis on individualism, a genealogy that connects them to other Satanic groups, a transgressive and antinomian stance, a self-perception as an elite, and an embrace of values such as pride, self-reliance, and productive non-conformity.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=7&ndash;9}}\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen argued that the groups within the Satanic milieu could be divided into three groups: reactive Satanists, rationalist Satanists, and esoteric Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They saw reactive Satanism as encompassing \"popular Satanism, inverted Christianity, and symbolic rebellion\" and noted that it situates itself in opposition to society while at the same time conforming to society's perspective of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} Rationalist Satanism is used to describe the trend in the Satanic milieu which is [[atheism|atheistic]], [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]], [[materialism|materialistic]], and [[epicurean]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}} Esoteric Satanism instead applied to those forms which are [[theism|theistic]] and draw upon ideas from other forms of [[Western esotericism]],

In LaVey's view, the Satanist is a carnal, physical and pragmatic being\u2014and enjoyment of physical existence and an undiluted view of this-worldly truth are promoted as the core values of Satanism, propagating a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] worldview that sees mankind as animals existing in an [[amorality|amoral]] universe.\n\n[[Anton LaVey]] believed that the ideal Satanist should be individualistic and non-conformist, rejecting what he called the \"colorless existence\" that mainstream society sought to impose on those living within it.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2013|p=129}} He praised the human [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] for encouraging an individual's pride, self-respect, and self-realization and accordingly believed in satisfying the ego's desires.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=92}} He expressed the view that self-indulgence was a desirable trait,{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2011|p=198}} and that hate and aggression were not wrong or undesirable emotions but that they were necessary and advantageous for survival.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=94}} Accordingly, he praised the [[seven deadly sins]] as virtues which were beneficial for the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Schipper|2y=2010|2p=107}} The anthropologist Jean La Fontaine highlighted an article that appeared in ''The Black Flame'', in which one writer described \"a true Satanic society\" as one in which the population consists of \"free-spirited, well-armed, fully-conscious, self-disciplined individuals, who will neither need nor tolerate any external entity 'protecting' them or telling them what they can and cannot do.\"{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}}\n\nThe sociologist [[James R.

Right: Mankind, Religions & The End Times|Warman-Stallings|2012||p=35}} LaVey used Christianity as a negative mirror for his new faith,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=109}} with LaVeyan Satanism rejecting the basic principles and theology of Christian belief.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} It views Christianity &ndash; alongside other major religions, and philosophies such as [[humanism]] and [[liberal democracy]] &ndash; as a largely negative force on humanity; LaVeyan Satanists perceive Christianity as a lie which promotes idealism, self-denigration, herd behavior, and irrationality.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVeyans view their religion as a force for redressing this balance by encouraging materialism, egoism, stratification, carnality, atheism, and social Darwinism.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVey's Satanism was particularly critical of what it understands as Christianity's denial of humanity's animal nature, and it instead calls for the celebration of, and indulgence in, these desires.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} In doing so, it places an emphasis on the carnal rather than the spiritual.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=50}}\n\nPractitioners do not believe that [[Satan]] literally exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive [[archetype]] embracing the Hebrew root of the word \"Satan\" as \"adversary\", who represents [[pride]], [[wiktionary:carnal|carnality]], and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], and of a [[cosmos]] which Satanists perceive to be motivated by a \"[[Dark matter|dark]] evolutionary force of [[entropy]] that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for [[Self-preservation|survival]] and [[Reproduction|propagation]] inherent in all living things\".{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|Lewis|Petersen|2014||p=408}} [[The Devil]] is embraced as a symbol of defiance against the [[Abrahamic faiths]] which LaVey criticized for what he saw as the suppression of humanity's natural instincts. Moreover, Satan also serves as a metaphorical external projection of the individual's [[Egotheism|godhood]]. LaVey espoused the view that \"god\" is a creation of man, rather than man being a creation of \"god\". In his book, ''The Satanic Bible'', the Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true \"self\"\u2014a projection of his or her own personality\u2014not an external deity.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p=143}} Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism.{{sfn|Cavaglion|Sela-Shayovitz|2005|p=255}}\n\nLaVey explained that the gods worshiped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of [[narcissism]] that would accompany self-worship.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=44\u201345}} The current High Priest of the Church of Satan, [[Peter H.

They described this as an adolescent and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] means of rebeling in a Christian society, by which an individual transgresses cultural boundaries.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They believed that there were two tendencies within reactive Satanism: one, \"Satanic tourism\", was characterized by the brief period of time in which an individual was involved, while the other, the \"Satanic quest\", was typified by a longer and deeper involvement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}}\n\nThe researcher Gareth Medway noted that in 1995 he encountered a British woman who stated that she had been a practicing Satanist during her teenage years. She had grown up in a small mining village, and had come to believe that she had [[psychic]] powers. After hearing about Satanism in some library books, she declared herself a Satanist and formulated a belief that Satan was the true god. After her teenage years she abandoned Satanism and became a [[Chaos Magic|chaos magic]]kian.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=362\u2013365}}\n\nSome reactive Satanists are teenagers or mentally disturbed individuals who have engaged in criminal activities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=130}} During the 1980s and 1990s, several groups of teenagers were apprehended after sacrificing animals and vandalizing both churches and graveyards with Satanic imagery.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} Introvigne expressed the view that these incidents were \"more a product of juvenile deviance and marginalization than Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} In a few cases the crimes of these reactive Satanists have included murder. In 1970, two separate groups of teenagers\u2014one led by Stanley Baker in [[Big Sur]] and the other by Steven Hurd in [[Los Angeles]]\u2014killed a total of three people and consumed parts of their corpses in what they later claimed were sacrifices devoted to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}} In 1984, a U.S. group called the Knights of the Black Circle killed one of its own members, Gary Lauwers, over a disagreement regarding the group's illegal drug dealing; group members later related that Lauwers' death was a sacrifice to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}}\nThe American serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]] for instance claimed that he was a Satanist; during his 1980s killing spree he left an inverted pentagram at the scene of each murder and at his trial called out \"Hail Satan!\"{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=122}}\n\n===Demographics===\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen observed that from surveys of Satanists conducted in the early 21st century, it was clear that the Satanic milieu was \"heavily dominated by young males\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} They nevertheless noted that census data from New Zealand suggested that there may be a growing proportion of women becoming Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} In comprising more men than women, Satanism differs from most other religious communities, including most new religious communities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=158}} Most Satanists came to their religion through reading, either online or books, rather than through being introduced to it through personal contacts.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=146}} Many practitioners do not claim that they converted to Satanism, but rather state that they were born that way, and only later in life confirmed that Satanism served as an appropriate label for their pre-existing worldviews.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=142}} Others have stated that they had experiences with [[supernatural]] phenomena that led them to embracing Satanism.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}} A number reported feelings of anger at the hypocrisy of many practicing Christians and expressed the view that the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Gods of Christianity and other religions are unethical, citing issues such as the [[problem of evil]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=202\u2013204}} For some practitioners, Satanism gave a sense of hope, including for those who had been physically and sexually abused.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThe surveys revealed that atheistic Satanists appeared to be in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists appeared to grow over time.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=179\u2013180}} Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most popular afterlife views were [[reincarnation]] and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=181\u2013182}} The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=183}} although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=209}} A number described performing [[curse|cursing]], in most cases as a form of vigilante justice.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=210\u2013212}}\nMost practitioners conduct their religious observances in a solitary manner, and never or rarely meet fellow Satanists for rituals.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=151, 153}} Rather, the primary interaction that takes place between Satanists is online, on websites or via email.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=153}}\nFrom their survey data, Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen noted that the average length of involvement in the Satanic milieu was seven years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=157}} A Satanist's involvement in the movement tends to peak in the early twenties and drops off sharply in their thirties.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=159}} A small proportion retain their allegiance to the religion into their elder years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=160}} When asked about their political views, the largest proportion of Satanists identified as apolitical or non-aligned, while only a small percentage identified as conservative despite the conservative views of prominent Satanists like LaVey and Marilyn Manson.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=171}} A small minority of Satanists expressed support for the far right; conversely, over two-thirds expressed negative or extremely negative views about [[Nazism]] and [[neo-Nazism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}}\n\n===Legal recognition===\n\nIn 2004 it was claimed that Satanism was allowed in the [[British Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] of the [[British Armed Forces]], despite opposition from Christians.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] [[CNN]]</ref><ref>Carter, Helen.

Satanism, and the [[Devil in popular culture|concept of Satan]], has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression.\n\nAccusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the [[Inquisition]] attached to the [[Catholic Church]] alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Cathars]], performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent [[Early Modern period]], belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in [[Witch trials in the early modern period|mass trials of alleged witches]] across Europe and the North American colonies. Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active, and behind events such as [[Protestantism]] (and conversely, the [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation#Antichrist|Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist]]) and the [[French Revolution]] continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century. The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential [[Taxil hoax]] of France in the 1890s, which claimed that [[Freemasonry]] worshiped Satan, [[Lucifer]], and [[Baphomet]] in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom, amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites. In most of these cases, there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them.\n\nSince the 19th century, various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography. Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural [[deity]], viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a [[patriarch]]. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\">{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n \nContemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet.<ref name=\"crsi\">{{cite book |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |author= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= Introduction: Embracing Satan}}</ref> The Internet spreads awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for Satanist disputes.<ref name=\"crsi\" /> Satanism started to reach [[Central and Eastern Europe]] in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], and most noticeably in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], predominantly Roman Catholic countries.<ref name=\"crs8\">{{cite book |last= Alisauskiene |first= Milda |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |editor= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= The Peculiarities of Lithuanian Satanism}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title =Satanism stalks Poland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/778438.stm |work= BBC News |date= 2000-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|224px|''[[Wolfgang of Regensburg|Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'', by [[Michael Pacher]].]]\n\nIn their study of Satanism, the [[religious studies]] scholars Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal, [[James R.

in this context, it appears at several points in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=19}} For instance, in the [[Book of Samuel]], [[David]] is presented as the satan (\"adversary\") of the [[Philistines]], while in the [[Book of Numbers]] the term appears as a verb, when God sent an angel to ''satan'' (\"to oppose\") [[Balaam]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=51}} Prior to the composition of the [[New Testament]], the idea developed within Jewish communities that Satan was the name of an angel who had rebeled against God and had been cast out of Heaven along with his followers; this account would be incorporated into contemporary texts like the [[Book of Enoch]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=52}} This Satan was then featured in parts of the New Testament, where he was presented as a figure who tempted humans to commit [[sin]]; in the [[Book of Matthew]] and the [[Book of Luke]], he attempted to tempt [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the latter fasted in the wilderness.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=53}}\n\nThe word \"Satanism\" was adopted into English from the [[French language|French]] ''satanisme''.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} The terms \"Satanism\" and \"Satanist\" are first recorded as appearing in the English and French languages during the sixteenth century, when they were used by Christian groups to attack other, rival Christian groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=2}} In a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] tract of 1565, the author condemns the \"heresies, blasphemies, and sathanismes [sic]\" of the [[Protestantism|Protestants]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} In an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] work of 1559, [[Anabaptists]] and other Protestant sects are condemned as \"swarmes of Satanistes [sic]\".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} As used in this manner, the term \"Satanism\" was not used to claim that people literally worshipped Satan, but rather presented the view that through deviating from what the speaker or writer regarded as the true variant of Christianity, they were regarded as being essentially in league with the [[devil]]. {{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} During the nineteenth century, the term \"Satanism\" began to be used to describe those considered to lead a broadly immoral lifestyle,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} and it was only in the late nineteenth century that it came to be applied in English to individuals who were believed to consciously and deliberately venerate Satan.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} This latter meaning had appeared earlier in the [[Swedish language]]; the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Bishop [[Laurentius Paulinus Gothus]] had described devil-worshipping sorcerers as ''Sathanister'' in his ''Ethica Christiana'', produced between 1615 and 1630.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=44}}\n\n== Antagonism towards Satanism ==\n<!-- Groups or individuals alleged to have practiced Satanism before the appearance of modern Satanism in the 1960s -->\n\nHistorical and anthropological research suggests that nearly all societies have developed the idea of a sinister and anti-human force that can hide itself within society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=13\u201314}} This commonly involves a belief in [[witchcraft|witches]], a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in [[incest]], [[murder]], and [[cannibalism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=14}} Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}} For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}}\n\nAnother contributing factor to the idea of Satanism is the concept that there is an agent of misfortune and evil who operates on a cosmic scale,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=19}} something usually associated with a strong form of ethical dualism that divides the world clearly into forces of good and forces of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=20}} The earliest such entity known is [[Angra Mainyu]], a figure that appears in the Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=19|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=18}} This concept was also embraced by [[Judaism]] and early Christianity, and although it was soon marginalized within Jewish thought, it gained increasing importance within early Christian understandings of the cosmos.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=21}} While the early Christian idea of the Devil was not well developed, it gradually adapted and expanded through the creation of folklore, art, theological treatises, and morality tales, thus providing the character with a range of extra-Biblical associations.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n===Medieval and Early Modern Christendom===\n\n[[File:Praetorius Blocksberg.jpg|thumb|Title illustration of [[Johannes Praetorius (writer)]] ''Blocksbergs Verrichtung'' (1668) showing many traditional features of the medieval [[Witches' Sabbath]]]]\n{{See also|European witchcraft|Maleficium (sorcery)|Witch-cult hypothesis}}\n\nAs Christianity expanded throughout the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and Europe, it came into contact with a variety of other religions, which it regarded as \"[[paganism|pagan]]\". Christian theologians claimed that the gods and goddesses venerated by these \"pagans\" were not genuine divinities, but were actually demons.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=23}} However, they did not believe that \"pagans\" were deliberately devil-worshippers, instead claiming that they were simply misguided.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}} In Christian iconography, the Devil and demons were given the physical traits of figures from [[Classical mythology]] such as the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], [[faun]]s, and [[satyr]]s.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}}\n\nThose Christian groups regarded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were treated differently, with theologians arguing that they were deliberately worshipping the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=24\u201326}} This was accompanied by claims that such individuals engaged in incestuous sexual orgies, murdered infants, and committed acts of [[cannibalism]], all stock accusations that had previously been leveled at Christians themselves in the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=25\u201326}}\nThe first recorded example of such an accusation being made within [[Western Christianity]] took place in [[Toulouse]] in 1022, when two clerics were tried for allegedly venerating a demon.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=25}} Throughout the middle ages, this accusation would be applied to a wide range of Christian heretical groups, including the [[Paulicians]], [[Bogomils]], [[Cathars]], [[Waldensians]], and the [[Hussites]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=28}} The [[Knights Templar]] were accused of worshipping an [[Cult image|idol]] known as [[Baphomet]], with Lucifer having appeared at their meetings in the form of a cat.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=126}} As well as these Christian groups, these claims were also made about Europe's Jewish community.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=28\u201329}} In the thirteenth century, there were also references made to a group of \"Luciferians\" led by a woman named Lucardis which hoped to see Satan rule in Heaven. References to this group continued into the fourteenth century, although historians studying the allegations concur that these Luciferians were likely a fictitious invention.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=29\u201331}}\n\nWithin Christian thought, the idea developed that certain individuals could make [[Deal with the Devil|a pact with Satan]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=57}} This may have emerged after observing that pacts with gods and goddesses played a role in various pre-Christian belief systems, or that such pacts were also made as part of the Christian cult of saints.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=58}} Another possibility is that it derives from a misunderstanding of [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s condemnation of [[augury]] in his ''[[On the Christian Doctrine]]'', written in the late fourth century. Here, he stated that people who consulted augurs were entering \"''quasi pacts''\" (covenants) with demons.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=57\u201358}} The idea of the diabolical pact made with demons was popularized across Europe in the story of [[Faust]], likely based in part on the real life [[Johann Georg Faust]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=60\u201363}}\n\n[[File:CompendiumMaleficarumEngraving15.jpg|thumb|left|''The Obscene Kiss'', an illustration of witches kissing the Devil's anus from [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]]'s ''Compendium Maleficarum'' (1608).]]\n\nAs the late medieval gave way to the [[early modern period]], European Christendom experienced a schism between the established [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the breakaway [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movement. In the ensuing [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], both Catholics and Protestants accused each other of deliberately being in league with Satan.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=35}} It was in this context that the terms \"Satanist\" and \"Satanism\" emerged.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=2}}\n\nThe early modern period also saw fear of Satanists reach its \"historical apogee\" in the form of the [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}} This came about as the accusations which had been leveled at medieval heretics, among them that of devil-worship, were applied to the pre-existing idea of [[European witchcraft|the witch]], or practitioner of malevolent [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=133|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=37}} The idea of a conspiracy of Satanic witches was developed by educated elites, although the concept of malevolent witchcraft was a widespread part of popular belief and [[folklore|folkloric]] ideas about the [[night witch]], the [[wild hunt]], and the dance of the fairies were incorporated into it.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=38}} The earliest trials took place in Northern Italy and France, before spreading it out to other areas of Europe and to Britain's North American colonies, being carried out by the legal authorities in both Catholic and Protestant regions.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}}\nBetween 30,000 and 50,000 individuals were executed as accused Satanic witches.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}}\nMost historians agree that the majority of those persecuted in these witch trials were innocent of any involvement in Devil worship.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=70}} However, in their summary of the evidence for the trials, the historians Geoffrey Scarre and John Callow thought it \"without doubt\" that some of those accused in the trials had been guilty of employing magic in an attempt to harm their enemies, and were thus genuinely guilty of witchcraft.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=2}}\n\nIn seventeenth-century Sweden, a number of highway robbers and other outlaws living in the forests informed judges that they venerated Satan because he provided more practical assistance than God.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=44\u201345}}\nThe historian of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] regarded these practices as \"folkloric Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=44}}\n\n===18th to 20th century Christendom===\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, gentleman's social clubs became increasingly prominent in Britain and Ireland, among the most secretive of which were the [[Hellfire Clubs]], which were first reported in the 1720s.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1pp=58\u201359|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=66}} The most famous of these groups was the [[Order of the Knights of Saints Francis]], which was founded circa 1750 by the aristocrat [[Sir Francis Dashwood]] and which assembled first at his estate at [[West Wycombe]] and later in [[Medmenham Abbey]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=66\u201367}} A number of contemporary press sources portrayed these as gatherings of [[atheism|atheist]] [[Rake (character)|rakes]] where Christianity was mocked and toasts were made to the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=66}} Beyond these sensationalist accounts, which may not be accurate portrayals of actual events, little is known about the activities of the Hellfire Clubs.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=66}} Introvigne suggested that they may have engaged in a form of \"playful Satanism\" in which Satan was invoked \"to show a daring contempt for conventional morality\" by individuals who neither believed in his literal existence nor wanted to pay homage to him.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=60\u201361}}\n\n[[Image:SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png|thumb|right|Stanislas de Guaita drew the original goat pentagram, which first appeared in the book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' in 1897. This symbol would later become synonymous with [[Baphomet]], and is commonly referred to as the Sabbatic Goat.]]\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] of 1789 dealt a blow to the hegemony of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in parts of Europe, and soon a number of Catholic authors began making claims that it had been masterminded by a conspiratorial group of Satanists.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=71}} Among the first to do so was French Catholic priest [[Jean-Baptiste Fiard]], who publicly claimed that a wide range of individuals, from the [[Jacobins]] to [[tarot|tarot card readers]], were part of a Satanic conspiracy.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=71\u201373}} Fiard's ideas were furthered by [[Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier]], who devoted a lengthy book to this [[conspiracy theory]]; he claimed that Satanists had supernatural powers allowing them to curse people and to shapeshift into both cats and fleas.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=74\u201378}} Although most of his contemporaries regarded Berbiguier as mad,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=84\u201385}} his ideas gained credence among many occultists, including [[Stanislas de Guaita]], a [[Christian Cabala|Cabalist]] who used them for the basis of his book, ''The Temple of Satan''.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nIn the early 20th century, the British novelist [[Dennis Wheatley]] produced a range of influential novels in which his protagonists battled Satanic groups.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=266\u2013267}} At the same time, non-fiction authors like [[Montague Summers]] and [[Rollo Ahmed]] published books claiming that Satanic groups practicing black magic were still active across the world, although they provided no evidence that this was the case.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=141\u2013142}} During the 1950s, various British tabloid newspapers repeated such claims, largely basing their accounts on the allegations of one woman, Sarah Jackson, who claimed to have been a member of such a group.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=143\u2013149}} In 1973, the British Christian [[Doreen Irvine]] published ''From Witchcraft to Christ'', in which she claimed to have been a member of a Satanic group that gave her supernatural powers, such as the ability to [[levitation|levitate]], before she escaped and embraced Christianity.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=159\u2013161}}\nIn the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, various Christian preachers\u2014the most famous being [[Mike Warnke]] in his 1972 book ''The Satan-Seller''\u2014claimed that they had been members of Satanic groups who carried out sex rituals and animal sacrifices before discovering Christianity.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=164\u2013170}} According to Gareth Medway in his historical examination of Satanism, these stories were \"a series of inventions by insecure people and hack writers, each one based on a previous story, exaggerated a little more each time\".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=161}}\n\nOther publications made allegations of Satanism against historical figures. The 1970s saw the publication of the Romanian Protestant preacher [[Richard Wurmbrand]]'s book in which he argued\u2014without corroborating evidence\u2014that the socio-political theorist [[Karl Marx]] had been a Satanist.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1pp=262\u2013263|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=66}}\n\n===Satanic ritual abuse hysteria===\n{{main|Satanic ritual abuse}}\n\nAt the end of the twentieth century, a [[moral panic]] developed around claims regarding a Devil-worshipping cult that made use of sexual abuse, murder, and cannibalism in its rituals, with children being among its victims.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=13}} Initially, the alleged perpetrators of such crimes were labeled \"witches\", although the term \"Satanist\" was soon adopted as a favored alternative,{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=13}} and the phenomenon itself came to be called \"the Satanism Scare\".{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=15}} Promoters of the claims alleged that there was a conspiracy of organized Satanists who occupied prominent positions throughout society, from the police to politicians, and that they had been powerful enough to cover up their crimes.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=2016|1p=13|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=381}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Preceded by some significant but isolated episodes in the 1970s, a great Satanism scare exploded in the 1980s in the United States and Canada and was subsequently exported towards England, Australia, and other countries.

in how many Europeans viewed Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=29}} In this context, a number of individuals took Satan out of the traditional Christian narrative and reread and reinterpreted him in light of their own time and their own interests, in turn generating new and different portraits of Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe shifting view of Satan owes many of its origins to [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), in which Satan features as the protagonist.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=28|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=70}} Milton was a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] and had never intended for his depiction of Satan to be a sympathetic one.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=28, 30}} However, in portraying Satan as a victim of his own pride who rebeled against God he humanized him and also allowed him to be interpreted as a rebel against tyranny.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} This was how Milton's Satan was understood by later readers like the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1pp=28, 30|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=69\u201370}} and the [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosopher [[William Godwin]], who reflected it in his 1793 book ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} ''Paradise Lost'' gained a wide readership in the eighteenth century, both in Britain and in continental Europe, where it had been translated into French by [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=70}} Milton thus became \"a central character in rewriting Satanism\" and would be viewed by many later religious Satanists as a \"''de facto'' Satanist\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe nineteenth century saw the emergence of what has been termed \"literary Satanism\" or \"romantic Satanism\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} According to Van Luijk, this cannot be seen as a \"coherent movement with a single voice, but rather as a ''post factum'' identified group of sometimes widely divergent authors among whom a similar theme is found\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}} For the literary Satanists, Satan was depicted as a benevolent and sometimes heroic figure,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=69}} with these more sympathetic portrayals proliferating in the art and poetry of many [[romanticism|romanticist]] and [[Decadent movement|decadent]] figures.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}} For these individuals, Satanism was not a religious belief or ritual activity, but rather a \"strategic use of a symbol and a character as part of artistic and political expression\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}}\n\nAmong the romanticist poets to adopt this view of Satan was the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who had been influenced by Milton.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=71\u201372}} In his poem ''[[Laon and Cythna]]'', Shelley praised the \"Serpent\", a reference to Satan, as a force for good in the universe.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=97\u201398}}\nAnother was Shelley's fellow British poet [[Lord Byron]], who included Satanic themes in his 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', which was a dramatization of the Biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} These more positive portrayals also developed in France; one example was the 1823 work ''[[Eloa]]'' by [[Alfred de Vigny]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=74\u201375}} Satan was also adopted by the French poet [[Victor Hugo]], who made the character's fall from Heaven a central aspect of his ''[[La Fin de Satan]]'', in which he outlined his own [[cosmogony]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=105\u2013107}}\nAlthough the likes of Shelley and Byron promoted a positive image of Satan in their work, there is no evidence that any of them performed religious rites to venerate him, and thus it is problematic to regard them as religious Satanists.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}}\n\nRadical left-wing political ideas had been spread by the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u201383 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789\u201399, and the figure of Satan, who was interpreted as having rebelled against the tyranny imposed by God, was an appealing one for many of the radical leftists of the period.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=77\u201379}} For them, Satan was \"a symbol for the struggle against tyranny, injustice, and oppression... a mythical figure of rebellion for an age of revolutions, a larger-than-life individual for an age of individualism, a free thinker in an age struggling for free thought\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}} The French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who was a staunch critic of Christianity, embraced Satan as a symbol of liberty in several of his writings.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=117\u2013119}} Another prominent 19th century anarchist, the Russian [[Mikhail Bakunin]], similarly described the figure of Satan as \"the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds\" in his book ''[[God and the State]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=119\u2013120}} These ideas likely inspired the American [[feminism|feminist]] activist [[Moses Harman]] to name his anarchist periodical ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=120}} The idea of this \"Leftist Satan\" declined during the twentieth century,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=120}} although it was used on occasion by authorities within the [[Soviet Union]], who portrayed Satan as a symbol of freedom and equality.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=66}}\n\n===Metal and rock music ===\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, several rock bands\u2014namely the American [[Coven (band)|Coven]] and the British [[Black Widow (band)|Black Widow]]\u2014employed the imagery of Satanism and witchcraft in their work.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=462\u2013463}} References to Satan also appeared in the work of those rock bands which were pioneering the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre in Britain during the 1970s.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=467}} [[Black Sabbath]] for instance made mention of Satan in their lyrics, although several of the band's members were practicing Christians and other lyrics affirmed the power of the Christian God over Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=467\u2013468}} In the 1980s, greater use of Satanic imagery was made by heavy metal bands like [[Slayer]], [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=468}} Bands active in the subgenre of [[death metal]]\u2014among them [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Morbid Angel]], and [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]]\u2014also adopted Satanic imagery, combining it with other morbid and dark imagery, such as that of [[zombie]]s and [[serial killer]]s.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=468\u2013469}}\n\n[[File:Tuska 20130628 - King Diamond - 32.jpg|thumb|left|Heavy metal singer King Diamond is a member of the Church of Satan]]\n\nSatanism would come to be more closely associated with the subgenre of [[black metal]],{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=467}} in which it was foregrounded over the other themes that had been used in death metal.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=469}} A number of black metal performers incorporated self-injury into their act, framing this as a manifestation of Satanic devotion.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=469}} The first black metal band, [[Venom (band)|Venom]], proclaimed themselves to be Satanists, although this was more an act of provocation than an expression of genuine devotion to the Devil.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=470}} Satanic themes were also used by the black metal bands [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=472\u2013473}} However, the first black metal act to more seriously adopt Satanism was [[Mercyful Fate]], whose vocalist, [[King Diamond]], joined the [[Church of Satan]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=471}} More often than not musicians associating themselves with black metal say they do not believe in legitimate Satanic ideology and often profess to being atheists, agnostics, or [[Religious skepticism|religious skeptics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/death-to-false-satanism|title=Death to False Satanism {{!}} NOISEY|website=NOISEY|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to King Diamond, various black metal Satanists sought to distance themselves from LaVeyan Satanism, for instance by referring to their beliefs as \"devil worship\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} These individuals regarded Satan as a literal entity,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=479}} and in contrast to LaVey's views, they associated Satanism with criminality, suicide, and terror.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} For them, Christianity was regarded as a plague which required eradication.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=482}} Many of these individuals\u2014such as [[Varg Vikernes]] and [[Euronymous]]\u2014were Norwegian,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=479\u2013481}} and influenced by the strong anti-Christian views of this milieu, between 1992 and 1996 around fifty Norwegian churches were destroyed in arson attacks.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=481}} Within the black metal scene, a number of musicians later replaced Satanic themes with those deriving from [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], a form of [[modern Paganism]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=503\u2013504}}\n\n== Religious Satanism ==\n{{See also|Contemporary Religious Satanism}}\nReligious Satanism does not exist in a single form, as there are multiple different religious Satanisms, each with different ideas about what being a Satanist entails.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=3}} The historian of religion Ruben van Luijk used a \"working definition\" in which Satanism was regarded as \"the intentional, religiously motivated veneration of Satan\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}}\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen believed that it was not a single [[Social movement|movement]], but rather a [[Social environment|milieu]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=4}} They and others have nevertheless referred to it as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=3|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=517}} They believed that there was a [[family resemblance]] that united all of the varying groups in this milieu,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=7}} and that most of them were [[self religion]]s.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=4}} They argued that there were a set of features that were common to the groups in this Satanic milieu: these were the positive use of the term \"Satanist\" as a designation, an emphasis on individualism, a genealogy that connects them to other Satanic groups, a transgressive and antinomian stance, a self-perception as an elite, and an embrace of values such as pride, self-reliance, and productive non-conformity.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=7&ndash;9}}\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen argued that the groups within the Satanic milieu could be divided into three groups: reactive Satanists, rationalist Satanists, and esoteric Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They saw reactive Satanism as encompassing \"popular Satanism, inverted Christianity, and symbolic rebellion\" and noted that it situates itself in opposition to society while at the same time conforming to society's perspective of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} Rationalist Satanism is used to describe the trend in the Satanic milieu which is [[atheism|atheistic]], [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]], [[materialism|materialistic]], and [[epicurean]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}} Esoteric Satanism instead applied to those forms which are [[theism|theistic]] and draw upon ideas from other forms of [[Western esotericism]],

promoted a [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinian]] ideology.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=36}}\n\nThe use of the term \"Lucifer\" was also taken up by the French [[ceremonial magic]]ian [[Eliphas

romantics.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=37}} As he moved toward a more politically conservative outlook in later life, he retained the use of the term, but instead applied it as to what he believed was a morally neutral facet of the Absolute.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=37|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=107}} In his book ''[[Dogma and Ritual of High Magic]]'', published in two volumes between 1854 and 1856, Levi offered the symbol of [[Baphomet]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=105}} He claimed that this was a figure who had been worshipped by the Knights Templar.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=107}}\nAccording to Introvigne, this image gave \"the Satanists their most popular symbol ever\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=105}}\n\nLevi was not the only occultist who wanted to use the term \"Lucifer\" without adopting the term \"Satan\" in a similar way.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=37}} The early [[Theosophical Society]] held to the view that \"Lucifer\" was a force that aided humanity's awakening to its own spiritual nature.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=37\u201338}} In keeping with this view, the Society began production of a journal titled ''Lucifer''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=38}}\n\n\"Satan\" was also used within the esoteric system propounded by the Danish occultist [[Carl William Hansen]], who used the pen name \"Ben Kadosh\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=38}} Hansen was involved in a variety of esoteric groups, including [[Martinism]], [[Freemasonry]], and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], drawing on ideas from various groups to establish his own philosophy.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=38}} In one pamphlet, he provided a \"Luciferian\" interpretation of

Right: Mankind, Religions & The End Times|Warman-Stallings|2012||p=35}} LaVey used Christianity as a negative mirror for his new faith,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=109}} with LaVeyan Satanism rejecting the basic principles and theology of Christian belief.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} It views Christianity &ndash; alongside other major religions, and philosophies such as [[humanism]] and [[liberal democracy]] &ndash; as a largely negative force on humanity; LaVeyan Satanists perceive Christianity as a lie which promotes idealism, self-denigration, herd behavior, and irrationality.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVeyans view their religion as a force for redressing this balance by encouraging materialism, egoism, stratification, carnality, atheism, and social Darwinism.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVey's Satanism was particularly critical of what it understands as Christianity's denial of humanity's animal nature, and it instead calls for the celebration of, and indulgence in, these desires.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} In doing so, it places an emphasis on the carnal rather than the spiritual.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=50}}\n\nPractitioners do not believe that [[Satan]] literally exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive [[archetype]] embracing the Hebrew root of the word \"Satan\" as \"adversary\", who represents [[pride]], [[wiktionary:carnal|carnality]], and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], and of a [[cosmos]] which Satanists perceive to be motivated by a \"[[Dark matter|dark]] evolutionary force of [[entropy]] that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for [[Self-preservation|survival]] and [[Reproduction|propagation]] inherent in all living things\".{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|Lewis|Petersen|2014||p=408}} [[The Devil]] is embraced as a symbol of defiance against the [[Abrahamic faiths]] which LaVey criticized for what he saw as the suppression of humanity's natural instincts. Moreover, Satan also serves as a metaphorical external projection of the individual's [[Egotheism|godhood]]. LaVey espoused the view that \"god\" is a creation of man, rather than man being a creation of \"god\". In his book, ''The Satanic Bible'', the Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true \"self\"\u2014a projection of his or her own personality\u2014not an external deity.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p=143}} Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism.{{sfn|Cavaglion|Sela-Shayovitz|2005|p=255}}\n\nLaVey explained that the gods worshiped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of [[narcissism]] that would accompany self-worship.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=44\u201345}} The current High Priest of the Church of Satan, [[Peter H.

Luciferianism is often identified as an auxiliary creed or movement of Satanism, due to the common identification of Lucifer with Satan. Some Luciferians accept this identification and/or consider Lucifer as the \"light bearer\" and illuminated aspect of Satan, giving them the name of Satanists and the right to bear the title. Others reject it, giving the argument that Lucifer is a more positive and easy-going ideal than Satan.

They described this as an adolescent and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] means of rebeling in a Christian society, by which an individual transgresses cultural boundaries.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They believed that there were two tendencies within reactive Satanism: one, \"Satanic tourism\", was characterized by the brief period of time in which an individual was involved, while the other, the \"Satanic quest\", was typified by a longer and deeper involvement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}}\n\nThe researcher Gareth Medway noted that in 1995 he encountered a British woman who stated that she had been a practicing Satanist during her teenage years. She had grown up in a small mining village, and had come to believe that she had [[psychic]] powers. After hearing about Satanism in some library books, she declared herself a Satanist and formulated a belief that Satan was the true god. After her teenage years she abandoned Satanism and became a [[Chaos Magic|chaos magic]]kian.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=362\u2013365}}\n\nSome reactive Satanists are teenagers or mentally disturbed individuals who have engaged in criminal activities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=130}} During the 1980s and 1990s, several groups of teenagers were apprehended after sacrificing animals and vandalizing both churches and graveyards with Satanic imagery.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} Introvigne expressed the view that these incidents were \"more a product of juvenile deviance and marginalization than Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} In a few cases the crimes of these reactive Satanists have included murder. In 1970, two separate groups of teenagers\u2014one led by Stanley Baker in [[Big Sur]] and the other by Steven Hurd in [[Los Angeles]]\u2014killed a total of three people and consumed parts of their corpses in what they later claimed were sacrifices devoted to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}} In 1984, a U.S. group called the Knights of the Black Circle killed one of its own members, Gary Lauwers, over a disagreement regarding the group's illegal drug dealing; group members later related that Lauwers' death was a sacrifice to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}}\nThe American serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]] for instance claimed that he was a Satanist; during his 1980s killing spree he left an inverted pentagram at the scene of each murder and at his trial called out \"Hail Satan!\"{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=122}}\n\n===Demographics===\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen observed that from surveys of Satanists conducted in the early 21st century, it was clear that the Satanic milieu was \"heavily dominated by young males\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} They nevertheless noted that census data from New Zealand suggested that there may be a growing proportion of women becoming Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} In comprising more men than women, Satanism differs from most other religious communities, including most new religious communities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=158}} Most Satanists came to their religion through reading, either online or books, rather than through being introduced to it through personal contacts.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=146}} Many practitioners do not claim that they converted to Satanism, but rather state that they were born that way, and only later in life confirmed that Satanism served as an appropriate label for their pre-existing worldviews.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=142}} Others have stated that they had experiences with [[supernatural]] phenomena that led them to embracing Satanism.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}} A number reported feelings of anger at the hypocrisy of many practicing Christians and expressed the view that the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Gods of Christianity and other religions are unethical, citing issues such as the [[problem of evil]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=202\u2013204}} For some practitioners, Satanism gave a sense of hope, including for those who had been physically and sexually abused.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThe surveys revealed that atheistic Satanists appeared to be in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists appeared to grow over time.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=179\u2013180}} Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most popular afterlife views were [[reincarnation]] and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=181\u2013182}} The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=183}} although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=209}} A number described performing [[curse|cursing]], in most cases as a form of vigilante justice.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=210\u2013212}}\nMost practitioners conduct their religious observances in a solitary manner, and never or rarely meet fellow Satanists for rituals.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=151, 153}} Rather, the primary interaction that takes place between Satanists is online, on websites or via email.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=153}}\nFrom their survey data, Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen noted that the average length of involvement in the Satanic milieu was seven years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=157}} A Satanist's involvement in the movement tends to peak in the early twenties and drops off sharply in their thirties.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=159}} A small proportion retain their allegiance to the religion into their elder years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=160}} When asked about their political views, the largest proportion of Satanists identified as apolitical or non-aligned, while only a small percentage identified as conservative despite the conservative views of prominent Satanists like LaVey and Marilyn Manson.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=171}} A small minority of Satanists expressed support for the far right;
