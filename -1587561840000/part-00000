It reached [[Georgian Golden Age|its Golden Age]] of political and economic strength during the reign of King [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] and Queen [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]] from 11th to 13th centuries. Georgia became one of the pre-eminent nations of the [[Eastern Christianity|Christian]] [[Middle East|East]], her pan-[[Caucasus|Caucasian]] empire stretching, at its largest extent, from [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[North Caucasus]] to the northern portion of [[Iran]] and [[Anatolia]], while also maintaining religious possessions abroad, such as the [[Monastery of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Iviron|Monastery of Iviron]] in [[Greece]]. It was the principal historical precursor of present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n \nLasting for several centuries, the kingdom fell to the [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century, but managed to re-assert sovereignty by the 1340s. The following decades were marked by the [[Black Death]], as well as numerous invasions under the leadership of [[Timur]], who devastated the country's economy, population, and urban centers. The Kingdom's geopolitical situation further worsened after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and then [[Empire of Trebizond]]. As a result of these processes, by the end of the 15th century Georgia turned into a fractured entity. Renewed [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|incursions]] by Timur from 1386, and the later invasions by the [[Turkmen incursions into Georgia|Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu]] led to the final collapse of the kingdom into anarchy by 1466 and the mutual recognition of its constituent kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]], [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] and [[Kingdom of Imereti|Imereti]] as independent states between 1490 and 1493 \u2013 each led by a rival branch of the [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] dynasty, and into five semi-independent principalities \u2013 [[Odishi]], [[Principality of Guria|Guria]], [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]], [[Principality of Svaneti|Svaneti]], and [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] \u2013 dominated by their own feudal clans.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Arab rule in Georgia|Bagratid Iberia}}Located on the crossroads of protracted [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars|Roman\u2013Persian wars]], the early Georgian kingdoms disintegrated into various feudal regions by the early [[Middle Ages]]. This made it easy for the remaining Georgian realms to fall prey to the [[early Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century.\n\nIn struggle against the [[Arab rule in Georgia|Arab occupation]], Iberian princes of [[Bagrationi dynasty]] came to rule over [[Tao-Klarjeti (historical region)|Tao-Klarjeti]], the former southern provinces of Iberia, and established [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Kouropalatate of Iberia]] as a nominal vassal of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Bagrationi's continued fighting for the central Georgian land, known as [[Kartli]], contested also by the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]], the Arab [[Emirate of Tbilisi|emirs of Tbilisi]] and even by [[First Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakhetian]] and [[Bagratuni dynasty|Armenian Bagratid]] rulers of [[Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget|Tashir-Dzoraget]]. The restoration of the [[List of monarchs of Georgia#Kings of Iberia|Iberian kingship]] begins in 888, however Bagrationi dynasty failed to maintain the integrity of their kingdom, which was actually divided between the three branches of the family with the main branch retaining in [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] and another controlling [[Klarjeti]].\n\nAn [[Marwan ibn Muhammad's invasion of Georgia|Arab incursion]] into western Georgia was repelled by Abkhazians jointly with [[Lazica|Lazic]] and Iberian allies in 736. The successful defense against the Arabs, and the increasingly expansionist tendencies of the kingdom to the east and the struggle against Byzantium, fighting for the hegemony within the Georgian territories speed up the process of unification of Georgian states into a single feudal monarchy. In 9th century western Georgian Church broke away from [[Constantinople]] and recognized the authority of the [[List of heads of the Georgian Orthodox Church#Catholicoi of Kartli (467\u20131010)|Catholicate of Mtskheta]]; language of the church in Abkhazia shifted from [[Greek language|Greek]] to [[Georgian language|Georgian]], as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared.<ref>{{harvnb|Rapp|2007|p=145}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Unification of the Georgian State ===\n[[File:Caucasus 1000 map de.png|left|thumb|Map of Caucasus region at 1000 AD before death of [[David III of Tao|David III]] of Tao.]]\nAt the end of the 10th century [[David III of Tao|David III]] of Tao invaded the [[Duchy of Kartli|Kartli]] and gave it to his foster-son [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]] and installed his father [[Gurgen of Iberia|Gurgen]] as his [[regent]], who was also crowned as \"King of the Iberians\" in 994. Through his mother [[Gurandukht of Abkhazia|Gurandukht]], sister of the childless Abkhazian king [[Theodosius III of Abkhazia|Theodosius III]] ({{Circa}} 975-978), Bagrat was a potential heir to the [[Divan of the Abkhazian Kings|realm of Abkhazia]].\n\n[[Kingdom of Abkhazia]] was engulfed into complete chaos and feudal warfare under the rule of Bagrat's uncle Theodosius the Blind, a weak and inauspicious king. In 978, the former duke of Kartli, [[Ivane Marushisdze]], aided by David III, forced Theodosius to abdicate the throne in favour of his nephew Bagrat. The latter proceeded to [[Kutaisi]] to be crowned King of the Abkhazia. Bagrat's descent from both Bagratid and Abkhazian dynasties made him an acceptable choice for the nobles of the realm who were growing weary of internecine quarrels.  [[File:Bediacup.jpg|thumb|220x220px|The [[Bedia Chalice]] donated by Bagrat to the [[Bedia Cathedral|Bedia Monastery]] is an important piece of Georgian metal art. c. 999 AD|alt=]]In 1008, Gurgen died, and Bagrat succeeded him as \"King of the Iberians\", thus becoming the first King of a [[List of monarchs of Georgia#Kings of unified Georgia (1008\u20131490)|unified realm]] of Abkhazia and Iberia. After he had secured his patrimony, Bagrat proceeded to press a claim to the easternmost Georgian kingdom of [[First Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti-Hereti]] and annexed it in or around 1010, after two years of fighting and aggressive diplomacy. Anxious to create more stable and centralized monarchy, Bagrat eliminated or at least diminished the autonomy of the dynastic princes. In his eyes, the most possible internal danger came from the [[Klarjeti]] line of the Bagrationi. To secure the succession to his son, [[George I of Georgia|George I]], Bagrat lured [[Sumbat III of Klarjeti|his cousins]], on pretext of a reconciliatory meeting and threw them in prison in 1011. Their possessions passed to Bagrat and his progeny. Their children \u2013 Bagrat, son of Sumbat, and Demetre, son of Gurgen \u2013 fled to [[Constantinople]] from where they [[Byzantine\u2013Georgian wars#Demetrius of Klarjeti|would try]] to retrieve patrimonial lands with the Byzantine aid, for the last time in 1032, but to no avail.<ref name=\"Toumanoff2\">[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]] (1967). ''Studies in Christian Caucasian History'', p. 498. [[Georgetown University Press]].</ref>\n\nBagrat's reign, a period of uttermost importance in the history of Georgia, brought about the final victory of the Georgian Bagratids in the centuries-long power struggles. Bagrat's foreign policy was generally peaceful and the king successfully manoeuvred to avoid the conflicts with both the Byzantine and Muslim neighbours even though David's domains of [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] remained in the Byzantine and [[Tbilisi]] in the [[Emirate of Tbilisi|Arab hands]].\n\n=== War and peace with Byzantium ===\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Georgian wars}}[[File:Map_Byzantine_Empire_1045.svg|thumb|220x220px|Kingdom of Georgia in 1045&nbsp;AD|alt=|left]]The major political and military event during [[George I of Georgia|George I]]\u2019s reign, a war against the [[Byzantine Empire]], had its roots back to the 990s, when the Georgian prince [[David III of Tao]], following his abortive rebellion against Emperor [[Basil II]], had to agree to cede his extensive possessions in [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] to the emperor on his death. All the efforts by David\u2019s stepson and George\u2019s father, [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]], to prevent these territories from being annexed to the empire went in vain. Young and ambitious, George [[David III of Tao#Wars of the Kuropalates\u2019 succession|launched a campaign]] to restore the Curopalates\u2019 succession to Georgia and [[Battle of Shirimni|occupied Tao]] in 1015\u20131016. Byzantines were at that time involved in a relentless war with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgar Empire]], limiting their actions to the west. But as soon as [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|Bulgaria was conquered]], Basil II led his army against Georgia in 1021. An exhausting war lasted for two years, and ended in a [[Battle of Svindax|decisive Byzantine victory]], forcing George to agree to a peace treaty, in which George had not only to abandon his claims to Tao, but to surrender several of his southwestern possessions, later reorganized into [[Iberia (theme)|theme of Iberia]], to Basil and to give his three-year-old son, [[Bagrat IV of Georgia|Bagrat IV]], as hostage.[[File:Svetitskhoveli_Cathedral_in_Georgia,_Europe.jpg|thumb|The construction of [[Svetitskhoveli Cathedral]] in [[Mtskheta]], now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]], was initiated in the 1020s by George I.]]The young child Bagrat IV spent the next three years in the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]] and was released in 1025. After George I's death in 1027, Bagrat, aged eight, succeeded to the throne. By the time Bagrat IV became king, the Bagratids\u2019 drive to complete the unification of all Georgian lands had gained irreversible momentum. The kings of Georgia sat at [[Kutaisi]] in western Georgia from which they ran all of what had been the Kingdom of Abkhazia and a greater portion of Iberia; [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] had been lost to the Byzantines while a [[Muslim]] emir [[Emirate of Tbilisi|remained in Tbilisi]] and the kings of [[Kingdom of Kakheti-Hereti|Kakheti and Hereti]] obstinately defended their autonomy in easternmost Georgia. Furthermore, the loyalty of great nobles to the Georgian crown was far from stable. During Bagrat's minority, the [[Liparit IV, Duke of Kldekari|regency]] had advanced the positions of the high nobility whose influence he subsequently [[Battle of Sasireti|tried to limit]] when he assumed full ruling powers. Simultaneously, the Georgian crown was confronted with two formidable external foes: the Byzantine Empire and the resurgent [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]].\n\n=== Great Turkish Invasion ===\n{{Main|Great Turkish Invasion}}The second half of the 11th century was marked by the strategically significant invasion of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who by the end of the 1040s had succeeded in building a vast empire including most of [[Central Asia]] and [[Iran|Persia]]. The Seljuk threat prompted the Georgian and Byzantine governments to seek a closer cooperation. To secure the alliance, Bagrat's daughter [[Maria of Alania|Maria]] married, at some point between 1066 and 1071, to the Byzantine co-emperor [[Michael VII Doukas|Michael VII Ducas]].\n\nThe Seljuqs made their first appearances in Georgia in the 1060s, when the sultan [[Alp Arslan]] laid waste to the south-western provinces of the Georgian kingdom and reduced [[Kakheti]]. These intruders were part of the same wave of the Turkish movement which inflicted a crushing defeat on the Byzantine army at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] in 1071. Although the Georgians were able to recover from Alp Arslan's invasion and even securing the [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] ([[Iberia (theme)|theme of Iberia]]), by the help of Byzantine governor of Georgian origin, [[Gregory Pakourianos]]. On this occasion, [[George II of Georgia|George II]] was bestowed with the Byzantine title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', granted the fortress of [[Kars]] and put in charge of the Imperial Eastern limits.\n\nThis did not help to stem the Seljuk advance, however. The Byzantine withdrawal from Anatolia brought Georgia in more direct contact with the Seljuqs. In 1073 Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan devastated [[Kartli]]. George II [[Battle of Partskhisi|successfully repelled an invasion]] once again. In 1076, the Seljuk sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik Shah I]] surged into Georgia and reduced many settlements to ruins. Harassed by the massive Turkic influx, known in Georgian history as the [[Great Turkish Invasion]], from 1079/80 onward, George was pressured into submitting to Malik-Shah to ensure a precious degree of peace at the price of an annual [[tribute]]. George's acceptance of the Seljuq suzerainty did not bring a real peace for Georgia. The Turks continued their seasonal movement into the Georgian territory to make use of the rich herbage of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura valley]] and the Seljuq garrisons occupied the key fortresses in Georgia's south. These inroads and settlements had a ruinous effect on Georgia's economic and political order. The contemporary Georgian chronicler laments that:{{cquote|''In those times there was neither sowing nor harvest. The land was ruined and turned into forest; in place of men beasts and animals of the field made their dwelling there. Insufferable oppression fell on all the inhabitants of the land; it was unparalleled and far worse than all ravages heard of or experienced.''\n}}\n\n=== Georgian Reconquista ===\n==== David IV ====\n[[File:King David Aghmashenebeli.jpg|thumb|[[David IV of Georgia]], a fresco from the [[Shio-Mgvime monastery]]|left|246x246px]][[File:David IV map de.png|thumb|Expansion of Kingdom of Georgia under [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]]'s reign.]]Watching his kingdom slip into chaos, [[George II of Georgia|George II]] ceded the crown to his 16-year-old son [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] in 1089. King David IV proved to be a capable statesman and military commander. As he came of age under the guidance of his court minister, [[George of Chqondidi]], David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized the power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1089\u20131100, he organized small detachments to harass and destroy isolated Seljuk troops and began the resettlement of desolate regions. By 1099 David IV's power was considerable enough that he was able to refuse paying [[tribute]] to Seljuqs.\n\nIn 1103 a major ecclesiastical congress known as the [[Council of Ruisi-Urbnisi|Ruis-Urbnisi Synod]] was held. Next year, David's supporters in the eastern Georgian province of [[Kakheti]] captured the local king [[Aghsartan II of Kakheti|Aghsartan II]] ({{Circa}}1102\u20131104), a loyal tributary of the Seljuk [[Sultan]], and reunited the area with the rest of Georgia. Following the annexation of Kakheti, in 1105, David routed a Seljuk punitive force at the [[Battle of Ertsukhi]], leading to momentum that helped him to secure the key fortresses of [[Samshvilde]], [[Rustavi]], [[Ki\u015f, Shaki|Gishi]], and [[Lori Fortress|Lori]] between 1110 and 1118.\n\nTo strengthen his army, King David launched a major military reform in 1118\u20131120 and [[Kipchaks in Georgia|resettled]] several thousand [[Kipchaks]] from the northern steppes to frontier districts of Georgia. In return, the Kipchaks provided one soldier per family, allowing King David to establish a standing army in addition to his royal troops (known as [[Monaspa]]). The new army provided the king with a much-needed force to fight both external threats and internal discontent of powerful lords. The Georgian-Kipchak alliance was facilitated by [[Family of David IV of Georgia|David's earlier marriage]] to the [[Khan (title)|Khan]]'s daughter.\n\nStarting in 1120, King David began a more aggressive policy of expansion. He entered the neighbouring [[Shirvan]] and took the town of [[Qabala District|Qabala]]. In the winter of 1120\u20131121 the Georgian troops successfully attacked the Seljuk settlements on the eastern and southwestern approaches to the [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasus]]. Muslim powers became increasingly concerned about the rapid rise of a Christian state in southern Caucasia. In 1121, [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq|Sultan Mahmud b. Muhammad]] ({{Circa}} 1118\u20131131) declared a [[Religious war|holy war]] on Georgia. However, 12 August 1121, King David routed the enemy army on the fields of [[Battle of Didgori|Didgori]], with fleeing Seljuq Turks being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. A huge amount of booty and prisoners were captured by David's army, which had also [[Siege of Tbilisi (1122)|secured Tbilisi]], the last Muslim enclave remaining from the Arab occupation, in 1122 and moved the Georgian capital there and inaugurated [[Georgian Golden Age|Georgia's Golden Age]].<ref name=\"javaxisvili\">{{in lang|ka}} [[Ivane Javakhishvili|Javakhishvili, Ivane]] (1982), ''k'art'veli eris istoria'' (The History of the Georgian Nation), vol. 2, pp. 184-187.

In 1123, David's army liberated [[Dmanisi]], the last Seljuk stronghold in southern Georgia. In 1124, David finally conquered [[Shirvan]] and took the [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenian]] city of [[Ani]] from the Muslim [[emir]]s, thus expanding the borders of his kingdom to the [[Aras (river)|Araxes]] basin. Armenians met him as a liberator providing some auxiliary force for his army. It was when the important component of \"''Sword of the [[Messiah]]''\" appeared in the title of David the Builder.\n\nDavid IV founded the [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati Academy]], which became an important center of scholarship in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] world of that time. Due to the extensive work carried out by the Gelati Academy, people of the time called it \"a new [[Classical Greece|Hellas]]\" and \"a second [[Mount Athos|Athos]]\".<ref>Chatzidakis, Nano. ''Byzantine Mosaics, Volume 7.'' [[Athens]], [[Greece]]: Ekdotike Athenon, 1994, p.22</ref> David also played a personal role in reviving Georgian religious hymnography, composing the ''Hymns of Repentance'', a sequence of eight free-verse psalms. In this emotional repentance of his sins, David sees himself as reincarnating the Biblical [[David]], with a similar relationship to God and to his people. His hymns also share the idealistic zeal of the contemporaneous European crusaders to whom David was a natural ally in his struggle against the Seljuks.<ref>[[Donald Rayfield]], \"Davit II\", in: Robert B.

Although his reign saw a disruptive family conflict related to royal succession, Georgia remained a centralized power with a strong military. In 1139, he raided the city of [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]] in [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] and brought the iron gate of the defeated city to Georgia and donated it to [[Gelati Monastery]] at [[Kutaisi]], western Georgia. Despite this brilliant victory, Demetrius could hold Ganja only for a few years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rayfield|first1=Donald|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|date=2013|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1780230702|url=|page=100|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1442241466|page=259|edition=2}}</ref> A talented poet, Demetrius also continued his father's contributions to Georgia's religious [[polyphony]]. The most famous of his hymns is [[Shen Khar Venakhi|Thou Art a Vineyard]].\n\nDemetrius was succeeded by his son [[George III of Georgia|George III]] in 1156, beginning a stage of more offensive foreign policy. The same year he ascended to the throne, George launched a successful campaign against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] sultanate of [[Shah-Armens|Ahlat]]. He freed the important Armenian town of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] from [[Eldiguzids|Eldiguzid]] vassalage and was thus welcomed as a liberator in the area. Eldiguz formed a coalition with other Seljuqids in the beginning of the 1160s to fight against the Georgians, and in 1163. the [[Shams al-Din Eldiguz's invasion of Georgia|allies inflicted a defeat]] on king [[George III of Georgia]]. The Seljuqid rulers were jubilant, and they prepared for a new campaign. However, this time they were forestalled by George III, who marched into [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] at the beginning of 1166, occupied a region extending to faraway cities as Nakhchivan and Beylagan, devastated the land and returned with prisoners and booty. There seemed to be no end to the war between George III and atabeg Eldiguz. But the belligerents were exhausted to such an extent that Eldiguz proposed an [[armistice]]. George had no alternative but to make concessions. Eldiguz restored Ani to its former rulers, the Shaddadids. In 1167, George marched to defend his vassal Shah [[Akhsitan I|Akhsitan]] of [[Shirvan]] against the [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus'|Rus' and Kipchak assaults]] and [[Siege of Derbent|strengthened]] the Georgian dominance in the area. George gave his daughter Rusudan, in marriage, to [[Manuel Komnenos (son of Andronikos I)|Manuel Komnenos]], the son of Emperor [[Andronikos I Komnenos]]. In 1173, Atabeg Eldiguz began another campaign against Georgia but he was defeated. Atabeg's troops retreated and Eldiguz died in 1174 in Nakhchivan. In 1177, the nobles [[House of Orbeli#Rise of Orbeli|rose in rebellion]] but were suppressed. The following year, King George III ceded the throne to his daughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]], but remained [[Coregency|coregent]] until his death in 1184.\n\n===Golden age===\n{{Main|Georgian Golden Age}}\n[[File:Caucasus 1213 AD map en.svg|thumb|263x263px|Kingdom of Georgia under [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]]'s reign.]]\nThe unified monarchy maintained its precarious independence [[Byzantine\u2013Georgian wars|from the Byzantine]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] empires throughout the 11th century, and flourished under [[David IV of Georgia|David IV the Builder]] ({{Circa}} 1089\u20131125), who [[Georgian\u2013Seljuk wars|repelled the Seljuk attacks]] and essentially completed the unification of Georgia with the [[Siege of Tbilisi (1122)|re-conquest of Tbilisi]] in 1122.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eastmond |first=Antony |date=2010 |title=Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KPdSQU-Bx4C |location=University Park, Pennsylvania, USA |publisher=Penn State Press |page=71 |isbn=978-0271043913}}</ref> In spite of repeated incidents of dynastic strife, the kingdom continued to prosper during the reigns of [[Demetrius I of Georgia|Demetrios I]] ({{Circa}}1125\u20131156), [[George III of Georgia|George III]] ({{Circa}}1156\u20131184), and especially, his daughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] ({{Circa}}1184\u20131213).\n\nWith the [[Decline of the Byzantine Empire|decline]] of Byzantine power and the dissolution of the [[Seljuk Empire|Great Seljuk Empire]], Georgia became one of the pre-eminent nations of the region, stretching, at its largest extent, from present-day [[Southern Russia]] to [[Iran|Northern Iran]], and westwards into [[Anatolia]]. The Kingdom of Georgia brought about the Georgian Golden Age, which describes a historical period in the [[High Middle Ages]], spanning from roughly the late 11th to 13th centuries, when the kingdom reached the zenith of its power and development. The period saw the flourishing of medieval Georgian architecture, painting and poetry, which was frequently expressed in the development of ecclesiastic art, as well as the creation of first major works of secular literature.

Exploiting her success in this battle, between 1203-1205 Georgians seized the town of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=150}}.</ref> and entered [[Shah-Armens|Akhlatshah]] possessions twice and subdued the emirs of [[Kars]], Akhlatshahs, [[Saltukids|Erzurum]] and [[House of Meng\u00fcjek|Erzincan]].\n\nIn 1206 the Georgian army, under the command of David Soslan, captured Kars (vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum) and other fortresses and strongholds along the [[Aras (river)|Araxes]]. This campaign was evidently started because the ruler of Erzerum refused to submit to Georgia. The emir of Kars requested aid from the Akhlatshahs, but the latter was unable to respond, it was taken over by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] In 1207. By 1209 Georgia challenged Ayyubid rule in [[Eastern Anatolia Region|eastern Anatolia]]. Georgian army besieged Akhlat. In response Ayyubid [[Sultan]] [[Al-Adil I|al-Adil]] assembled and personally led large Muslim army that included the ''[[emir]]s'' of [[Homs]], [[Hama]] and [[Baalbek]] as well as contingents from other Ayyubid principalities to support [[Al-Awhad Ayyub|al-Awhad]]. During the siege, Georgian general [[Mkhargrdzeli|Ivane Mkhargrdzeli]] accidentally fell into the hands of the al-Awhad on the outskirts of Akhlat. the latter demanded for his release a thirty-year truce. The Georgians had to lift the siege and conclude peace with the sultan.

Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. He put down the revolts in neighbouring [[Muslims|Muslim]] vassal states in the 1210s and began preparations for a large-scale campaign against [[Jerusalem]] to support the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] in 1220. However, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] approach to the Georgian borders made the Crusade plan unrealistic, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|two successive battles]], in 1221\u20131222, most notably the [[Battle of Khunan]]. [[File:Georgian Cavalry.jpg|thumb|245x245px|Georgian Illumination from the Djruchi II Four Gospels, 12-13th Centuries. The miniature depicting ''\"Georgian knights\"''.|alt=]]Georgians suffered heavy losses in this war and the King George IV, himself was severely wounded. The Kingdom of Georgia itself was torn by internal dissent and was unprepared for such an ordeal. The struggle between the nobility and the crown increased. In 1222, King George appointed his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Rusudan]] as a [[Coregency|co-regent]] and died later that year. Queen Rusudan ({{Circa}} 1223\u20131245) proved a less capable ruler, and domestic discord intensified on the eve of foreign invasion.\nThis offensive, which would prove the ruin of Georgia, was preceded by the devastating conflict with Khwarazm ruler [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the son of the last ruler of [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazm]], who was defeated by the Mongols and now led his Khwaras mian army to Caucasus. The Georgians suffered bitter defeat at the [[Battle of Garni]], and the royal court with Queen Rusudan moved to [[Kutaisi]], when the Georgian capital [[Tbilisi]] was besieged by the Khwarezmians. The victorious Khwarezmid soldiers sacked Tbilisi and [[Hundred Thousand Martyrs of Tbilisi|massacred]] its Christian population and  terminated Georgia's \"Golden Age\". Jalal al-Din continued devastating Georgian regions until 1230, when the Mongols finally defeated him.\n\nIn 1235\u20131236, Mongol forces, unlike their first raid in 1221, appeared with the sole purpose of conquest and occupation and easily overran the already devastated Kingdom. Queen Rusudan fled to the security of western Georgia, while the nobles secluded themselves in their fortresses. By 1240 all the country was under the Mongol yoke. Forced to accept the sovereignty of the [[List of Mongol rulers|Mongol Khan]] in 1242, Rusudan had to pay an annual tribute of 50,000 gold pieces and support the Mongols with a Georgian army.\n\nFearing that her nephew [[David VII of Georgia]] would aspire to the throne, Rusudan held him prisoner at the court of her son-in-law, the sultan [[Kaykhusraw II]], and sent her son [[David VI of Georgia]] to the Mongol court to get his official recognition as heir apparent. She died in 1245, still waiting for her son to return.\n\n==== Mongol yoke ====\n[[File:Caucasus 1245 AD map de.png|thumb|Map of Kingdom of Georgia during [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol invasions]], 1245 AD.]]\nThe Mongols created the \"[[Vilayet]] of [[Georgia (country)#Etymology|Gurjistan]]\", which included Georgia and the whole [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]], where they ruled indirectly, through the Georgian monarch, the latter to be confirmed by the [[Khagan|Great Khan]] upon his/her ascension. Following the death of Queen Rusudan in 1245, an [[interregnum]] began during which the Mongols divided the Caucasus into eight [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]].\n\nExploiting the complicated issue of succession, the Mongols had the Georgian nobles divided into two rival parties, each of which advocated their own candidate to the crown. These were [[David VII of Georgia|David VII \"Ulu\"]], an illegitimate son of George IV, and his cousin [[David VI of Georgia|David VI \"Narin\"]], son of Rusudan. After a [[Tsotne Dadiani#Kokhtastavi conspiracy|failed plot]] against the Mongol rule in Georgia (1245), [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]] made, in 1247, both pretenders co-kings, in eastern and western parts of the kingdom respectively, they also carved out the region of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] and placed it under the direct control of the [[Ilkhanate]]. The system of tumens was abolished, but the Mongols closely watched the Georgian administration in order to secure a steady flow of taxes and tributes from the subject peoples, who were also pressed into the Mongol armies. Georgians attended all major campaigns of the [[Ilkhanate]] and aristocrats' sons served in [[kheshig]].<ref>C.P.Atwood- Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.197</ref>\n\nThe period between 1259 and 1330 was marked by the struggle of the Georgians against the Mongol Ilkhanate for full independence. The first anti-Mongol uprising started in 1259 under the leadership of [[David VI of Georgia|King David Narin]] who in fact waged his war for almost thirty years. The Anti-Mongol strife went on under the Kings [[Demetrius II of Georgia|Demetrius II]] ({{Circa}} 1270\u20131289) and [[David VIII of Georgia|David VIII]] ({{Circa}} 1293\u20131311).\n\n==== George V the Brilliant ====\n[[File:Caucasus 1311 AD map de.png|thumb|[[Kingdom of Imereti|Western]] and Eastern Georgia around 1311 AD.|alt=|left]]Demetrius was executed by the Mongols in 1289, and the little prince [[George V of Georgia|George]] was carried to [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] to be reared at the court of his maternal grandfather, [[Beka I Jaqeli]]. In 1299, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] [[Ghazan]] installed him as a rival ruler to George's elder brother, the rebellious King [[David VIII of Georgia|David VIII]]. However, George's authority did not extend beyond the Mongol-protected capital [[Tbilisi]], so George was referred to during this period as \"The Shadow King of Tbilisi\". In 1302, he was replaced by his brother, [[Vakhtang III of Georgia|Vakhtang III]]. After the death of both his elder brothers \u2013 David and Vakhtang \u2013 George became a regent for David's son, [[George VI of Georgia|George VI]], who died underage in 1313, allowing George V to be crowned king for a second time. Having initially pledged his loyalty to the Il-khan [[\u00d6ljait\u00fc]], he began a program of reuniting the Georgian lands. In 1315, he led the Georgian [[auxiliaries]] to suppress an anti-Mongol revolt in [[Asia Minor]], an expedition that would prove to be the last in which the Georgians fought in the Mongol ranks. In 1320, he drove the marauding [[Alans]] out of the town [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] and forced them back to the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. [[File:Tiflis - Angelino Dulcert - 1339.jpg|thumb|217x217px|Detail from the [[Nautical chart]] by [[Angelino Dulcert]], depicting Georgian Black Sea coast and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]], 1339|alt=]]He pursued a shrewd and flexible policy aimed at throwing off the Mongol yoke and restoring the Georgian kingdom. He established close relations with the Mongol khans and succeeded in acquiring authority to personally collect taxes on their behalf. Using Mongol force to his advantage, In 1329, George laid siege to [[Kutaisi]], western Georgia, reducing the [[Kingdom of Imereti|local king]] [[Bagrat I of Imereti|Bagrat I the Little]] to a vassal prince. King George was on friendly terms with the influential Mongol prince [[Chupan]], who was executed by [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Sa'id Khan]] in 1327. Subsequently, Iqbalshah, son of [[Kutlushah]], was appointed to be Mongol governor of Georgia ([[Gurjistan]]). In 1334 he reasserted royal authority over the virtually independent principality of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] and [[Trapezuntine Civil War#Anna Anachoutlou|returned]] the [[Empire of Trebizond]] into Georgia's sphere of influence.\n\nIn 1334, [[Hasan Buzurg|Shaykh Hasan]] of the [[Jalairid Sultanate|Jalayir]] was appointed as governor of Georgia by Abu Sai'd.<ref>Ta'rfkh-i Shaikh Uwais (History of Shaikh Uwais), trans. and ed. J. B. van Loon, The Hague, 1954, 56-58.</ref> However, George soon took advantage of the civil war in the Il-Khanate, where several khans were overthrown between 1335 and 1344, and drove the last remaining Mongol troops out of Georgia. The following year he ordered great festivities on the Mount Tsivi to celebrate the anniversary of the victory over the Mongols, and massacred there all oppositionist nobles.\n\nHaving restored the kingdom's unity, he focused now on cultural, social and economic projects. He changed the coins issued by [[Ghazan]] khan with the Georgian ones, called George's [[tetri]]. Between 1325 and 1338, he worked out two major law codes, [[Regulations of the Georgian Royal Court|one regulating the relations]] at the royal court and the other devised for the peace of a remote and disorderly mountainous district. Under him, Georgia established close international commercial ties, mainly with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but also with the great [[Europe]]an [[maritime republics]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].\n\n====Black Death====\nOne of the primary reasons of Georgian political and military decline was the [[bubonic plague]]. It was first introduced in 1346 by the soldiers of George the Brilliant returning from a military expedition in [[Tao-Klarjeti|south-western Georgia]] against invading [[Osmanli]] tribesmen. It is said that the plague wiped out a large part, if not half of the Georgian populace.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQWWBQAAQBAJ|title=Georgia Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|last=IBP|first=Inc.|date=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1438774435|location=|page=44}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania|last=West|first=Barbara A.|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438119137|location=New York City, NY, USA|page=229}}</ref> This further weakened the integrity of the kingdom, as well as its military and logistic capabilities.\n\n====Timurid invasions====\n{{Main|Timur's invasions of Georgia}}[[File:Caucasus 1380 map de.png|thumb|Kingdom of Georgia, 1380.|alt=]]There was a period of reunion and revival under [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]], but the eight onslaughts of the [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur]] between 1386 and 1403 dealt a great blow to the Georgian kingdom. Timur's first appearance in the [[Caucasus]] was a response to Khan [[Tokhtamysh]]\u2019s marauding inroad into [[Northern Iran]] through the Caucasian lands in 1385. \nIn late autumn 1386, a huge army of Timur [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|attacked Georgia]]. Timur officially proclaimed his invasions to be [[jihad]] against the region's non-Muslims. [[Tbilisi]] was besieged and taken on 22 November 1386, after a fierce fight. The city was pillaged and Bagrat V and his family were imprisoned. Taking advantage of this disaster, the royal vassal Duke [[Alexander I of Imereti|Alexander]] of [[Imereti]] proclaimed himself an independent ruler and was crowned [[Kingdom of Imereti|king of Imereti]] at the [[Gelati Monastery]] in 1387.\n\nGeorgian resistance prompted a renewed attack by the Turco-Mongol armies. Bagrat's son and successor, [[George VII of Georgia|George VII]], put up a stiff resistance and had to spend much of his reign (1395\u20131405) fighting the Timurid invasions. Timur personally led most of these raids to subdue the recalcitrant Georgian monarch. Although he was not able to establish a firm control over Georgia, the country suffered a blow from which it never recovered. By the time George VII was forced to accept Timur's terms of peace and agree to pay tribute, he was a master of little more than gutted towns, ravaged countryside and a shattered monarchy.<ref name=\"Suny\">[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 45. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}</ref>\n\n==== Turkmen invasions ====\n{{Main|Turkmen invasions of Georgia}}\n[[File:Caucasus 1405 map de.png|thumb|Map of Caucasus Region 1405.]]\nAfter the [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|devastating invasions]] by [[Timur]] and subsequent enfeeblement of the Kingdom of Georgia, it soon faced a new threat. Timur's death in 1405 marked the beginning of the end of his Empire, unified only by fear and blood of the subjected peoples. Turkomans, particularly the [[Kara Koyunlu]] clan, were among the first to rebel against [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]] who ruled most of the Persia and [[Transoxiana|Mawerannahr]]. [[Qara Yusuf]], ruler of the Kara Koyunlu, defeated Shah Rukh, captured Baghdad, and repulsed Timurids from western Persia. After they established themselves as the new leading power in the middle east. They took advantage of the temporary weakness of Georgians and launched attacks against them, apparently in which, [[George VII of Georgia]] was killed. [[Constantine I of Georgia]], fearing further encroachment, allied himself with the Shirvanshah [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan|Ibrahim I]] to counter Turkoman advance and engaged them in the [[Battle of Chalagan]], in which he was defeated and taken captive. In captivity Constantine behaved very proudly, which infuriated Qara Yusuf to such an extent, that he ordered his, his half-brother David's and 300 Georgian nobles' execution. Kara Yusuf put Constantine to death by his own hand.<ref name=\"Toumanoff\">[[Toumanoff, Cyril]] (1949\u201351). The Fifteenth-Century Bagratids and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia. ''Traditio'' 7: 174, 176-177.</ref>\n\n[[Alexander I of Georgia]] who sought to strengthen and restore his declining Kingdom, faced constant invasions by the tribal Turkomans. Alexander re-conquered Lori from the Turkomans in 1431, which was of great importance in securing of the Georgian borders. Around 1434/5, Alexander encouraged the Armenian prince Beshken II Orbelian to attack the Kara Koyunlu clansmen in [[Syunik Province|Siunia]] and, for his victory, granted him Lori under terms of vassalage. In 1440, Alexander refused to pay tribute to [[Jahan Shah]] of the Kara Koyunlu. In March, Jahan Shah surged into Georgia with 20,000 troops, destroyed the city of [[Samshvilde]] and sacked the capital city [[Tbilisi]]. He massacred thousands of Christians, put heavy indemnity on Georgia, and returned to [[Tabriz]]. He also mounted a second military expedition against Georgia in 1444. His forces met those of Alexander's successor, [[Vakhtang IV of Georgia|King Vakhtang IV]] at [[Akhaltsikhe]], but the fighting was inconclusive and Jahan Shah returned to Tabriz once more.\n\nAs a result of foreign and internal struggles unified Kingdom of Georgia stopped to exist after 1466 and was subdivided into several political units. Kara Koyunlu tribal confederation was destroyed by [[Aq Qoyunlu]], their kin tribesmen who formed another confederation, which was similar in many ways to its predecessor. Aq Qoyunlu Turkomans naturally took advantage of the Georgian fragmentation. Georgia was at least twice attacked by [[Uzun Hasan]], the prince of the Aq Qoyunlu in 1466, 1472 and possibly 1476-7. [[Bagrat VI of Georgia]], temporary ruler of most of Georgia at the time, had to make peace with the invaders, by abandoning Tbilisi to the enemy. It was only after Uzun Hasan's death (1478) when the Georgians were able to recover their capital. In the winter of 1488, the Ak Koyunlu Turkomans led by Halil Bey attacked Georgia's capital Tbilisi, and took the city after a long-lasted siege in February 1489. [[Alexander II of Imereti]], another pretender to the throne, took advantage of the Aq Qoyunlu Turkoman invasion of Kartli, and seized control of [[Kingdom of Imereti|Imereti]]. Occupation of the capital did not last long and [[Constantine II of Georgia]] was able to repel them, but it was still costly to Georgians. [[Ismail I]], founder of the [[Safavid dynasty]], formed an alliance with the Georgians in 1502 and decisively defeated Aq Qoyunlu in the same year, destroying their state and marking the end of their invasions.\n\n=== Final disintegration ===\n[[File:Caucasus 1450 map de.png|thumb|250x250px|Map of Caucasus Region 1460.]]\nThe political split of the kingdom was speeded up by the [[Eristavi|Eristavs]] of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]]. In 1462 [[Qvarqvare II Jaqeli|Kvarkvare II Jaqeli]] called against the king of Georgia  [[Uzun Hasan]], the leader of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]]. His invasion was used by the [[viceroy]] of the western Georgia \u2013 [[Bagrat VI of Georgia|Bagrat VI]]. In 1463 Bagrat VI defeated [[George VIII of Georgia|Giorgi VIII]] at Chikhori. \"[[House of Dadiani|Dadiani]], [[House of Gurieli|Gurieli]], [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazians]] and [[Principality of Svaneti|Svans]] came to the conqueror and expressing the wish of all the Imerians (westerners) blessed him to be King. From that time [[Kingdom of Imereti|Imereti]] turned into one kingdom and four Duchies or [[satavado]].\n\nBagrat was the king of only west Georgia for a short period. In 1466 he crossed the borders of East Georgia (Inner [[Shida Kartli|Kartli]]) and proclaimed himself [[List of monarchs of Georgia#Kings of unified Georgia (1008\u20131490)|King of all Georgia]]. In fact, he possessed only west Georgia and Inner Kartli. Giorgi VIII went to [[Kakheti]] and formed an independent [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakhetian Kingdom]]. Recognizing as a sovereign of Bagrat VI the grandson of [[Alexander I of Georgia|Alexander I the Great]] \u2013 [[Constantine II of Georgia|Constantine II]] was consolidated in the [[Kvemo Kartli|lower Kartli]] ([[Tbilisi]]), while [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe-Saatabago]] became an independent principality. \n[[File:Caucasus 1490 map de.png|thumb|250x250px|Map of Caucasus Region 1490.]]\nIn 1477, Eristav of Odishi [[Vameq II Dadiani]] opposed Bagrat VI. He \"assembled the Abkhazians and Gurians and began the raids, devastation and capturing of Imereti\". The reaction of the king of Georgia was immediate. Bagrat VI attacked Odishi with the great army, defeated and subdued Vameq II Dadiani. The king of Kartli and west Georgia \u2013 Bagrat VI died in 1478. Constantine II ascended the throne of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]]. The son of Bagrat VI \u2013 [[Alexander II of Imereti|Alexander II]] tried to ascend the throne in west Georgia. For coronation he summoned \"Dadiani, Gurieli, Sharvashidze and Gelovani\", but headed with Vameq II Dadiani. who refused to support him and invited Constantine II to Western Georgia. Constantine with the help of the Eristavs of western Georgia took Kutaisi and for a short time restored the integrity of Kartli with western Georgia. The allies were planning to unite the whole Georgia and in the first place tried to join Samtskhe-Saatabago. Vameq II Dadiani with the army of west Georgia helped Constantine II in 1481 in the battle with prince and after this the King subordinated Samtskhe. Constantine II became the King of All Georgia. He \"subdued Imers, Odishians and Abkhazians; Atabag served him and the Kakhetians were in his subordination.\n\nin 1483 Constantine II was defeated at Aradeti in the battle with atabag. The son of Bagrat \u2013 [[Alexander II of Imereti|Alexander]], later known as Alexander II took advantage of it and captured Kutaisi and was crowned as a King. Then, the new possessor of Odishi - [[Liparit II Dadiani]] invited Constantine II to West Georgia for the second time. In 1487 Constantine came to west Georgia again with the army and occupied Kutaisi and other significant fortresses with the help of Liparit II Dadiani and other great feudals of West Georgia. But he failed to fully annex west Georgia. In 1488 [[Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan|Yaqub b. Uzun Hasan]] invaded East Georgia and the king of Kartli went to fight with him. Alexander II took advantage of it and captured Kutaisi and all fortresses of Imereti again and after that \"reconciled with Dadiani and Gurieli. By this act, he pacified Imereti and firmly subdued the Abkhazians and Svans\".\n\nIn 1490 Constantine asked a specially assembled [[Darbazi (State Council)|royal court]] for an advice concerning restoration of the integral kingdom. The royal court advised Constantine II to postpone this struggle till the better times. After this the king of Kartli had to temporarily reconcile with the kings of Kakheti and Imereti and also prince of Samtskhe having thus formed the factual split of Georgia. Its unity was finally shattered and, by 1490/91, the once powerful monarchy fragmented into three independent kingdoms \u2013 [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]] (central to eastern Georgia), [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] (eastern Georgia), and [[Kingdom of Imereti|Imereti]] (western Georgia) \u2013 each led by the rival branches of the Bagrationi dynasty, and into five semi-independent principalities \u2013 [[Odishi]] ([[Principality of Mingrelia|Mingrelia]]), [[Principality of Guria|Guria]], [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]], [[Principality of Svaneti|Svaneti]] and [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] \u2013 dominated by their own feudal clans.\n\n== Government and society ==\n[[File:Map_of_Georgia_by_Prince_Vakhushti_Bagrationi.27.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Map of Georgia (''[[Description of the Kingdom of Georgia]])'' by Prince [[Vakhushti of Kartli|Vakhushti Bagrationi]], 1740s.]][[Lists of Georgian monarchs|Georgian monarchs]] followed a policy of religious tolerance and their [[Christians|Christian]], [[Muslim]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] subjects could feel quite comfortable. Medieval Georgia, in its political and cultural development and social structure, resembled [[Middle Ages|Europe]], \"all the familiar terms of Western [[feudalism]] had their equivalents in the social system of medieval Georgia\"<ref>David Lang (1966: 116)</ref> obviously influenced by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. In the medieval period, [[Georgian feudalism]] or \"Patronqmoba\" went through three distinct phases. In the first period, taken to have lasted from the 8th to the 11th centuries, Georgian society was organized as a network of personal ties, tying the king with the nobles of various classes. By the early 9th century, Georgia had already developed a system in which [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] was exchanged for [[benefice]]s. Unlike the countries of medieval Europe, where the three elements of political compromise \u2013 towns, feudal lords and the church \u2013 divided power among themselves and consequently promoted the development of strong centralized nation-States, in Georgia the towns were too weak and were deprived of rights, the feudal lords were too strong, and the church was nominally subjugated to the crown and politically less active.\n\nThe aristocratic [[Elite|\u00e9lite]] of this period was divided into two major classes: an upper noble whose dynastic dignity and feudal quality was expressed in the terms [[Tavadi]] and Didebuli, respectively; both of these terms were synonymous, from the 11th to the 14th centuries, with [[Eristavi]], and all three terms referred to one of the upper nobles, \"a [[Prince]]\". Lesser nobles, the [[Aznauri]], were either \"nobles of race\" or \"of patent\" who acquired their status in specific charters issued by the king or a lord. The power of the feudal nobles over the peasantry also increased and the cultivators began to loss a degree of personal freedom they had formerly enjoyed.\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Duchies of Kingdom of Georgia, XIII c.svg|thumb|Administrative division of the medieval Kingdom of Georgia in [[Georgian Golden Age|Georgian golden age]].|300x300px]]\n''[[Eristavi]]''<nowiki/>'s (dukes) were in charge of local governing. [[Saeristavo]] (duchy) was divided into [[Khevi (territorial unit)|Khevi]] ruled by ''Khevistavi'' (in mountainous regions - ''[[Khevisberi]]''). List of duchies at the time of reign [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]]: [[Principality of Svaneti|Svaneti]], [[Duchy of Racha|Racha-Takveri]]; [[Duchy of Tskhumi|Tskhumi]], [[Argveti|Artgveti]], [[Odishi]], [[Duchy of Kartli|Kartli]], [[Principality of Kakheti|Kakheti]], [[Principality of Hereti|Hereti]] and [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]].\n\nThe frontier regions were granted exceptional privileges and autonomous rights, and were governed by monapire eristavi (frontier governor). There were several [[Border|frontier]] (sanapiro) [[March (territorial entity)|marches]] estabelished specifically on southern districts: [[Gardabani (historic district)|Gagi]], [[Lori Province|Lore]], [[Duchy of Akhalkalaki|Akhalkalaki]], [[Ardahan Province|Artani]], [[Tao (historical region)|Panaskerti]], [[Gachiani]] and [[Kars|Kari]].\n\nFor their part, towns were governed by ''amiri'', while large cities by [[Amirtamira|''amirt-amiri'']]. All these arrangements were codified and systematised in special legislation - [[Regulations of the Georgian Royal Court|Regulations of the Royal Court]] - and codes of laws. The bishops and the churches were exempted from quitrents and duties.\n\nTribute extracted from the neighbors and war booty added to the royal treasury, giving rise to the saying that \"the peasants were like nobles, the nobles like princes, and the princes like kings.\"<ref>Suny, Ronald Grigor, The Making of the Georgian Nation.

To accomplish that goal, kings relied much on the prestige of the Church, and enrolled its political support by giving it many economical advantages, immunity from taxes and large appanages. At the same time, the kings, most notably [[David IV of Georgia|David the Builder]] (1089\u20131125), used state power to interfere in church affairs. Notably, he summoned the 1103 council of [[Urbnisi|Ruisi-Urbnisi]], which condemned Armenian [[Miaphysitism]] in stronger terms than ever before, and gave unprecedented power, second only to the Patriarch, to his friend and advisor [[George of Chqondidi]]. For the following centuries, the Church would remain a crucial feudal institution, whose economical and political power would always be at least equal to that of the main noble families.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Christianity was the central element of Georgian culture. Specific forms of art were developed in Georgia for religious purposes. Among them, [[Georgian calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] church singing, [[cloisonn\u00e9]] enamel icons, such as the [[Khakhuli triptych]], and the \"Georgian cross-dome style\" of architecture, which characterizes most medieval Georgian churches. The most celebrated examples of Georgian religious architecture of the time include the [[Gelati Monastery]] and [[Bagrati Cathedral]] in [[Kutaisi]], the [[Ikalto]] Monastery complex and Academy, and the [[Svetitskhoveli Cathedral]] in [[Mtskheta]].\n\nOutstanding Georgian representatives of Christian culture include [[Euthymius of Athos]] (Ekvtime Atoneli, 955\u20131028), [[George the Hagiorite|George of Athos]] (Giorgi Atoneli, 1009\u20131065), [[Arsen Ikaltoeli]] (11th century), and [[Ephrem Mtsire]], (11th century). Philosophy flourished between the 11th and 13th century, especially at the Academy of Gelati Monastery, where [[Ioane Petritsi]] attempted a synthesis of Christian, [[Peripatetic school|aristotelician]] and [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] thought.\n\nTamar's reign also marked the continuation of artistic development in the country commenced by her predecessors. While her contemporary Georgian chronicles continued to enshrine Christian morality, the religious theme started to lose its earlier dominant position to the highly original secular literature. This trend culminated in an [[Epic poetry|epic]] written by Georgia's national poet [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]] - ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'' (''Vepkhistq'aosani''). Revered in Georgia as the greatest achievement of native literature, the poem  celebrates the Medieval [[Humanism|humanistic]] ideals of [[chivalry]], friendship and [[courtly love]].\n\n==== Missionary activities ====\nFrom the 10th century, Georgians had started to play a significant role in preaching Christianity in the mountains of the Caucasus. \"Wherever the missions of the patriarchs of Constantinople, Rome, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem failed, the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Church]] succeeded in bringing Jesus's Cross and preaching His [[Gospel]]s\". This is corroborated not only by old written sources, but also by Christian architectural monuments bearing Georgian inscriptions, which are still to be seen throughout the North Caucasus in Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan, North Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkaria. The golden age of Georgian monasticism lasted from the 9th to the 11th century. During that period, Georgian monasteries were founded outside the country, most notably on [[Mount Sinai]], [[Mount Athos]] (the [[Iviron monastery]], where the [[Theotokos Iverskaya]] icon is still located), and in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Artistic inheritance ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Golden Theotokos from Khobi, Georgia 12th century.jpg|Golden Theotokos of [[Khobi|Khobi Monastery]], with some precious stones stolen by the communists \nFile:Georgia Khakhuli triptych.jpg|[[Khakhuli triptych|Tryptich of Khakhuli]]\nFile:Khakhuli icon.

It reached [[Georgian Golden Age|its Golden Age]] of political and economic strength during the reign of King [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] and Queen [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]] from 11th to 13th centuries. Georgia became one of the pre-eminent nations of the [[Eastern Christianity|Christian]] [[Middle East|East]], her pan-[[Caucasus|Caucasian]] empire stretching, at its largest extent, from [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[North Caucasus]] to the northern portion of [[Iran]] and [[Anatolia]], while also maintaining religious possessions abroad, such as the [[Monastery of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Iviron|Monastery of Iviron]] in [[Greece]]. It was the principal historical precursor of present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n \nLasting for several centuries, the kingdom fell to the [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century, but managed to re-assert sovereignty by the 1340s. The following decades were marked by the [[Black Death]], as well as numerous invasions under the leadership of [[Timur]], who devastated the country's economy, population, and urban centers. The Kingdom's geopolitical situation further worsened after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and then [[Empire of Trebizond]]. As a result of these processes, by the end of the 15th century Georgia turned into a fractured entity. Renewed [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|incursions]] by Timur from 1386, and the later invasions by the [[Turkmen incursions into Georgia|Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu]] led to the final collapse of the kingdom into anarchy by 1466 and the mutual recognition of its constituent kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]], [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] and [[Kingdom of Imereti|Imereti]] as independent states between 1490 and 1493 \u2013 each led by a rival branch of the [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] dynasty, and into five semi-independent principalities \u2013 [[Odishi]], [[Principality of Guria|Guria]], [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]], [[Principality of Svaneti|Svaneti]], and [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] \u2013 dominated by their own feudal clans.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Arab rule in Georgia|Bagratid Iberia}}Located on the crossroads of protracted [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars|Roman\u2013Persian wars]], the early Georgian kingdoms disintegrated into various feudal regions by the early [[Middle Ages]]. This made it easy for the remaining Georgian realms to fall prey to the [[early Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century.\n\nIn struggle against the [[Arab rule in Georgia|Arab occupation]], Iberian princes of [[Bagrationi dynasty]] came to rule over [[Tao-Klarjeti (historical region)|Tao-Klarjeti]], the former southern provinces of Iberia, and established [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Kouropalatate of Iberia]] as a nominal vassal of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Bagrationi's continued fighting for the central Georgian land, known as [[Kartli]], contested also by the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]], the Arab [[Emirate of Tbilisi|emirs of Tbilisi]] and even by [[First Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakhetian]] and [[Bagratuni dynasty|Armenian Bagratid]] rulers of [[Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget|Tashir-Dzoraget]]. The restoration of the [[List of monarchs of Georgia#Kings of Iberia|Iberian kingship]] begins in 888, however Bagrationi dynasty failed to maintain the integrity of their kingdom, which was actually divided between the three branches of the family with the main branch retaining in [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] and another controlling [[Klarjeti]].\n\nAn [[Marwan ibn Muhammad's invasion of Georgia|Arab incursion]] into western Georgia was repelled by Abkhazians jointly with [[Lazica|Lazic]] and Iberian allies in 736. The successful defense against the Arabs, and the increasingly expansionist tendencies of the kingdom to the east and the struggle against Byzantium, fighting for the hegemony within the Georgian territories speed up the process of unification of Georgian states into a single feudal monarchy. In 9th century western Georgian Church broke away from [[Constantinople]] and recognized the authority of the [[List of heads of the Georgian Orthodox Church#Catholicoi of Kartli (467\u20131010)|Catholicate of Mtskheta]]; language of the church in Abkhazia shifted from [[Greek language|Greek]] to [[Georgian language|Georgian]], as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared.<ref>{{harvnb|Rapp|2007|p=145}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Unification of the Georgian State ===\n[[File:Caucasus 1000 map de.png|left|thumb|Map of Caucasus region at 1000 AD before death of [[David III of Tao|David III]] of Tao.]]\nAt the end of the 10th century [[David III of Tao|David III]] of Tao invaded the [[Duchy of Kartli|Kartli]] and gave it to his foster-son [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]] and installed his father [[Gurgen of Iberia|Gurgen]] as his [[regent]], who was also crowned as \"King of the Iberians\" in 994. Through his mother [[Gurandukht of Abkhazia|Gurandukht]], sister of the childless Abkhazian king [[Theodosius III of Abkhazia|Theodosius III]] ({{Circa}} 975-978), Bagrat was a potential heir to the [[Divan of the Abkhazian Kings|realm of Abkhazia]].\n\n[[Kingdom of Abkhazia]] was engulfed into complete chaos and feudal warfare under the rule of Bagrat's uncle Theodosius the Blind, a weak and inauspicious king. In 978, the former duke of Kartli, [[Ivane Marushisdze]], aided by David III, forced Theodosius to abdicate the throne in favour of his nephew Bagrat. The latter proceeded to [[Kutaisi]] to be crowned King of the Abkhazia. Bagrat's descent from both Bagratid and Abkhazian dynasties made him an acceptable choice for the nobles of the realm who were growing weary of internecine quarrels.  [[File:Bediacup.jpg|thumb|220x220px|The [[Bedia Chalice]] donated by Bagrat to the [[Bedia Cathedral|Bedia Monastery]] is an important piece of Georgian metal art. c. 999 AD|alt=]]In 1008, Gurgen died, and Bagrat succeeded him as \"King of the Iberians\", thus becoming the first King of a [[List of monarchs of Georgia#Kings of unified Georgia (1008\u20131490)|unified realm]] of Abkhazia and Iberia. After he had secured his patrimony, Bagrat proceeded to press a claim to the easternmost Georgian kingdom of [[First Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti-Hereti]] and annexed it in or around 1010, after two years of fighting and aggressive diplomacy. Anxious to create more stable and centralized monarchy, Bagrat eliminated or at least diminished the autonomy of the dynastic princes. In his eyes, the most possible internal danger came from the [[Klarjeti]] line of the Bagrationi. To secure the succession to his son, [[George I of Georgia|George I]], Bagrat lured [[Sumbat III of Klarjeti|his cousins]], on pretext of a reconciliatory meeting and threw them in prison in 1011. Their possessions passed to Bagrat and his progeny. Their children \u2013 Bagrat, son of Sumbat, and Demetre, son of Gurgen \u2013 fled to [[Constantinople]] from where they [[Byzantine\u2013Georgian wars#Demetrius of Klarjeti|would try]] to retrieve patrimonial lands with the Byzantine aid, for the last time in 1032, but to no avail.<ref name=\"Toumanoff2\">[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]] (1967). ''Studies in Christian Caucasian History'', p. 498. [[Georgetown University Press]].</ref>\n\nBagrat's reign, a period of uttermost importance in the history of Georgia, brought about the final victory of the Georgian Bagratids in the centuries-long power struggles. Bagrat's foreign policy was generally peaceful and the king successfully manoeuvred to avoid the conflicts with both the Byzantine and Muslim neighbours even though David's domains of [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] remained in the Byzantine and [[Tbilisi]] in the [[Emirate of Tbilisi|Arab hands]].\n\n=== War and peace with Byzantium ===\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Georgian wars}}[[File:Map_Byzantine_Empire_1045.svg|thumb|220x220px|Kingdom of Georgia in 1045&nbsp;AD|alt=|left]]The major political and military event during [[George I of Georgia|George I]]\u2019s reign, a war against the [[Byzantine Empire]], had its roots back to the 990s, when the Georgian prince [[David III of Tao]], following his abortive rebellion against Emperor [[Basil II]], had to agree to cede his extensive possessions in [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] to the emperor on his death. All the efforts by David\u2019s stepson and George\u2019s father, [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]], to prevent these territories from being annexed to the empire went in vain. Young and ambitious, George [[David III of Tao#Wars of the Kuropalates\u2019 succession|launched a campaign]] to restore the Curopalates\u2019 succession to Georgia and [[Battle of Shirimni|occupied Tao]] in 1015\u20131016. Byzantines were at that time involved in a relentless war with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgar Empire]], limiting their actions to the west. But as soon as [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|Bulgaria was conquered]], Basil II led his army against Georgia in 1021. An exhausting war lasted for two years, and ended in a [[Battle of Svindax|decisive Byzantine victory]], forcing George to agree to a peace treaty, in which George had not only to abandon his claims to Tao, but to surrender several of his southwestern possessions, later reorganized into [[Iberia (theme)|theme of Iberia]], to Basil and to give his three-year-old son, [[Bagrat IV of Georgia|Bagrat IV]], as hostage.[[File:Svetitskhoveli_Cathedral_in_Georgia,_Europe.jpg|thumb|The construction of [[Svetitskhoveli Cathedral]] in [[Mtskheta]], now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]], was initiated in the 1020s by George I.]]The young child Bagrat IV spent the next three years in the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]] and was released in 1025. After George I's death in 1027, Bagrat, aged eight, succeeded to the throne. By the time Bagrat IV became king, the Bagratids\u2019 drive to complete the unification of all Georgian lands had gained irreversible momentum. The kings of Georgia sat at [[Kutaisi]] in western Georgia from which they ran all of what had been the Kingdom of Abkhazia and a greater portion of Iberia; [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] had been lost to the Byzantines while a [[Muslim]] emir [[Emirate of Tbilisi|remained in Tbilisi]] and the kings of [[Kingdom of Kakheti-Hereti|Kakheti and Hereti]] obstinately defended their autonomy in easternmost Georgia. Furthermore, the loyalty of great nobles to the Georgian crown was far from stable. During Bagrat's minority, the [[Liparit IV, Duke of Kldekari|regency]] had advanced the positions of the high nobility whose influence he subsequently [[Battle of Sasireti|tried to limit]] when he assumed full ruling powers. Simultaneously, the Georgian crown was confronted with two formidable external foes: the Byzantine Empire and the resurgent [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]].\n\n=== Great Turkish Invasion ===\n{{Main|Great Turkish Invasion}}The second half of the 11th century was marked by the strategically significant invasion of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who by the end of the 1040s had succeeded in building a vast empire including most of [[Central Asia]] and [[Iran|Persia]]. The Seljuk threat prompted the Georgian and Byzantine governments to seek a closer cooperation. To secure the alliance, Bagrat's daughter [[Maria of Alania|Maria]] married, at some point between 1066 and 1071, to the Byzantine co-emperor [[Michael VII Doukas|Michael VII Ducas]].\n\nThe Seljuqs made their first appearances in Georgia in the 1060s, when the sultan [[Alp Arslan]] laid waste to the south-western provinces of the Georgian kingdom and reduced [[Kakheti]]. These intruders were part of the same wave of the Turkish movement which inflicted a crushing defeat on the Byzantine army at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] in 1071. Although the Georgians were able to recover from Alp Arslan's invasion and even securing the [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] ([[Iberia (theme)|theme of Iberia]]), by the help of Byzantine governor of Georgian origin, [[Gregory Pakourianos]]. On this occasion, [[George II of Georgia|George II]] was bestowed with the Byzantine title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', granted the fortress of [[Kars]] and put in charge of the Imperial Eastern limits.\n\nThis did not help to stem the Seljuk advance, however. The Byzantine withdrawal from Anatolia brought Georgia in more direct contact with the Seljuqs. In 1073 Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan devastated [[Kartli]]. George II [[Battle of Partskhisi|successfully repelled an invasion]] once again. In 1076, the Seljuk sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik Shah I]] surged into Georgia and reduced many settlements to ruins. Harassed by the massive Turkic influx, known in Georgian history as the [[Great Turkish Invasion]], from 1079/80 onward, George was pressured into submitting to Malik-Shah to ensure a precious degree of peace at the price of an annual [[tribute]]. George's acceptance of the Seljuq suzerainty did not bring a real peace for Georgia. The Turks continued their seasonal movement into the Georgian territory to make use of the rich herbage of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura valley]] and the Seljuq garrisons occupied the key fortresses in Georgia's south. These inroads and settlements had a ruinous effect on Georgia's economic and political order. The contemporary Georgian chronicler laments that:{{cquote|''In those times there was neither sowing nor harvest. The land was ruined and turned into forest; in place of men beasts and animals of the field made their dwelling there. Insufferable oppression fell on all the inhabitants of the land; it was unparalleled and far worse than all ravages heard of or experienced.''\n}}\n\n=== Georgian Reconquista ===\n==== David IV ====\n[[File:King David Aghmashenebeli.jpg|thumb|[[David IV of Georgia]], a fresco from the [[Shio-Mgvime monastery]]|left|246x246px]][[File:David IV map de.png|thumb|Expansion of Kingdom of Georgia under [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]]'s reign.]]Watching his kingdom slip into chaos, [[George II of Georgia|George II]] ceded the crown to his 16-year-old son [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] in 1089. King David IV proved to be a capable statesman and military commander. As he came of age under the guidance of his court minister, [[George of Chqondidi]], David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized the power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1089\u20131100, he organized small detachments to harass and destroy isolated Seljuk troops and began the resettlement of desolate regions. By 1099 David IV's power was considerable enough that he was able to refuse paying [[tribute]] to Seljuqs.\n\nIn 1103 a major ecclesiastical congress known as the [[Council of Ruisi-Urbnisi|Ruis-Urbnisi Synod]] was held. Next year, David's supporters in the eastern Georgian province of [[Kakheti]] captured the local king [[Aghsartan II of Kakheti|Aghsartan II]] ({{Circa}}1102\u20131104), a loyal tributary of the Seljuk [[Sultan]], and reunited the area with the rest of Georgia. Following the annexation of Kakheti, in 1105, David routed a Seljuk punitive force at the [[Battle of Ertsukhi]], leading to momentum that helped him to secure the key fortresses of [[Samshvilde]], [[Rustavi]], [[Ki\u015f, Shaki|Gishi]], and [[Lori Fortress|Lori]] between 1110 and 1118.\n\nTo strengthen his army, King David launched a major military reform in 1118\u20131120 and [[Kipchaks in Georgia|resettled]] several thousand [[Kipchaks]] from the northern steppes to frontier districts of Georgia. In return, the Kipchaks provided one soldier per family, allowing King David to establish a standing army in addition to his royal troops (known as [[Monaspa]]). The new army provided the king with a much-needed force to fight both external threats and internal discontent of powerful lords. The Georgian-Kipchak alliance was facilitated by [[Family of David IV of Georgia|David's earlier marriage]] to the [[Khan (title)|Khan]]'s daughter.\n\nStarting in 1120, King David began a more aggressive policy of expansion. He entered the neighbouring [[Shirvan]] and took the town of [[Qabala District|Qabala]]. In the winter of 1120\u20131121 the Georgian troops successfully attacked the Seljuk settlements on the eastern and southwestern approaches to the [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasus]]. Muslim powers became increasingly concerned about the rapid rise of a Christian state in southern Caucasia. In 1121, [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq|Sultan Mahmud b. Muhammad]] ({{Circa}} 1118\u20131131) declared a [[Religious war|holy war]] on Georgia. However, 12 August 1121, King David routed the enemy army on the fields of [[Battle of Didgori|Didgori]], with fleeing Seljuq Turks being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. A huge amount of booty and prisoners were captured by David's army, which had also [[Siege of Tbilisi (1122)|secured Tbilisi]], the last Muslim enclave remaining from the Arab occupation, in 1122 and moved the Georgian capital there and inaugurated [[Georgian Golden Age|Georgia's Golden Age]].<ref name=\"javaxisvili\">{{in lang|ka}} [[Ivane Javakhishvili|Javakhishvili, Ivane]] (1982), ''k'art'veli eris istoria'' (The History of the Georgian Nation), vol. 2, pp. 184-187.

In 1123, David's army liberated [[Dmanisi]], the last Seljuk stronghold in southern Georgia. In 1124, David finally conquered [[Shirvan]] and took the [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenian]] city of [[Ani]] from the Muslim [[emir]]s, thus expanding the borders of his kingdom to the [[Aras (river)|Araxes]] basin. Armenians met him as a liberator providing some auxiliary force for his army. It was when the important component of \"''Sword of the [[Messiah]]''\" appeared in the title of David the Builder.\n\nDavid IV founded the [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati Academy]], which became an important center of scholarship in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] world of that time. Due to the extensive work carried out by the Gelati Academy, people of the time called it \"a new [[Classical Greece|Hellas]]\" and \"a second [[Mount Athos|Athos]]\".<ref>Chatzidakis, Nano. ''Byzantine Mosaics, Volume 7.'' [[Athens]], [[Greece]]: Ekdotike Athenon, 1994, p.22</ref> David also played a personal role in reviving Georgian religious hymnography, composing the ''Hymns of Repentance'', a sequence of eight free-verse psalms. In this emotional repentance of his sins, David sees himself as reincarnating the Biblical [[David]], with a similar relationship to God and to his people. His hymns also share the idealistic zeal of the contemporaneous European crusaders to whom David was a natural ally in his struggle against the Seljuks.<ref>[[Donald Rayfield]], \"Davit II\", in: Robert B.

Although his reign saw a disruptive family conflict related to royal succession, Georgia remained a centralized power with a strong military. In 1139, he raided the city of [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]] in [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] and brought the iron gate of the defeated city to Georgia and donated it to [[Gelati Monastery]] at [[Kutaisi]], western Georgia. Despite this brilliant victory, Demetrius could hold Ganja only for a few years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rayfield|first1=Donald|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|date=2013|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1780230702|url=|page=100|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1442241466|page=259|edition=2}}</ref> A talented poet, Demetrius also continued his father's contributions to Georgia's religious [[polyphony]]. The most famous of his hymns is [[Shen Khar Venakhi|Thou Art a Vineyard]].\n\nDemetrius was succeeded by his son [[George III of Georgia|George III]] in 1156, beginning a stage of more offensive foreign policy. The same year he ascended to the throne, George launched a successful campaign against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] sultanate of [[Shah-Armens|Ahlat]]. He freed the important Armenian town of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] from [[Eldiguzids|Eldiguzid]] vassalage and was thus welcomed as a liberator in the area. Eldiguz formed a coalition with other Seljuqids in the beginning of the 1160s to fight against the Georgians, and in 1163. the [[Shams al-Din Eldiguz's invasion of Georgia|allies inflicted a defeat]] on king [[George III of Georgia]]. The Seljuqid rulers were jubilant, and they prepared for a new campaign. However, this time they were forestalled by George III, who marched into [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] at the beginning of 1166, occupied a region extending to faraway cities as Nakhchivan and Beylagan, devastated the land and returned with prisoners and booty. There seemed to be no end to the war between George III and atabeg Eldiguz. But the belligerents were exhausted to such an extent that Eldiguz proposed an [[armistice]]. George had no alternative but to make concessions. Eldiguz restored Ani to its former rulers, the Shaddadids. In 1167, George marched to defend his vassal Shah [[Akhsitan I|Akhsitan]] of [[Shirvan]] against the [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus'|Rus' and Kipchak assaults]] and [[Siege of Derbent|strengthened]] the Georgian dominance in the area. George gave his daughter Rusudan, in marriage, to [[Manuel Komnenos (son of Andronikos I)|Manuel Komnenos]], the son of Emperor [[Andronikos I Komnenos]]. In 1173, Atabeg Eldiguz began another campaign against Georgia but he was defeated. Atabeg's troops retreated and Eldiguz died in 1174 in Nakhchivan. In 1177, the nobles [[House of Orbeli#Rise of Orbeli|rose in rebellion]] but were suppressed. The following year, King George III ceded the throne to his daughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]], but remained [[Coregency|coregent]] until his death in 1184.\n\n===Golden age===\n{{Main|Georgian Golden Age}}\n[[File:Caucasus 1213 AD map en.svg|thumb|263x263px|Kingdom of Georgia under [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]]'s reign.]]\nThe unified monarchy maintained its precarious independence [[Byzantine\u2013Georgian wars|from the Byzantine]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] empires throughout the 11th century, and flourished under [[David IV of Georgia|David IV the Builder]] ({{Circa}} 1089\u20131125), who [[Georgian\u2013Seljuk wars|repelled the Seljuk attacks]] and essentially completed the unification of Georgia with the [[Siege of Tbilisi (1122)|re-conquest of Tbilisi]] in 1122.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eastmond |first=Antony |date=2010 |title=Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KPdSQU-Bx4C |location=University Park, Pennsylvania, USA |publisher=Penn State Press |page=71 |isbn=978-0271043913}}</ref> In spite of repeated incidents of dynastic strife, the kingdom continued to prosper during the reigns of [[Demetrius I of Georgia|Demetrios I]] ({{Circa}}1125\u20131156), [[George III of Georgia|George III]] ({{Circa}}1156\u20131184), and especially, his daughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] ({{Circa}}1184\u20131213).\n\nWith the [[Decline of the Byzantine Empire|decline]] of Byzantine power and the dissolution of the [[Seljuk Empire|Great Seljuk Empire]], Georgia became one of the pre-eminent nations of the region, stretching, at its largest extent, from present-day [[Southern Russia]] to [[Iran|Northern Iran]], and westwards into [[Anatolia]]. The Kingdom of Georgia brought about the Georgian Golden Age, which describes a historical period in the [[High Middle Ages]], spanning from roughly the late 11th to 13th centuries, when the kingdom reached the zenith of its power and development. The period saw the flourishing of medieval Georgian architecture, painting and poetry, which was frequently expressed in the development of ecclesiastic art, as well as the creation of first major works of secular literature.

She not only shielded much of her Empire from further Turkish invasions but successfully pacified internal tensions, including a coup organized by her [[Kievan Rus'|Russian]] husband [[Yury Bogolyubsky]], prince of [[Novgorod]].\n\nIn 1199, Tamar's armies led by two Christianised Armenian-[[Kurds|Kurdish]]<ref>{{harvnb|Kuehn|2011|p=28}}.</ref> generals, Zakare and Ivane [[Mkhargrdzeli|Mkhargrzeli]], dislodged the [[Shaddadids|Shaddadid]] dynasty from [[Ani]]. At the beginning of the 13th century Georgian armies overran fortresses and cities towards the [[Ararat Plain]], reclaiming one after another fortresses and districts from local Muslim rulers: [[Bjni Fortress|Bjni]], [[Amberd]] and all the towns on their way in 1201. Alarmed by the Georgian successes, [[Suleiman II (R\u00fbm)|S\u00fcleymanshah II]], the resurgent Seljuqid [[Sultanate of Rum|sultan of R\u00fbm]], rallied his vassal [[emir]]s and marched against Georgia, but his camp was attacked and destroyed by Tamar's husband [[David Soslan]] at the [[Battle of Basian]] in 1203 or 1204.

This campaign was evidently started because the ruler of Erzerum refused to submit to Georgia. The emir of Kars requested aid from the Akhlatshahs, but the latter was unable to respond, it was taken over by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] In 1207. By 1209 Georgia challenged Ayyubid rule in [[Eastern Anatolia Region|eastern Anatolia]]. Georgian army besieged Akhlat. In response Ayyubid [[Sultan]] [[Al-Adil I|al-Adil]] assembled and personally led large Muslim army that included the ''[[emir]]s'' of [[Homs]], [[Hama]] and [[Baalbek]] as well as contingents from other Ayyubid principalities to support [[Al-Awhad Ayyub|al-Awhad]]. During the siege, Georgian general [[Mkhargrdzeli|Ivane Mkhargrdzeli]] accidentally fell into the hands of the al-Awhad on the outskirts of Akhlat. the latter demanded for his release a thirty-year truce.

Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. He put down the revolts in neighbouring [[Muslims|Muslim]] vassal states in the 1210s and began preparations for a large-scale campaign against [[Jerusalem]] to support the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] in 1220. However, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] approach to the Georgian borders made the Crusade plan unrealistic, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|two successive battles]], in 1221\u20131222, most notably the [[Battle of Khunan]]. [[File:Georgian Cavalry.jpg|thumb|245x245px|Georgian Illumination from the Djruchi II Four Gospels, 12-13th Centuries. The miniature depicting ''\"Georgian knights\"''.|alt=]]Georgians suffered heavy losses in this war and the King George IV, himself was severely wounded. The Kingdom of Georgia itself was torn by internal dissent and was unprepared for such an ordeal. The struggle between the nobility and the crown increased. In 1222, King George appointed his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Rusudan]] as a [[Coregency|co-regent]] and died later that year. Queen Rusudan ({{Circa}} 1223\u20131245) proved a less capable ruler, and domestic discord intensified on the eve of foreign invasion.\nThis offensive, which would prove the ruin of Georgia, was preceded by the devastating conflict with Khwarazm ruler [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the son of the last ruler of [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazm]], who was defeated by the Mongols and now led his Khwaras mian army to Caucasus. The Georgians suffered bitter defeat at the [[Battle of Garni]], and the royal court with Queen Rusudan moved to [[Kutaisi]], when the Georgian capital [[Tbilisi]] was besieged by the Khwarezmians. The victorious Khwarezmid soldiers sacked Tbilisi and [[Hundred Thousand Martyrs of Tbilisi|massacred]] its Christian population and  terminated Georgia's \"Golden Age\". Jalal al-Din continued devastating Georgian regions until 1230, when the Mongols finally defeated him.\n\nIn 1235\u20131236, Mongol forces, unlike their first raid in 1221, appeared with the sole purpose of conquest and occupation and easily overran the already devastated Kingdom. Queen Rusudan fled to the security of western Georgia, while the nobles secluded themselves in their fortresses. By 1240 all the country was under the Mongol yoke. Forced to accept the sovereignty of the [[List of Mongol rulers|Mongol Khan]] in 1242, Rusudan had to pay an annual tribute of 50,000 gold pieces and support the Mongols with a Georgian army.\n\nFearing that her nephew [[David VII of Georgia]] would aspire to the throne, Rusudan held him prisoner at the court of her son-in-law, the sultan [[Kaykhusraw II]], and sent her son [[David VI of Georgia]] to the Mongol court to get his official recognition as heir apparent. She died in 1245, still waiting for her son to return.\n\n==== Mongol yoke ====\n[[File:Caucasus 1245 AD map de.png|thumb|Map of Kingdom of Georgia during [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol invasions]], 1245 AD.]]\nThe Mongols created the \"[[Vilayet]] of [[Georgia (country)#Etymology|Gurjistan]]\", which included Georgia and the whole [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]], where they ruled indirectly, through the Georgian monarch, the latter to be confirmed by the [[Khagan|Great Khan]] upon his/her ascension. Following the death of Queen Rusudan in 1245, an [[interregnum]] began during which the Mongols divided the Caucasus into eight [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]].\n\nExploiting the complicated issue of succession, the Mongols had the Georgian nobles divided into two rival parties, each of which advocated their own candidate to the crown. These were [[David VII of Georgia|David VII \"Ulu\"]], an illegitimate son of George IV, and his cousin [[David VI of Georgia|David VI \"Narin\"]], son of Rusudan. After a [[Tsotne Dadiani#Kokhtastavi conspiracy|failed plot]] against the Mongol rule in Georgia (1245), [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]] made, in 1247, both pretenders co-kings, in eastern and western parts of the kingdom respectively, they also carved out the region of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] and placed it under the direct control of the [[Ilkhanate]]. The system of tumens was abolished, but the Mongols closely watched the Georgian administration in order to secure a steady flow of taxes and tributes from the subject peoples, who were also pressed into the Mongol armies. Georgians attended all major campaigns of the [[Ilkhanate]] and aristocrats' sons served in [[kheshig]].<ref>C.P.Atwood- Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.197</ref>\n\nThe period between 1259 and 1330 was marked by the struggle of the Georgians against the Mongol Ilkhanate for full independence. The first anti-Mongol uprising started in 1259 under the leadership of [[David VI of Georgia|King David Narin]] who in fact waged his war for almost thirty years. The Anti-Mongol strife went on under the Kings [[Demetrius II of Georgia|Demetrius II]] ({{Circa}} 1270\u20131289) and [[David VIII of Georgia|David VIII]] ({{Circa}} 1293\u20131311).\n\n==== George V the Brilliant ====\n[[File:Caucasus 1311 AD map de.png|thumb|[[Kingdom of Imereti|Western]] and Eastern Georgia around 1311 AD.|alt=|left]]Demetrius was executed by the Mongols in 1289, and the little prince [[George V of Georgia|George]] was carried to [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] to be reared at the court of his maternal grandfather, [[Beka I Jaqeli]]. In 1299, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] [[Ghazan]] installed him as a rival ruler to George's elder brother, the rebellious King [[David VIII of Georgia|David VIII]]. However, George's authority did not extend beyond the Mongol-protected capital [[Tbilisi]], so George was referred to during this period as \"The Shadow King of Tbilisi\". In 1302, he was replaced by his brother, [[Vakhtang III of Georgia|Vakhtang III]]. After the death of both his elder brothers \u2013 David and Vakhtang \u2013 George became a regent for David's son, [[George VI of Georgia|George VI]], who died underage in 1313, allowing George V to be crowned king for a second time. Having initially pledged his loyalty to the Il-khan [[\u00d6ljait\u00fc]], he began a program of reuniting the Georgian lands. In 1315, he led the Georgian [[auxiliaries]] to suppress an anti-Mongol revolt in [[Asia Minor]], an expedition that would prove to be the last in which the Georgians fought in the Mongol ranks. In 1320, he drove the marauding [[Alans]] out of the town [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] and forced them back to the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. [[File:Tiflis - Angelino Dulcert - 1339.jpg|thumb|217x217px|Detail from the [[Nautical chart]] by [[Angelino Dulcert]], depicting Georgian Black Sea coast and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]], 1339|alt=]]He pursued a shrewd and flexible policy aimed at throwing off the Mongol yoke and restoring the Georgian kingdom. He established close relations with the Mongol khans and succeeded in acquiring authority to personally collect taxes on their behalf. Using Mongol force to his advantage, In 1329, George laid siege to [[Kutaisi]], western Georgia, reducing the [[Kingdom of Imereti|local king]] [[Bagrat I of Imereti|Bagrat I the Little]] to a vassal prince. King George was on friendly terms with the influential Mongol prince [[Chupan]], who was executed by [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Sa'id Khan]] in 1327. Subsequently, Iqbalshah, son of [[Kutlushah]], was appointed to be Mongol governor of Georgia ([[Gurjistan]]). In 1334 he reasserted royal authority over the virtually independent principality of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] and [[Trapezuntine Civil War#Anna Anachoutlou|returned]] the [[Empire of Trebizond]] into Georgia's sphere of influence.\n\nIn 1334, [[Hasan Buzurg|Shaykh Hasan]] of the [[Jalairid Sultanate|Jalayir]] was appointed as governor of Georgia by Abu Sai'd.<ref>Ta'rfkh-i Shaikh Uwais (History of Shaikh Uwais), trans. and ed. J. B. van Loon, The Hague, 1954, 56-58.</ref> However, George soon took advantage of the civil war in the Il-Khanate, where several khans were overthrown between 1335 and 1344, and drove the last remaining Mongol troops out of Georgia. The following year he ordered great festivities on the Mount Tsivi to celebrate the anniversary of the victory over the Mongols, and massacred there all oppositionist nobles.\n\nHaving restored the kingdom's unity, he focused now on cultural, social and economic projects. He changed the coins issued by [[Ghazan]] khan with the Georgian ones, called George's [[tetri]]. Between 1325 and 1338, he worked out two major law codes, [[Regulations of the Georgian Royal Court|one regulating the relations]] at the royal court and the other devised for the peace of a remote and disorderly mountainous district. Under him, Georgia established close international commercial ties, mainly with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but also with the great [[Europe]]an [[maritime republics]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].\n\n====Black Death====\nOne of the primary reasons of Georgian political and military decline was the [[bubonic plague]]. It was first introduced in 1346 by the soldiers of George the Brilliant returning from a military expedition in [[Tao-Klarjeti|south-western Georgia]] against invading [[Osmanli]] tribesmen. It is said that the plague wiped out a large part, if not half of the Georgian populace.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQWWBQAAQBAJ|title=Georgia Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|last=IBP|first=Inc.|date=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1438774435|location=|page=44}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania|last=West|first=Barbara A.|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438119137|location=New York City, NY, USA|page=229}}</ref> This further weakened the integrity of the kingdom, as well as its military and logistic capabilities.\n\n====Timurid invasions====\n{{Main|Timur's invasions of Georgia}}[[File:Caucasus 1380 map de.png|thumb|Kingdom of Georgia, 1380.|alt=]]There was a period of reunion and revival under [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]], but the eight onslaughts of the [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur]] between 1386 and 1403 dealt a great blow to the Georgian kingdom. Timur's first appearance in the [[Caucasus]] was a response to Khan [[Tokhtamysh]]\u2019s marauding inroad into [[Northern Iran]] through the Caucasian lands in 1385. \nIn late autumn 1386, a huge army of Timur [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|attacked Georgia]]. Timur officially proclaimed his invasions to be [[jihad]] against the region's non-Muslims. [[Tbilisi]] was besieged and taken on 22 November 1386, after a fierce fight. The city was pillaged and Bagrat V and his family were imprisoned. Taking advantage of this disaster, the royal vassal Duke [[Alexander I of Imereti|Alexander]] of [[Imereti]] proclaimed himself an independent ruler and was crowned [[Kingdom of Imereti|king of Imereti]] at the [[Gelati Monastery]] in 1387.\n\nGeorgian resistance prompted a renewed attack by the Turco-Mongol armies. Bagrat's son and successor, [[George VII of Georgia|George VII]], put up a stiff resistance and had to spend much of his reign (1395\u20131405) fighting the Timurid invasions. Timur personally led most of these raids to subdue the recalcitrant Georgian monarch. Although he was not able to establish a firm control over Georgia, the country suffered a blow from which it never recovered. By the time George VII was forced to accept Timur's terms of peace and agree to pay tribute, he was a master of little more than gutted towns, ravaged countryside and a shattered monarchy.<ref name=\"Suny\">[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 45. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}</ref>\n\n==== Turkmen invasions ====\n{{Main|Turkmen invasions of Georgia}}\n[[File:Caucasus 1405 map de.png|thumb|Map of Caucasus Region 1405.]]\nAfter the [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|devastating invasions]] by [[Timur]] and subsequent enfeeblement of the Kingdom of Georgia, it soon faced a new threat. Timur's death in 1405 marked the beginning of the end of his Empire, unified only by fear and blood of the subjected peoples. Turkomans, particularly the [[Kara Koyunlu]] clan, were among the first to rebel against [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]] who ruled most of the Persia and [[Transoxiana|Mawerannahr]]. [[Qara Yusuf]], ruler of the Kara Koyunlu, defeated Shah Rukh, captured Baghdad, and repulsed Timurids from western Persia. After they established themselves as the new leading power in the middle east. They took advantage of the temporary weakness of Georgians and launched attacks against them, apparently in which, [[George VII of Georgia]] was killed. [[Constantine I of Georgia]], fearing further encroachment, allied himself with the Shirvanshah [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan|Ibrahim I]] to counter Turkoman advance and engaged them in the [[Battle of Chalagan]], in which he was defeated and taken captive. In captivity Constantine behaved very proudly, which infuriated Qara Yusuf to such an extent, that he ordered his, his half-brother David's and 300 Georgian nobles' execution. Kara Yusuf put Constantine to death by his own hand.<ref name=\"Toumanoff\">[[Toumanoff, Cyril]] (1949\u201351). The Fifteenth-Century Bagratids and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia. ''Traditio'' 7: 174, 176-177.</ref>\n\n[[Alexander I of Georgia]] who sought to strengthen and restore his declining Kingdom, faced constant invasions by the tribal Turkomans. Alexander re-conquered Lori from the Turkomans in 1431, which was of great importance in securing of the Georgian borders. Around 1434/5, Alexander encouraged the Armenian prince Beshken II Orbelian to attack the Kara Koyunlu clansmen in [[Syunik Province|Siunia]] and, for his victory, granted him Lori under terms of vassalage. In 1440, Alexander refused to pay tribute to [[Jahan Shah]] of the Kara Koyunlu. In March, Jahan Shah surged into Georgia with 20,000 troops, destroyed the city of [[Samshvilde]] and sacked the capital city [[Tbilisi]]. He massacred thousands of Christians, put heavy indemnity on Georgia, and returned to [[Tabriz]]. He also mounted a second military expedition against Georgia in 1444. His forces met those of Alexander's successor, [[Vakhtang IV of Georgia|King Vakhtang IV]] at [[Akhaltsikhe]], but the fighting was inconclusive and Jahan Shah returned to Tabriz once more.\n\nAs a result of foreign and internal struggles unified Kingdom of Georgia stopped to exist after 1466 and was subdivided into several political units. Kara Koyunlu tribal confederation was destroyed by [[Aq Qoyunlu]], their kin tribesmen who formed another confederation, which was similar in many ways to its predecessor. Aq Qoyunlu Turkomans naturally took advantage of the Georgian fragmentation. Georgia was at least twice attacked by [[Uzun Hasan]], the prince of the Aq Qoyunlu in 1466, 1472 and possibly 1476-7. [[Bagrat VI of Georgia]], temporary ruler of most of Georgia at the time, had to make peace with the invaders, by abandoning Tbilisi to the enemy. It was only after Uzun Hasan's death (1478) when the Georgians were able to recover their capital. In the winter of 1488, the Ak Koyunlu Turkomans led by Halil Bey attacked Georgia's capital Tbilisi, and took the city after a long-lasted siege in February 1489. [[Alexander II of Imereti]], another pretender to the throne, took advantage of the Aq Qoyunlu Turkoman invasion of Kartli, and seized control of [[Kingdom of Imereti|Imereti]]. Occupation of the capital did not last long and [[Constantine II of Georgia]] was able to repel them, but it was still costly to Georgians. [[Ismail I]], founder of the [[Safavid dynasty]], formed an alliance with the Georgians in 1502 and decisively defeated Aq Qoyunlu in the same year, destroying their state and marking the end of their invasions.\n\n=== Final disintegration ===\n[[File:Caucasus 1450 map de.png|thumb|250x250px|Map of Caucasus Region 1460.]]\nThe political split of the kingdom was speeded up by the [[Eristavi|Eristavs]] of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]]. In 1462 [[Qvarqvare II Jaqeli|Kvarkvare II Jaqeli]] called against the king of Georgia  [[Uzun Hasan]], the leader of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]]. His invasion was used by the [[viceroy]] of the western Georgia \u2013 [[Bagrat VI of Georgia|Bagrat VI]]. In 1463 Bagrat VI defeated [[George VIII of Georgia|Giorgi VIII]] at Chikhori. \"[[House of Dadiani|Dadiani]], [[House of Gurieli|Gurieli]], [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazians]] and [[Principality of Svaneti|Svans]] came to the conqueror and expressing the wish of all the Imerians (westerners) blessed him to be King. From that time [[Kingdom of Imereti|Imereti]] turned into one kingdom and four Duchies or [[satavado]].\n\nBagrat was the king of only west Georgia for a short period. In 1466 he crossed the borders of East Georgia (Inner [[Shida Kartli|Kartli]]) and proclaimed himself [[List of monarchs of Georgia#Kings of unified Georgia (1008\u20131490)|King of all Georgia]]. In fact, he possessed only west Georgia and Inner Kartli. Giorgi VIII went to [[Kakheti]] and formed an independent [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakhetian Kingdom]]. Recognizing as a sovereign of Bagrat VI the grandson of [[Alexander I of Georgia|Alexander I the Great]] \u2013 [[Constantine II of Georgia|Constantine II]] was consolidated in the [[Kvemo Kartli|lower Kartli]] ([[Tbilisi]]), while [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe-Saatabago]] became an independent principality. \n[[File:Caucasus 1490 map de.png|thumb|250x250px|Map of Caucasus Region 1490.]]\nIn 1477, Eristav of Odishi [[Vameq II Dadiani]] opposed Bagrat VI. He \"assembled the Abkhazians and Gurians and began the raids, devastation and capturing of Imereti\". The reaction of the king of Georgia was immediate. Bagrat VI attacked Odishi with the great army, defeated and subdued Vameq II Dadiani. The king of Kartli and west Georgia \u2013 Bagrat VI died in 1478. Constantine II ascended the throne of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]]. The son of Bagrat VI \u2013 [[Alexander II of Imereti|Alexander II]] tried to ascend the throne in west Georgia. For coronation he summoned \"Dadiani, Gurieli, Sharvashidze and Gelovani\", but headed with Vameq II Dadiani. who refused to support him and invited Constantine II to Western Georgia. Constantine with the help of the Eristavs of western Georgia took Kutaisi and for a short time restored the integrity of Kartli with western Georgia. The allies were planning to unite the whole Georgia and in the first place tried to join Samtskhe-Saatabago. Vameq II Dadiani with the army of west Georgia helped Constantine II in 1481 in the battle with prince and after this the King subordinated Samtskhe. Constantine II became the King of All Georgia. He \"subdued Imers, Odishians and Abkhazians; Atabag served him and the Kakhetians were in his subordination.\n\nin 1483 Constantine II was defeated at Aradeti in the battle with atabag. The son of Bagrat \u2013 [[Alexander II of Imereti|Alexander]], later known as Alexander II took advantage of it and captured Kutaisi and was crowned as a King. Then, the new possessor of Odishi - [[Liparit II Dadiani]] invited Constantine II to West Georgia for the second time. In 1487 Constantine came to west Georgia again with the army and occupied Kutaisi and other significant fortresses with the help of Liparit II Dadiani and other great feudals of West Georgia. But he failed to fully annex west Georgia. In 1488 [[Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan|Yaqub b. Uzun Hasan]] invaded East Georgia and the king of Kartli went to fight with him. Alexander II took advantage of it and captured Kutaisi and all fortresses of Imereti again and after that \"reconciled with Dadiani and Gurieli. By this act, he pacified Imereti and firmly subdued the Abkhazians and Svans\".\n\nIn 1490 Constantine asked a specially assembled [[Darbazi (State Council)|royal court]] for an advice concerning restoration of the integral kingdom. The royal court advised Constantine II to postpone this struggle till the better times. After this the king of Kartli had to temporarily reconcile with the kings of Kakheti and Imereti and also prince of Samtskhe having thus formed the factual split of Georgia. Its unity was finally shattered and, by 1490/91, the once powerful monarchy fragmented into three independent kingdoms \u2013 [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]] (central to eastern Georgia), [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] (eastern Georgia), and [[Kingdom of Imereti|Imereti]] (western Georgia) \u2013 each led by the rival branches of the Bagrationi dynasty, and into five semi-independent principalities \u2013 [[Odishi]] ([[Principality of Mingrelia|Mingrelia]]), [[Principality of Guria|Guria]], [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]], [[Principality of Svaneti|Svaneti]] and [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] \u2013 dominated by their own feudal clans.\n\n== Government and society ==\n[[File:Map_of_Georgia_by_Prince_Vakhushti_Bagrationi.27.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Map of Georgia (''[[Description of the Kingdom of Georgia]])'' by Prince [[Vakhushti of Kartli|Vakhushti Bagrationi]], 1740s.]][[Lists of Georgian monarchs|Georgian monarchs]] followed a policy of religious tolerance and their [[Christians|Christian]], [[Muslim]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] subjects could feel quite comfortable.

In the medieval period, [[Georgian feudalism]] or \"Patronqmoba\" went through three distinct phases. In the first period, taken to have lasted from the 8th to the 11th centuries, Georgian society was organized as a network of personal ties, tying the king with the nobles of various classes. By the early 9th century, Georgia had already developed a system in which [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] was exchanged for [[benefice]]s. Unlike the countries of medieval Europe, where the three elements of political compromise \u2013 towns, feudal lords and the church \u2013 divided power among themselves and consequently promoted the development of strong centralized nation-States, in Georgia the towns were too weak and were deprived of rights, the feudal lords were too strong, and the church was nominally subjugated to the crown and politically less active.\n\nThe aristocratic [[Elite|\u00e9lite]] of this period was divided into two major classes: an upper noble whose dynastic dignity and feudal quality was expressed in the terms [[Tavadi]] and Didebuli, respectively; both of these terms were synonymous, from the 11th to the 14th centuries, with [[Eristavi]], and all three terms referred to one of the upper nobles, \"a [[Prince]]\". Lesser nobles, the [[Aznauri]], were either \"nobles of race\" or \"of patent\" who acquired their status in specific charters issued by the king or a lord. The power of the feudal nobles over the peasantry also increased and the cultivators began to loss a degree of personal freedom they had formerly enjoyed.\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Duchies of Kingdom of Georgia, XIII c.svg|thumb|Administrative division of the medieval Kingdom of Georgia in [[Georgian Golden Age|Georgian golden age]].|300x300px]]\n''[[Eristavi]]''<nowiki/>'s (dukes) were in charge of local governing. [[Saeristavo]] (duchy) was divided into [[Khevi (territorial unit)|Khevi]] ruled by ''Khevistavi'' (in mountainous regions - ''[[Khevisberi]]''). List of duchies at the time of reign [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]]: [[Principality of Svaneti|Svaneti]], [[Duchy of Racha|Racha-Takveri]]; [[Duchy of Tskhumi|Tskhumi]], [[Argveti|Artgveti]], [[Odishi]], [[Duchy of Kartli|Kartli]], [[Principality of Kakheti|Kakheti]], [[Principality of Hereti|Hereti]] and [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]].\n\nThe frontier regions were granted exceptional privileges and autonomous rights, and were governed by monapire eristavi (frontier governor). There were several [[Border|frontier]] (sanapiro) [[March (territorial entity)|marches]] estabelished specifically on southern districts: [[Gardabani (historic district)|Gagi]], [[Lori Province|Lore]], [[Duchy of Akhalkalaki|Akhalkalaki]], [[Ardahan Province|Artani]], [[Tao (historical region)|Panaskerti]], [[Gachiani]] and [[Kars|Kari]].\n\nFor their part, towns were governed by ''amiri'', while large cities by [[Amirtamira|''amirt-amiri'']]. All these arrangements were codified and systematised in special legislation - [[Regulations of the Georgian Royal Court|Regulations of the Royal Court]] - and codes of laws. The bishops and the churches were exempted from quitrents and duties.\n\nTribute extracted from the neighbors and war booty added to the royal treasury, giving rise to the saying that \"the peasants were like nobles, the nobles like princes, and the princes like kings.\"<ref>Suny, Ronald Grigor, The Making of the Georgian Nation.

To accomplish that goal, kings relied much on the prestige of the Church, and enrolled its political support by giving it many economical advantages, immunity from taxes and large appanages. At the same time, the kings, most notably [[David IV of Georgia|David the Builder]] (1089\u20131125), used state power to interfere in church affairs. Notably, he summoned the 1103 council of [[Urbnisi|Ruisi-Urbnisi]], which condemned Armenian [[Miaphysitism]] in stronger terms than ever before, and gave unprecedented power, second only to the Patriarch, to his friend and advisor [[George of Chqondidi]]. For the following centuries, the Church would remain a crucial feudal institution, whose economical and political power would always be at least equal to that of the main noble families.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Christianity was the central element of Georgian culture. Specific forms of art were developed in Georgia for religious purposes. Among them, [[Georgian calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] church singing, [[cloisonn\u00e9]] enamel icons, such as the [[Khakhuli triptych]], and the \"Georgian cross-dome style\" of architecture, which characterizes most medieval Georgian churches. The most celebrated examples of Georgian religious architecture of the time include the [[Gelati Monastery]] and [[Bagrati Cathedral]] in [[Kutaisi]], the [[Ikalto]] Monastery complex and Academy, and the [[Svetitskhoveli Cathedral]] in [[Mtskheta]].\n\nOutstanding Georgian representatives of Christian culture include [[Euthymius of Athos]] (Ekvtime Atoneli, 955\u20131028), [[George the Hagiorite|George of Athos]] (Giorgi Atoneli, 1009\u20131065), [[Arsen Ikaltoeli]] (11th century), and [[Ephrem Mtsire]], (11th century). Philosophy flourished between the 11th and 13th century, especially at the Academy of Gelati Monastery, where [[Ioane Petritsi]] attempted a synthesis of Christian, [[Peripatetic school|aristotelician]] and [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] thought.\n\nTamar's reign also marked the continuation of artistic development in the country commenced by her predecessors. While her contemporary Georgian chronicles continued to enshrine Christian morality, the religious theme started to lose its earlier dominant position to the highly original secular literature. This trend culminated in an [[Epic poetry|epic]] written by Georgia's national poet [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]] - ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'' (''Vepkhistq'aosani''). Revered in Georgia as the greatest achievement of native literature, the poem  celebrates the Medieval [[Humanism|humanistic]] ideals of [[chivalry]], friendship and [[courtly love]].\n\n==== Missionary activities ====\nFrom the 10th century, Georgians had started to play a significant role in preaching Christianity in the mountains of the Caucasus. \"Wherever the missions of the patriarchs of Constantinople, Rome, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem failed, the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Church]] succeeded in bringing Jesus's Cross and preaching His [[Gospel]]s\". This is corroborated not only by old written sources, but also by Christian architectural monuments bearing Georgian inscriptions, which are still to be seen throughout the North Caucasus in Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan, North Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkaria. The golden age of Georgian monasticism lasted from the 9th to the 11th century. During that period, Georgian monasteries were founded outside the country, most notably on [[Mount Sinai]], [[Mount Athos]] (the [[Iviron monastery]], where the [[Theotokos Iverskaya]] icon is still located), and in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Artistic inheritance ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Golden Theotokos from Khobi, Georgia 12th century.jpg|Golden Theotokos of [[Khobi|Khobi Monastery]], with some precious stones stolen by the communists \nFile:Georgia Khakhuli triptych.jpg|[[Khakhuli triptych|Tryptich of Khakhuli]]\nFile:Khakhuli icon.

For the fourth and final battle the Fifth Army's front had been compressed towards the coast to allow the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] and [[II Corps (Poland)|II Polish Corps]] to join the line. During this battle, launched 11 May 1944, the Corps attacked into the inhospitable [[Aurunci Mountains]] which the Germans had considered impassable by modern infantry. The progress made by the corps and in particular the lightly loaded [[goumiers]], capturing Monte Maio and pushing deep into the Aurunci, threatened the flanks of the German forces on their right in the [[Liri]] valley fighting against XIII Corps. The Germans were consequently forced to withdraw allowing XIII Corps to advance up the Liri valley and the Polish Corps on the right to occupy on 18 May the heights of Monte Cassino and the abbey reduced to rubble on top of it.{{sfn|Richard Natkiel|1985|p=114}}\n\n==Breaking of the Gustav Line==\n[[File:Moroccan soldiers at Monte Cassino.jpg|thumb|Moroccan goumiers at Monte Cassino]]\nIn his autobiography, [[Mark W. Clark]] describes how the FEC broke through the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] in May 1944.\n\n<blockquote>Meantime, the French forces had crossed the [[Garigliano]] (River) and moved forward into the mountainous terrain lying south of the [[Liri|Liri River]].  It was not easy.  As always, the German veterans reacted strongly and there was bitter fighting. The French surprised the enemy and quickly seized key terrain including Mounts Faito Cerasola and high ground near [[Castelforte]].  The 1st Motorized Division helped the 2nd Moroccan division take key Mount Girofano and then advanced rapidly north to S. Apollinare and S. Ambrogio.  In spite of the stiffening enemy resistance, the 2nd Moroccan Division penetrated the [[Gustav Line]] in less than two day\u2019s fighting. The next 48 hours on the French front were decisive.  The knife-wielding [[Goumiers]] swarmed over the hills, particularly at night, and General Juin\u2019s entire force showed an aggressiveness hour after hour that the Germans could not withstand.  Cerasola, San Giogrio, Mt. D\u2019Oro, [[Ausonia, Italy|Ausonia]] and [[Esperia]] were seized in one of the most brilliant and daring advances of the war in Italy, and by May 16 the French Expeditionary Corps had thrust forward some ten miles on their left flank to Mount Revole, with the remainder of their front slanting back somewhat to keep contact with the British 8th Army. For this performance, which was to be a key to the success of the entire drive on Rome, I shall always be a grateful admirer of General Juin and his magnificent FEC... The 8th Army\u2019s delay made Juin\u2019s task more difficult because he was moving forward so rapidly that his right flank---adjacent to the British---constantly was exposed to counter-attacks.<ref>[[Mark Wayne Clark]], ''Calculated risk'', Harper, 1950, p.348</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe battle for the Gustav Line had been difficult for the FEC. It had been involved in violent combat in the mountains. Then, while Clark entered [[Rome]], the FEC attacked the east of the city securing the road to [[Siena]] and capturing it. After the campaign, the soldiers were withdrawn to Africa to join the [[First Army (France)#1944\u20131945|Army B]] that had landed in southern France after [[Operation Dragoon]].\n==Casualties==\nThe casualties for the campaign were approximately 6,500 killed in action, 2,000 missing and 23,000 wounded.

Bimberg|1999|p=54}}\n\nIn the next two battles, much smaller affairs on a narrow front around Cassino town, the corps was not involved. For the fourth and final battle the Fifth Army's front had been compressed towards the coast to allow the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] and [[II Corps (Poland)|II Polish Corps]] to join the line. During this battle, launched 11 May 1944, the Corps attacked into the inhospitable [[Aurunci Mountains]] which the Germans had considered impassable by modern infantry. The progress made by the corps and in particular the lightly loaded [[goumiers]], capturing Monte Maio and pushing deep into the Aurunci, threatened the flanks of the German forces on their right in the [[Liri]] valley fighting against XIII Corps. The Germans were consequently forced to withdraw allowing XIII Corps to advance up the Liri valley and the Polish Corps on the right to occupy on 18 May the heights of Monte Cassino and the abbey reduced to rubble on top of it.{{sfn|Richard Natkiel|1985|p=114}}\n\n==Breaking of the Gustav Line==\n[[File:Moroccan soldiers at Monte Cassino.jpg|thumb|Moroccan goumiers at Monte Cassino]]\nIn his autobiography, [[Mark W. Clark]] describes how the FEC broke through the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] in May 1944.\n\n<blockquote>Meantime, the French forces had crossed the [[Garigliano]] (River) and moved forward into the mountainous terrain lying south of the [[Liri|Liri River]].  It was not easy.  As always, the German veterans reacted strongly and there was bitter fighting. The French surprised the enemy and quickly seized key terrain including Mounts Faito Cerasola and high ground near [[Castelforte]].  The 1st Motorized Division helped the 2nd Moroccan division take key Mount Girofano and then advanced rapidly north to S. Apollinare and S. Ambrogio.  In spite of the stiffening enemy resistance, the 2nd Moroccan Division penetrated the [[Gustav Line]] in less than two day\u2019s fighting. The next 48 hours on the French front were decisive.  The knife-wielding [[Goumiers]] swarmed over the hills, particularly at night, and General Juin\u2019s entire force showed an aggressiveness hour after hour that the Germans could not withstand.  Cerasola, San Giogrio, Mt. D\u2019Oro, [[Ausonia, Italy|Ausonia]] and [[Esperia]] were seized in one of the most brilliant and daring advances of the war in Italy, and by May 16 the French Expeditionary Corps had thrust forward some ten miles on their left flank to Mount Revole, with the remainder of their front slanting back somewhat to keep contact with the British 8th Army. For this performance, which was to be a key to the success of the entire drive on Rome, I shall always be a grateful admirer of General Juin and his magnificent FEC... The 8th Army\u2019s delay made Juin\u2019s task more difficult because he was moving forward so rapidly that his right flank---adjacent to the British---constantly was exposed to counter-attacks.<ref>[[Mark Wayne Clark]], ''Calculated risk'', Harper, 1950, p.348</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe battle for the Gustav Line had been difficult for the FEC. It had been involved in violent combat in the mountains. Then, while Clark entered [[Rome]], the FEC attacked the east of the city securing the road to [[Siena]] and capturing it. After the campaign, the soldiers were withdrawn to Africa to join the [[First Army (France)#1944\u20131945|Army B]] that had landed in southern France after [[Operation Dragoon]].\n==Casualties==\nThe casualties for the campaign were approximately 6,500 killed in action, 2,000 missing and 23,000 wounded. The combatants of the C.E.F. rest in the French military cemeteries of [[Monte Mario]] ([[Rome]]) and [[Venafro#The French Military Cemetery|Venafro]].\n\n== Triumph and disgrace ==\n\n=== Praised from Allied military leaders ===\nIn a letter to Marechal Juin, General Mark Clark paid tribute to the Tirailleur units and Goumiers of the CEF :\n\n<blockquote>For me, it has been a deep source of satisfaction to see how the vital part played by the French troops of the Fifth Army throughout our Italian campaign against the common enemy has been universally acknowledged. During these long months, I have had the real privilege of seeing for myself the evidence of the outstanding calibre of the French soldiers, heirs of the noblest traditions of the French Army. Nevertheless, not satisfied with this, you and all your people have added a new epic chapter to the history of France; you have gladdened the hearts of your compatriots, giving them comfort and hope as they languish under the heavy and humiliating yoke of a hated invader. . . .

The player takes the role of an assassin and uses attacks, dodges and stealth to pursue targets. The game is presented in a minimalist, low-poly, [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric perspective]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/mode-7-brings-tokyo-42-to-pc-and-consoles-in-2017|title=Mode 7 Brings Tokyo 42 to PC and Consoles in 2017|first=Mike|last=Williams|date=September 5, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/tokyo-42/tokyo-42-release-date  |title = Isometric action game Tokyo 42 releases May 31, gets trailer with 4.2 seconds of gameplay | first=  Richard | last = Scott-Jones | date = May 9, 2017 | accessdate = May 9, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe gameplay experience of '''''Tokyo 42''''' can be likened to that of a [[shoot 'em up]] game; The player must be aware of their surroundings as it is likely that enemy bullets will be coming in from multiple directions.\n\nThe player has a variety of weapons at their arsenal, from sniper rifles to grenades and even melee weapons such as [[Katanas]].\n\nThe camera angle can be rotated clockwise or counter clockwise by pressing \"E\" and \"Q\"' respectively.\n\n== Story ==\nThe main premise of the story is that the player plays as an inhabitant of an ultra futuristic version of the Japanese city [[Tokyo]] who is framed for murder. The player escapes a police chase in the tutorial and is now officially a wanted criminal on the run. The player's friend tells the player of a good way to exact revenge on the assassin that framed you, which is to become an assassin yourself and rise the ranks to eventually be able to take them down.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe release of the game was accompanied by an official 2 part soundtrack by Beat Vince. The feature track \"Go Go Go (feat. Genevieve Artadi)\" was very well received in the indie music community.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indieshuffle.com/beat-vince-go-go-go-ft-genevieve-artadi/}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline = '''Part 1'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Tokyo 42 - [Original Game Soundtrack] Part I, by Beat Vince |url=https://beatvince.bandcamp.com/album/tokyo-42-original-game-soundtrack-part-i |website=Beat Vince}}</ref>\n\n| all_music   = Beat Vince\n\n| title1      = Tokyo 42\n| length1     = 1:59\n\n| title2      = Go Go Go (Instrumental)\n| length2     = 3:09\n\n| title3      =  Everything in it's Place\n| length3     = 2:48\n\n| title4      = Kyrie\n| length4     = 4:20\n\n| title5      = Nanomed Overture\n| length5     = 1:55\n\n| title6      = Arrival\n| length6     = 1:44\n\n| title7      = Title Screen\n| length7     = 1:06\n\n| title8      = Go Go Go\n| note8       = Genevieve Artadi\n| length8     = 3:09\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline    = '''Part 2'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Tokyo 42 - [Original Game Soundtrack] Part II, by Beat Vince |url=https://beatvince.bandcamp.com/album/tokyo-42-original-game-soundtrack-part-ii |website=Beat Vince}}</ref>\n\n| all_music   = Beat Vince\n\n| title1      = Prologue\n| length1     = 2:31\n\n| title2      = Prologue Alert\n| length2     = 1:23\n\n| title3      = Nudist Colony\n| length3     = 2:25\n\n| title4      = Nudist Colony Alert\n| length4     = 1:02\n\n| title5      = Central Pt.

The player escapes a police chase in the tutorial and is now officially a wanted criminal on the run. The player's friend tells the player of a good way to exact revenge on the assassin that framed you, which is to become an assassin yourself and rise the ranks to eventually be able to take them down.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe release of the game was accompanied by an official 2 part soundtrack by Beat Vince. The feature track \"Go Go Go (feat. Genevieve Artadi)\" was very well received in the indie music community.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indieshuffle.com/beat-vince-go-go-go-ft-genevieve-artadi/}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline = '''Part 1'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Tokyo 42 - [Original Game Soundtrack] Part I, by Beat Vince |url=https://beatvince.bandcamp.com/album/tokyo-42-original-game-soundtrack-part-i |website=Beat Vince}}</ref>\n\n| all_music   = Beat Vince\n\n| title1      = Tokyo 42\n| length1     = 1:59\n\n| title2      = Go Go Go (Instrumental)\n| length2     = 3:09\n\n| title3      =  Everything in it's Place\n| length3     = 2:48\n\n| title4      = Kyrie\n| length4     = 4:20\n\n| title5      = Nanomed Overture\n| length5     = 1:55\n\n| title6      = Arrival\n| length6     = 1:44\n\n| title7      = Title Screen\n| length7     = 1:06\n\n| title8      = Go Go Go\n| note8       = Genevieve Artadi\n| length8     = 3:09\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline    = '''Part 2'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Tokyo 42 - [Original Game Soundtrack] Part II, by Beat Vince |url=https://beatvince.bandcamp.com/album/tokyo-42-original-game-soundtrack-part-ii |website=Beat Vince}}</ref>\n\n| all_music   = Beat Vince\n\n| title1      = Prologue\n| length1     = 2:31\n\n| title2      = Prologue Alert\n| length2     = 1:23\n\n| title3      = Nudist Colony\n| length3     = 2:25\n\n| title4      = Nudist Colony Alert\n| length4     = 1:02\n\n| title5      = Central Pt.
