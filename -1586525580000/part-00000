He started work at the age of 14 as an apprentice [[china painter]] at the [[Mintons|Minton Pottery]]. During the [[Great Depression|Depression]] he learnt to sculpt at [[Stoke-on-Trent College of Art]], which was opposite the Minton factory.

This was used for all British coins until 1984 and was also used on the coins of [[Rhodesia]] in 1964, coins of [[Canada]] from 1965 to 1989, [[Australia]] from 1966 to 1984 and [[New Zealand]] from 1967 to 1985. \n\nIn 1966 the Queen approved Machin's similar design for an effigy of her to be used on what came to be known as the \"[[Machin series]]\" of British [[Definitive stamp|definitive postage stamps]]. Machin produced a [[bas-relief]] in clay which, when combined with a different coloured background, is reminiscent of the overlaid decoration of potteries such as [[Wedgwood]]. The design was first used on the 4[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] stamp which was issued in June 1967, and has been used on all British definitive stamps (except more recent regional issues) since.

The effect lasts for about six months or longer.

For example, sometimes people can be sexually stimulated from residual arousal arising from something such as exercise, being transformed into another type of arousal such as sexual arousal. In one study<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cantor |first1=J.

They found that participants who were still experiencing excitatory residues from the exercise rated the film as more arousing than those who had fully recovered from the exercise. This suggests that the remaining arousal from the exercise was being transformed into sexual arousal without any external stimulation.\n\n== Alternative routes ==\nThe human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Whilst the most common forms of sexual stimulation discussed are [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]] or physical stimulation of the genitals and other erogenous areas, sexual arousal may also be mediated through alternative routes such as visual, olfactory and auditory means.\n\n=== Visual ===\nPerhaps the most researched non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Arnow | first1 = B.

Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of '[[Paraphilia|sexual deviation]]', it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar industry that is [[pornography]] is another example. A common presumption in society and the media is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] hypothesis that men are more prone to sexual arousal from visual stimulation than women<ref>Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., Martin, C. E., & Sloan, S. (1948). [[Sexual behavior in the human male]].</ref> and, arguably, can be seen depicted through the \"male gaze\"<ref>Mulvey, L. (1989).

In one study, visual stimulation was tested by means of an erotic video. Although significantly higher in the male group, sexual arousal was the main emotional reaction reported by both sexes.

Making sounds during sexual arousal and sexual activity is widespread among primates and humans. These include sighs, moans, strong expirations and inspirations, increased breathing rate and occasionally, at orgasm, screams of ecstasy. Many of these sounds are highly exciting to men and women, and act as strong reinforcers of sexual arousal, creating a powerful positive feedback effect.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = R.

Commercial erotic material (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to \"low moans\" for erotic effect. [[Vaudeville]] Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s \"Orgasm\" or [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[You Sure Love to Ball]]\" includes sounds of the female orgasm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corbett | first1 = J. | last2 = Kapsalis | first2 = T. | year = 1996 | title =  Aural Sex: The Female Orgasm in Popular Sound| url = | journal =  TDR| volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 102\u2013111 | doi=10.2307/1146553| jstor = 1146553 }}</ref> Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant.

Common sexual fantasies include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender.<ref name=\":3\" /> It's also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | last1 = Leitenberg | first1 = H. | last2 = Henning | first2 = K. | year = 1995 | title = Sexual fantasy | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 469\u2013496 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.469 | pmid = 7777650}}</ref>\n\nIt is useful for research because it makes differences between male and female heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour.

For example, sometimes people can be sexually stimulated from residual arousal arising from something such as exercise, being transformed into another type of arousal such as sexual arousal. In one study<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cantor |first1=J.

They found that participants who were still experiencing excitatory residues from the exercise rated the film as more arousing than those who had fully recovered from the exercise. This suggests that the remaining arousal from the exercise was being transformed into sexual arousal without any external stimulation.\n\n== Alternative routes ==\nThe human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Whilst the most common forms of sexual stimulation discussed are [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]] or physical stimulation of the genitals and other erogenous areas, sexual arousal may also be mediated through alternative routes such as visual, olfactory and auditory means.\n\n=== Visual ===\nPerhaps the most researched non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Arnow | first1 = B.

Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of '[[Paraphilia|sexual deviation]]', it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar industry that is [[pornography]] is another example. A common presumption in society and the media is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] hypothesis that men are more prone to sexual arousal from visual stimulation than women<ref>Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., Martin, C.

Making sounds during sexual arousal and sexual activity is widespread among primates and humans. These include sighs, moans, strong expirations and inspirations, increased breathing rate and occasionally, at orgasm, screams of ecstasy. Many of these sounds are highly exciting to men and women, and act as strong reinforcers of sexual arousal, creating a powerful positive feedback effect.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = R.

Commercial erotic material (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to \"low moans\" for erotic effect. [[Vaudeville]] Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s \"Orgasm\" or [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[You Sure Love to Ball]]\" includes sounds of the female orgasm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corbett | first1 = J. | last2 = Kapsalis | first2 = T. | year = 1996 | title =  Aural Sex: The Female Orgasm in Popular Sound| url = | journal =  TDR| volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 102\u2013111 | doi=10.2307/1146553| jstor = 1146553 }}</ref> Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant.

Fantasy has less social or safety limits than in real life situations. It gives people more freedom to experiment or think of things they could not necessarily try in real life and can be anything from imagining your spouse naked, to imagining a sexual experience with a mythical creature. Common sexual fantasies include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender.<ref name=\":3\" /> It's also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | last1 = Leitenberg | first1 = H. | last2 = Henning | first2 = K. | year = 1995 | title = Sexual fantasy | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 469\u2013496 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.469 | pmid = 7777650}}</ref>\n\nIt is useful for research because it makes differences between male and female heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour.

The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].'' Square Enix developed the remake as a multi-part series, with the first entry released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on April 10, 2020, with timed exclusivity for one year.\n\nPlayers control mercenary [[Cloud Strife]] as he and a group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose Shinra, a [[megacorporation]], from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time action]] with other strategic elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced in 2015 following years of fan requests and rumors. Several key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' aims to retell [[Final Fantasy VII#Plot|the story of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'']]. Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier turned mercenary who joins the  [[eco-terrorist]] group AVALANCHE to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. The game is a full [[Video game remake|remake]] with real-time polygonal graphics, as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n\nExploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves. The player can also assign these special abilities to shortcut buttons, allowing them to play entirely in real-time without pausing. Each special ability uses up a segment of the ATB bar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake still has ATB \u2026 kinda |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617105924/https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player can also switch between party members at any time.

Producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that while the game has more real-time elements, there would still be strategic elements, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Plot==\nCloud Strife is a former first-class SOLDIER, an elite class of fighters who work for the Shinra Electric Power Company which rules the world. Disillusioned with his former employer, Cloud joins Avalanche, an eco-terrorist organization, to bomb Shinra's energy reactors. Shinra drain spiritual energy from the planet, called mako, to provide power and create technologies. Cloud's terrorist cell is led by the temperamental Barret Wallace. After the first bombing Cloud is haunted by memories of Sephiroth, a mysterious and powerful former high-ranking SOLDIER. Cloud also becomes reacquainted with his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart who is affiliated with Avalanche and fights off strange ghost-like hooded creatures.\n\nAfter the second bombing, Cloud is split from everyone and meets Aerith Gainsborough who is being chased by Shinra. Aerith is the last descendant of the ancients who were the original stewards of the planet and have magical powers. Shinra believes they can use her power for gains. After finding Tifa, the group learn that Shinra plans to drop the plate where rich people live onto the slum where Avalanche hides in retaliation for the attacks on the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan with most of their terrorist cell being killed. Meanwhile Aerith, helping with evacuations, is caught by Shinra.\n\nWhile cleaning out the rubbles after the destruction of their slum, Tifa, Cloud and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they decide to attack Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she is subjected to anything like it. While saving Aerith, the group also rescues a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII who joins their fight. Aerith explains that the strange ghost-like hooded creatures the group has been fighting are called Whispers. Their job is to ensure destiny happens. If someone tries to change the future from what is meant to be, they will automatically correct it even if it means bringing someone back from the dead. Meanwhile Sephiroth steals an experiment from Shinra thought to be connected to the extinction of the ancients.\n\nOn their way to escape the headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra which makes his son Rufus the new leader of the company. Meanwhile the building becomes engulfed in Whispers. The group escape on a half-built highway while fighting off their pursuers, Cloud on a motorcycle and the rest in a truck. At the end of the highway the characters catch up to what appears to be a Sephiroth from an alternative timeline. Sephiroth offers the group the freedom to choose their own destiny if they can defeat the Whispers. Afterwards Sephiroth offers Cloud to join him. When Cloud refuses, Sephiroth gives him seven seconds to change whatever he wants. Cloud apparently goes back in time and [[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII|saves Zack Fair's life]] creating multiple unacknowledged time paradoxes.\n\nAfter Cloud returns to his group, they agree to continue chasing the Sephiroth from their own dimension despite no one having explained to them who he is.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> The game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> It features newly arranged and orchestrated tracks from the original game, in addition to original material such as \"Hollow\", a theme song by Uematsu.<ref name=\"Music\"/> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" />\n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nThe subtitle \"''Remake''\" was included to differentiate the game from its 1997 original. It was initially going to be story-related, but the team did not want to give the impression that it was a sequel or spin-off.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Rather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with \"Enlighten,\" a lighting engine licensed from software company [[Geomerics]].<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n==Release==\nRumors of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' remake appeared in 2014.<ref name=\"RemakeRumor\"/> It was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) during the [[PlayStation]] conference, and received a standing ovation.<ref name=\"GSremake\"/><ref name=\"4Govation\"/> [[Visual Works]] created the announcement trailer.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\" /> Square Enix's stock prices rose to their highest rating since November 2008, and the [[YouTube]] release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views in the following two weeks.<ref name=\"IGNstocks\" /><ref name=\"VIIRtrailer\" /> The game was next showcased at the 2015 PlayStation Experience, demonstrating cutscenes and gameplay from the opening sequence.<ref name=\"WiredPSE\"/>\n\nDuring the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary [[opening ceremony]] event hosted by Square Enix in [[Tokyo]] on January 31, 2017 \u2014 the 20th anniversary of ''Final Fantasy VII''\u2014 the game's first piece of CGI key art was unveiled, along with announcements for a collaboration event with ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GamaAnniversary\"/> On February 18, Nomura revealed two screenshots, showing off the updated [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]].<ref name=\"Magic2017showing\"/> Due to its lack of footage since 2015, switch to internal development, and other projects Nomura was involved in, there were concerns about the status of the project. Speaking following E3 2018, Nomura stated that the game was in development, with his full attention shifted to it when ''Kingdom Hearts III'' was completed.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/><ref name=\"Nomura2018b\"/>\n\nAfter years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast.

game]] developed and published by [[Square Enix]]. The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].'' Square Enix developed the remake as a multi-part series, with the first entry released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on April 10, 2020, with timed exclusivity for one year.\n\nPlayers control mercenary [[Cloud Strife]] as he and a group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose Shinra, a [[megacorporation]], from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time action]] with other strategic elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced in 2015 following years of fan requests and rumors. Several key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' aims to retell [[Final Fantasy VII#Plot|the story of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'']]. Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier turned mercenary who joins the  [[eco-terrorist]] group AVALANCHE to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. The game is a full [[Video game remake|remake]] with real-time polygonal graphics, as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n\nExploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves. The player can also assign these special abilities to shortcut buttons, allowing them to play entirely in real-time without pausing. Each special ability uses up a segment of the ATB bar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake still has ATB \u2026 kinda |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617105924/https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player can also switch between party members at any time.

Producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that while the game has more real-time elements, there would still be strategic elements, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Plot==\nCloud Strife is a former first-class SOLDIER, an elite class of fighters who work for the Shinra Electric Power Company which rules the world. Disillusioned with his former employer, Cloud joins Avalanche, an eco-terrorist organization, to bomb their energy reactors. Shinra drain spiritual energy from the planet, called mako, to provide power. Cloud's terrorist cell is led by the temperamental Barret Wallace. After the first bombing Cloud is haunted by memories of Sephiroth, a mysterious and powerful former high-ranking SOLDIER. Cloud also becomes reacquainted with his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart and fights off strange ghost-like hooded creatures.\n\nAfter the second bombing, Cloud is split from everyone and meets Aerith Gainsborough who is being chased by Shinra. Aerith is the last descendant of the ancients who were the original stewards of the planet and have magical powers. Shinra believes they can use her power for gains. After finding Tifa, the group learn that Shinra plans to drop the plate where rich people live onto the slum where Avalanche hides in retaliation for the attacks on the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan with most of their terrorist cell being killed. Meanwhile Aerith, helping with evacuations, is caught by Shinra.\n\nWhile cleaning out the rubbles after the desctruction of their slum, Tifa, Cloud and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they decide to attack Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she is subjected to anything like it. While saving Aerith, the group also rescues a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII who joins them. Aerith explains that the strange ghost-like hooded creatures the group has been fighting are called Whispers. Their job is to ensure destiny happens. If someone tries to change the future from what is meant to be, they will automatically correct it even if it means bringing someone back from the dead. Meanwhile Sephiroth steals an experiment from Shinra thought to be connected to the extinction of the ancients.\n\nOn their way to escape the headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra which makes his son Rufus the new leader of the company. Meanwhile the building becomes engulfed in Whispers. The group escape on a half-built highway while fighting off their pursuers, Cloud on a motorcycle and the rest in a truck. At the end of the highway the characters catch up to what appears to be a Sephiroth from an alternative timeline. Sephiroth offers the group the freedom to choose their own destiny if they can defeat the Whispers. Afterwards Sephiroth offers Cloud to join him. When Cloud refuses, Sephiroth gives him seven seconds to change whatever he wants. Cloud apparently goes back in time and [[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII|saves Zack Fair's life]] creating multiple unackowledged time paradoxes.\n\nAfter Cloud returns to his group, they agree to continue chasing the Sephiroth from their own dimension despite no one having explained to them who he is.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> The game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> It features newly arranged and orchestrated tracks from the original game, in addition to original material such as \"Hollow\", a theme song by Uematsu.<ref name=\"Music\"/> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" />\n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nThe subtitle \"''Remake''\" was included to differentiate the game from its 1997 original. It was initially going to be story-related, but the team did not want to give the impression that it was a sequel or spin-off.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Rather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with \"Enlighten,\" a lighting engine licensed from software company [[Geomerics]].<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n==Release==\nRumors of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' remake appeared in 2014.<ref name=\"RemakeRumor\"/> It was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) during the [[PlayStation]] conference, and received a standing ovation.<ref name=\"GSremake\"/><ref name=\"4Govation\"/> [[Visual Works]] created the announcement trailer.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\" /> Square Enix's stock prices rose to their highest rating since November 2008, and the [[YouTube]] release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views in the following two weeks.<ref name=\"IGNstocks\" /><ref name=\"VIIRtrailer\" /> The game was next showcased at the 2015 PlayStation Experience, demonstrating cutscenes and gameplay from the opening sequence.<ref name=\"WiredPSE\"/>\n\nDuring the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary [[opening ceremony]] event hosted by Square Enix in [[Tokyo]] on January 31, 2017 \u2014 the 20th anniversary of ''Final Fantasy VII''\u2014 the game's first piece of CGI key art was unveiled, along with announcements for a collaboration event with ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GamaAnniversary\"/> On February 18, Nomura revealed two screenshots, showing off the updated [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]].<ref name=\"Magic2017showing\"/> Due to its lack of footage since 2015, switch to internal development, and other projects Nomura was involved in, there were concerns about the status of the project. Speaking following E3 2018, Nomura stated that the game was in development, with his full attention shifted to it when ''Kingdom Hearts III'' was completed.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/><ref name=\"Nomura2018b\"/>\n\nAfter years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast. Kitase announced that the team had wanted to \"try something new\" on the State of Play broadcast by showing the trailer.<ref name=\"RemakeSoP\"/> The release date, March 3, 2020, was revealed the following month in a second teaser trailer during an orchestral concert dedicated to the [[Music of the Final Fantasy VII series|music of ''Final Fantasy VII'']] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"2020REL\"/> Further release details were announced at the company's [[E3 2019]] press conference, including different editions of ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeFirstInfo\"/> Kitase later clarified at the event that Square Enix had yet to determine the number of games in the ''Remake'' series, adding that they were in the process of planning the second installment.<ref name=\"RemakeScale\"/>\n\nAn extended gameplay showcase and demo was playable at E3 2019, demonstrating parts of the opening mission, including some of the exploration, combat system, and first boss battle. The playable demo has received a positive reception in early previews, with praise towards the graphics, gameplay and combat system.<ref name=\"metro\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake E3 2019 Preview -
