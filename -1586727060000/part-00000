For example, in cloud based architecture, data is replicated and moved frequently so the risk of unauthorized data recovery increases dramatically. Such as in the case of disposal of old equipment, reuse of drives, reallocation of storage space. The manner that data is replicated depends on the service level a customer chooses and on the service provided.  When encryption is in place it can ensure confidentiality. [[Crypto-shredding]] can be used when disposing of data (on a [[Disk encryption|disk]]).\n# The number of people with access to the data who could be compromised (e.g., bribed, or coerced) increases dramatically.  A single company might have a small team of administrators, network engineers, and technicians, but a cloud storage company will have many customers and thousands of servers, therefore a much larger team of technical staff with physical and electronic access to almost all of the data at the entire facility or perhaps the entire company.<ref>{{cite site|title=Top 10 Cheapest Wordpress Web Hosting Plans of Shine IT Solutions|url=https://conceptsmadeeasy.com/top-10-cheapest-wordpress-web-hosting-plans-of-shine-it-solutions/}}{{|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Decryption keys that are kept by the service user, as opposed to the service provider, limit the access to data by service provider employees. As for sharing multiple data in the cloud with multiple users, a large number of keys has to be distributed to users via secure channels for decryption, also it has to be securely stored and managed by the users in their devices. Storing these keys requires rather expensive secure storage. To overcome that, key-aggregate cryptosystem<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Key-Aggregate Cryptosystem for Scalable Data Sharing in Cloud Storage|journal = IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems|date = 2014-02-01|issn = 1045-9219|pages = 468\u2013477|volume = 25|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/TPDS.2013.112|first = Cheng-Kang|last = Chu|first2 = Sherman S.M.|last2 = Chow|first3 = Wen-Guey|last3 = Tzeng|first4 = Jianying|last4 = Zhou|first5 = Robert H.|last5 = Deng}}</ref> can be used.\n# It increases the number of networks over which the data travels.  Instead of just a local area network (LAN) or storage area network (SAN), data stored on a cloud requires a WAN (wide area network) to connect them both.\n# By sharing storage and networks with many other users/customers it is possible for other customers to access your data.  Sometimes because of erroneous actions, faulty equipment, a bug and sometimes because of criminal intent. This risk applies to all types of storage and not only cloud storage. The risk of having data read during transmission can be mitigated through encryption technology. Encryption in transit protects data as it is being transmitted to and from the cloud service.<ref>[https://www.multcloud.com/tutorials/transfer-files-from-one-onedrive-account-to-another.html Transfer files from one onedrive account to another].</ref> Encryption at rest protects data that is stored at the service provider. Encrypting data in an on-premises cloud service on-ramp system can provide both kinds of encryption protection.\n\n===Longevity===\n{{See also|Financial Analysis}}\n\nCompanies are not permanent and the services and products they provide can change.

One option is to use a private cloud instead of a public cloud (there are as well providers that offer private cloud storage). Another option is to ingest data in encrypted format where the key is hold within your on premise infrastructure. Access is often by use of cloud storage gateways that are on premise. Such gateways have options not only to encrypt and compress the data prior of transfer but as well mirror the storage across multiple cloud storage providers and remove the risk of a single providers shutdown. Gateways offer as well the option to cache data on a most recently used algorithm on premise. Along with data analytics data is cached and fetched on a most valuable form instead of recently used only form.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cloud collaboration]]\n*[[Cloud Data Management Interface]], better known as CDMI\n*[[Cloud database]]\n*[[Comparison of online backup services]]\n*[[File hosting service]]\n*[[Mobile cloud storage]]\n*[[Cooperative storage cloud]]\n*[[Google Cloud (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Cloud computing]]\n*[[Cloud research]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cloud computing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cloud Storage}}\n[[Category:Network file systems]]\n[[Category:Outsourcing]]\n[[Category:Cloud storage| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Model of computer data storage}}\n{{About|enterprise-level cloud data storage|consumer-level file hosting services|file hosting service}}\n'''Cloud storage''' is a model of [[computer data storage]] in which the [[digital data]] is stored in logical [[Pool (computer science)|pools]].

For example, in cloud based architecture, data is replicated and moved frequently so the risk of unauthorized data recovery increases dramatically. Such as in the case of disposal of old equipment, reuse of drives, reallocation of storage space. The manner that data is replicated depends on the service level a customer chooses and on the service provided.  When encryption is in place it can ensure confidentiality. [[Crypto-shredding]] can be used when disposing of data (on a [[Disk encryption|disk]]).\n# The number of people with access to the data who could be compromised (e.g., bribed, or coerced) increases dramatically.  A single company might have a small team of administrators, network engineers, and technicians, but a cloud storage company will have many customers and thousands of servers, therefore a much larger team of technical staff with physical and electronic access to almost all of the data at the entire facility or perhaps the entire company.<ref>{{cite web|title=US-CERT ICS-TIP-12-146-01 Targeted Cyber Intrusion and Detection Mitigation Strategies|url=ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/pruggiero/Sample%20Re-remediated%20Documents/ICS-TIP-12-146-01%20-%20 Cyber%20 Intrusion%20 Mitigation%20 Strategies .pdf}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Decryption keys that are kept by the service user, as opposed to the service provider, limit the access to data by service provider employees. As for sharing multiple data in the cloud with multiple users, a large number of keys has to be distributed to users via secure channels for decryption, also it has to be securely stored and managed by the users in their devices. Storing these keys requires rather expensive secure storage. To overcome that, key-aggregate cryptosystem<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Key-Aggregate Cryptosystem for Scalable Data Sharing in Cloud Storage|journal = IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems|date = 2014-02-01|issn = 1045-9219|pages = 468\u2013477|volume = 25|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/TPDS.2013.112|first = Cheng-Kang|last = Chu|first2 = Sherman S.M.|last2 = Chow|first3 = Wen-Guey|last3 = Tzeng|first4 = Jianying|last4 = Zhou|first5 = Robert H.|last5 = Deng}}</ref> can be used.\n# It increases the number of networks over which the data travels.  Instead of just a local area network (LAN) or storage area network (SAN), data stored on a cloud requires a WAN (wide area network) to connect them both.\n# By sharing storage and networks with many other users/customers it is possible for other customers to access your data.  Sometimes because of erroneous actions, faulty equipment, a bug and sometimes because of criminal intent. This risk applies to all types of storage and not only cloud storage. The risk of having data read during transmission can be mitigated through encryption technology. Encryption in transit protects data as it is being transmitted to and from the cloud service.<ref>[https://www.multcloud.com/tutorials/transfer-files-from-one-onedrive-account-to-another.html Transfer files from one onedrive account to another].</ref> Encryption at rest protects data that is stored at the service provider. Encrypting data in an on-premises cloud service on-ramp system can provide both kinds of encryption protection.\n\n===Longevity===\n{{See also|Financial Analysis}}\n\nCompanies are not permanent and the services and products they provide can change.

One option is to use a private cloud instead of a public cloud (there are as well providers that offer private cloud storage). Another option is to ingest data in encrypted format where the key is hold within your on premise infrastructure. Access is often by use of cloud storage gateways that are on premise. Such gateways have options not only to encrypt and compress the data prior of transfer but as well mirror the storage across multiple cloud storage providers and remove the risk of a single providers shutdown. Gateways offer as well the option to cache data on a most recently used algorithm on premise. Along with data analytics data is cached and fetched on a most valuable form instead of recently used only form.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cloud collaboration]]\n*[[Cloud Data Management Interface]], better known as CDMI\n*[[Cloud database]]\n*[[Comparison of online backup services]]\n*[[File hosting service]]\n*[[Mobile cloud storage]]\n*[[Cooperative storage cloud]]\n*[[Google Cloud (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Cloud computing]]\n*[[Cloud research]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cloud computing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cloud Storage}}\n[[Category:Network file systems]]\n[[Category:Outsourcing]]\n[[Category:Cloud storage| ]]\n", "name_user": "Concepts Made Easy", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eData security)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage"}

The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007 with the new headmaster Mr Brendan McLoughlin. The former headteacher Sister Mary Teresa RSM [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] was the last of the Sisters to be Head the school and ceased her duties in 2007, opting to remain as deputy chair of the Board of Governors. The school offered both [[GCSE]] and [[Advanced Level]] qualifications for male and female students.\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded by the Sisters of Mercy on 12 September 1957, originally known as ''Mater Misericordiae Grammar School''. It opened in the convent parlour of Quarry Brook House, former home of [[Meccano]] inventor and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Frank Hornby]], with only 16 eleven-year-old girls. The school eventually moved to the first small external section in January 1958. This section was formally blessed by Cardinal Heenan on 8 March in the same year. Due to the interest taken in it by the Bootle Education Committee, it rapidly grew in building size and pupil numbers, and became a voluntary aided [[Grammar School]] in September 1964, maintained by the Bootle Authority.\n\nThe school continued to run as a grammar school until November 1967, when the then [[Archbishop of Liverpool]], Dr Andrew Beck, approached the sisters to see if they would take over a nearby secondary school that had not yet opened,  St. Paul's Catholic Secondary Modern. They agreed, and in September 1968 it was annexed to their existing building. It was the first co-educational voluntary aided school in the Archdiocese, opened under the new title of ''Maricourt Catholic High School'', with Sister Mary Magdalen as headmistress. She retired at Christmas in 1989 and was succeeded by Sister Mary Teresa, who led the school until 2007. The school is now the largest Catholic secondary school in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]]. A jubilee mass was celebrated on 21 September 2007 in the [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]]. The chief celebrant was the [[Archbishop of Liverpool]], Patrick Kelly, with thousands of friends, students, past and present attending the ceremony to celebrate the milestone.\n\n==Sixth Form==\nThe [[Sixth Form]] at Maricourt was rated as gaining some of the highest [[Advanced Level]] results in [[Merseyside]] and stand consistently above the national average,<ref>{{cite web|title=Department for Education KS5 Results|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/cgi-bin/performancetables/school_10.pl?No=3434621&Type=LA&Begin=c1&Num=343&Phase=2&Year=10&Base=c|work=National Results}}</ref> as well as enjoying a regular 100% pass rate for Advanced Level students. Maricourt works alongside [[Maghull High School]] and [[Deyes High School]] to form the ''Maghull Collaborative'', in which students may study across these sixth forms to broaden the A-Level curriculum available within them. Facilities at Maricourt, based in Quarry Brook House, were subject to substantial refurbishment during the 2011 August Holidays with modified study areas as well as the conversion of one of Quarry Brook's larger first floor rooms into an Oratory for use by students.\n\n== School Grounds ==\nMaricourt is split across two sites, Newman Hall and Arnold Hall, upper and lower school respectively. Newman Hall, named in the honour of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[John Henry Newman]], is considered the school's main site and is home to both the administrative offices and most subject offices. School years 9 to 11 and the [[Sixth Form]] reside on this site for the majority of their lessons, and years 7 and 8 visit the site to use the available facilities, such as sports, drama and technology. Arnold Hall, previously the site of St Paul's Comprehensive, serves as the primary site for years 7 and 8, with sports facilities and rooms used by all students. Both sites have a large field used for recreation, physical education and sporting events. \n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Newman Maricourt Map.png|1000px|centre|Newman Hall]] -->\n\n==Mission and Ethos==\n{{Quote box\n| quote = '''''Maricourt seeks to  provide and sustain a living Roman Catholic community which is rooted in Christian values and where growth and knowledge, respect, love and friendship are shared by all.'''''\n| align = center\n}}\n\nThe mission statement is represented by a tree, symbolising Maricourt as a living community; with each year new people joining, whilst others move to the world of work or higher education. The school ethos fosters the development of each individual, a proper sense of self-worth, a sense of responsibility and respect for others. The school was founded in the tradition of the Sisters of Mercy, an institute founded for the service of those in need. Today, this is reflected in the school's intensive charity, such as the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool#Nugent Care Society|Good Shepherd Appeal]] and other local organisations.\n\n== Previous Headteachers ==\nSince its opening in 1957, the school has had four headteachers.

After unifying his country, on September 28, 1928, Bin Saud set about gaining international recognition for Saudi Arabia. The United Kingdom was the first country to recognize Saudi Arabia as an independent state, as the British had provided protection of Saudi territories from the Turks for many years (Wafa, 2005). Saud also hoped to be recognized by the US, which at that time had no interest in Saudi Arabia. Initially, his efforts were rebuffed, but Washington eventually came around, promoted by the fact that Al Saud had obtained recognition from many nations. In May 1931 the U.S. officially recognized Saudi Arabia by extending full diplomatic recognition.<ref name=Grayson-1982>{{cite book|last1=Grayson|first1=Benson Lee|title=Saudi-American relations|date=1982|publisher=University Press of America}}</ref><ref name=pbschr>{{cite news|title=Chronology|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saudi/etc/cron.html|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=PBS}}</ref> At the same time Ibn Saud granted a concession to the U.S. company, Standard Oil of California, allowing them to explore for oil in the country's Eastern Province, [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|al-Hasa]].<ref name=pbschr/> The company gave the Saudi government \u00a335,000 and also paid assorted rental fees and royalty payments.\n\nIn November 1931, a treaty was signed by both nations which included favored nation status. The relationship was still weak, however, as America did not have an interest in establishing missions in Saudi Arabia: at the time, Saudi affairs were handled by the U.S. delegation in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], and did not send a resident ambassador to the country until 1943.<ref name=Grayson-1982/>\n\nThe relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America was economically strengthened in 1933, whereas Standard Oil of California was permitted a concession to explore the Saudi Arabian lands for oil. The subsidiary of this company, regarded as California Arabian Standard Oil Company, later deemed [[Saudi Aramco]] proved the exploration to be fruitful in 1938 after finding oil for the first time. The relationship between the two nations strengthened throughout the next decade, establishing a full diplomatic relationship through a symbolic acceptance of an American envoy in Saudi Arabia. President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with King Abdulaziz on the USS Murphy in 1945, formally solidifying the friendship between the two nations. Saudi Arabia proved their willingness to carry out relations by staying neutral in World War II as well as by allowing the Allied powers to utilize their air space.\n\n===Foundation of ARAMCO===\nThe United States of America and Saudi Arabian trade relationship has long revolved around two central concepts: security and oil. Throughout the next two decades, signifying the 50s and 60s, relations between the two nations grew significantly stronger. In 1950 ARAMCO and Saudi Arabia agreed on a 50/50 profit distribution of the oil discovered in Saudi Arabia. In 1951 the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement was put into action, which allowed for the US arms trade to Saudi Arabia, along with a United States military training mission to be centered in the Saudi Land.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/05/saudi-relations-timeline-170518112421011.html|title=US-Saudi Relations: A Timeline|last=Chughtai|first=Alia|date=May 18, 2017|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=December 4, 2018}}</ref> The relationship between these two nations, in terms of trade, continued to prove of high value until 1973 when King Faisal concluded that Saudi Arabia would take part of the oil embargo, which posed as the first disagreement between Saudi Arabia and the United States. In 1974 the oil embargo between the United States and Saudi Arabia was eradicated, which allowed for the United States and Saudi Arabia to sign military contracts amassing in two billion dollars in the fiscal year of 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-103/issue-17/general-interest/the-oil-weapon-past-present-and-future.html|title=The Oil Weapon: Past, Present, and Future|last=Alhajji|first=Anas|publisher=Oil & Gas Journal|url-access=subscription|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref>\n\nAfter the promises that had been made by American oil explorers that Saudi Arabia could have a very good chance of finding oil, [[Al Saud]] accepted the American offer of exploration, because he was hoping that his land could have valuable materials that would support the country's economy. In May 1933 the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC), later called the [[Saudi Aramco|Arab American Company]] (ARAMCO), had started the exploration in the country with large area to explore (Alnabrab, 2008). Although the imported oil was not very important for the U.S. at the time, Washington seemed hungry for the Saudi oil since their confidence in finding oil in Saudi Arabia had greatly grown, which resulted in stronger relations with Saudi Arabia (Irvine, 1981).\n\nCASOC Struck oil near [[Dhahran]], but production over the next several years remained low\u2014only about 42.5 million barrels between 1941 and 1945; less than 1% of the output in the United States over the same time period. CASOC was later renamed the Arabian-American Oil Company ([[Saudi Aramco#History|Aramco]]).\n\n===World War II===\nAs the U.S.\u2013Saudi relationship was growing slowly, [[World War II]] was beginning its first phase. The U.S. was deeply involved in World War II, and as a result, US-Saudi relations were put on the 'back burner'. This negligence left Saudi Arabia vulnerable to attack. [[Italy]], an [[Axis powers|Axis]] power, bombed a CASOC oil installation in Dhahran crippling Saudi Arabia's oil production.<ref name=Grayson-1982/> This attack left Bin Saud scrambling for to find an external power that would protect the country, fearing further attacks that would most likely cease the country's oil production and the flow of pilgrims coming into [[Makkah]] to perform [[Hajj]], the base of the Saudi power and economy at that time (Wafa, 2005).\n\nHowever, as World War II progressed, the United States began to believe that Saudi oil was of strategic importance. As a result, in the interest of national security, the U.S. began to push for greater control over the CASOC concession. On 16 February 1943, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] declared that \"the defense of Saudi Arabia is vital to the defense of the United States\", thereby making possible the extension of the Lend-Lease program to the kingdom. Later that year, the president approved the creation of the state-owned Petroleum Reserves Corporation, with the intent that it purchase all the stock of CASOC and thus gain control of Saudi oil reserves in the region. However, the plan was met with opposition and ultimately failed. Roosevelt continued to court the government, however\u2014on 14 February 1945, he met with King Ibn Saud aboard the [[USS Quincy (CA-71)|USS Quincy]], discussing topics such as the countries' security relationship and the creation of a Jewish country in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]].\n\nBin Saud therefore approved the US's request to allow the U.S. air force to fly over and construct airfields in Saudi Arabia. The oil installations were rebuilt and protected by the U.S.,<ref name=Grayson-1982/> the pilgrims' routes were protected (Wafa, 2005), and the U.S. gained a much needed direct route for military aircraft heading to [[Iran]] and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=Grayson-1982/> The first American consulate was opened in Dhahran in 1944.<ref>{{cite journal|author=I.

In contrast, Saudi government and officials saw the U.S. forces as a major component of the Saudi military defense strategy.<ref name=Pollack-2002/> As a result, Bin Saud balanced the two conflicts by increasing the demands on U.S. forces in Dhahran when the region was highly threatened and lowering it when the danger declined (Alnabrab, 1994). At this time, due to the start of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. was greatly concerned about Soviet communism and devised a strategy of 'containing' the spread of communism within [[Arabian Peninsula]], putting Saudi security at the top of Washington's list of priorities.<ref name=Metz-1992>{{cite book|editor1-last=Metz|editor1-first=Helen Chapin|title=Saudi Arabia: A Country Study.|date=1992|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/}}</ref> [[Harry S.

During Saud's time the U.S.\u2013Saudi relations had faced many obstacles concerning the anti-communism strategy. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s new anti-Soviet alliance combined most of \"the kingdom's regional rivals and foes\", which heightened Saudi suspicions.<ref name=Grayson-1982/> For this reason, in October 1955, Saud had joined the pro-Soviet strategy with Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].<ref name=Pollack-2002/> Furthermore, Saud dismissed the U.S. forces and replaced them by Egyptian forces. Thus, this act had sparked and innovated a new and a large conflict in the relationship. But in 1956, during the [[Suez crisis]], Saud began to cooperate with the U.S. again after Eisenhower's opposition of the Israeli, British, and French plan to seize the canal. Eisenhower opposed the plan because of anti-Soviet purposes, but King Saud had admired the act and decided to start cooperating with the U.S.<ref name=Pollack-2002/> As a result, Egyptian power greatly declined while US-Saudi relations were simultaneously improving.\n\n===Cold War and Soviet containment===\nIn 1957, Saud decided to renew the [[King Abdulaziz Air Base|U.S. base in Dhahran]]. In less than a year, after the [[United Arab Republic|Egyptian\u2013Syrian unification]] in 1958, Egypt's pro-Soviet strategy had returned to power. Saud had once again joined their alliance, which declined the US-Saudi relationship to a fairly low point especially after he announced in 1961 that he changed his mind on renewing the U.S. base.<ref name=\"Hart 1998\"/> In 1962, however, Egypt attacked Saudi Arabia from bases in [[Yemen]] during the 1962 Yemeni revolution because of Saudi Arabia's Anti-revolution propaganda, which made Saud seek the U.S. support. President [[John F. Kennedy]] immediately responded to Saud's request by sending U.S. warplanes in July 1963 to the war zone to stop the attack which was putting U.S. interests at risk.<ref name=Pollack-2002/> At the end of the war, shortly before Prince Faisal became king, the relationship rebuilt itself to become healthy again.<ref name=\"Hart 1998\">{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=Parker T.|title=Saudi Arabia and the United States: Birth of a Security Partnership|date=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/saudiarabiaunite00hart|url-access=registration|quote=saudi arabia and the united states by parker t hart 1998.|accessdate=23 October 2014|isbn=0253334608}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[United Kingdom]] withdrew from the Gulf region in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. was reluctant to take on new security commitments.

In the Gulf region, this meant relying on Saudi Arabia and Iran as \"twin pillars\" of regional security.

The US, on the other hand, was not sure about the outcome of such unplanned change in the Saudi monarchy. Faisal, however, continued the cooperation with the US until October 20, 1973. Then came the low point of the relationship before 9/11, as Faisal decided to contribute in an oil embargo against the US and Europe in favor of the Arab position during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. That caused an [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis]] in the US.\n\n\"America's complete [[Israel]] support against the Arabs makes it extremely difficult for us to continue to supply the United States with oil, or even remain friends with the United States,\" said Faisal in an interview with international media.<ref>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~twod/oil-ns/articles/research-07/research-saudi/pollack.pdf</ref> <!-- By 1974, after a lot of changes that happened during that era, Saudi Arabia started pumping oil to the U.S. again. Although the embargo was not running for a long time, it truly had a great impact on the world's foreign policies and the U.S.\u2013Saudi relations (Kaiser & Ottaway 2002). -->\n\nDespite the tensions caused by the [[oil embargo]], the U.S. wished to resume relations with the Saudis. Indeed, the great oil wealth accumulated as a result of price increases allowed the Saudis to purchase large sums of American military technology.

The cooperation grew broader covering financial, educational, technological aspects both in Saudi Arabia and Muslim-like countries to prevent pro-Al-Qaeda terrorists' activities and ideologies. \"It is a high time for the Ulma (Muslim Scholars), and all thinkers, intellectuals, and academics, to shoulder their responsibilities towards the enlightenment of the people, especially the young people, and protect them from deviant ideas\" said Sheikh Saleh bin [[Abdulaziz Alsheikh]], Minister of Islamic Affairs, in the CTIC.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nAlmost all members of the CTIC agreed that Al-Qaeda target less educated Muslims by convincing them that they are warriors of God, but they really convince them to only accomplish their political goals.

Some of these criminals held high rank in terrorist society, which helped diffuse many terrorist cells (Alahmary, 2004).

After unifying his country, on September 28, 1928, Bin Saud set about gaining international recognition for Saudi Arabia. The United Kingdom was the first country to recognize Saudi Arabia as an independent state, as the British had provided protection of Saudi territories from the Turks for many years (Wafa, 2005). Saud also hoped to be recognized by the US, which at that time had no interest in Saudi Arabia. Initially, his efforts were rebuffed, but Washington eventually came around, promoted by the fact that Al Saud had obtained recognition from many nations. In May 1931 the U.S. officially recognized Saudi Arabia by extending full diplomatic recognition.<ref name=Grayson-1982>{{cite book|last1=Grayson|first1=Benson Lee|title=Saudi-American relations|date=1982|publisher=University Press of America}}</ref><ref name=pbschr>{{cite news|title=Chronology|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saudi/etc/cron.html|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=PBS}}</ref> At the same time Ibn Saud granted a concession to the U.S. company, Standard Oil of California, allowing them to explore for oil in the country's Eastern Province, [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|al-Hasa]].<ref name=pbschr/> The company gave the Saudi government \u00a335,000 and also paid assorted rental fees and royalty payments.\n\nIn November 1931, a treaty was signed by both nations which included favored nation status. The relationship was still weak, however, as America did not have an interest in establishing missions in Saudi Arabia: at the time, Saudi affairs were handled by the U.S. delegation in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], and did not send a resident ambassador to the country until 1943.<ref name=Grayson-1982/>\n\nThe relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America was economically strengthened in 1933, whereas Standard Oil of California was permitted a concession to explore the Saudi Arabian lands for oil. The subsidiary of this company, regarded as California Arabian Standard Oil Company, later deemed [[Saudi Aramco]] proved the exploration to be fruitful in 1938 after finding oil for the first time. The relationship between the two nations strengthened throughout the next decade, establishing a full diplomatic relationship through a symbolic acceptance of an American envoy in Saudi Arabia. President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with King Abdulaziz on the USS Murphy in 1945, formally solidifying the friendship between the two nations. Saudi Arabia proved their willingness to carry out relations by staying neutral in World War II as well as by allowing the Allied powers to utilize their air space.\n\n===Foundation of ARAMCO===\nThe United States of America and Saudi Arabian trade relationship has long revolved around two central concepts: security and oil. Throughout the next two decades, signifying the 50s and 60s, relations between the two nations grew significantly stronger. In 1950 ARAMCO and Saudi Arabia agreed on a 50/50 profit distribution of the oil discovered in Saudi Arabia. In 1951 the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement was put into action, which allowed for the US arms trade to Saudi Arabia, along with a United States military training mission to be centered in the Saudi Land.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/05/saudi-relations-timeline-170518112421011.html|title=US-Saudi Relations: A Timeline|last=Chughtai|first=Alia|date=May 18, 2017|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=December 4, 2018}}</ref> The relationship between these two nations, in terms of trade, continued to prove of high value until 1973 when King Faisal concluded that Saudi Arabia would take part of the oil embargo, which posed as the first disagreement between Saudi Arabia and the United States. In 1974 the oil embargo between the United States and Saudi Arabia was eradicated, which allowed for the United States and Saudi Arabia to sign military contracts amassing in two billion dollars in the fiscal year of 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-103/issue-17/general-interest/the-oil-weapon-past-present-and-future.html|title=The Oil Weapon: Past, Present, and Future|last=Alhajji|first=Anas|publisher=Oil & Gas Journal|url-access=subscription|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref>\n\nAfter the promises that had been made by American oil explorers that Saudi Arabia could have a very good chance of finding oil, [[Al Saud]] accepted the American offer of exploration, because he was hoping that his land could have valuable materials that would support the country's economy. In May 1933 the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC), later called the [[Saudi Aramco|Arab American Company]] (ARAMCO), had started the exploration in the country with large area to explore (Alnabrab, 2008). Although the imported oil was not very important for the U.S. at the time, Washington seemed hungry for the Saudi oil since their confidence in finding oil in Saudi Arabia had greatly grown, which resulted in stronger relations with Saudi Arabia (Irvine, 1981).\n\nCASOC Struck oil near [[Dhahran]], but production over the next several years remained low\u2014only about 42.5 million barrels between 1941 and 1945; less than 1% of the output in the United States over the same time period. CASOC was later renamed the Arabian-American Oil Company ([[Saudi Aramco#History|Aramco]]).\n\n===World War II===\nAs the U.S.\u2013Saudi relationship was growing slowly, [[World War II]] was beginning its first phase. The U.S. was deeply involved in World War II, and as a result, US-Saudi relations were put on the 'back burner'. This negligence left Saudi Arabia vulnerable to attack. [[Italy]], an [[Axis powers|Axis]] power, bombed a CASOC oil installation in Dhahran crippling Saudi Arabia's oil production.<ref name=Grayson-1982/> This attack left Bin Saud scrambling for to find an external power that would protect the country, fearing further attacks that would most likely cease the country's oil production and the flow of pilgrims coming into [[Makkah]] to perform [[Hajj]], the base of the Saudi power and economy at that time (Wafa, 2005).\n\nHowever, as World War II progressed, the United States began to believe that Saudi oil was of strategic importance. As a result, in the interest of national security, the U.S. began to push for greater control over the CASOC concession. On 16 February 1943, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] declared that \"the defense of Saudi Arabia is vital to the defense of the United States\", thereby making possible the extension of the Lend-Lease program to the kingdom. Later that year, the president approved the creation of the state-owned Petroleum Reserves Corporation, with the intent that it purchase all the stock of CASOC and thus gain control of Saudi oil reserves in the region. However, the plan was met with opposition and ultimately failed. Roosevelt continued to court the government, however\u2014on 14 February 1945, he met with King Ibn Saud aboard the [[USS Quincy (CA-71)|USS Quincy]], discussing topics such as the countries' security relationship and the creation of a Jewish country in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]].\n\nBin Saud therefore approved the US's request to allow the U.S. air force to fly over and construct airfields in Saudi Arabia. The oil installations were rebuilt and protected by the U.S.,<ref name=Grayson-1982/> the pilgrims' routes were protected (Wafa, 2005), and the U.S. gained a much needed direct route for military aircraft heading to [[Iran]] and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=Grayson-1982/> The first American consulate was opened in Dhahran in 1944.<ref>{{cite journal|author=I.

In contrast, Saudi government and officials saw the U.S. forces as a major component of the Saudi military defense strategy.<ref name=Pollack-2002/> As a result, Bin Saud balanced the two conflicts by increasing the demands on U.S. forces in Dhahran when the region was highly threatened and lowering it when the danger declined (Alnabrab, 1994). At this time, due to the start of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. was greatly concerned about Soviet communism and devised a strategy of 'containing' the spread of communism within [[Arabian Peninsula]], putting Saudi security at the top of Washington's list of priorities.<ref name=Metz-1992>{{cite book|editor1-last=Metz|editor1-first=Helen Chapin|title=Saudi Arabia: A Country Study.|date=1992|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/}}</ref> [[Harry S.

During Saud's time the U.S.\u2013Saudi relations had faced many obstacles concerning the anti-communism strategy. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s new anti-Soviet alliance combined most of \"the kingdom's regional rivals and foes\", which heightened Saudi suspicions.<ref name=Grayson-1982/> For this reason, in October 1955, Saud had joined the pro-Soviet strategy with Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].<ref name=Pollack-2002/> Furthermore, Saud dismissed the U.S. forces and replaced them by Egyptian forces. Thus, this act had sparked and innovated a new and a large conflict in the relationship. But in 1956, during the [[Suez crisis]], Saud began to cooperate with the U.S. again after Eisenhower's opposition of the Israeli, British, and French plan to seize the canal. Eisenhower opposed the plan because of anti-Soviet purposes, but King Saud had admired the act and decided to start cooperating with the U.S.<ref name=Pollack-2002/> As a result, Egyptian power greatly declined while US-Saudi relations were simultaneously improving.\n\n===Cold War and Soviet containment===\nIn 1957, Saud decided to renew the [[King Abdulaziz Air Base|U.S. base in Dhahran]]. In less than a year, after the [[United Arab Republic|Egyptian\u2013Syrian unification]] in 1958, Egypt's pro-Soviet strategy had returned to power.

The US, on the other hand, was not sure about the outcome of such unplanned change in the Saudi monarchy. Faisal, however, continued the cooperation with the US until October 20, 1973. Then came the low point of the relationship before 9/11, as Faisal decided to contribute in an oil embargo against the US and Europe in favor of the Arab position during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. That caused an [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis]] in the US.\n\n\"America's complete [[Israel]] support against the Arabs makes it extremely difficult for us to continue to supply the United States with oil, or even remain friends with the United States,\" said Faisal in an interview with international media.<ref>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~twod/oil-ns/articles/research-07/research-saudi/pollack.pdf</ref> <!-- By 1974, after a lot of changes that happened during that era, Saudi Arabia started pumping oil to the U.S. again. Although the embargo was not running for a long time, it truly had a great impact on the world's foreign policies and the U.S.\u2013Saudi relations (Kaiser & Ottaway 2002). -->\n\nDespite the tensions caused by the [[oil embargo]], the U.S. wished to resume relations with the Saudis. Indeed, the great oil wealth accumulated as a result of price increases allowed the Saudis to purchase large sums of American military technology. The embargo was lifted in March 1974 after the U.S. pressured Israel into negotiating with [[Syria]] over the [[Golan Heights]]. Three months later, \"Washington and Riyadh signed a wide-ranging agreement on expanded economic and military cooperation.\" In the 1975 fiscal year, the two countries signed $2 billion worth of military contracts, including an agreement to send Saudi Arabia 60 [[fighter jets]].<ref name=Gause-31>{{cite book|author=F.

In the 1940s, Swedes [[Arne Andersson]] and [[Gunder H\u00e4gg]] lowered the record to just over four minutes (4:01.4) while racing was curtailed during World War II in the combatant countries.  After the war,  [[John Landy]] of Australia and Britain's [[Roger Bannister]] vied to be the first to break the fabled [[four-minute mile]] barrier. Roger Bannister did it first on May 6, 1954, and John Landy followed 46 days later. By the end of the 20th century, the record had been lowered to the time of 3:43.13 run by [[Hicham El Guerrouj]] of [[Morocco]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iaaf.org/statistics/records/gender=M/allrecords/discipline=MILE/index.html |title=International Association of Athletics Federations |publisher=IAAF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nOn the women's side, the first sub-5:00 mile was achieved by Britain's [[Diane Leather]] 23 days after Bannister's first sub-4:00 mile. However, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) did not recognize women's records for the distance until 1967, when [[Anne Smith (middle-distance runner)|Anne Smith]] of Britain ran 4:37.0. The current women's world record, pending ratification, is 4:12.33 by [[Sifan Hassan]], set on July 12, 2019.\n\n==Men==\n<timeline>\n#>\nThe chart is clipped at 3:20 (200 seconds), and magnified by 3 (three pixels height equal 1 second)\n<#\nImageSize  = width:700 height:300 # The width can be changed without much harm (remember to change the PlotArea below too)\nPlotArea   = width:650 height:280 left:25 bottom:20\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1850 till:2000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:1850\n\nColors=\n  id:grid value: gray(0.5)\n\nLineData=\n  width: 0.1\n  color: grid\n  from: start till: end atpos: 30\n  from: start till: end atpos: 60\n  from: start till: end atpos: 90\n  from: start till: end atpos: 120\n  from: start till: end atpos: 150\n  from: start till: end atpos: 180\n  from: start till: 01/01/1960 atpos: 210\n  from: start till: 01/01/1960 atpos: 240\n  from: start till: end atpos: 270\nTextData=\n  pos:(0,30) text: \"3:30\"\n  pos:(0,60) text: \"3:40\"\n  pos:(0,90) text: \"3:50\"\n  pos:(0,120) text: \"4:00\"\n  pos:(0,150) text: \"4:10\"\n  pos:(0,180) text: \"4:20\"\n  pos:(0,210) text: \"4:30\"\n  pos:(0,240) text: \"4:40\"\n  pos:(0,270) text: \"4:50\"\n\nTextData=\n  fontsize: M\n  pos:(520,250)  textcolor: blue text: Amateurs\n  pos:(520,220)  textcolor: red text: Professionals\n  pos:(520,190)  textcolor: orange text: IAAF\n\nLineData=\n  width: 0.2\n  color: red\n  at: 26/07/1852 tillpos: 204\n  at: 28/09/1857 tillpos: 204\n  at: 12/07/1858 tillpos: 189\n  at: 27/10/1860 tillpos: 186.75\n  at: 11/07/1863 tillpos: 185.25\n  at: 23/04/1864 tillpos: 181.5\n  at: 19/08/1865 tillpos: 171.75\n  at: 19/08/1865 tillpos: 171.75\n  at: 14/05/1881 tillpos: 168.6\n  at: 23/08/1886 tillpos: 158.25\n\nLineData=\n  width: 0.2\n  color: blue\n  at: 02/09/1852 tillpos: 276.0\n  at: 03/11/1858 tillpos: 255.0\n  at: 15/11/1858 tillpos: 255.0\n  at: 24/11/1859 tillpos: 240.0\n  at: 23/05/1862 tillpos: 219.0\n  at: 10/03/1868 tillpos: 208.8\n  at: 03/04/1868 tillpos: 206.4\n  at: 31/03/1873 tillpos: 205.8\n  at: 30/05/1874 tillpos: 198.0\n  at: 19/06/1875 tillpos: 193.5\n  at: 16/08/1880 tillpos: 189.6\n  at: 03/06/1882 tillpos: 178.2\n  at: 21/06/1884 tillpos: 175.2\n  at: 26/08/1893 tillpos: 173.4\n  at: 06/07/1895 tillpos: 171.0\n  at: 28/08/1895 tillpos: 166.8\n  at: 27/05/1911 tillpos: 154.2\nLineData=\n  width: 0.2\n  color: orange\n  at: 31/05/1913 tillpos: 163.2\n  at: 16/07/1915 tillpos: 157.8\n  at: 23/08/1923 tillpos: 151.2\n  at: 04/10/1931 tillpos: 147.6\n  at: 15/07/1933 tillpos: 142.8\n  at: 16/06/1934 tillpos: 140.4\n  at: 28/08/1937 tillpos: 139.2\n  at: 01/07/1942 tillpos: 138.6\n  at: 10/07/1942 tillpos: 138.6\n  at: 04/09/1942 tillpos: 133.8\n  at: 01/07/1943 tillpos: 127.8\n  at: 18/07/1944 tillpos: 124.8\n  at: 17/07/1945 tillpos: 124.2\n  at: 06/05/1954 tillpos: 118.2\n  at: 21/06/1954 tillpos: 114.0\n  at: 19/07/1957 tillpos: 111.6\n  at: 06/08/1958 tillpos: 103.5\n  at: 27/01/1962 tillpos: 103.2\n  at: 17/11/1964 tillpos: 102.3\n  at: 09/06/1965 tillpos: 100.8\n  at: 17/07/1966 tillpos: 93.9\n  at: 23/06/1967 tillpos: 93.3\n  at: 17/05/1975 tillpos: 93.0\n  at: 12/08/1975 tillpos: 88.2\n  at: 17/07/1979 tillpos: 87.0\n  at: 01/07/1980 tillpos: 86.4\n  at: 19/08/1981 tillpos: 85.59\n  at: 26/08/1981 tillpos: 85.2\n  at: 28/08/1981 tillpos: 81.99\n  at: 27/07/1985 tillpos: 78.96\n  at: 05/09/1993 tillpos: 73.17\n  at: 07/07/1999 tillpos: 69.39\n\n</timeline>\n\n=== Pre-IAAF ===\n\n===Professionals===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Time !!Athlete !!Nationality !!Date !!Venue\n|-\n|'''4:28'''|| [[Charles Westhall]] || {{GBR}} || 26 July 1855|| [[London]] \n|-\n|'''4:28'''|| [[Thomas Horspool]] || {{GBR}} || 28 September 1857 || [[Manchester]]\n|-\n|'''4:23'''|| Thomas Horspool || {{GBR}} || 12 July 1858|| Manchester \n|-\n|'''4:22{{frac|1|4}}'''|| [[Siah Albison]] || {{GBR}} || 27 October 1860|| Manchester\n|-\n|'''4:21{{frac|3|4}}'''|| [[William Lang (British athlete)|William Lang]]|| {{GBR}} || 11 July 1863 || Manchester\n|-\n|'''4:20{{frac|1|2}}'''|| Edward Mills|| {{GBR}} || 23 April 1864 || Manchester\n|-\n|'''4:20'''|| Edward Mills|| {{GBR}} || 25 June 1864|| Manchester \n|-\n|'''4:17{{frac|1|4}}'''|| William Lang|| {{GBR}} || 19 August 1865|| Manchester \n|-\n|'''4:17{{frac|1|4}}'''|| William Richards|| {{GBR}} || 19 August 1865|| Manchester\n|-\n|'''4:16{{frac|1|5}}'''|| [[William Cummings (athlete)|William Cummings]] || {{GBR}} || 14 May 1881|| Preston\n|-\n|'''4:12{{frac|3|4}}'''|| [[Walter George (athlete)|Walter George]]|| {{GBR}} || 23 August 1886|| London \n|}\n\n===Amateurs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Time !!Athlete !!Nationality !!Date !!Venue\n|-\n|'''4:55'''|| [[J.

Castle & Cooke rapidly became one of the largest companies in Hawaii, investing in shipping, railroad construction, sugar production and seafood packing. The other half of Dole's corporate heritage, the '''Hawaiian Pineapple Company''', was founded in 1901 by [[James Dole]], who opened his first pineapple plantation in the central plateau of the Hawaiian island of [[Oahu]]. [[Sanford Dole]], the cousin of James, had been president of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] from 1894 after the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] (her last monarch, [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]]), and first governor of the [[Territory of Hawaii]] until 1903.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole,%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |title= Dole, Sanford Ballard office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-01-20 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120306203149/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole%2C%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |archivedate= 2012-03-06 }}</ref>\nThe annexation of Hawaii to the United States made selling agricultural products to the mainland much more profitable, since they would never be subject to import [[tariff]]s.\n\nIn 1932, Castle & Cooke purchased a 21% interest in the Hawaiian Pineapple Company. In the 1960s, Castle & Cooke acquired the remainder of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company and the [[Standard Fruit Company]]. In 1976, it acquired Bud Antle Inc., a California-based lettuce and celery farmer; it was renamed Dole Fresh Vegetables in 1989. The company was renamed \"The Dole Food Company, Inc\" in 1991.

Castle & Cooke rapidly became one of the largest companies in Hawaii, investing in shipping, railroad construction, sugar production and seafood packing. The other half of Dole's corporate heritage, the '''Hawaiian Pineapple Company''', was founded in 1901 by [[James Dole]], who opened his first pineapple plantation in the central plateau of the Hawaiian island of [[Oahu]]. [[Sanford Dole]], the cousin of James, had been president of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] from 1894 after the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] (her last monarch, [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]]), and first governor of the [[Territory of Hawaii]] until 1903.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole,%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |title= Dole, Sanford Ballard office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-01-20 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120306203149/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole%2C%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |archivedate= 2012-03-06 }}</ref>\nThe annexation of Hawaii to the United States made selling agricultural products to the mainland much more profitable, since they would never be subject to import [[tariff]]s.\n\nIn 1932, Castle & Cooke purchased a 21% interest in the Hawaiian Pineapple Company.

It had an aluminium body (some had steel bodies), a Salisbury differential, four-wheel independent suspension, and [[vacuum servo]]-assisted [[Girling brakes|Girling]] [[disc brake]]s all round.

A number of revisions and refinements were made due to the suggestions of the Neri and Bonacini racing development shop and test driver Bob Wallace.  Fixed headlights replaced the prototype's rotationally hidden variety, and twin-barrel side-draught [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 40 DCOE 2 [[carburetor|carburettors]] reduced the height of the engine, thereby negating the clearance problems of the GTV prototype, and giving the car the exceptionally low hood line Ferruccio desired.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Chassis===\n\nAs was the case with the motor, Bizzarrini's GTV \"racing\" chassis design was the basis of Dallara's 350&nbsp;GT \"street\" chassis.

The first 350&nbsp;GT frame was fabricated by [[Neri and Bonacini]], who continued to act as Lamborghini's chassis supplier until production of the 350&nbsp;GT was underway, when the job was turned over to Marchesi.<ref>[[Lamborghini 400GT Monza]]</ref>  Chassis and bodies were mated at Touring, which then delivered the complete assemblies{{mdash}}with even the bumpers in place{{mdash}}to the Lamborghini factory.  The cars could be ordered in these [http://www.400gt.com/misc/350colors.jpg colors]. \n\nThe first 350&nbsp;GT chassis and body, delivered to the Lamborghini factory on March 9, 1964, was named No. 101 (Touring No. 17001).  That same month No. 101 debuted at the Geneva show.  The first customer delivery of a 350&nbsp;GT was No. 104 (Touring No. 17004), delivered on July 31, 1964.\n\nLamborghini produced one hundred-twenty 350&nbsp;GTs before replacing it with the [[Lamborghini 400 GT]] in 1966.<ref name=Lambo_350GT/>  Many 350&nbsp;GTs were subsequently fit with the larger 4.0 litre engine used in the 400 GT.\n\n==Specifications==\nThe 350&nbsp;GT had an all-[[aluminium alloy]] V12 engine mated to a [[list of ZF transmissions#5-speed longitudinal|five-speed ZF]] [[manual transmission]]. It had an aluminium body (some had steel bodies), a Salisbury differential, four-wheel independent suspension, and [[vacuum servo]]-assisted [[Girling brakes|Girling]] [[disc brake]]s all round.

A number of revisions and refinements were made due to the suggestions of the Neri and Bonacini racing development shop and test driver Bob Wallace.  Fixed headlights replaced the prototype's rotationally hidden variety, and twin-barrel side-draught [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 40 DCOE 2 [[carburetor|carburettors]] reduced the height of the engine, thereby negating the clearance problems of the GTV prototype, and giving the car the exceptionally low hood line Ferruccio desired.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Chassis===\n\nAs was the case with the motor, Bizzarrini's GTV \"racing\" chassis design was the basis of Dallara's 350&nbsp;GT \"street\" chassis.

The chapter was later retitled \"A Cuckoo in the Nest\". A character also uses the phrase in Chapter 22 of her 1953 book \"After the Funeral\". The phrase was also used by a character in early editions of Christie's novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (originally released under the title ''Ten Little Niggers''), but was changed in later editions to ''There's a [[fly in the ointment]]''. As late as 1952, in the novel ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'', published in the U.S. as ''Murder with Mirrors,'' she has a character use the phrase. It appears in editions published as late as 1985.  In her 1970 novel ''[[Passenger to Frankfurt]]'', she has a character use the phrase in chapter 23.\n\n[[W. C. Fields]] used variations of this phrase in two of his films: In ''[[You Can't Cheat an Honest Man]]'' (1939) he said there was \"an Ubangi in the fuel supply\", and in ''[[My Little Chickadee]]'' (1940) he said there was \"an Ethiopian in the fuel supply\".\n\nIn the song, \"This Could Be True\", [[Pat Kirkwood (actress)|Pat Kirkwood]] and [[Graham Payn]] sing the phrase in [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s 1950 musical ''[[Ace of Clubs (musical)|Ace of Clubs]]''.\n\nPopular western author [[Louis L'Amour]] used a variant in ''Crossfire Trail'' (1954): \"Now there seemed to be a larger African in the woodpile, or several of them.\"\n\nPopular music group [[Supertramp]] used the phrase in the lyrics of their 1971 song 'Potter'. English band [[10cc]] also used the phrase in their song 'The Second Sitting for the Last Supper' from their album [[The Original Soundtrack]] from 1975.\n\nThe phrase declined in use during the 20th century, and now the occasional use of this phrase by public figures has often been followed by controversy and apology.\n\nIn July 2008, the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]], [[David Cameron]], was urged to sack Conservative peer [[Lord Dixon-Smith]], who said in the [[House of Lords]] that concerns about government housing legislation were \"the nigger in the woodpile\".

The chapter was later retitled \"A Cuckoo in the Nest\". A character also uses the phrase in Chapter 22 of her 1953 book \"After the Funeral\". The phrase was also used by a character in early editions of Christie's novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (originally released under the title ''Ten Little Niggers''), but was changed in later editions to ''There's a [[fly in the ointment]]''. As late as 1952, in the novel ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'', published in the U.S. as ''Murder with Mirrors,'' she has a character use the phrase. It appears in editions published as late as 1985.  In her 1970 novel ''[[Passenger to Frankfurt]]'', she has a character use the phrase in chapter 23.\n\n[[W. C. Fields]] used variations of this phrase in two of his films: In ''[[You Can't Cheat an Honest Man]]'' (1939) he said there was \"an Ubangi in the fuel supply\", and in ''[[My Little Chickadee]]'' (1940) he said there was \"an Ethiopian in the fuel supply\".\n\nIn the song, \"This Could Be True\", [[Pat Kirkwood (actress)|Pat Kirkwood]] and [[Graham Payn]] sing the phrase in [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s 1950 musical ''[[Ace of Clubs (musical)|Ace of Clubs]]''.\n\nPopular western author [[Louis L'Amour]] used a variant in ''Crossfire Trail'' (1954): \"Now there seemed to be a larger African in the woodpile, or several of them.\"\n\nPopular music group [[Supertramp]] used the phrase in the lyrics of their 1971 song 'Potter'. English band [[10cc]] also used the phrase in their song 'The Second Sitting for the Last Supper' from their album [[The Original Soundtrack]] from 1975.\n\nThe phrase declined in use during the 20th century, and now the occasional use of this phrase by public figures has often been followed by controversy and apology.\n\nIn July 2008, the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]], [[David Cameron]], was urged to sack Conservative peer [[Lord Dixon-Smith]], who said in the [[House of Lords]] that concerns about government housing legislation were \"the nigger in the woodpile\".
