Unlike ordinary inmates, they were not normally subject to arbitrary, random killing by guards. Their livelihood and utility was determined by how efficiently they could keep the Nazi death factory running.{{sfn|Sofsky|2013|pp=271\u2013273}} As a result, ''Sonderkommando'' members survived marginally longer in the death camps than other prisoners \u2014 but few survived the war.\n\nAs they had intimate knowledge of the Nazis' policy of mass murder, the ''Sonderkommando'' were considered ''Geheimnistr\u00e4ger'' \u2014 bearers of secrets \u2014 and as such, were held in isolation away from prisoners being used as slave labor (see [[SS Main Economic and Administrative Office]]).{{sfn|Greif|2005|p=4}} Every three months, according to SS policy, almost all the ''Sonderkommandos'' working in the death camps' killing areas would be gassed themselves and replaced with new arrivals to ensure secrecy. However, some inmates survived for up to a year or more because they possessed specialist skills.{{sfn|Greif|2005|p=327}} Usually the task of a new ''Sonderkommando'' unit would be to dispose of the bodies of their predecessors.

For months, young Jewish women had been smuggling small packets of  [[gunpowder]] out of the Weichsel-Union-Metallwerke, a munitions factory in an industrial area between the Auschwitz I main camp and Auschwitz II.

[[Miklos Nyiszli]], in ''Auschwitz: A Doctor\u2019s Eyewitness Account'', described the ''Sonderkommando'' as enjoying a virtual feast, complete with chandeliers and candlelight, as other prisoners died of starvation. Nyiszli, an admitted collaborator who assisted [[Josef Mengele]] in his medical experiments on Auschwitz prisoners, would appear to have been in a good position to observe the ''Sonderkommando'' in action, as he had an office in Krematorium II; and yet, the significant inaccuracy of some of his physical descriptions of the crematoria diminishes his credibility in this regard. Historian [[Gideon Greif]] characterized Nyiszli's writings as among the \u201cmyths and other wrong and defamatory accounts\u201d of the ''Sonderkommando'' that flourished in the absence of first-hand testimony by surviving ''Sonderkommando'' members.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Greif |first1=Gideon | last2=Kilian | first2=Andreas | authorlink2=Andreas Kilian | title=Forschung: Significance, responsibility, challenge: Interviewing the Sonderkommando survivors | website=sonderkommando-studien.de | date=25 September 2011 | url=http://www.sonderkommando-studien.de/artikel.php?c=forschung/significance | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925214658/http://www.sonderkommando-studien.de/artikel.php?c=forschung/significance | archive-date=25 September 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Primo Levi]], in ''[[The Drowned and the Saved]]'', characterizes the ''Sonderkommando'' as being a step away from collaborators.

It has been said that he could have based his description of them on Nyiszli.\n\n[[Filip M\u00fcller]] was one of the few ''Sonderkommando'' members who survived the war, and was also unusual in that he served on the ''Sonderkommando'' far longer than most. He wrote of his experiences in his 1979 book ''Eyewitness Auschwitz: Three Years in the Gas Chambers''.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=180}} Among other incidents he related, M\u00fcller recounted how he tried to enter the gas chamber to die with a group of his countrymen, but was dissuaded from suicide by a girl who asked him to remain alive and bear witness.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=113}}\nIn the last several years, several other more sympathetic accounts of the ''Sonderkommando'' have been published, beginning with Gideon Greif\u2019s own book ''[[We Wept Without Tears]]'', which consists of exhaustive, and sometimes grueling, interviews with former ''Sonderkommando'' members. Greif includes as his prologue the poem \u201cAnd What Would You Have Done?\u201d by [[Gunther Anders]], which makes the point that one who has not been in that situation has little right to judge the ''Sonderkommando'': \u201cNot you, not me!

[[Miklos Nyiszli]], in ''Auschwitz: A Doctor\u2019s Eyewitness Account'', described the ''Sonderkommando'' as enjoying a virtual feast, complete with chandeliers and candlelight, as other prisoners died of starvation. Nyiszli, an admitted collaborator who assisted [[Josef Mengele]] in his medical experiments on Auschwitz prisoners, would appear to have been in a good position to observe the ''Sonderkommando'' in action, as he had an office in Krematorium II; and yet, the significant inaccuracy of some of his physical descriptions of the crematoria diminishes his credibility in this regard. Historian [[Gideon Greif]] characterized Nyiszli's writings as among the \u201cmyths and other wrong and defamatory accounts\u201d of the ''Sonderkommando'' that flourished in the absence of first-hand testimony by surviving ''Sonderkommando'' members.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Greif |first1=Gideon | last2=Kilian | first2=Andreas | authorlink2=Andreas Kilian | title=Forschung: Significance, responsibility, challenge: Interviewing the Sonderkommando survivors | website=sonderkommando-studien.de | date=25 September 2011 | url=http://www.sonderkommando-studien.de/artikel.php?c=forschung/significance | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925214658/http://www.sonderkommando-studien.de/artikel.php?c=forschung/significance | archive-date=25 September 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Primo Levi]], in ''[[The Drowned and the Saved]]'', characterizes the ''Sonderkommando'' as being a step away from collaborators. Nevertheless, he asks his readers to refrain from condemnation: \u201cTherefore I ask that we meditate upon the story of \u2018the crematorium ravens\u2019 with pity and rigor, but that judgment of them be suspended.\u201d <ref>{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Primo|title=The Drowned and the Saved|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P66RkjLLASsC|year=1989|publisher=Vintage International|isbn=978-0-679-72186-4|publication-place=New York|page=60}}</ref> Levi, whose time at Auschwitz was spent at Camp III/Monowitz (also known as the Buna Werke), may not have directly encountered the ''Sonderkommando''. It has been said that he could have based his description of them on Nyiszli.\n\n[[Filip M\u00fcller]] was one of the few ''Sonderkommando'' members who survived the war, and was also unusual in that he served on the ''Sonderkommando'' far longer than most. He wrote of his experiences in his 1979 book ''Eyewitness Auschwitz: Three Years in the Gas Chambers''.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=180}} Among other incidents he related, M\u00fcller recounted how he tried to enter the gas chamber to die with a group of his countrymen, but was dissuaded from suicide by a girl who asked him to remain alive and bear witness.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=113}}\nIn the last several years, several other more sympathetic accounts of the ''Sonderkommando'' have been published, beginning with Gideon Greif\u2019s own book ''[[We Wept Without Tears]]'', which consists of exhaustive, and sometimes grueling, interviews with former ''Sonderkommando'' members. Greif includes as his prologue the poem \u201cAnd What Would You Have Done?\u201d by [[Gunther Anders]], which makes the point that one who has not been in that situation has little right to judge the ''Sonderkommando'': \u201cNot you, not me!

For centuries, Vojvodina was ruled by several European powers, but Vojvodina Serbs never assimilated into cultures of those countries. Thus, they have consistently been a recognized indigenous ethnic minority with its own culture, language and religion. According to the 2011 census, there were 1,289,635 Serbs in Vojvodina or 66.76% of the population of the province.\n\n==History==\n===Early medieval period===\nBefore the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest in the 1st century BC, [[Celt]]ic tribes inhabited the territory of present-day [[Vojvodina]] region. During the Roman rule, the original inhabitants were heavily Romanized.\n\nThe [[Slavs]] ([[Severians|Severans]], [[Abodrites]], [[Brani\u010devci]] and [[Timo\u010dani]]) settled today's Vojvodina during the early medieval migrations. Until the 13th century, the region had a dominant [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] population.\n\nIn the 9th century the region of present-day Vojvodina was ruled by the two local Bulgaro-Slavic [[duke]]s ([[Voivode]]s). Their names were [[Salan]] and [[Glad (duke)|Glad]]. Salan ruled the territory of [[Ba\u010dka]], and his capital city was [[Titel]], while Glad ruled the territory of [[Banat]]. The descendant of Glad was [[Ahtum]], another local duke of Banat, the last ruler who opposed to the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 11th century. The important local Bulgaro-Slavic duke was also [[Sermon (ruler)|Sermon]], a vassal of the Bulgarian emperor [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuil]], who ruled over [[Srem (region)|Srem]] in the 11th century.\n\n===Hungarian rule===\n{{see also|Rascians|Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Stefan Dragutin|Serbian despots}}\n[[File:StefanDragutin.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Stefan Dragutin]], king of [[Srem (region)|Srem]] (1282\u20131316)]]\nParts of Vojvodina were conquered by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the 10th and 12th centuries. This was followed by the destruction of the local Slavic tribal organization and introduction of the county system of rule. The first known prefect of the Ba\u010d county (in the region of [[Ba\u010dka]]) was recorded in 1074 and his name was Vid, which is a Slavic name by origin. During the rule of the Hungarian king [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]] (1095\u20131116), the local Serb nobles in Ba\u010dka were Uro\u0161, Vukan and Pavle. A record from 1309 speak about \"Schismatics\" ([[Eastern Orthodox Christians]]), who lived in Ba\u010dka. [[Arsenije I Bogdanovi\u0107 from Srem]], the second Serb archbishop (1233\u20131263) after [[Saint Sava]], was born in [[Srem (region)|Srem]], in the village [[Dabar (village)|Dabar]] near [[Stari Slankamen|Slankamen]]. After the creation of an autocephalous [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1219 and negotiations between Archbishop [[Sveti Sava|Sava]] and the Hungarian crown, the Eastern Orthodox Slavic population north of the Danube was subjected under its jurisdiction.\n\nFrom 1282 to 1316 Serbian King [[Stefan Dragutin]] [[Nemanji\u0107]] reigned several lands as a \"King of Syrmia\". The center of his realm was in \"Lower Syrmia\" (modern [[Ma\u010dva]]), while he also possibly ruled \"Upper Syrmia\" (i.e. Syrmian part of Vojvodina).<ref>R.

By 1483, according to a Hungarian source, as much as half of the population of the Vojvodina territory of the Kingdom of Hungary at the time consisted of Serbs. The Hungarian kings encouraged the immigration of Serbs to the Kingdom, and hired many of them as soldiers and border guards. A letter of King Matthias from 12 January 1483 mentions that 200,000 Serbs had settled the Hungarian kingdom in the last four years.<ref name=\"Darby1966\">{{cite book|author=Henry Clifford Darby|title=Short History of Yugoslavia |url=https://books.google.rs/books?id=_G43AAAAIAAJ&dq=Short+History+of+Yugoslavia&hl=sr&source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=1968|publisher=CUP Archive|page=103}}</ref> Despot Vuk and his warriors were greatly rewarded with estates, also including places in Croatia.

The residence of the despots was [[Kupinovo|Kupinik]] (today Kupinovo) in [[Srem (region)|Srem]]. The Serbian despots were: [[Vuk Grgurevi\u0107]] (1471\u20131485), [[\u0110or\u0111e Brankovi\u0107]] (1486\u20131496), [[Jovan Brankovi\u0107]] (1496\u20131502), [[Ivani\u0161 Berislav]] (1504\u20131514), [[Stevan Berislav]] (1520\u20131535), [[Radi\u010d Bo\u017ei\u0107]] (1527\u20131528), [[Pavle Baki\u0107]] (1537) and [[Stefan \u0160tiljanovi\u0107]] (1537\u20131540). The last three did not rule in the territory of present-day Vojvodina, but had possessions in the territories of present-day [[Romania]], [[Hungary]] and [[Croatia]]. The fact that Despots of Serbia ruled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina, but also the presence of large Serb population, are reasons because of which in many historical records and maps made between 15th and 18th centuries, territory of present-day Vojvodina was named ''[[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Rascia]]'' ([[Ra\u0161ka (state)|Ra\u0161ka]], [[Serbia]]) and ''Little Ra\u0161ka'' (Little Serbia).\n\nA 1542 document describes that \"Serbia\" stretched from Lipova and [[Timi\u0219oara]] to the Danube, while a 1543 document that Timi\u0219oara and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] being located \"in the middle of Rascian land\" (''in medio Rascianorum'').<ref name=PI.4-8>{{cite book|title=Posebna izdanja|volume=4\u20138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZASAAAAIAAJ|year=1952|publisher=Nau\u010dno delo|p=32}}</ref> At that time, the majority language in the region between [[Mure\u0219 (river)|Mure\u0219]] and [[K\u00f6r\u00f6s]] was indeed Serbian.<ref name=PI.4-8/> Apart from Serbian being the main language of the Banat population, there were 17 Serbian monasteries active in Banat at that time.{{sfn|Rascia|1996|p=2}} The territory of Banat had received a Serbian character and was called \"Little Rascia\".<ref name=\"Maleti\u0107Bo\u017eovi\u01071989\">{{cite book|author1=Mihailo Maleti\u0107|author2=Ratko Bo\u017eovi\u0107|title=Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Srbija|volume=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ba8qAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=NIRO \"Knji\u017eevne novine\"|p=46}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Slavs Vojvodina02 map.png|Slavs (including Serbs) in Vojvodina, 7th century\nFile:Kingdom of syrmia according to stanoje stanojevic.png|Realm of [[Stefan Dragutin]], 13th-14th century, according to the book of historian Stanoje Stanojevi\u0107\nFile:Serbian empire06 map.png|Serbian Empire of [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], 1526-1527\nFile:Radoslav celnik01.png|Duchy of Syrmia of Radoslav \u010celnik in 1527-1530\nFile:Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 in the 16th and 17th century.png|Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 (16th-17th century)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{Main|History of Ottoman Serbia|Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Sanjak of Segedin|Sanjak of Syrmia}}\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] took control of Vojvodina following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] of 1526 and the conquest of [[Banat]] in 1552. Soon after the Battle of Moha\u010d, [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], a leader of the Serb mercenaries, established his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Srem (region)|Srem]]. He created an ephemeral independent state, with [[Subotica]] as its capital. At the pitch of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself \"Serbian Emperor\" in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. \"Emperor\" Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed.\n\nAfter the assassination of Jovan Nenad, the general commander of his army, [[Radoslav \u010celnik]], moved with part of the former emperor's army from Ba\u010dka to Srem, and acceded into the Ottoman service. Radoslav \u010celnik then ruled over Srem as Ottoman vassal and took for himself the title of the duke of Srem, while his residence was in [[Stari Slankamen|Slankamen]].\n\nThe establishment of the Ottoman rule caused a massive depopulation of the Vojvodina region. Most of the Hungarians and many local Serbs fled from the region and escaped to the north. The majority of those who left in the region were Serbs, mainly now engaging either in farming either in Ottoman military service.\n\nUnder Ottoman policy, many Serbs were newly settled in the region. During the Ottoman rule, most of the inhabitants of the Vojvodina region were Serbs. In that time, villages were mostly populated with Serbs, while cities were populated with [[Muslims]] and [[Serbs]]. In 1594 Serbs in [[Banat]] started a [[Uprising in Banat|large uprising]] opposing Turkish rule. This was one of three largest Serbian uprisings in history, and the largest one before the [[First Serbian Uprising]] led by [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:South slavic vojv map.png|Ethnic territory of the South Slavs between 16th and 18th century (according to Jovan Cviji\u0107 and Dr [[Du\u0161an J.

Serbs were a recognized nation in the Habsburg Monarchy.]]\nThe [[Habsburg Monarchy]] took control of Vojvodina among other lands by the treaties of [[Treaty of Karlowitz|Karlovci]] (1699) and [[Treaty of Passarowitz|Po\u017earevac]] (1718). The Serbian [[patriarch]], [[Arsenije III \u010carnojevi\u0107]], fearing the revenge of the Turks, immigrated in the last decade of the 17th century to the Habsburg Monarchy with as many as 36,000 families, but these Serbs mostly went further to the north and settled in the territory of what is now Republic of Hungary with only small part of them settling in the territory of present-day north-western Vojvodina. However, because of this event, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Emperor]] promised religious freedom to all Serbs in the Monarchy as well as the right to elect their own \"[[Voivode|vojvoda]]\" (military and civil governor). Much of the area of present-day Vojvodina where Serbs lived was incorporated into the Military Frontier. The emperor also recognized Serbs as one of the official nations of the Habsburg Monarchy and he recognized the right of Serbs to have territorial autonomy within one separate voivodeship. This right, however, was not realized before the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolution in 1848\u20131849]]. The immigration of Serbs to the Habsburg Monarchy was maintained during the 18th century.\n\nDuring the [[Kurucs|Kuruc War]] (1703\u20131711) of [[Francis II Rakoczi]], the territory of present-day Vojvodina was a battlefield between Hungarian rebels and local Serbs who fought on the side of the Habsburg Emperor. Serbs in [[Ba\u010dka]] suffered the greatest losses. Hungarian rebels burned Serb villages and many Serbs were expelled from Ba\u010dka. [[Darvas]], the prime military commander of the Hungarian rebels, which fought against Serbs in Ba\u010dka, wrote: \"We burned all large places of ''[[Raci (ethnonym)|Rascia]]'', on the both banks of the rivers [[Danube]] and [[Tisza|Tisa]]\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nDuring the Austrian rule many non-Serbs also settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina. They were mainly ([[Catholic Germans|Catholic]]) [[Ethnic German|Germans]] and [[Magyar people|Hungarians]], but also [[Pannonian Rusyns|Ruthenians]], [[Slovaks]], [[Czechs]],\n[[Poles]], [[Romanians]], and others. Because of this immigration, Vojvodina became one of the most ethnically diverse regions of [[Europe]]. However, there was also some emigration of Serbs from Vojvodina: after the Tisa-Mori\u0161 section of the Military Frontier was abolished, Serbs from the north-eastern parts of Ba\u010dka left this region and immigrated to [[Russia]] (notably to [[Nova Serbia]] and [[Slavo-Serbia]]) in 1752, and this region was then populated with new Hungarian settlers. Serbs, however, remained the single largest ethnic group in Vojvodina, until the second half of 20th century, when they became the absolute majority.\n\nBetween the 16th and 19th centuries, Vojvodina was a cultural centre of the Serb people. Especially important cultural centres were: [[Novi Sad]], [[Sremski Karlovci]], and the monasteries of [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]]. In the first half of the 19th century, Novi Sad was the largest Serb city; in 1820 this city had about 20,000 inhabitants, of whom 2/3 were Serbs. The [[Matica Srpska]] moved to Novi Sad from [[Budapest]] in 1864. The Serbian gymnasiums of Novi Sad and [[Sremski Karlovci]] were at the time considered to be among the best in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. [[Novi Sad]] was being called the \"Serb [[Athens]]\".\n[[File:The May Assembly 1848 in Sremski Karlovci.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Proclamation of [[Serbian Vojvodina]] \u2013 [[May Assembly]] in 1848 in Sremski Karlovci]]\n\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the Hungarians demanded national rights and autonomy within the Austrian Empire. However, they did not recognized the national rights of other peoples which lived in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in that time. Wishing to express their national individuality and confronted with the new Hungarian authorities, [[Serbs]] declared the constitution of the ''[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]]'' (Serbian Duchy) at the May Assembly in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (May 13\u201315, 1848). The Serbian Voivodship consisted of [[Srem (region)|Srem]], [[Ba\u010dka]], [[Banat]], and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] regions. The Serbs also formed a political alliance with the [[Croats]] \"based on freedom and perfect equality\". They also recognized the [[Romanians|Romanian]] nationality. The metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]], was elected [[patriarch]], while [[Stevan \u0160upljikac]] the first [[Voivode]] ([[duke]]). A National committee was formed as the new government of the ''Serbian Voivodship''. Instead of the old feudal regime a new reign was founded based on the national boards with the Head [[Serbian National Board]] presiding.\n\nThe Hungarian government replied by the use of force: on June 12, 1848, a war between Serbs and Hungarians started. Austria took the side of Hungary at first, demanding from the Serbs to \"go back to being obedient\". Serbs were aided by volunteers from autonomous Ottoman [[Principality of Serbia]]. A consequence of this war, was the expansion of the conservative factions. Since the Austrian court turned against the Hungarians in the later stage of revolution, the feudal and clerical circles of Serbian Voivodship formed an alliance with Austria and became a tool of the [[Vienna|Viennese]] government. Serbian troops from the Voivodship then joined the Habsburg army and helped in crushing the revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Hungarian revolution, by a decision of the Austrian [[emperor]], in November 1849, an Austrian crown land known as the ''[[Voivodship of Serbia and Tami\u0161 Banat]]'' was formed as the political successor of the Serbian Voivodship. The crown land consisted of the parts of [[Banat]], [[Ba\u010dka]] and [[Srem (region)|Srem]] regions. An Austrian governor seated in [[Temi\u0161var]] ruled the area, and the title of voivod (duke) belonged to the emperor himself. The full title of the emperor was \"[[Grosswojwod|Grand Voivod]] of the Voivodship of Serbia\" (German: ''Gro\u00dfwoiwode der Woiwodschaft Serbien''). Even after this crown land was abolished, the emperor kept this title until the end of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in 1918.\n[[File:\u0417\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0458\u0435, \u0421\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438, \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[The Patriarchate Court, Sremski Karlovci|The Patriarchate Court]] in Sremski Karlovci]]\n\nIn 1860 the Voivodship of Serbia and Tami\u0161 Banat was abolished and most of its territory (Banat and Ba\u010dka) was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, although direct Hungarian rule began only in 1867, when the Kingdom of Hungary gained autonomy within the newly formed [[Austria-Hungary]]. Unlike Banat and Ba\u010dka, the Srem region was in 1860 incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]], another separate Habsburg crown land. However, the Kingdom of Slavonia was too incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary in 1868.\n\nAfter the Voivodship was abolished, one Serb politician, [[Svetozar Mileti\u0107]], appeared in the political sphere. He demanded national rights for Serbs and other non-Hungarian peoples of the Kingdom of Hungary, but he was arrested and imprisoned because of his political demands. In 1867, the Austrian Empire was transformed into Austria-Hungary, with the Kingdom of Hungary becoming one of two autonomous parts of the new state. This was followed by a policy of [[Magyarization|Hungarization]] of the non-Hungarian nationalities, most notably promotion of the [[Hungarian language]] and suppression of [[Slavic languages]] (including Serbian).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe [[Suffrage|franchise]] was greatly restricted so as to keep power in the hands of the Hungarians. The new government of the autonomous Kingdom of Hungary, took the stance that the Kingdom of Hungary should be a Hungarian [[nation state]], and that all other peoples living in the Kingdom: [[ethnic German|Germans]], [[Jew]]s, [[Romanian people|Romanians]], [[Poles]], [[Slovaks]], [[Ruthenians|Ruthenes]], [[Serbs]], and others should be assimilated. Finally, the privileges given to Serbs by the Habsburg emperor in 1690, were abolished in 1912.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vojvodina18 19 cen.png|Vojvodina, 18th-19th century - Districts of Potisje and Velika Kikinda, Military Frontier sections in Banat, Ba\u010dka and Syrmia and Kingdom of Slavonia\nFile:Vojvodina03.png|Proclaimed borders of the [[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]], 1848\nFile:Vojvodina front lines 1848 1849.png|Frontlines in Vojvodina in 1848-1849\nFile:Serbia02.png|[[Voivodship of Serbia and Tami\u0161 Banat]] and [[Principality of Serbia]], 1849\n</gallery>\n\n===Yugoslavia and Serbia===\n:See also: [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]], [[Treaty of Trianon]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], [[Danube Banovina]], [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941\u20131944]], [[Banat, 1941-1944]], [[Hungarian occupation of Baranja and Ba\u010dka, 1941\u20131944]], [[1942 raid in Novi Sad]], [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (1945\u20131963)]], [[SAP Vojvodina]]\n[[File:Velika-narodna-skupstina-1918.jpg|thumb|250px|Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci, and other nations of Vojvodina in Novi Sad proclaimed the unification of Vojvodina region with the Kingdom of Serbia, 1918.]]\n\nAt the end of [[World War I]], the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, and the Serbs in Vojvodina gained another opportunity to achieve their political demands. On November 25, 1918, the Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci, and other nations of Vojvodina in [[Novi Sad]] proclaimed the unification of Vojvodina (Banat, Ba\u010dka, and Baranja) with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. One day before this, on November 24, the Assembly of Srem also proclaimed the unification of Srem with Serbia. On December 1, 1918, the Vojvodina region became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. After the several centuries of living under foreign rule (Hungarian, Ottoman, Habsburg), the Vojvodinian Serbs now lived in a country together with other [[Serbs]] and [[South Slavs]]. That marked a new stage in the national development of the Serb people in the Vojvodina region.\n\nThe difficult time period for the Serbs in Vojvodina was a [[World War II]] and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] occupation (1941\u20131944), when Vojvodina region was held by the [[Germany|German]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Croatia]]n occupational forces. The occupying powers committed numerous crimes against the ethnic Serb population in the region. It is estimated that during the occupation, about 50,000 people in Vojvodina (mostly [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and Roma) were murdered, while more than 280,000 people were interned, arrested, violated or tortured.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe Axis occupation ended in 1944 and the autonomous province of Vojvodina (incorporating Srem, Banat and Ba\u010dka) was formed within [[Yugoslavia]] in 1945 as a part of [[Serbia]]. The province was created as a territorial autonomy for all peoples who live in it, with the significant role of the Serbs, who were ethnic majority in the province.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Serbia1918.png|Unification of Vojvodina with Serbia, 1918\nFile:Occupation of vojvodina.png|Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944\nFile:Serbia01.png|Vojvodina within [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], 1945-1989\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!Year\n!Serbs\n!Percentage\n!Total Population<br />of Vojvodina\n|- \n|1910 || 510,186|| 33.8%|| 1,512,983\n|- \n|1921 || 526,134|| 34.7%|| 1,528,238\n|- \n|1931 || 528,000|| 33.0%|| 1,624,158\n|- \n|1941 || 577,067|| 35.3%|| 1,636,367\n|-\n|1948 || 841,246|| 50.6%|| 1,663,212\n|- \n|1953 || 865,538|| 50.9%|| 1,699,545\n|- \n|1961 || 1,017,713|| 54.9%|| 1,854,965\n|- \n|1971 || 1,089,132|| 55.8%|| 1,952,535\n|- \n|1981 || 1,107,735|| 54.4%|| 2,034,772\n|- \n|1991 || 1,151,353|| 57.2%|| 2,012,517\n|-\n|2002 || 1,321,807|| 65.0%|| 2,031,992\n|-\n|2011 || 1,289,635|| 66.7%|| 1,931,809\n|-\n|}\n\n<gallery>\nFile: Vojvodina ethnic2011.png|Serbs in Vojvodina according to the 2011 census\nFile: Vojvodina ethnic2011 serbs.png| Percentage of Serbs in municipalities of Vojvodina according to the 2011 census\n</gallery>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Building of the Matica srpska, Novi Sad.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Matica Srpska]]]]\n[[File:Serbia-0296 - Serbian National Theatre.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Serbian National Theatre]]]]\n* [[Matica Srpska]], the oldest cultural-scientific institution of Serbs.

For centuries, Vojvodina was ruled by several European powers, but Vojvodina Serbs never assimilated into cultures of those countries. Thus, they have consistently been a recognized indigenous ethnic minority with its own culture, language and religion. According to the 2011 census, there were 1,289,635 Serbs in Vojvodina or 66.76% of the population of the province.\n\n==History==\n===Early medieval period===\nBefore the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest in the 1st century BC, [[Celt]]ic tribes inhabited the territory of present-day [[Vojvodina]] region. During the Roman rule, the original inhabitants were heavily Romanized.\n\nThe [[Slavs]] ([[Severians|Severans]], [[Abodrites]], [[Brani\u010devci]] and [[Timo\u010dani]]) settled today's Vojvodina during the early medieval migrations. Until the 13th century, the region had a dominant [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] population.\n\nIn the 9th century the region of present-day Vojvodina was ruled by the two local Bulgaro-Slavic [[duke]]s ([[Voivode]]s). Their names were [[Salan]] and [[Glad (duke)|Glad]]. Salan ruled the territory of [[Ba\u010dka]], and his capital city was [[Titel]], while Glad ruled the territory of [[Banat]]. The descendant of Glad was [[Ahtum]], another local duke of Banat, the last ruler who opposed to the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 11th century. The important local Bulgaro-Slavic duke was also [[Sermon (ruler)|Sermon]], a vassal of the Bulgarian emperor [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuil]], who ruled over [[Srem (region)|Srem]] in the 11th century.\n\n===Hungarian rule===\n{{see also|Rascians|Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Stefan Dragutin|Serbian despots}}\n[[File:StefanDragutin.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Stefan Dragutin]], king of [[Srem (region)|Srem]] (1282\u20131316)]]\nParts of Vojvodina were conquered by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the 10th and 12th centuries. This was followed by the destruction of the local Slavic tribal organization and introduction of the county system of rule. The first known prefect of the Ba\u010d county (in the region of [[Ba\u010dka]]) was recorded in 1074 and his name was Vid, which is a Slavic name by origin. During the rule of the Hungarian king [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]] (1095\u20131116), the local Serb nobles in Ba\u010dka were Uro\u0161, Vukan and Pavle. A record from 1309 speak about \"Schismatics\" ([[Eastern Orthodox Christians]]), who lived in Ba\u010dka. [[Arsenije I Bogdanovi\u0107 from Srem]], the second Serb archbishop (1233\u20131263) after [[Saint Sava]], was born in [[Srem (region)|Srem]], in the village [[Dabar (village)|Dabar]] near [[Stari Slankamen|Slankamen]]. After the creation of an autocephalous [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1219 and negotiations between Archbishop [[Sveti Sava|Sava]] and the Hungarian crown, the Eastern Orthodox Slavic population north of the Danube was subjected under its jurisdiction.\n\nFrom 1282 to 1316 Serbian King [[Stefan Dragutin]] [[Nemanji\u0107]] reigned several lands as a \"King of Syrmia\". The center of his realm was in \"Lower Syrmia\" (modern [[Ma\u010dva]]), while he also possibly ruled \"Upper Syrmia\" (i.e. Syrmian part of Vojvodina).<ref>R.

By 1483, according to a Hungarian source, as much as half of the population of the Vojvodina territory of the Kingdom of Hungary at the time consisted of Serbs. The Hungarian kings encouraged the immigration of Serbs to the Kingdom, and hired many of them as soldiers and border guards. A letter of King Matthias from 12 January 1483 mentions that 200,000 Serbs had settled the Hungarian kingdom in the last four years.<ref name=\"Darby1966\">{{cite book|author=Henry Clifford Darby|title=Short History of Yugoslavia |url=https://books.google.rs/books?id=_G43AAAAIAAJ&dq=Short+History+of+Yugoslavia&hl=sr&source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=1968|publisher=CUP Archive|page=103}}</ref> Despot Vuk and his warriors were greatly rewarded with estates, also including places in Croatia.

The residence of the despots was [[Kupinovo|Kupinik]] (today Kupinovo) in [[Srem (region)|Srem]]. The Serbian despots were: [[Vuk Grgurevi\u0107]] (1471\u20131485), [[\u0110or\u0111e Brankovi\u0107]] (1486\u20131496), [[Jovan Brankovi\u0107]] (1496\u20131502), [[Ivani\u0161 Berislav]] (1504\u20131514), [[Stevan Berislav]] (1520\u20131535), [[Radi\u010d Bo\u017ei\u0107]] (1527\u20131528), [[Pavle Baki\u0107]] (1537) and [[Stefan \u0160tiljanovi\u0107]] (1537\u20131540). The last three did not rule in the territory of present-day Vojvodina, but had possessions in the territories of present-day [[Romania]], [[Hungary]] and [[Croatia]]. The fact that Despots of Serbia ruled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina, but also the presence of large Serb population, are reasons because of which in many historical records and maps made between 15th and 18th centuries, territory of present-day Vojvodina was named ''[[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Rascia]]'' ([[Ra\u0161ka (state)|Ra\u0161ka]], [[Serbia]]) and ''Little Ra\u0161ka'' (Little Serbia).\n\nA 1542 document describes that \"Serbia\" stretched from Lipova and [[Timi\u015foara]] to the Danube, while a 1543 document that Timi\u015foara and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] being located \"in the middle of Rascian land\" (''in medio Rascianorum'').<ref name=PI.4-8>{{cite book|title=Posebna izdanja|volume=4\u20138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZASAAAAIAAJ|year=1952|publisher=Nau\u010dno delo|p=32}}</ref> At that time, the majority language in the region between [[Mure\u0219 (river)|Mure\u0219]] and [[K\u00f6r\u00f6s]] was indeed Serbian.<ref name=PI.4-8/> Apart from Serbian being the main language of the Banat population, there were 17 Serbian monasteries active in Banat at that time.{{sfn|Rascia|1996|p=2}} The territory of Banat had received a Serbian character and was called \"Little Rascia\".<ref name=\"Maleti\u0107Bo\u017eovi\u01071989\">{{cite book|author1=Mihailo Maleti\u0107|author2=Ratko Bo\u017eovi\u0107|title=Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Srbija|volume=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ba8qAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=NIRO \"Knji\u017eevne novine\"|p=46}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Slavs Vojvodina02 map.png|Slavs (including Serbs) in Vojvodina, 7th century\nFile:Kingdom of syrmia according to stanoje stanojevic.png|Realm of [[Stefan Dragutin]], 13th-14th century, according to the book of historian Stanoje Stanojevi\u0107\nFile:Serbian empire06 map.png|Serbian Empire of [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], 1526-1527\nFile:Radoslav celnik01.png|Duchy of Syrmia of Radoslav \u010celnik in 1527-1530\nFile:Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 in the 16th and 17th century.png|Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 (16th-17th century)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{Main|History of Ottoman Serbia|Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Sanjak of Segedin|Sanjak of Syrmia}}\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] took control of Vojvodina following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] of 1526 and the conquest of [[Banat]] in 1552. Soon after the Battle of Moha\u010d, [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], a leader of the Serb mercenaries, established his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Srem (region)|Srem]]. He created an ephemeral independent state, with [[Subotica]] as its capital. At the pitch of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself \"Serbian Emperor\" in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. \"Emperor\" Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed.\n\nAfter the assassination of Jovan Nenad, the general commander of his army, [[Radoslav \u010celnik]], moved with part of the former emperor's army from Ba\u010dka to Srem, and acceded into the Ottoman service. Radoslav \u010celnik then ruled over Srem as Ottoman vassal and took for himself the title of the duke of Srem, while his residence was in [[Stari Slankamen|Slankamen]].\n\nThe establishment of the Ottoman rule caused a massive depopulation of the Vojvodina region. Most of the Hungarians and many local Serbs fled from the region and escaped to the north. The majority of those who left in the region were Serbs, mainly now engaging either in farming either in Ottoman military service.\n\nUnder Ottoman policy, many Serbs were newly settled in the region. During the Ottoman rule, most of the inhabitants of the Vojvodina region were Serbs. In that time, villages were mostly populated with Serbs, while cities were populated with [[Muslims]] and [[Serbs]]. In 1594 Serbs in [[Banat]] started a [[Uprising in Banat|large uprising]] opposing Turkish rule. This was one of three largest Serbian uprisings in history, and the largest one before the [[First Serbian Uprising]] led by [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:South slavic vojv map.png|Ethnic territory of the South Slavs between 16th and 18th century (according to Jovan Cviji\u0107 and Dr [[Du\u0161an J.

Serbs were a recognized nation in the Habsburg Monarchy.]]\nThe [[Habsburg Monarchy]] took control of Vojvodina among other lands by the treaties of [[Treaty of Karlowitz|Karlovci]] (1699) and [[Treaty of Passarowitz|Po\u017earevac]] (1718). The Serbian [[patriarch]], [[Arsenije III \u010carnojevi\u0107]], fearing the revenge of the Turks, immigrated in the last decade of the 17th century to the Habsburg Monarchy with as many as 36,000 families, but these Serbs mostly went further to the north and settled in the territory of what is now Republic of Hungary with only small part of them settling in the territory of present-day north-western Vojvodina. However, because of this event, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Emperor]] promised religious freedom to all Serbs in the Monarchy as well as the right to elect their own \"[[Voivode|vojvoda]]\" (military and civil governor). Much of the area of present-day Vojvodina where Serbs lived was incorporated into the Military Frontier. The emperor also recognized Serbs as one of the official nations of the Habsburg Monarchy and he recognized the right of Serbs to have territorial autonomy within one separate voivodeship. This right, however, was not realized before the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolution in 1848\u20131849]]. The immigration of Serbs to the Habsburg Monarchy was maintained during the 18th century.\n\nDuring the [[Kurucs|Kuruc War]] (1703\u20131711) of [[Francis II Rakoczi]], the territory of present-day Vojvodina was a battlefield between Hungarian rebels and local Serbs who fought on the side of the Habsburg Emperor. Serbs in [[Ba\u010dka]] suffered the greatest losses. Hungarian rebels burned Serb villages and many Serbs were expelled from Ba\u010dka. [[Darvas]], the prime military commander of the Hungarian rebels, which fought against Serbs in Ba\u010dka, wrote: \"We burned all large places of ''[[Raci (ethnonym)|Rascia]]'', on the both banks of the rivers [[Danube]] and [[Tisza|Tisa]]\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nDuring the Austrian rule many non-Serbs also settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina. They were mainly ([[Catholic Germans|Catholic]]) [[Ethnic German|Germans]] and [[Magyar people|Hungarians]], but also [[Pannonian Rusyns|Ruthenians]], [[Slovaks]], [[Czechs]],\n[[Poles]], [[Romanians]], and others. Because of this immigration, Vojvodina became one of the most ethnically diverse regions of [[Europe]]. However, there was also some emigration of Serbs from Vojvodina: after the Tisa-Mori\u0161 section of the Military Frontier was abolished, Serbs from the north-eastern parts of Ba\u010dka left this region and immigrated to [[Russia]] (notably to [[Nova Serbia]] and [[Slavo-Serbia]]) in 1752, and this region was then populated with new Hungarian settlers. Serbs, however, remained the single largest ethnic group in Vojvodina, until the second half of 20th century, when they became the absolute majority.\n\nBetween the 16th and 19th centuries, Vojvodina was a cultural centre of the Serb people. Especially important cultural centres were: [[Novi Sad]], [[Sremski Karlovci]], and the monasteries of [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]]. In the first half of the 19th century, Novi Sad was the largest Serb city; in 1820 this city had about 20,000 inhabitants, of whom 2/3 were Serbs. The [[Matica Srpska]] moved to Novi Sad from [[Budapest]] in 1864. The Serbian gymnasiums of Novi Sad and [[Sremski Karlovci]] were at the time considered to be among the best in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. [[Novi Sad]] was being called the \"Serb [[Athens]]\".\n[[File:The May Assembly 1848 in Sremski Karlovci.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Proclamation of [[Serbian Vojvodina]] \u2013 [[May Assembly]] in 1848 in Sremski Karlovci]]\n\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the Hungarians demanded national rights and autonomy within the Austrian Empire. However, they did not recognized the national rights of other peoples which lived in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in that time. Wishing to express their national individuality and confronted with the new Hungarian authorities, [[Serbs]] declared the constitution of the ''[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]]'' (Serbian Duchy) at the May Assembly in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (May 13\u201315, 1848). The Serbian Voivodship consisted of [[Srem (region)|Srem]], [[Ba\u010dka]], [[Banat]], and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] regions. The Serbs also formed a political alliance with the [[Croats]] \"based on freedom and perfect equality\". They also recognized the [[Romanians|Romanian]] nationality. The metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]], was elected [[patriarch]], while [[Stevan \u0160upljikac]] the first [[Voivode]] ([[duke]]). A National committee was formed as the new government of the ''Serbian Voivodship''. Instead of the old feudal regime a new reign was founded based on the national boards with the Head [[Serbian National Board]] presiding.\n\nThe Hungarian government replied by the use of force: on June 12, 1848, a war between Serbs and Hungarians started. Austria took the side of Hungary at first, demanding from the Serbs to \"go back to being obedient\". Serbs were aided by volunteers from autonomous Ottoman [[Principality of Serbia]]. A consequence of this war, was the expansion of the conservative factions. Since the Austrian court turned against the Hungarians in the later stage of revolution, the feudal and clerical circles of Serbian Voivodship formed an alliance with Austria and became a tool of the [[Vienna|Viennese]] government. Serbian troops from the Voivodship then joined the Habsburg army and helped in crushing the revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Hungarian revolution, by a decision of the Austrian [[emperor]], in November 1849, an Austrian crown land known as the ''[[Voivodship of Serbia and Tami\u0161 Banat]]'' was formed as the political successor of the Serbian Voivodship. The crown land consisted of the parts of [[Banat]], [[Ba\u010dka]] and [[Srem (region)|Srem]] regions. An Austrian governor seated in [[Temi\u0161var]] ruled the area, and the title of voivod (duke) belonged to the emperor himself. The full title of the emperor was \"[[Grosswojwod|Grand Voivod]] of the Voivodship of Serbia\" (German: ''Gro\u00dfwoiwode der Woiwodschaft Serbien''). Even after this crown land was abolished, the emperor kept this title until the end of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in 1918.\n[[File:\u0417\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0458\u0435, \u0421\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438, \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[The Patriarchate Court, Sremski Karlovci|The Patriarchate Court]] in Sremski Karlovci]]\n\nIn 1860 the Voivodship of Serbia and Tami\u0161 Banat was abolished and most of its territory (Banat and Ba\u010dka) was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, although direct Hungarian rule began only in 1867, when the Kingdom of Hungary gained autonomy within the newly formed [[Austria-Hungary]]. Unlike Banat and Ba\u010dka, the Srem region was in 1860 incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]], another separate Habsburg crown land. However, the Kingdom of Slavonia was too incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary in 1868.\n\nAfter the Voivodship was abolished, one Serb politician, [[Svetozar Mileti\u0107]], appeared in the political sphere. He demanded national rights for Serbs and other non-Hungarian peoples of the Kingdom of Hungary, but he was arrested and imprisoned because of his political demands. In 1867, the Austrian Empire was transformed into Austria-Hungary, with the Kingdom of Hungary becoming one of two autonomous parts of the new state. This was followed by a policy of [[Magyarization|Hungarization]] of the non-Hungarian nationalities, most notably promotion of the [[Hungarian language]] and suppression of [[Slavic languages]] (including Serbian).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe [[Suffrage|franchise]] was greatly restricted so as to keep power in the hands of the Hungarians. The new government of the autonomous Kingdom of Hungary, took the stance that the Kingdom of Hungary should be a Hungarian [[nation state]], and that all other peoples living in the Kingdom: [[ethnic German|Germans]], [[Jew]]s, [[Romanian people|Romanians]], [[Poles]], [[Slovaks]], [[Ruthenians|Ruthenes]], [[Serbs]], and others should be assimilated. Finally, the privileges given to Serbs by the Habsburg emperor in 1690, were abolished in 1912.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vojvodina18 19 cen.png|Vojvodina, 18th-19th century - Districts of Potisje and Velika Kikinda, Military Frontier sections in Banat, Ba\u010dka and Syrmia and Kingdom of Slavonia\nFile:Vojvodina03.png|Proclaimed borders of the [[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]], 1848\nFile:Vojvodina front lines 1848 1849.png|Frontlines in Vojvodina in 1848-1849\nFile:Serbia02.png|[[Voivodship of Serbia and Tami\u0161 Banat]] and [[Principality of Serbia]], 1849\n</gallery>\n\n===Yugoslavia and Serbia===\n:See also: [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]], [[Treaty of Trianon]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], [[Danube Banovina]], [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941\u20131944]], [[Banat, 1941-1944]], [[Hungarian occupation of Baranja and Ba\u010dka, 1941\u20131944]], [[1942 raid in Novi Sad]], [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (1945\u20131963)]], [[SAP Vojvodina]]\n[[File:Velika-narodna-skupstina-1918.jpg|thumb|250px|Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci, and other nations of Vojvodina in Novi Sad proclaimed the unification of Vojvodina region with the Kingdom of Serbia, 1918.]]\n\nAt the end of [[World War I]], the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, and the Serbs in Vojvodina gained another opportunity to achieve their political demands. On November 25, 1918, the Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci, and other nations of Vojvodina in [[Novi Sad]] proclaimed the unification of Vojvodina (Banat, Ba\u010dka, and Baranja) with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. One day before this, on November 24, the Assembly of Srem also proclaimed the unification of Srem with Serbia. On December 1, 1918, the Vojvodina region became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. After the several centuries of living under foreign rule (Hungarian, Ottoman, Habsburg), the Vojvodinian Serbs now lived in a country together with other [[Serbs]] and [[South Slavs]]. That marked a new stage in the national development of the Serb people in the Vojvodina region.\n\nThe difficult time period for the Serbs in Vojvodina was a [[World War II]] and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] occupation (1941\u20131944), when Vojvodina region was held by the [[Germany|German]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Croatia]]n occupational forces. The occupying powers committed numerous crimes against the ethnic Serb population in the region. It is estimated that during the occupation, about 50,000 people in Vojvodina (mostly [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and Roma) were murdered, while more than 280,000 people were interned, arrested, violated or tortured.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe Axis occupation ended in 1944 and the autonomous province of Vojvodina (incorporating Srem, Banat and Ba\u010dka) was formed within [[Yugoslavia]] in 1945 as a part of [[Serbia]]. The province was created as a territorial autonomy for all peoples who live in it, with the significant role of the Serbs, who were ethnic majority in the province.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Serbia1918.png|Unification of Vojvodina with Serbia, 1918\nFile:Occupation of vojvodina.png|Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944\nFile:Serbia01.png|Vojvodina within [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], 1945-1989\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!Year\n!Serbs\n!Percentage\n!Total Population<br />of Vojvodina\n|- \n|1910 || 510,186|| 33.8%|| 1,512,983\n|- \n|1921 || 526,134|| 34.7%|| 1,528,238\n|- \n|1931 || 528,000|| 33.0%|| 1,624,158\n|- \n|1941 || 577,067|| 35.3%|| 1,636,367\n|-\n|1948 || 841,246|| 50.6%|| 1,663,212\n|- \n|1953 || 865,538|| 50.9%|| 1,699,545\n|- \n|1961 || 1,017,713|| 54.9%|| 1,854,965\n|- \n|1971 || 1,089,132|| 55.8%|| 1,952,535\n|- \n|1981 || 1,107,735|| 54.4%|| 2,034,772\n|- \n|1991 || 1,151,353|| 57.2%|| 2,012,517\n|-\n|2002 || 1,321,807|| 65.0%|| 2,031,992\n|-\n|2011 || 1,289,635|| 66.7%|| 1,931,809\n|-\n|}\n\n<gallery>\nFile: Vojvodina ethnic2011.png|Serbs in Vojvodina according to the 2011 census\nFile: Vojvodina ethnic2011 serbs.png| Percentage of Serbs in municipalities of Vojvodina according to the 2011 census\n</gallery>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Building of the Matica srpska, Novi Sad.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Matica Srpska]]]]\n[[File:Serbia-0296 - Serbian National Theatre.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Serbian National Theatre]]]]\n* [[Matica Srpska]], the oldest cultural-scientific institution of Serbs.
