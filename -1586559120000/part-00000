It was dedicated as the home of Sacramento Elks Lodge No. 6 on June twenty-second, 1926. \n===Walter Hicks on the new Lodge===\nSpeaking about the grandness of the 11th and J Street Elks temple in 1926, Walter J. Hicks, exalted ruler of the Sacramento Elks Lodge, said, \u201cI am not proud because we built higher, not proud because we built bigger, but proud because we have built a temple to Elkdome in the city of Sacramento, which already is becoming the topic of conversation wherever Elks congregate and which before long will be instrumental in placing the name of Sacramento on the lips of nearly every Elk throughout the nation.\u201d\n\n==Late [[1960s]]==\nIn 1968, the 13th floor of the building became home to the newly created radio station, KZAP, which was a free-form FM radio station.\n  \n===Amenities & Configuration of the building during the late 60s===\n====Basement====\n*Steam room\n====Ground Floor====\n*Exercise room\n====Second Floor====\n*Ballroom\n*Main dining room\n====Third Floor====\n*Lodge room\n*Reading room\n====Fourth Floor====\n*Meeting-room\n*Billiards area\n*Game room\n\n==Recent History (1970-Current)==\nThe Elks consequently sold the building in 1972 to local developer Buzz Oates, who soon afterward joined in a business partnership with Waltz Investment, Richard Benvenutti, William Cook and Dean Unger.

It was released in April 1997 as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from their second album, ''[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]''. The female part of song's chorus is sung by [[Bobo (singer)|Christiane \"Bobo\" Hebold]] of the German [[pop music|pop]] band ''[[Bobo in White Wooden Houses]]''. An English version of \"Engel\" can be found on US special editions of ''Sehnsucht''.\n\n==Music video==\nWhile [[Till Lindemann|Lindemann]], [[Christoph Schneider|Schneider]] and [[Christian Lorenz|Flake]] are in the audience, [[Paul Landers]] can be seen taking Schneider's place by playing the drums and [[Richard Z. Kruspe|Kruspe]] and [[Oliver Riedel|Riedel]] are seen singing. The video references to the 1996 film, [[From Dusk till Dawn]].\n\n==Live performances==\nA regular during the ''Sehnsucht'' tour, it was used as the last song of the main set in non-festival concerts. In the first months of the ''[[Mutter (Rammstein album)|Mutter]]'' (2001) tour, \"Engel\" appeared in the setlists sporadically, but became a regular again in November, and continued as the last song of the main set until the end of the tour.\n\nWhen performed on stage, flames shoot into the air, and Schneider's drumsticks would shoot sparks. On the 'Live aus Berlin' shows, Bobolina joins Rammstein to sing her parts from inside a flaming cage, instead of the usual pre-recorded chorus used in most of the shows. After missing the entire ''Reise, Reise'' tour; \"Engel\" returned to the setlists as the closing song of the Liebe Ist F\u00fcr Alle Da tour, taking place during 2009 and 2011. This time around, vocalist Till Lindemann sang the chorus instead of Bobo's pre-recorded lines. For the pyrotechnics, Lindemann wears a set of angel wings that shoot flames from the tips and that have sparks go off along them.<ref>{{cite web |author1=nasbootlegs |title=RAMMSTEIN - Engel + Final live London 2010 Wembley Arena |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9YkX7pBRm8 |website=YouTube |accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Engel was the penultimate song on the setlist during the [[Made in Germany 1995-2011 Tour]], and the [[Rammstein Tour 2016|tour]] in 2016\n[[File:Till-ENGEL2.jpg|thumb|Engel in the LIFAD Tour]]\n[[File:Rammstein in Minsk, 2010.jpg|thumb|Rammstein playing \"Engel\" in [[Minsk]], Belarus]]\n\n==In other media==\nThe song was used during the end credits of the 1997 film, [[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]], and also appears on its soundtrack.\n\n==Track listings==\n===Single===\n# Engel - 4:23\n# Sehnsucht - 4:02\n# Rammstein ([[Eskimos and Egypt|Eskimos & Egypt]] [[Radio edit|Radio Edit]]) - 3:40\n# Rammstein (Eskimos & Egypt [[Instrumental]] Edit) - 3:32\n# Rammstein (Original) - 4:25\n\n===Fan-Edition===\nA second single called '''''Engel (Fan-Edition)''''' was released on 23 May 1997.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/de/Rammstein-Engel-Fan-Edition/release/234361</ref> It includes different track listing from the original and a different artwork, showing singer Till Lindemann.\n# Engel (Extended Version) - 4:34\n# Feuerr\u00e4der (Live Demo Version 1994)<small> (Wheels of Fire)</small> - 4:47\n# Wilder Wein (Demo Version 1994)<small> (Wild Wine)</small> - 5:41\n# Rammstein (Eskimos & Egypt Instrumental) - 3:27\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It was released in April 1997 as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from their second album, ''[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]''. The female part of song's chorus is sung by [[Bobo (singer)|Christiane \"Bobo\" Hebold]] of the German [[pop music|pop]] band ''[[Bobo in White Wooden Houses]]''. An English version of \"Engel\" can be found on US special editions of ''Sehnsucht''.\n\n==Music video==\nWhile [[Till Lindemann|Lindemann]], [[Christoph Schneider|Schneider]] and [[Christian Lorenz|Flake]] are in the audience, [[Paul Landers]] can be seen taking Schneider's place by playing the drums and [[Richard Z. Kruspe|Kruspe]] and [[Oliver Riedel|Riedel]] are seen singing. The video references to the 1996 film, [[From Dusk till Dawn]].\n\n==Live performances==\nA regular during the ''Sehnsucht'' tour, it was used as the last song of the main set in non-festival concerts. In the first months of the ''[[Mutter (Rammstein album)|Mutter]]'' (2001) tour, \"Engel\" appeared in the setlists sporadically, but became a regular again in November, and continued as the last song of the main set until the end of the tour.\n\nWhen performed on stage, flames shoot into the air, and Schneider's drumsticks would shoot sparks. On the 'Live aus Berlin' shows, Bobolina joins Rammstein to sing her parts from inside a flaming cage, instead of the usual pre-recorded chorus used in most of the shows. After missing the entire ''Reise, Reise'' tour; \"Engel\" returned to the setlists as the closing song of the Liebe Ist F\u00fcr Alle Da tour, taking place during 2009 and 2011. This time around, vocalist Till Lindemann sang the chorus instead of Bobo's pre-recorded lines. For the pyrotechnics, Lindemann wears a set of angel wings that shoot flames from the tips and that have sparks go off along them.<ref>{{cite web |author1=nasbootlegs |title=RAMMSTEIN - Engel + Final live London 2010 Wembley Arena |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9YkX7pBRm8 |website=YouTube |accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Engel was the penultimate song on the setlist during the [[Made in Germany 1995-2011 Tour]], and the [[Rammstein Tour 2016|tour]] in 2016\n[[File:Till-ENGEL2.jpg|thumb|Engel in the LIFAD Tour]]\n[[File:Rammstein in Minsk, 2010.jpg|thumb|Rammstein playing \"Engel\" in [[Minsk]], Belarus]]\n\n==In other media==\nThe song was used during the end credits of the 1997 film, [[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]], and also appears on its soundtrack.\n\n==Track listings==\n===Single===\n# Engel - 4:23\n# Sehnsucht - 4:02\n# Rammstein ([[Eskimos and Egypt|Eskimos & Egypt]] [[Radio edit|Radio Edit]]) - 3:40\n# Rammstein (Eskimos & Egypt [[Instrumental]] Edit) - 3:32\n# Rammstein (Original) - 4:25\n\n===Fan-Edition===\nA second single called '''''Engel (Fan-Edition)''''' was released on 23 May 1997.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/de/Rammstein-Engel-Fan-Edition/release/234361</ref> It includes different track listing from the original and a different artwork, showing Till.\n# Engel (Extended Version) - 4:34\n# Feuerr\u00e4der (Live Demo Version 1994)<small> (Wheels of Fire)</small> - 4:47\n# Wilder Wein (Demo Version 1994)<small> (Wild Wine)</small> - 5:41\n# Rammstein (Eskimos & Egypt Instrumental) - 3:27\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
