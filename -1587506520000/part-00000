Seven of these pieces are included in her Material Witness collection. These artworks are fabric scraps soaked in paint, densely sewn together and on a hanger strung from the ceiling. Presences was presented at Harmony Hammond's first solo exhibition in New York in 1973. The fabric is all different lengths with some strips being layered or tied together to be longer. The Sculptures are slightly larger than life and hover just above the floor. Viewers can walk among them and notice the many layers and patterns that might peak through. They are mostly earthy tones, but with splotches of bright colors. Harmony Hammond\u2019s intention behind the works was to capture the history of women being creative and claiming their space. She wanted them to look ghostly and yet corporeal. So that they would look toward the past but still have purpose and weight. All the fabric she used was donated old clothes and bed sheets from her friends that also indeified as queer, feminst, or an artist.

For helping neutralize the chief of the most powerful group of militants in the state, the turned member also received a full third of the reward on Singh.<ref name=\"satp_cat\"/>\n\n== Character Assassination ==\nThe Indian Security Services and especially RAW (Research and analysis Wing) knew the Babbar Khalsa group were a puritan group who's fight was based on high ideals. Jathedar Sukhdev Singh was an iconic figure in Punjab and the backbone of the movement. They knew they had to discredit him to make sure no new Sukhdev Singh should rise from his ashes. This policy had already been used effectively on Deepa Heeran wale who was hugely popular in his area.\n\nSo a detailed propaganda campaign was launched by the security forces, and spread via the press, and even via other agents amongst the Sikh leadership. In hindsight now it is easy to see who is who. In them days it was more difficult. Just compare the sacrifices of Jathedar Sukhdev Singh Babbar, Anokh Singh Babbar, Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala, Avtar Singh Brahma, and Gurbachan Singh Manochal, with those who spoke against them such as Badal, Wassan Zaffarwal, Dr Jagjit Chohan and other Panthik traitors.\n\nJathedar Sukhdev Singh was attacked on two points which is important to be cleared, as the propaganda was done over a number of years to the Sikh masses and some many still question Bhai Sahib.\n\nFirstly, comments were made on his lifestyle mainly due to the house in which he lived. The house was very large and well decorated. We have to understand for Bhai Sahib to live for 14 years and take guerrilla warfare to the level that he did, plus also co-ordinate efforts world wide, he could not have done this living in a field, a ditch, or a shack. The house and lifestyle were part of his disguise as the rich building contractor, which gave him access to numerous telephone lines, faxes, and powerful contacts. This was essential to run a parallel government like he between 1986 -1989.\n\nSecondly propaganda was spread that he remarried and had children. This is also not true. Bhai Sahib was only married once to Bibi Sukhwant Kaur in 1978, and he had children with her. To maintain his disguise, he could not have his actual wife living with him. She was constantly under surveillance, and it would blow his disguise straight away. As part of the disguise, it was made to look like he had a family. This was with a Bibi Parcharak who was sympathetic to the cause, and the child was adopted from a Shaheed Parivaar.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Babbar, Sukhdev Singh}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:1992 deaths]]\n[[Category:Khalistan movement people]]\n[[Category:Punjabi people]]\n[[Category:Sikh terrorism]]\n[[Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in India]]\n[[Category:Punjab insurgency]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name = Sukhdev Singh Babbar\n| image = Sukhdev_singh_babbar.jpg\n| alt                = Sukhdev Singh Babbar\n| image_size = 200px\n| caption = \n| birth_name = Sukhdev Singh Dasuwal\n| birth_date = {{birth date|df=yes|1955|8|9}}\n| birth_place = Dhassuwal, [[Patti, Punjab|Patti]], [[Amritsar]], [[India]]\n| death_date = {{death date and age|df=yes|1992|08|09|1955|08|09}}\n| death_place = [[Patiala]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[India]]\n| nationality = [[India]]n\n| occupation = Head of [[Babbar Khalsa International]]\n| parents = Jind Singh and Harnam Kaur\n| native_name        = \n| native_name_lang   = \n| pronunciation      = \n| death_cause        = \n| body_discovered    = \n| residence          = \n| other_names        = \n| citizenship        = \n| education          = \n| alma_mater         = \n| years_active       = \n| era                = \n| employer           = \n| organization       = [[Babbar Khalsa International]]\n| agent              =  <!-- Discouraged in most cases, specifically when promotional, and requiring a reliable source -->\n| known_for          = \n| notable_works      =  <!-- produces label \"Notable work\"; may be overridden by |credits=, which produces label \"Notable credit(s)\"; or by |works=, which produces label \"Works\"; or by |label_name=, which produces label \"Label(s)\" -->\n| style              = \n| home_town          = \n| salary             = \n| net_worth          =  <!-- Net worth should be supported with a citation from a reliable source -->\n| height             =  <!-- \"X cm\", \"X m\"  or \"X ft Y in\" plus optional reference (conversions are automatic) -->\n| weight             =  <!-- \"X kg\", \"X lb\" or \"X st Y lb\" plus optional reference (conversions are automatic) -->\n| television         = \n| title              =  <!-- Formal/awarded/job title.

Bengali architecture includes ancient urban architecture, religious architecture, rural [[vernacular architecture]], colonial [[townhouse]]s and [[country house]]s, and modern urban styles. The [[bungalow]] style is a notable architectural export of Bengal. The corner towers of Bengali religious buildings were replicated in medieval Southeast Asia.  [[Bengal roofs|Bengali curved roofs]], suitable for the very heavy rains, were adopted into a distinct local style of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], and used decoratively elsewhere in north India in [[Mughal architecture]]. \n\nBengal is not rich in good stone for building, and traditional Bengali architecture mostly uses brick and wood, often reflecting the styles of the wood, bamboo and thatch styles of local [[vernacular architecture]] for houses.  Decorative carved or [[Molding (process)|mould]]ed plaques of [[terracotta]] (the same material as the brick) are a special feature.  The brick is extremely durable and disused ancient buildings were often used as a convenient source of materials by local people, often being stripped to their foundations over the centuries. \n\n==Antiquity and Buddhism==\n[[File:Paharpur Buddhist Bihar.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the central Buddhist [[stupa]] of the [[Somapura Mahavihara|Grand Vihara of Somapura]] in modern Bangladesh, a Pala royal project of around 800.]]\n[[Urbanization]] is recorded in the region since the first millennium BCE. This was part of the second wave of urban civilization in the Indian subcontinent, following the decline of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Ancient Bengal was part of a network of urban and trading hubs stretching to [[Ancient Persia]]. The archaeological sites of [[Mahasthangarh]], Paharpur, [[Wari-Bateshwar ruins]], [[Chandraketugarh]] and [[Mainamati]] provide evidence of a highly organized urban civilization in the region. [[Terracotta]] became a hallmark of Bengali construction, as the region lacked stone reserves. Bricks were produced with the clay of the [[Bengal delta]].\n\nAncient Bengali architecture reached its pinnacle during the [[Pala Empire]] (750\u20131120); this was Bengali-based and the last Buddhist imperial power in the Indian subcontinent.  Most patronage was of Buddhist [[vihara]]s, temples and [[stupa]]s. Pala architecture influenced Tibetan and Southeast Asian architecture. The most famous monument built by the Pala emperors was the [[Somapura Mahavihara|Grand Vihara of Somapura]], now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Historians believe Somapura was a model for the architects of [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia.<ref name=\"Bernier1997\">{{cite book |author=Ronald M.

The Hindu [[Sena dynasty]] only ruled for a century before the conquest.  They built the relatively modest [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] in [[Dhaka]], although this has been greatly rebuilt. \n\nThe term ''[[deula]]'', ''deul'' (or ''deoul'') is used for a style of [[Jain]] and [[Hindu temple architecture]] of Bengal, where the temple lacks the usual [[mandapa]] beside the main shrine, and the main unit consists only of the shrine and a ''[[deul]]'' above it.  The type arose between the 6th and 10th centuries, and most examples are now ruins; it was revived in the 16th to 19th century.<ref name=\"Amit\">{{citation | url=http://www.aishee.org/essays/classification.php |title=Classification of Terracotta Temples |author=Amit Guha |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>  In other respects they are similar to the [[Kalinga architecture]] of [[Odisha]], where the term is also used for temple superstructures - what would be called a [[shikara]] elsewhere in northern India.<ref>Harle, 216</ref> and some smaller temples in Odisha take this form.  The later representatives of this style were generally smaller and included features influenced by Islamic architecture.<ref name=\"Amit\"/>\n\nMost temples surviving in reasonable condition date from about the 17th century onwards, after temple building revived; it had stopped after the Muslim conquest in the 13th century.<ref>Michell, 156</ref>  The roofing style of Bengali [[Hindu temple architecture]] is unique and closely related to the paddy roofed traditional building style of rural Bengal.<ref>3.http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/wb/wbtemps.htm</ref>  The \"extensive improvisation within a local architectural idiom\"<ref>Michell, 156</ref> which the temples exhibit is often ascribed to a local shortage of expert [[Brahmin]] priests to provide the rather rigid guidance as to correct forms that governed temple architecture elsewhere.  In the same way the terracotta reliefs often depict secular subjects in a very lively fashion.\n\nRoofing styles include the ''jor-bangla'', ''do-chala'', ''char-chala'', ''at-chala'', and ''ek-ratna''.  The ''do-chala'' type has only two hanging roof tips on each side of a roof divided in the middle by a ridge-line; in the rare ''char-chala'' type, the two roof halves are fused into one unit and have a dome-like shape; the double-storey ''at-chala'' type has eight roof corners.<ref name=\"banglapedia\">{{cite web\n|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture\n|title=Architecture\n|publisher=Banglapedia\n|accessdate=6 September 2009\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Amit\"/>\n\nMany of these temples are covered on the outer walls with [[terracotta]] (carved brick) [[relief]]s.  [[Bishnupur, Bankura|Bishnupur]] in [[West Bengal]] has a remarkable set of 17th and 18th-century temples with a variety of roof styles built by the [[Mallabhum|Malla dynasty]].  \n\nIn larger, and later, temples, small towers rise up from the centre or corners of the curving roof.  These are straight-sided, often with conical roofs.  They have little resemblance to a typical north Indian [[shikara]] temple tower.  The [[pancharatna (architecture)|pancharatna]] (\"five towers\") and [[Navaratna (architecture)|navaratna]] (\"nine towers\") styles are varieties of this type.<ref name=\"Amit\"/>    \n\nThe temple structures contain gabled roofs which are colloquially called the chala, For example, a gabled roof with an eight sided pyramid structured roof will be called \"ath chala\" or literally the eight faces of the roof. And frequently there is more than one tower in the temple building. These are built of laterite and brick bringing them at the mercy of severe weather conditions of southern Bengal. [[Dakshineswar Kali Temple]] is one example of the Bhanja style while the additional small temples of [[Shiva]] along the river bank are example of southern Bengal roof style though in much smaller dimension.\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"240\" heights=\"240\">\nFile:SUN TEMPLE (Around 11th Century AD).jpg|A deul Jain temple\nFile:Puthia Mandirs10.JPG|A Pancharatna temple\nFile:Rasmancha, Bishnupur.JPG|A ritual platform\nFile:Ramchandra Mandir, Guptipara, Hooghly, West Bengal, India.jpg|Ram Chandra Temple on Guptipara\nFile:Jor-Bangla Temple.jpg|[[Jor-bangla]] features a curved [[Do-chala]] style roof\nFile:Evolution of Temple Architecture in Bengal.jpg|Evolution of Temple Architecture in Bengal\nFile:Classification of Bengal Temple Architecture 12.jpg|Classification of Bengal Temple Architecture 1\nFile:Classification of Bengal Temple Architecture 1.jpg|Classification of Bengal Temple Architecture 2\n</gallery>\n\n===Islamic===\n[[File:Choto Sona Mosque (side view).jpg|thumb|[[Choto Sona Mosque]] (around 1500)]]\n[[Indo-Islamic architecture]] in the Bengali architecture can be seen from the 13th century, but before the Mughals has usually strongly reflected local traditions.

While most rural estates featured an elegant [[country house]], the cities of [[Calcutta]], [[Dacca]], [[Sonargaon|Panam]] and [[Chittagong]] had widespread 19th and early 20th century urban architecture, comparable to [[London]], [[Sydney]] or [[Auckland]].

Bengali architecture includes ancient urban architecture, religious architecture, rural [[vernacular architecture]], colonial [[townhouse]]s and [[country house]]s, and modern urban styles. The [[bungalow]] style is a notable architectural export of Bengal. The corner towers of Bengali religious buildings were replicated in medieval Southeast Asia.  [[Bengal roofs|Bengali curved roofs]], suitable for the very heavy rains, were adopted into a distinct local style of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], and used decoratively elsewhere in north India in [[Mughal architecture]]. \n\nBengal is not rich in good stone for building, and traditional Bengali architecture mostly uses brick and wood, often reflecting the styles of the wood, bamboo and thatch styles of local [[vernacular architecture]] for houses.  Decorative carved or [[mould]]ed plaques of [[terracotta]] (the same material as the brick) are a special feature.  The brick is extremely durable and disused ancient buildings were often used as a convenient source of materials by local people, often being stripped to their foundations over the centuries. \n\n==Antiquity and Buddhism==\n[[File:Paharpur Buddhist Bihar.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the central Buddhist [[stupa]] of the [[Somapura Mahavihara|Grand Vihara of Somapura]] in modern Bangladesh, a Pala royal project of around 800.]]\n[[Urbanization]] is recorded in the region since the first millennium BCE. This was part of the second wave of urban civilization in the Indian subcontinent, following the decline of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Ancient Bengal was part of a network of urban and trading hubs stretching to [[Ancient Persia]]. The archaeological sites of [[Mahasthangarh]], Paharpur, [[Wari-Bateshwar ruins]], [[Chandraketugarh]] and [[Mainamati]] provide evidence of a highly organized urban civilization in the region. [[Terracotta]] became a hallmark of Bengali construction, as the region lacked stone reserves. Bricks were produced with the clay of the [[Bengal delta]].\n\nAncient Bengali architecture reached its pinnacle during the [[Pala Empire]] (750\u20131120); this was Bengali-based and the last Buddhist imperial power in the Indian subcontinent.  Most patronage was of Buddhist [[vihara]]s, temples and [[stupa]]s. Pala architecture influenced Tibetan and Southeast Asian architecture. The most famous monument built by the Pala emperors was the [[Somapura Mahavihara|Grand Vihara of Somapura]], now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Historians believe Somapura was a model for the architects of [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia.<ref name=\"Bernier1997\">{{cite book |author=Ronald M.

The Hindu [[Sena dynasty]] only ruled for a century before the conquest.  They built the relatively modest [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] in [[Dhaka]], although this has been greatly rebuilt. \n\nThe term ''[[deula]]'', ''deul'' (or ''deoul'') is used for a style of [[Jain]] and [[Hindu temple architecture]] of Bengal, where the temple lacks the usual [[mandapa]] beside the main shrine, and the main unit consists only of the shrine and a ''[[deul]]'' above it.

In the same way the terracotta reliefs often depict secular subjects in a very lively fashion.\n\nRoofing styles include the ''jor-bangla'', ''do-chala'', ''char-chala'', ''at-chala'', and ''ek-ratna''.  The ''do-chala'' type has only two hanging roof tips on each side of a roof divided in the middle by a ridge-line; in the rare ''char-chala'' type, the two roof halves are fused into one unit and have a dome-like shape; the double-storey ''at-chala'' type has eight roof corners.<ref name=\"banglapedia\">{{cite web\n|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture\n|title=Architecture\n|publisher=Banglapedia\n|accessdate=6 September 2009\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Amit\"/>\n\nMany of these temples are covered on the outer walls with [[terracotta]] (carved brick) [[relief]]s.

But there is a small mosque at Molla Simla, [[Hooghly district]], that is probably from 1375, earlier than the mausoleum.<ref>Hasan, 36-39</ref>  The Eklakhi Mausoleum is large and has several features that were to become common in the Bengal style, including a slightly curved [[cornice]], large round decorative [[buttress]]es and decoration in carved [[terracotta]] brick.<ref>Hasan, 36-37; Harle, 428</ref>  \n\nThese features are also seen in the [[Choto Sona Mosque]] (around 1500), which is in stone, unusually for Bengal, but shares the style and mixes domes and a curving \"paddy\" roof based on village house roofs made of vegetable thatch. Such roofs feature even more strongly in later Bengal [[Hindu temple architecture]], with types such as the [[do-chala]], [[jor-bangla]], and [[char-chala]].<ref>Hasan, 23-25</ref>  For larger mosques, Bengali architects multiplied the numbers of domes, with a nine-domed formula (three rows of three) being one option, surviving in four examples, all 15th or 16th century and now in Bangladesh,<ref>Hasan, 41-44</ref> although there were others with larger numbers of domes.<ref>Hasan, 44-49</ref>\n\nBuildings in the style are the [[Nine Dome Mosque]] and the [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] (completed 1459) and several other buildings in the [[Mosque City of Bagerhat]], an abandoned city in Bangladesh now featured as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. These show other distinctive features, such as a multiplicity of doors and ''mihrab''s; the Sixty Dome Mosque has 26 doors (11 at the front, 7 on each side, and one in the rear).  These increased the light and ventilation. Further mosques include the [[Baro Shona Masjid]]; the [[Pathrail Mosque]], the [[Bagha Mosque]], the [[Darasbari Mosque]], and the [[Kusumba Mosque]].  Single-domed mosques include the [[Singair Mosque]], and the [[Shankarpasha Shahi Masjid]]. \n\nBoth capitals of the Bengal Sultanate, first [[Pandua, Malda|Pandua or Adina]], then from 1450 [[Gau\u1e0da (city)|Gauda or Gaur]], started to be abandoned soon after the conquest of the sultanate by the Mughals in 1576, leaving many grand buildings, mostly religious.  The materials from secular buildings were recycled by builders in later periods.<ref>Banglapedia</ref>  While minarets are conspicuously absent in most mosques, the [[Firoz Minar]] was built in Gauda to commemorate Bengali military victories.\n\nThe ruined [[Adina Mosque]] (1374\u201375) is very large, which is unusual in Bengal, with a [[barrel vault]]ed central hall flanked by hypostyle areas.

The [[Indo-Saracenic]] movement was strongly prevalent in the region. While most rural estates featured an elegant [[country house]], the cities of [[Calcutta]], [[Dacca]], [[Sonargaon|Panam]] and [[Chittagong]] had widespread 19th and early 20th century urban architecture, comparable to [[London]], [[Sydney]] or [[Auckland]].

In the rural areas of Bangladesh, it is often called \u201cBangla Ghar\u201d (Bengali Style House). The main construction material used in modern time is corrugated steel sheets. Previously they had been constructed from wood, bamboo and a kind of straw called \u201cKhar\u201d. Khar was used in the roof of the Bungalow house and kept the house cold during hot summer days.

Louis Kahn designed the [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]], the preeminent symbol of modern Bangladeshi architecture. The [[cityscape]]s of modern Bengali cities are dominated by midsized skycrapers and often called concrete jungles.

The first [[pottery]] was made during the [[List of Palaeolithic sites in China|Palaeolithic]] era. Chinese ceramics range from construction materials such as bricks and tiles, to hand-built pottery vessels fired in bonfires or [[kiln]]s, to the sophisticated Chinese [[porcelain]] wares made for the imperial court and for export. Porcelain was a [[Chinese invention]] and is so identified with China that it is still called \"china\" in everyday English usage.\n[[Image:Ming-Schale1.jpg|thumb|A Ming-dynasty [[blue-and-white porcelain]] dish with a dragon]]\n\nMost later Chinese ceramics, even of the finest quality, were made on an industrial scale, thus few names of individual potters were recorded. Many of the most important kiln workshops were owned by or reserved for the emperor, and large quantities of [[Chinese export porcelain]] were exported as [[diplomatic gift]]s or for trade from an early date, initially to East Asia and the Islamic world, and then from around the 16th century to Europe.  Chinese ceramics have had an enormous influence on other ceramic traditions in these areas.\n[[Image:Porcelaine chinoise Guimet 231103.jpg|thumb|[[Yaozhou ware]] [[celadon]] bowl, [[Song dynasty]], 10th-11th century.]]\n\nIncreasingly over their long history, Chinese ceramics can be classified between those made for the imperial court to use or distribute, those made for a discriminating Chinese market, and those for popular Chinese markets or [[Chinese export porcelain|for export]].  Some types of wares were also made only or mainly for special uses such as burial in tombs, or for use on altars.\n\n==Terminology and categories== \n[[File:Song Dynasty Porcelain.jpg|thumb|A [[Qingbai ware|qingbai]] porcelain vase, bowl, and model of a [[granary]] with transparent blue-toned glaze, from the period of the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279 AD)]]\n\nThe earliest Chinese pottery was [[earthenware]], which continued in production for utilitarian uses throughout Chinese history, but was increasingly less used for fine wares. [[Stoneware]], fired at higher temperatures, and naturally impervious to water, was developed very early and continued to be used for fine pottery in many areas at most periods; the tea bowls in [[Jian ware]] and [[Jizhou ware]] made during the [[Song dynasty]] are examples.\n\n{{anchor|Porcelain defined}}\n[[Porcelain]], on a Western definition, is \"a collective term comprising all ceramic ware that is white and translucent, no matter what ingredients are used to make it or to what use it is put\".<ref>''An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery.'' 2nd edition.

W. (1977) ''Chinese Pottery and Porcelain.'' Oxford University Press, Kuala Lumpur. {{ISBN|0-19-580372-8}}.</ref>\n\nChinese pottery can also be classified as being either ''northern'' or ''southern''.  China comprises two separate and geologically different land masses, brought together by [[continental drift]] and forming a junction that lies between the [[Yellow River|Yellow]] and [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] rivers, sometimes known as the [[Zhongnan Mountains|Nanshan]]-[[Qinling]] divide. The contrasting geology of the north and south led to differences in the raw materials available for making ceramics; in particular the north lacks [[petunse]] or \"porcelain stone\", needed for porcelain on the strict definition. Ware-types can be from very widespread kiln-sites in either north or south China, but the two can nearly always be distinguished, and influences across this divide may affect shape and decoration, but will be based on very different clay bodies, with fundamental effects.  The kiln types were also different, and in the north the fuel was usually coal, as opposed to wood in the south, which often affects the wares. Southern materials have high [[silica]], low [[alumina]] and high [[potassium oxide]], the reverse of northern materials in each case.  The northern materials are often very suitable for stoneware, while in the south there are also areas highly suitable for porcelain.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DCuAD6cofjYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Korean+art+from+Gompertz&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=&f=false Korean art from the Gompertz and other collections in the Fitzwilliam Museum], ed.

This in turn has led to confusion about when the first Chinese porcelain was made. Claims have been made for the late [[Han dynasty|Eastern Han dynasty]] (100\u2013200 AD), the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220\u2013280 AD), the [[Six Dynasties]] period (220\u2013589 AD), and the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013906 AD).\n\nKiln technology has always been a key factor in the development of Chinese pottery. The Chinese developed effective kilns capable of firing at around {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|F}} before 2000 BC.  These were updraft kilns, often built below ground.  Two main types of kiln were developed by about 200 AD and remained in use until modern times.  These are the [[dragon kiln]] of hilly southern China, usually fuelled by wood, long and thin and running up a slope, and the horseshoe-shaped [[mantou kiln]] of the north Chinese plains, smaller and more compact.  Both could reliably produce the temperatures of up to {{convert|1300|\u00b0C|F}} or more needed for porcelain.  In the late Ming, the [[egg-shaped kiln]] (''zhenyao'') was developed at [[Jingdezhen]], but mainly used there. This was something of a compromise between the other types, and offered locations in the firing chamber with a range of firing conditions.<ref>Rawson, 364, 369\u2013370; Vainker, 222\u2013223</ref>\n\n==History==\nImportant specific types of pottery, many coming from more than one period, are dealt with individually in sections lower down.\n\n===Early wares===\n[[File:Xianrendong Cave Pottery - 2.jpg|thumb|<center>[[Xianrendong]] cave pottery fragments, radiocarbon-dated to circa 20,000 [[before present|BP]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bar-Yosef |first1=Ofer |last2=Arpin |first2=Trina |last3=Pan |first3=Yan |last4=Cohen |first4=David |last5=Goldberg |first5=Paul |last6=Zhang |first6=Chi |last7=Wu |first7=Xiaohong |title=Early Pottery at 20,000 Years Ago in Xianrendong Cave, China |journal=Science |date=29 June 2012 |volume=336 |issue=6089 |pages=1696\u20131700 |doi=10.1126/science.1218643 |pmid=22745428 |language=en |issn=0036-8075}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Michael |title=Oldest pottery hints at cooking's ice-age origins |website=www.newscientist.com |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21985-oldest-pottery-hints-at-cookings-ice-age-origins/}}</ref></center>]]\n[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - painted jar.jpg|thumb|Painted jar of the [[Majiayao culture]], Late Neolithic period (3300\u20132200 BC)]] \nPottery dating from 20,000 years ago was found at the [[Xianrendong]] Cave site in [[Jiangxi]] province,<ref>[http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-28/science/32452370_1_bone-fragments-sediment-pottery \"Harvard, BU researchers find evidence of 20,000-year-old pottery\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130102041017/http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-28/science/32452370_1_bone-fragments-sediment-pottery |date=2013-01-02 }}.

This type of vessel became widespread during the following [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)]] and the [[Six Dynasties]].<ref name=dien>{{citation|first=Albert E. |last=Dien|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2007|isbn=978-0-300-07404-8|title=Six dynasties civilization|series=Early Chinese civilization series|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0zp6iMZoqt0C&pg=PA214|pages=214\u2013215}}</ref>\n\nThe tomb figures that were to recur in the Tang were popular across society, but with more emphasis than later on model houses and farm animals. [[Green-glazed pottery]], using [[lead-glazed earthenware]] in part of the later ''[[sancai]]'' formula, was used for some of these, though not for wares for use, as the raw lead made the glaze poisonous.\n\n===Sui and Tang dynasties, 581\u2013907 AD===\n[[File:Earthenware dish with sancai glaze and rosette medallion, Tang Dynasty.JPG|thumb|A [[sancai]] glazed offering tray, late 7th or early 8th century, [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907)]]\nDuring the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties (581 to 907 AD), a wide range of ceramics, low-fired and high-fired, were produced. These included the last significant fine earthenwares to be produced in China, mostly [[Lead-glazed earthenware|lead-glazed]] ''[[sancai]]'' (three-colour) wares.  Many of the well-known lively [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]], which were only made to be placed in elite tombs close to the capital in the north, are in ''sancai'', while others are unpainted or were painted over a [[slip (ceramics)|slip]]; the paint has now often fallen off.  The ''sancai'' vessels too may have been mainly for tombs, which is where they are all found; the glaze was less toxic than in the Han, but perhaps still to be avoided for use at the dining table.\n\nIn the south, the wares from the [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site]] in [[Tongguan Subdistrict|Tongguan]] are significant for their first regular use of [[underglaze]] painting; examples have been found in many places in the Islamic world. However their production tailed off as underglaze painting remained a minor technique for several centuries.<ref>Vainker, 82\u201384</ref>\n\n[[Yue ware]] was the leading high-fired, [[lime-glaze]]d [[celadon]] of the period, and was of very sophisticated design, patronized by the court. This was also the case with the northern porcelains of kilns in the provinces of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]], which for the first time met the Western and Eastern definition of porcelain, being both pure white and translucent.<ref>Vainker, 64\u201372</ref>  One of the first mentions of porcelain by a foreigner was in the ''Chain of Chronicles'', written by the Arab traveler and merchant [[Suleiman]] in 851 AD during the Tang dynasty who recorded that:<ref name=\"temple\"/><ref name=\"Bushell 1906\">Bushell, S.

The artistic emphasis of Song pottery was on subtle glaze effects and graceful shapes; other decoration, where there was any, was mostly in shallow [[relief]].  Initially this was carved with a knife, but later [[Molding (process)|moulds]] were used, with a loss of artistic quality.  Painting was mostly used in the popular [[Cizhou ware]].  \"What is clear is that in the Song Dynasty which tended to uphold the esthetics of conventional Confucianism, underglaze blue was not at all popular; Confucian esthetics emphasized simplicity, and the underglaze blue designs were judged to be too ornamental.\"<ref name=\"Zhiyan 2010\">Zhiyan, Li, et al.

[[Yue ware]] was succeeded by [[Northern Celadon]] and then in the south [[Longquan celadon]].  White and black wares were also important, especially in [[Cizhou ware]], and there were polychrome types, but the finer types of ceramics, for the court and the literati, remained monochrome, relying on glaze effects and shape.  A wide variety of styles evolved in various areas, and those that were successful were imitated in other areas.  Important kiln sites and stoneware styles included [[Ru ware|Ru]], [[Jun ware|Jun]],  Southern Song [[Guan ware|Guan]] or official ware, [[Jian ware|Jian]] and [[Jizhou ware|Jizhou]].  Whitish porcelain continued to be improved, and included the continuation of [[Ding ware]] and the arrival of the ''[[qingbai]]'' which would replace it.\n[[File:Bowl (Wan) with Peony, Chrysanthemum, and Prunus Sprays LACMA M.73.48.101.jpg|thumb|[[Ding ware]] bowl with flower sprays]]\nThe Liao, Xia and Jin were founded by non-literate, often nomadic people who conquered parts of China.  Pottery production continued under their rule, but their own artistic traditions merged to some extent with the Chinese, producing characteristic new styles.\n\nThe fine pottery of all these regions was mainly high-fired, with some earthenware produced because of its lower cost and more colourful glazes.  Some of the clay used was what is called [[kaolinite]] in the West.  In some cases stoneware was preferred for its darker colour or better working qualities.  Potteries used the local clay, and when that was dark or coarse and they wanted a fine white body, they covered the clay with white slip before applying glaze.\n\n===Yuan dynasty, 1271\u20131368===\n[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|Early [[blue and white porcelain]], c. 1335, the shape from Islamic metalwork]]\n\nThe Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] enforced the movement of artists of all sorts around the Mongol Empire, which in ceramics brought a major stylistic and technical influence from the Islamic world in the form of [[blue and white porcelain]], with underglaze painting in [[cobalt]]. This has been described as the \"last great innovation in ceramic technology\".<ref>Medley, 169</ref> Decoration by underglaze painted patterns had long been a feature of Chinese pottery, especially in the popular [[Cizhou ware]] (mostly using black over slip), but was perhaps regarded as rather vulgar by the court and the [[Scholar-official|literati class]], and the finest ceramics were monochrome, using an understated aesthetic with perfect shapes and subtle glaze effects, often over shallow decoration carved or moulded into the surface.<ref>Vainker, 115\u2013117, 180</ref>\n\nThis was a great contrast to the bright colours and complicated designs developed under the Yuan, whose organization was mostly based on [[Islamic art]], especially metalwork, although the animal and vegetable motifs remained based on Chinese tradition.<ref>Medley, 180\u2013182</ref> These were initially mainly made for export,<ref>Vainker, 139\u2013140, 180</ref> but became acceptable at court, and to buyers of fine ceramics internally.  Export markets readily accepted the style, which has continued to be produced ever since, both in China and around the world.\n\nBecause of this, improvements in water transportation and the re-unification under Mongol rule, pottery production started to concentrate near deposits of [[kaolin]], such as [[Jingdezhen ware|Jingdezhen]], which gradually became the pre-eminent centre for producing porcelain in a variety of styles, a position it has held ever since.  The scale of production greatly increased, and the scale and organization of the kilns became industrialized, with ownership by commercial syndicates, much [[division of labour]], and other typical features of [[mass production]].<ref>Medley, 171</ref>  Some other types of pottery, especially [[Longquan celadon]] and Cizhou ware, continued to flourish.\n\n===Ming dynasty, 1368\u20131644===\n[[File:Chinese - Wine Jar with Carp among Water Weeds and Lotuses - Walters 491917 - View A (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Wucai]] ''Goldfish Vase'' from the [[Jiajing Emperor|Jiajing period]] (1521\u201367) of the [[Ming dynasty]]]]\n\nThe [[Ming dynasty]] saw an extraordinary period of innovation in ceramic manufacture.

This esteem for relatively recent ceramics excited much scorn on the part of [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati scholars]] (such as [[Wen Zhenheng]], [[Tu Long]], and [[Gao Lian (dramatist)|Gao Lian]], who is cited below); these men fancied themselves arbiters of taste and found the painted aesthetic 'vulgar.'<ref>James C.Y.

Thus aside from supplying porcelain for domestic use, the kilns at Jingdezhen became the main production centre for large-scale [[Chinese export porcelain|porcelain exports to Europe]] starting with the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (1572\u20131620). By this time, [[kaolin]] and pottery stone were mixed in about equal proportions. Kaolin produced wares of great strength when added to the paste; it also enhanced the whiteness of the body\u2014a trait that became a much sought after property, especially when form blue-and-white wares grew in popularity. Pottery stone could be fired at a lower temperature ({{convert|1250|C|F|disp=x|; }}) than paste mixed with kaolin, which required {{convert|1350|C|F}}. These sorts of variations were important to keep in mind because the large southern egg-shaped kiln varied greatly in temperature. Near the firebox it was hottest; near the chimney, at the opposite end of the kiln, it was cooler.\n\n===Qing dynasty, 1644\u20131911===\n[[File:Qing-YellowGlazedBrushHolderJingdezhenWare-ShanghaiMuseum-May27-08.jpg|thumb|''Yellow-glazed brush-holder'', \"Chen Guo Zhi\" mark; Jingdezhen [[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang period]], (1821\u201350); [[Shanghai Museum]]]]\n{{Further|Porcelain trade in Qing China}}\nThe lengthy civil wars marking the transition from Ming to Qing caused a breakdown in the Imperial kilns system, forcing the managers to find new markets. The [[Transitional porcelain]] of about 1620 to the 1680s saw a new style in painting, mostly in blue and white, with new subject-matter of landscapes and figures painted very freely, borrowing from other media. The later part of the period saw Europe joining the existing export markets.\n\nThe Qing dynasty produced very varied porcelain styles, developing many of the innovations of the Ming. The most notable area of continuing innovation was in the increasing range of colours available, mostly in [[overglaze enamels]].  A very significant trade in [[Chinese export porcelain]] with the West developed.  Court taste was highly eclectic, still favouring monochrome wares, which now used a wide range of bright glaze colours.  Special glazing effects were highly regarded; new ones were developed and classic Song wares imitated with great skill. But the court now accepted wares with painted scenes in both blue and white and the new bright polychrome palettes.  Technical standards at Jingdezhen were remarkably high, though falling somewhat by the middle of the 19th century.\n\nDecoration, and sometimes shapes, became increasingly over-elaborate and fussy, and generally the Ming period is regarded as the greater; indeed in China this was the case at the time.  By the 18th century the tradition had ceased to innovate in any radical way, and the vitality of painting declines.\n\nPrimary source material on [[Qing dynasty]] porcelain is available from both foreign residents and domestic authors. Two letters written by P\u00e8re [[Fran\u00e7ois Xavier d'Entrecolles]], a [[Jesuit]] missionary and industrial spy who lived and worked in Jingdezhen in the early 18th century, described in detail manufacturing of porcelain in the city.<ref name=\"letters\">see:  [http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/entrecolles.htm Two letters written by P\u00e8re Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CPaGVF5x?url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/entrecolles.htm |date=2012-11-24 }} at Ceramics Today.com</ref> In his first letter dated 1712, d'Entrecolles described the way in which pottery stones were crushed, refined and formed into little white bricks, known in Chinese as ''[[petuntse]]''. He then went on to describe the refining of china clay ''[[kaolin]]'' along with the developmental stages of glazing and firing. He explained his motives: {{quote| Nothing but my curiosity could ever have prompted me to such researches, but it appears to me that a minute description of all that concerns this kind of work might,  be useful in Europe.}}\n\nIn 1743, during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], Tang Ying, the imperial supervisor in the city produced a memoir entitled ''Twenty Illustrations of the Manufacture of Porcelain''.

In fact some other colours could be used, including [[cobalt]] blue. In the West, Tang sancai wares were sometimes referred to as ''egg-and-spinach''.\n\nSancai wares were northern wares made using white and buff-firing secondary kaolins and [[fire clay]]s.<ref name=\"Wood 1999\">Wood, Nigel (1999).

The burial wares were fired at a lower temperature than contemporaneous whitewares. [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]], such as the well-known representations of camels and horses, were cast in sections, in [[Molding (process)|mould]]s with the parts luted together using [[clay slip]]. They were either painted in ''sancai'' or merely coated in white slip, often with paint added over the glaze, which has now mostly been lost. In some cases, a degree of individuality was imparted to the assembled figurines by hand-carving.\n\n===Greenwares or celadon wares===\nThe major group of [[celadon]] wares is named for its glaze, which uses [[iron oxide]] to give a broad spectrum of colours centred on a jade or olive green, but covering browns, cream and light blues. This is a similar range to that of [[jade]], always the most prestigious material in Chinese art, and the broad resemblance accounts for much of the attractiveness of celadon to the Chinese. Celadons are plain or decorated in [[relief]], which may be carved, inscribed or moulded.  Sometimes taken by the imperial court, celadons had a more regular market with the scholarly and middle classes, and were also exported in enormous quantities.  Important types are: [[Yue ware]], [[Yaozhou ware]] and the wider Northern Celadons, [[Ru ware]], [[Guan ware]], and finally [[Longquan celadon]].\n\n=== Jian ware ===\n{{main|Jian ware}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:jian bowl.jpg|thumb|left|Jian tea bowl, [[Song dynasty]], 960\u20131279 AD ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1891.1.226)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/91.1.226 |title=Tea bowl, Song dynasty, 960\u20131279; Jian ware |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>]] -->\n'''''Jian Zhan''''' blackwares, mainly comprising tea wares, were made at kilns located in [[Jianyang, Fujian]] province.  They reached the peak of their popularity during the Song dynasty. The wares were made using locally won, iron-rich clays and fired in an [[Redox|oxidising]] atmosphere at temperatures in the region of {{convert|1300|C|F}}. The glaze was made using clay similar to that used for forming the body, except [[ceramic flux|flux]]ed with wood-[[ash glaze|ash]]. At high temperatures the molten glaze separate to produce a pattern called \"hare's fur\". When Jian wares were set tilted for firing, drips run down the side, creating evidence of liquid glaze pooling.\n\nJian tea wares of the Song dynasty were also greatly appreciated and copied in Japan, where they were known as ''[[tenmoku]]'' wares.\n[[File:Bol Dynastie Song Mus\u00e9e Guimet 2418.jpg|thumb|''White Glazed Ding Ware Bowl with Incised Design'' Northern Song dynasty (11th\u201312th Century); Porcelain, Mus\u00e9e Guimet 2418]]\n\n=== Jizhou ware ===\n{{main|Jizhou ware}}\nJizhou ware was stoneware, mostly used for tea drinking.  It was famous for glaze effects, including a \"tortoiseshell\" glaze, and the use of real leaves as glaze resists; the leaf burnt away during firing, leaving its outlines in the glaze.\n\n===Ding ware===\n{{main|Ding ware}}\n\n'''''Ding''''' ([[Wade\u2013Giles]]: ''Ting'') ware was produced in [[Dingzhou|Ding County]], [[Hebei]] Province. Already in production when the Song emperors came to power in 940, ''Ding'' ware was the finest porcelain produced in northern China at the time, and was the first to enter the palace for official imperial use. Its paste is white, generally covered with an almost transparent glaze that dripped and collected in \"tears\", (though some ''Ding'' ware was glazed a monochrome black or brown, white was the much more common type). Overall, the ''Ding'' aesthetic relied more on its elegant shape than ostentatious decoration; designs were understated, either incised or stamped into the clay prior to glazing. Due to the way the dishes were stacked in the kiln, the edged remained unglazed, and had to be rimmed in metal such as gold or silver when used as tableware. Some hundred years later, a Southern Song dynasty writer commented that it was this defect that led to its demise as favoured imperial ware.<ref name=\"James C.Y. Watt pp. 236\">James C.Y. Watt, \"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\" in ''Possessing the Past'', pp. 236\u201338.</ref> Since the Song government lost access to these northern kilns when they fled south, it has been argued that Qingbai ware (''see below'') was viewed as a replacement for ''Ding''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Qingbai wine ewer and basin |publisher=The British Museum |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/q/qingbai_wine_ewer_and_basin.aspx }}</ref>\n\nAlthough not as highly ranked as ''Ru'' ware, the late Ming dynasty connoisseur [[Gao Lian (dramatist)|Gao Lian]] awards Ding ware a brief mention in his volume ''Eight Discourses on the Art of Living''.

The Ru kilns were near the Northern Song capital at [[Kaifeng]]. In similar fashion to [[Longquan celadon]]s, Ru pieces have small amounts of iron oxide in their glaze that [[oxidize]] and turn greenish when fired in a reducing atmosphere.  Ru wares range in colour\u2014from nearly white to a deep robin's egg\u2014and often are covered with reddish-brown crackles. The crackles, or \"[[crazing]]\", are caused when the glaze cools and contracts faster than the body, thus having to stretch and ultimately to split, (''as seen in the detail at right; see also'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20081209060525/http://www1.chinaculture.org/created/2005-06/09/content_69528.htm]). The art historian James Watt comments that the Song dynasty was the first period that viewed crazing as a merit rather than a defect. Moreover, as time went on, the bodies got thinner and thinner, while glazes got thicker, until by the end of the Southern Song the 'green-glaze' was thicker than the body, making it extremely 'fleshy' rather than 'bony,' to use the traditional analogy (''see section on'' Guan ''ware, below''). Too, the glaze tends to drip and pool slightly, leaving it thinner at the top, where the clay peeps through.\n\n[[File:RuWare-V&AFE.1-1970Det.jpg|thumb|''[[Ru ware|Ru Ware]] Bowl Stand'', detail of crazing; [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&A]] FE.1\u20131970<ref name=\"Collections.vam.ac.uk\"/>]]\n\nAs with Ding ware, the Song imperial court lost access to the Ru kilns after it fled Kaifeng when the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] conquered northern China, and settled at [[Hangzhou|Lin'an]] (present-day [[Hangzhou]]) in the south. There, the [[Emperor Gaozong of Song|Emperor Gaozong]] founded the ''Guan yao'' ('official kilns') right outside the new capital in order to produce imitations of Ru ware.<ref>James C.Y. Watt, \"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\" in ''Possessing the Past'', pp. 238\u201342.</ref> However, posterity has remembered Ru ware as something unmatched by later attempts; Master Gao says, \"Compared with Guan yao, the above were of finer substance and more brilliant luster.\"<ref>Gao Lian, \"The ''Tsun Sheng Pa Chien'', AD 1591, by Kao Lien,\" p. 82.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bulb bowl Asian Art Museum SF B60P93.JPG|thumb|left|''Bulb Bowl with Scalloped Rim'', Northern Song dynasty (960\u20131127); Stoneware; [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]], San Francisco, B60P93<ref>{{cite web |url=http://67.52.109.59/code/emuseum.asp?style=browse&currentrecord=1&page=search&profile=objects&searchdesc=B60P93&quicksearch=B60P93&newvalues=1&newstyle=single&newcurrentrecord=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081209133217/http://67.52.109.59/code/emuseum.asp?style=browse&currentrecord=1&page=search&profile=objects&searchdesc=B60P93&quicksearch=B60P93&newvalues=1&newstyle=single&newcurrentrecord=1 |archivedate=2008-12-09 }}</ref>]]\n\n===Jun ware===\n{{main|Jun ware}}\n\n'''''Jun''''' (Wade\u2013Giles: '''''ch\u00fcn''''') ware was a third style of porcelain used at the Northern Song court. Characterized by a thicker body than Ding or Ru ware, Jun is covered with a turquoise and purple glaze, so thick and viscous looking that appears to melting off the golden-brown body. Not only are Jun vessels more thickly potted, their shape is much more robust than the fine Jun pieces, yet both types were appreciated at the court of [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]]. Jun production was centred at Jun-tai in [[Yuzhou, Henan|Yuzhou]], [[Henan Province]].<ref name=\"James C.Y.

Usually the term in English only applies to that produced by an official, imperially run kiln, which did not start until the Southern Song dynasty fled from the advancing [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and settled at [[Hangzhou|Lin'an]]. It was during this period that walls become so thin and glaze so thick that the latter superseded the former in breadth. As the clay in the foothills around Lin'an, was a brownish colour, and the glaze so viscous.<ref>\u2018Sheng Pa Chien'', AD 1591, by Kao Lien,\" pp.&nbsp;82\u20134.</ref>\n\n=== Ge ware ===\n[[File:Percival David Collection DSCF3585 01.jpg|thumb|[[Ge ware|Ge-type]] vase, with \"gold thread and iron wire\" double crackle]]\n{{Main|Ge ware}}\n'''''Ge''''' (Wade\u2013Giles:  '''''ko'''''), literally \"big-brother\" ware, due to a legend of two brothers working in Longquan, one made the typical [[celadon]] style ceramics, the elder made ''ge'' ware, produced in his private kiln. Ming dynasty commentator Gao Lian writes that the ''ge'' kiln took its clay from the same site as ''Guan'' ware, accounting for the difficulty in distinguishing one from the other (though Gao thinks \"''Ge'' is distinctly inferior\" to Guan).<ref>Gao Lian, \"The ''Tsun Sheng Pa Chien'', AD 1591, by Kao Lien,\" p. 84\u20135.</ref> Overall, Ge remains somewhat elusive, but basically comprises two types\u2014one with a 'warm rice-yellow glaze and two sets of crackles, a more prominent set of darker colour interspersed with a finer set of reddish lines' (called ''chin-ssu t'ieh-hsien'' or 'golden floss and iron threads', which can just faintly be detected on this bowl).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seco.glendale.edu/ceramics/songgebowl.html |title=Song Ge Ware Footed Bowl, Chinese |publisher=Seco.glendale.edu |accessdate=2012-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214162255/http://seco.glendale.edu/ceramics/songgebowl.html |archivedate=2012-12-14 }}</ref> The other Ge ware is much like Guan ware, with grayish glaze and one set of crackles. Once thought to have only been manufactured alongside [[Longquan celadon]], per its legendary founding, Ge is now believed to have also been produced at [[Jingdezhen]].<ref>James C.Y. Watt, \"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\" in ''Possessing the Past'', pp. 245\u201338.</ref>\n\nWhile similar to Guan ware, Ge typically has a grayish-blue glaze that is fully opaque with an almost matte finish. Its crackle pattern is exaggerated, often standing out in bold black. Though still shrouded in mystery, many specialists believe that Ge ware did not develop until the very late Southern Song dynasty or even the Yuan dynasty. In any case, enthusiasm for it persisted throughout the Ming dynasty; [[Wen Zhenheng]] preferred it to all other types of porcelain, in particular for brush washers and water droppers (although he preferred jade brush washers to porcelain, Guan and Ge were the best ceramic ones, especially if they have scalloped rims). Differences between later Ming imitations of Song/Yuan Ge include: Ming versions substitute a white porcelain body; they tend to be produced in a range of new shapes, for example those for the scholar's studio; glazes tend to be thinner and more lustrous; and slip is applied to the rim and base to simulate the \"brown mouth and iron foot\" of Guan ware.<ref>Robert Mowry ''The Chinese scholar's studio'', p. 164</ref>\n\n=== Qingbai wares ===\n{{main|Qingbai ware}}\n[[File:Lidded Prunus Vase (Meiping) with Lotus Sprays LACMA AC1999.38.6.1-.2.jpg|thumb|Lidded plum vase ([[meiping]]) with lotus sprays, [[Qingbai ware]], [[Southern Song]]. The glaze has collected in the carved indentations, where the colour is stronger.]]\n\nQingbai wares (also called 'yingqing')<ref>Wood, Nigel, ''Chinese Glazes''</ref> were made at Jingdezhen and at many other southern kilns from the time of the [[Northern Song dynasty]] until they were eclipsed in the 14th century by underglaze-decorated blue and white wares. Qingbai in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] literally means \"clear blue-white\". The qingbai glaze is a ''porcelain glaze'', so-called because it was made using pottery stone. The qingbai glaze is clear, but contains [[iron]] in small amounts. When applied over a white porcelain body the glaze produces a greenish-blue colour that gives the glaze its name. Some have incised or moulded decorations.\n\nThe Song dynasty qingbai bowl illustrated was likely made at the Jingdezhen village of Hutian, which was also the site of the imperial kilns established in 1004. The bowl has incised decoration, possibly representing clouds or the reflection of clouds in the water. The body is white, translucent and has the texture of very-fine [[sugar]], indicating that it was made using crushed and refined pottery stone instead of pottery stone and [[kaolin]]. The glaze and the body of the bowl would have been fired together, in a [[Saggar fired pottery|saggar]] in a large wood-burning [[dragon kiln]], typical of southern kilns in the period.\n\nThough many Song and Yuan dynasty qingbai bowls were fired upside down in special segmented saggars, a technique first developed at the [[Ding Ware|Ding]] kilns in [[Hebei]] province. The rims of such wares were left unglazed but were often bound with bands of [[silver]], [[copper]] or [[lead]].\n\nOne remarkable example of ''qingbai'' porcelain is the so-called [[Fonthill Vase]], described in a guide for [[Fonthill Abbey]] published in 1823 as \"an oriental china bottle, superbly mounted, said to be the earliest known specimen of porcelain introduced into Europe\".\n\nThe vase was made at Jingdezhen, probably around 1300 and was probably sent as a present to [[Pope Benedict XII]] by one of the last [[List of emperors of the Yuan dynasty|Yuan emperors]] of China, in 1338. The mounts referred to in the 1823 description were of enamelled silver-gilt and were added to the vase in Europe in 1381. An 18th-century water colour of the vase complete with its mounts exists, but the mounts themselves were removed and lost in the 19th century. The vase is now in the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. It is often held that ''qingbai'' wares were not subject to the higher standards and regulations of the other porcelain wares, since they were made for everyday use. They were mass-produced, and received little attention from scholars and [[antiquarian]]s. The Fonthill Vase, given by a Chinese emperor to a pope, might appear to cast at least some doubt on this view.\n\n=== Blue and white wares ===\n[[File:Bluepot porcelain.jpg|thumb|[[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi period]] (1661 to 1722) blue and white porcelain [[tea caddy]]]]\n{{main|Blue and white porcelain}}\n\nFollowing in the tradition of earlier ''qingbai'' porcelains, blue and white wares are glazed using a transparent ''porcelain glaze''. The blue decoration is painted onto the body of the porcelain before glazing, using very finely ground [[Cobalt(II) oxide|cobalt oxide]] mixed with water. After the decoration has been applied the pieces are glazed and fired.\n\nIt is believed that underglaze blue and white porcelain was first made in the [[Tang dynasty]]. Only three complete pieces of Tang blue and white porcelain are known to exist (in Singapore from the Indonesian Belitung shipwreck), but shards dating to the 8th or 9th century have been unearthed at [[Yangzhou]] in [[Jiangsu|Jiangsu Province]]. It has been suggested that the shards originated from a kiln in the province of [[Henan]]. In 1957, excavations at the site of a [[pagoda]] in [[Zhejiang]] province uncovered a Northern Song bowl decorated with underglaze blue and further fragments have since been discovered at the same site. In 1970 a small fragment of a blue and white bowl, again dated to the 11th century, was also excavated in the province of Zhejiang.\n\nIn 1975, shards decorated with underglaze blue were excavated at a kiln site in [[Jiangxi]] and, in the same year, an underglaze blue and white [[urn]] was excavated from a tomb dated to 1319, in the province of [[Jiangsu]]. It is of interest to note that a Yuan [[urn|funerary urn]] decorated with underglaze blue and underglaze red and dated 1338 is still in the Chinese taste, even though by this time the large-scale production of blue and white porcelain in the Yuan dynasty, [[Mongols|Mongol]] taste had started its influence at Jingdezhen.\n\nStarting early in the 14th century, blue and white porcelain rapidly became the main product of Jingdezhen, reaching the height of its technical excellence during the later years of the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1661-1722)<ref name=\"de Boulay 1973\">de Boulay, Anthony (1973). ''Chinese Porcelain''. Octopus Books, London. {{ISBN|0-7064-0045-3}}</ref> and continuing in present times to be an important product of the city.\n\nThe [[tea caddy]] illustrated shows many of the characteristics of blue and white porcelain produced during the Kangxi period. The translucent body showing through the clear glaze is of great whiteness and the cobalt decoration, applied in many layers, has a fine blue [[hue]]. The decoration, a sage in a landscape of lakes and mountains with ''blazed'' rocks is typical of the period. The piece would have been fired in a [[Saggar fired pottery|saggar]] (a lidded ceramic box intended to protect the piece from kiln debris, smoke and cinders during firing) in a [[reducing atmosphere]] in a wood-burning ''egg-shaped'' kiln, at a temperature approaching {{convert|1350|C|F}}.\n\nDistinctive blue-and-white porcelain was exported to Japan, where it is known as [[Tenkei blue-and-white ware]] or ''ko sometsukei''. This ware is thought to have been especially ordered by tea masters for [[Japanese tea ceremony|Japanese ceremony]].\n\n[[File:Status of Kuan Yin.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Guanyin]], Ming dynasty ([[Shanghai Museum]])]]\n\n=== Blanc de Chine ===\n{{main|Blanc de Chine}}\n\n''Blanc de Chine'' is a type of white porcelain made at [[Dehua County|Dehua]] in [[Fujian]] province. It has been produced from the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) to the present day. Large quantities arrived in Europe as [[Chinese Export Porcelain]] in the early 18th century and it was copied at [[Meissen]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe area along the Fujian coast was traditionally one of the main ceramic exporting centres. Over 180 kiln sites have been identified extending in historical range from the Song dynasty to the present.\n\nFrom the Ming dynasty, porcelain objects were manufactured that achieved a fusion of glaze and body traditionally referred to as \"ivory white\" and \"milk white\". The special characteristic of Dehua porcelain is the very small amount of iron oxide in it, allowing it to be fired in an oxidising atmosphere to a warm white or pale ivory colour.  (Wood, 2007)\n\nThe porcelain body is not very plastic but vessel forms have been made from it. Donnelly, (1969, pp.xi-xii) lists the following types of product: figures, boxes, vases and jars, cups and bowls, fishes, lamps, cup-stands, censers and flowerpots, animals, brush holders, wine and teapots, [[Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]] figures, secular figures and puppets. There was a large output of figures, especially religious figures, e.g. [[Guanyin]], [[Maitreya]], [[Arhat|Lohan]] and Ta-mo figures.\n[[File:Kinesisk vinoffersk\u00e5l i porslin med dekor i relief best\u00e5ende av huvudet och frambenen av en drake - Hallwylska museet - 95557.tif|thumb|left|Late-Ming [[Dehua porcelain|Dehua]] cup, with dragon]]\n\nThe numerous Dehua porcelain factories today make figures and tableware in modern styles. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] \"Dehua artisans applied their very best skills to produce immaculate statuettes of [[Mao Zedong]] and the Communist leaders. Portraits of the stars of the new proletarian opera in their most famous roles were produced on a truly massive scale.\"<ref>(Ayers and Bingling, 2002)</ref> Mao Zedong figures later fell out of favour but have been revived for foreign collectors.\n\nNotable artists in ''blanc de Chine'', such as the late Ming period [[He Chaozong]], signed their creations with their seals. Wares include crisply modeled figures, [[cup]]s, bowls and joss stick-holders.\n\nMany of the best examples of ''blanc de Chine'' are found in Japan where the white variety was termed ''hakugorai'' or \"Korean white\", a term often found in [[tea ceremony]] circles. The [[British Museum]] in London has a large number of ''blanc de Chine'' pieces, having received as a gift in 1980 the entire collection of P.J. Donnelly.<ref>(Harrison-Hall, 2001)</ref>\n\n===Painted colours===\n[[File:Jar (Ping) with the Eight Immortals (Baxian) LACMA 53.41.6a.jpg|thumb|''[[Wucai]]'' jar with the [[Eight Immortals]], Ming, [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] reign, 1573\u20131620]]\nChinese court taste long favoured monochrome wares, and although the Yuan dynasty saw blue and white porcelain accepted by the court, more fully polychrome styles took  much longer to be accepted.  Initially blue from [[cobalt]] was almost the only pigment that could withstand the high temperature of a porcelain firing without discolouring, but gradually (mostly during the Ming period) others were found, or the extra cost of a second firing at a lower temperature to fix [[overglaze enamels]] was accepted. Copper-reds could produce highly effective results underglaze, but at the cost of an extremely high proportion of greyish rejects, some of which remain in circulation, and thousands more of which have been found when kiln waste-heaps have been excavated.  Eventually underglaze blue and overglaze red became the usual way of achieving the same result.\n\nOverglaze painting, usually called \"enamels\", was widely used in the popular [[Cizhou ware]] stonewares, and was sometimes experimented with by kilns producing for the court, but not until the 15th century, under the Ming, was the ''[[doucai]]'' technique used for imperial wares. This combined underglaze blue outlines with overglaze enamels in further colours.<ref>Valenstein, 153-157</ref>  The ''[[wucai]]'' technique was a similar combination, with underglaze blue used more widely for highlights.<ref>Pierson, Stacey, ''From Object to Concept: Global Consumption and the Transformation of Ming Porcelain'', 2013, Hong Kong University Press, {{ISBN|9888139835}}, 9789888139835, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B4SD9lv7ZBUC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14 google books]</ref>\n\nTwo-colour wares, using underglaze blue and an overglaze colour, usually red, also produced very fine results. A number of different other methods using coloured glazes were tried, often with images lightly incised into the body.  The ''[[fahua]]'' technique outlined areas of coloured decoration with raised trails of slip, and the subtle \"secret\" (''[[an hua]]'') technique decorated using very light incisions that could hardly be seen.  As the range of glaze colours expanded, the taste for monochrome wares, now in the new strong colours, returned, and with it a number of special glazing effects were developed, including the return of crackle and spotty effects made by blowing powdered pigment onto the piece.<ref>Valenstein, 167, 172-178</ref>\n\n===={{anchor|Classification by colour}}Classification by colour, the {{lang|fr|famille}} groups====\nThe next development saw a group of 'families', or palettes of enamel colours used on Chinese porcelain. These are commonly known by their French names of {{lang|fr|famille jaune, noire, rose, verte}}, based on the dominant element in each colour palette are terms used to classify.  A large proportion of these were [[Chinese export porcelain|export wares]].\n\n* '''{{vanchor|Famille verte}}''' ({{lang|zh|\u5eb7\u7199\u4e94\u5f69}}, ''Kangxi wucai'', also {{lang|zh|\u7d20\u4e09\u5f69}}, ''susancai'', {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \u2018three colours on a plain [unglazed or thinly glazed] body\u2019), adopted in the [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi period]] (1661\u20131722), uses green and [[iron red]] with other overglaze colours. It developed from the ''wucai'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e94\u5f69}}, \"five colours\") style.\n** '''{{vanchor|Famille jaune}}''' is a variation using {{lang|fr|famille verte}} [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]] on a yellow ground ({{lang|zh|\u9ec3\u5730}}), often painted on the [[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]. \n** '''{{vanchor|Famille noire}}''' ({{lang|zh|\u9ed1\u5730\u7d20\u4e09\u5f69}}, ''modi susancai'') is another subtype of {{lang|fr|famille verte}}, but it uses a black ground.  Many {{lang|fr|famille jaune}} and  {{lang|fr|famille noir}} pieces were \"clobbered\" with the yellow or black added in the 19th century. \n* '''{{vanchor|Famille rose}}''' (known in Chinese as ''fencai'' ({{lang|zh|\u7c89\u5f69}}) or ''ruancai'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u8edf\u5f69}} / {{lang|zh-hans|\u8f6f\u5f69}}), {{abbr|lit.|literally}} 'soft colours' or 'pale colours', and later as ''Yangcai'' ({{lang|zh|\u6d0b\u5f69}}), lit. 'foreign colours') was introduced late in the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1661\u20131722), possibly around 1720. It used mainly pink or purple and remained popular throughout the 18th and the 19th centuries, also being widely adopted by European factories.  {{lang|fr|Famille rose}} enamel ware allows a greater range of colour and tone than was previously possible, enabling the depiction of more complex images, including flowers, figures and insects.\n\n{{Gallery \n| title        =  Examples of {{lang|fr|famille verte}} works\n| height = 120px\n| width = 120px\n| File:Porcelaine chinoise Guimet 271101.jpg | ''Famille verte'' dish, [[Kangxi period]] (1661-1722)\n| File:Wusai vase Shunzi period circa 1650 1660.jpg | ''Wucai'' vase, [[Shunzhi period]], {{circa|1650}}\u20131660\n| File:Wucai plate for exportation Kangxi period circa 1680 bis.jpg | ''Wucai'' [[Chinese export porcelain|export]] plate, [[Kangxi period]], {{ca.|1680}}\n| File:Wucai plate for exportation Kangxi period circa 1680.jpg | ''Wucai'' [[Chinese export porcelain|export]] plate, [[Kangxi period]], {{ca.|1680}}\n}}\n\n{{Gallery\n| title        = Examples of {{lang|fr|famille rose}} works\n| File:Jingdezhen soft paste porcelain flower holder Famille Rose 1736 1796 Qianlong period.jpg | [[Soft paste]] {{lang|fr|famille rose}} flower holder, [[Jingdezhen]], [[Qianlong period]] (1735\u201396)\n| File:Qing export porcelain with European figure Famille Rose first half of 18th century.jpg | [[Chinese export porcelain|Export porcelain]] with European figure, {{lang|fr|famille rose}}, first half of 18th century, Qing dynasty\n| File:Chinese Export Hard Paste Famille Rose Double Peacock Plates.jpg | [[Double Peacock Dinner Service]] [[Chinese export porcelain|export]]: {{lang|fr|famille rose}} [[service plates|service]] with peacocks over a rock, late 18th century\n}}\n\n==Stoneware==\n[[File:Yixing teapot, China, Chen Hongshou, Yang Pengnian, Qing dynasty, c. 1800-1835, stoneware - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC03858.JPG|thumb|left|Inscribed [[Yixing clay teapot|Yixing teapot]], Qing dynasty, c. 1800\u20131835, stoneware]]\nPottery classified as [[stoneware]] in the West is usually regarded as porcelain in Chinese terms, where a stoneware group is not recognised, and so the definition of porcelain is rather different, covering all vitrified high-fired wares.  Terms such as \"{{linktext|porcellaneous}}\" and \"near-porcelain\" are often used to reflect this, and cover wares that in Western terms lie on the border of stoneware and porcelain. High-fired stonewares were numerous from very early on, and included many high-prestige wares, including those for imperial use, as well as great quantities of everyday utilitarian pots.  Usually they achieved their reputation by their glazes.  Most of the [[celadon]] group, including [[Longquan celadon]]s, especially earlier ones, can be classified as stoneware, and all classic [[Jian ware]]s and [[Jizhou ware]]s.\n\nBy contrast, the [[Yixing clay teapot]]s and cups made from [[Yixing clay]] from [[Jiangsu]] province are usually left unglazed, and not washed after use, as the clay is believed to improve the taste of the tea, especially after it acquires a [[patina]] from long use. There are in fact a number of different clays, giving a range of colours. The pots are unusual in that they are often signed by their potters, which is very rare in China, perhaps because they were associated with the [[Scholar-official|literati]] culture, of which Jiangsu was a stronghold. The earliest datable example is from a burial of 1533 in [[Nanjing]]. Elaborately decorated examples, often with a rectangular body, were exported to Europe from the 18th century, and these and pots for local use often had poems inscribed on them.  As well as teaware and desk objects such as [[brush-rest]]s, fruit and other natural shapes were modelled as ornaments.  Production continues today, generally using simpler shapes.<ref>Vainker, 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n==The ceramics industry under the Ming==\n[[File:Ming dynasty Xuande mark and period (1426\u201335) imperial blue and white vase, from The Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u660e\u5ba3\u5fb7 \u666f\u5fb7\u93ae\u7aaf\u9752\u82b1\u8cab\u8033\u74f6, \u7ebd\u7ea6\u5927\u90fd\u535a\u7269\u9986 .jpg|thumbnail|right|Ming dynasty [[Xuande Emperor|Xuande]] mark and period (1426\u201335) imperial blue and white vase.]]\n\n=== Imperial and private kilns ===\nThe very first imperial kiln was established in the thirty-fifth year of Hongwu.<ref name=\"Ding, Pengbo 2013 P. 69\">Ding, Pengbo, \u4e01\u9e4f\u52c3. \u201c\u660e\u4ee3\u5fa1\u5668\u5382\u8bbe\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u201d (Discussing the Establishing Time in the Imperial Kilns in Ming Period), \u5357\u65b9\u6587\u7269 (Cultural Relics in the Southern China)13.3 (March 2013): 66-69.

Apart from making ceramics for people's everyday life, private kilns also accepted orders from the imperial court. However, making and selling imperial style ceramics in private kilns was strictly forbidden.<!-- contradiction here --><ref name=\"Yoshiaki Ten\u014d 1989 P. 53\"/>\n\nDuring the late Ming period, private kilns rose as imperial kilns declined. Many famous workers escaped from the overworked and underpaid environment in the imperial kilns to private ones. Private kilns were more involved in commercials than the imperial kilns did.<!-- what does this mean?? --> In the late Ming period, several private kilns won great popularity among the literati, who were enthusiastic about the antique style porcelain. Examples were the Cui kiln ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u516c\u7a91}}), Zhou kiln ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u7a91}}), and Hu kiln ({{lang|zh|\u58f6\u516c\u7a91}}).<ref name=\"Liu Mingshan p.242\"/> Ceramics in the late Ming dynasty was produced in high quality and quantity, making Jingdezhen one of the earliest commercial centres in the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dillon|first=Michael|date=1992|title=Transport and Marketing in the Development of the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry during the Ming and Qing Dynasties|url=|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=|pages=278\u2013290|via=}}</ref>\n\nCompetition in the porcelain industry erupted following the failure of the corvee system.<ref>Wen-Chin, Hsu. \u201cSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.\u201d ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', no. 1, 1988, pp. 135\u2013159. p.140</ref> With government control at a low, investors could invest in many means of production, especially in handicraft industries. In Jingdezhen, over 70 percent of the 100,000 families occupying the 6.5 square kilometre town were involved in the porcelain industry.\n\nThe economic resurgence brought on by the porcelain industry carried along its own ramifications. There existed two sides of the porcelain industry which are described as ''jiating shougongye'' ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5bb6\u5ead\u624b\u5de5\u4e1a}}, \"family-run industry\") and ''zuofang shougongye'' ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4f5c\u574a\u624b\u5de5\u4e1a}}, \"entrepreneurial industry\").<ref>Wen-Chin, Hsu. \u201cSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.\u201d ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', no. 1, 1988, pp. 135\u2013159. p.142</ref> Family-run industries reveal the ruthless and inhumane side of the porcelain industry as seen in the story of Yang Shi in \u201cAn Injustice Caused by a Slight Dispute Over One Penny\u201d.

Especially within work involving relatives or immediate family, one's own self worth and concept will be diminished in the face of success for the business.\n\nThe cut-throat mentality served to blur the family hierarchy within family-run industries to some degree. Porcelain production required both the construction of pots as well as the decorations done after. Within a family-run pottery industry, the women took on this decorating role which helped to increase their value to the family. Men and women had to work harmoniously to produce good quality work and ultimately this spread throughout the porcelain industry.<ref name=\"Wen-Chin, Hsu 1683. pp. 135\"/>\n\n=== Life as a potter ===\nIn the early Ming dynasty, the population could be divided into three categories: military, craftsmen, and peasants. Within the craftsmen system, most of the craftsmen were from the previous dynasty, the Yuan Dynasty, others were prisoners or unemployed people. Craftsmen households members had to work throughout their lifetime, and their status was hereditary. There were two subcategories within the craftsmen system: military craftsmen, who were specialized in producing weapon; the ordinary craftsmen, who worked in various other industries. Potters belonged to the latter subcategory.<ref>Li Chuanwen, \u674e\u4f20\u6587, \u660e\u4ee3\u5320\u4f5c\u5236\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty).

Usually, there were different types of workers in the imperial kilns. Most of the potters were selected from the craftsman households by the local government and served in the imperial kilns for three months in every four years for free; in other cases, workers were recruited from counties near the imperial kilns and paid regularly. Usually the recruited workers were assigned to different departments.<ref>Liu Mingshan, \u5218\u660e\u6749, \u201c\u660e\u4ee3\u5b98\u7a91\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528,\u201d (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), \u660e\u53f2\u7814\u7a76(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.221-222.</ref>\n\nThe imperial factory was divided into twenty-three departments, with each department having managers and workers. The number of managers was usually less than five, and the number of workers was usually about ten to twenty.<ref>Li Chuanwen, \u674e\u4f20\u6587, \u660e\u4ee3\u5320\u4f5c\u5236\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty).

More than half the firings of every kiln resulted in spoilt pieces and were thrown away in the neighborhood of Jingdezhen, resulting in a huge dump of porcelain fragments that still exist today. When the kiln was in action, it was important to control the fire, which ideally should produce a constant temperature. The proper choice, preparation, colouring, firing, and the slip should be made on every stage of the production.<ref>Jenyns, 16</ref> The regulations on the potters working in the imperial kiln were severe. Potters were punished for delaying, smuggling, producing inferior goods, and other misconducts.<ref>Li Chuanwen, \u674e\u4f20\u6587, \u660e\u4ee3\u5320\u4f5c\u5236\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty).

By the time of Xuande period, the number of potters escaping from the corvee was about five thousand; in the first year of Jingtai, the number reached about thirty thousand. There was also a great discrepancy in the number of workers in different departments. Sometimes private kiln workers from the corresponding departments would serve as temporary workers in the imperial kilns. To regulate the potters, the government reformed the policy so that the potters would not have to work in the imperial kilns if they pay certain amount of money per month.<ref>Li Chuanwen, \u674e\u4f20\u6587, \u660e\u4ee3\u5320\u4f5c\u5236\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty).

Unable to stand the hard law and the heavy work, lots of talented workers found their new positions in the private kilns. The imperial kilns suffered from the lost in talented potters and labors, and the quality of the porcelain declined dramatically.<ref>Liu Mingshan, \u5218\u660e\u6749, \u201c\u660e\u4ee3\u5b98\u7a91\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528,\u201d (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), \u660e\u53f2\u7814\u7a76(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.224.</ref>\n\nStarting from the ninth year of Jiajing, a new policy was carried out. The government prepared their own materials, utilized the private kilns to make porcelain, and paid the private kilns based on the number of porcelain produced. However, the state was usually not able to pay the amount required.<ref>Liu Mingshan, \u5218\u660e\u6749, \u201c\u660e\u4ee3\u5b98\u7a91\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528,\u201d (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), \u660e\u53f2\u7814\u7a76(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.223.</ref>\n\n=== Post-production ===\n[[File:MET DP342705 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Porcelain Jar with cobalt blue under a transparent glaze, [[Jingdezhen porcelain]], mid-15th century.]]\n\nThe industrialization of Chinese porcelain during the Ming dynasty was not possible without a post-production system that honored scalability as well as scarcity. Individual retail sales were important to kilns but wholesale orders were of even higher importance.<ref>Michael Dillon, \u201cTransport and Marketing in the Development of the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.\u201d ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', vol. 35, no. 3, 1992, pp. 278\u2013290. p.286</ref> In reality, wholesale orders were the backbone of porcelain economics. Without these orders that required months to a year of work to complete, demand would have definitely been lacking.\n\nMerchants entered provinces with little knowledge of how porcelain trade was conducted. They relied on brokers to introduce them to reliable kilns and ultimately negotiate prices. Once established, merchants took on negotiating matters. In particular, brokers helped alleviate risk for many kilns by analyzing the integrity of buyers. Due to the guild-esque nature between brokers and kiln owners, guilty knowledge of the buyer's secrets was common talk.<ref>Michael Dillon, Dillon, Michael. \u201cTransport and Marketing in the Development of the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.\u201d ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', vol. 35, no. 3, 1992, pp. 278\u2013290. p.287</ref> If a buyer was deemed as unreliable, word spread throughout the province of such news. Potters claimed the license to know who the bad buyers were. This dangerous knowledge had the ability to ruin a buyer's reputation but on the contrary contributed to the success of kilns.\n\nIn observing court orders, porcelain was required for culinary, religious, and display purposes. Since porcelain was often used once and thrown away by the court, imperial orders were at a continuous flow in porcelain factories.<ref name=\"Pierson, Stacey 1800. pp. 229\"/> Demand was often too high for kilns to meet which hints at the necessity for scalability.\n\nFrom their respective kilns, fine porcelain was distributed over sea and land to Southeast Asia, Japan and the Middle East. The magnitude of foreign trade can be understood in a record showing over sixteen million pieces circulating through a Dutch East India Company.<ref>Wen-Chin, Hsu. \u201cSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.\u201d ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', no. 1, 1988, pp. 135\u2013159. p.151</ref> The land transportation showed the intensity of labor in the porcelain industry. Dozens of carts sent from Mongolia, Manchuria, Persia and Arabic countries were loaded in the Ming capital full of porcelain and other Chinese goods. Some carts reached thirty feet in height which must have required extreme attention to avoid broken porcelain. Due to the hollowness of porcelain vases, they were filled with soil and beans.<ref>Wen-Chin, Hsu p. 151</ref> The growth of the bean roots helped porcelain withstand further pressure during transportation. In order to effectively transport large amounts of porcelain, as much space in carts must have been used indicated by the thirty foot high carts. Knowing the risk that came with placing fragile porcelain next to and on top of one another, handlers of the porcelain mitigated that risk through the soil and bean method.\n[[File:MET DP-14156-003 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Brush-rest with Arabic inscription; [[Chinese export porcelain|probably for export to the Islamic world]].]]\n\nLike the silk industry, the porcelain industry claimed merit for its mass-producing capabilities. Potters from lower economic backgrounds stuck true to their repetitive methods mostly due to the high risk in attempting new and not tested methods. Trying new techniques could result in the loss of an entire month's worth of work so for these potters, changing their method was not a luxury they could afford.<ref name=\"Finley, Robert 2010, pp. 17\">Finley, Robert \u201cThe Porcelain City: Jingdezhen in the Eighteenth Century.\u201d ''The Pilgrim Art: Cultures of Porcelain in World History,'' 1st ed., University of California Press, 2010, pp. 17\u201346. p.24</ref> These potters were found in peasant societies outside of Jingdezhen and highlight the particular code that limited their imaginative potential. For potters within Jingdezhen, the code that governed the way their products were created was greatly influenced by international markets. These markets inspired creativity and innovation as seen in how \u201cJingdezhen and other pottery centres produced ceramic versions of reliquaries, alms bowls, oil lamps, and stem-cups\u201d<ref name=\"Finley, Robert 2010, pp. 17\"/> The difference in code did not necessarily contribute to a hierarchical division but rather a diversification in the personality behind Chinese porcelain.\n\nForeign trade was not always beneficial for potters because the further away that products had to go from the source (Ex: Jingdezhen) the more vulnerable cargo became. In examining a report of a Spanish voyage, about a fifth of a Chinese ship crew were killed when met by a Spanish voyager of the name Juan de Salcedo.<ref>Laura Lee Junker, \u201cThe Long-Distance Porcelain Trade.\u201d ''Raiding, Trading. and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms'', University of Hawai'i Press, 1999, pp. 183\u2013220. p.196</ref> The two ships that were raided held many Chinese valuables including porcelain and most likely were used to trade off the coast of Midoro. Overall, international markets offered great potential for potters seeking greater wealth but unfortunately came with a vulnerability to crime.\n\nTrade on an international scale required organization between chiefs and potters. Throughout the Southeast Asian trading ports, chiefs had the power to set port fees as well as control interactions between elite merchants and foreign traders.<ref>Laura Lee Junker, \u201cThe Long-Distance Porcelain Trade.\u201d ''Raiding, Trading. and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms'', University of Hawai'i Press, 1999, pp. 183\u2013220. p.206</ref> By possessing the license to impose fees, chiefs were able to profit on almost every transaction within their respective markets and it serves to boost their brilliance in constructing such a diverse market. Potters of luxury porcelain would have to work under the rules set by the chiefs and thus their relationship constructed a hierarchy.\n\n== Fakes and reproductions ==\n[[File:Kangxi mark.jpg|thumb|[[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi period]] mark on a piece of late nineteenth century blue and white porcelain.]]\nChinese potters have a long tradition of borrowing design and decorative features from earlier wares.  Whilst ceramics with features thus borrowed might sometimes pose problems of [[provenance]], they would not generally be regarded as either reproductions or fakes. However, fakes and reproductions have also been made at many times during the long history of Chinese ceramics and continue to be made today in ever-increasing numbers.\n\nIn addition, the reign marks of earlier emperors (typically from the Ming) were often put on Qing wares, which scholars are often inclined to treat as a mark of respect  or aspiration rather than an attempt to deceive, although they clearly did often mislead centemporaries, and confuse understanding.\n\n* Imitations and reproductions of Song dynasty [[Longquan celadon]] wares were made at Jingdezhen in the early 18th century, but outright fakes were also made using special clay that were artificially aged by boiling in meat [[broth]], refiring and storage in [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s. P\u00e8re d'Entrecolles records that by this means the wares could be passed off as being hundreds of years old.<ref name=\"letters\"/>\n* In the late 19th century, fakes of Kangxi-period ''famille noire'' wares were made that were convincing enough to deceive the experts of the day. Many such pieces may still be seen in museums today, as may pieces of genuine Kangxi porcelain were given additional overglaze decoration in the late nineteenth century with ''famille noire'' enamels (a process known as \"clobbering\"). A body of modern expert opinion holds that porcelain decorated with ''famille noire'' enamels was not made at all during the Kangxi period, though this view is disputed.<ref name=\"de Boulay 1973\"/>\n* A fashion for Kangxi period (1661 to 1722) blue and white wares grew to large proportions in Europe during the later years of the 19th century and triggered the production at Jingdezhen of large quantities of porcelain wares that strike a resemblance to ceramics of earlier periods. Such blue and white wares were not fakes or even convincing reproductions, even though some pieces carried four-character Kangxi reign-marks that continue to cause confusion to this day. Kangxi reign-marks in the form shown in the illustration occur only on wares made towards the end of the 19th century or later, without exception.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Authentication==\nThe most widely known test is the [[thermoluminescence]] test, or TL test, which is used on some types of ceramic to estimate, roughly, the date of last firing. [[Thermoluminescence dating]] is carried out on small samples of pottery drilled or cut from the body of a piece, which can be risky and disfiguring. For this reason, the test is rarely used for dating finely potted, high-fired ceramics.

The first [[pottery]] was made during the [[List of Palaeolithic sites in China|Palaeolithic]] era. Chinese ceramics range from construction materials such as bricks and tiles, to hand-built pottery vessels fired in bonfires or [[kiln]]s, to the sophisticated Chinese [[porcelain]] wares made for the imperial court and for export. Porcelain was a [[Chinese invention]] and is so identified with China that it is still called \"china\" in everyday English usage.\n[[Image:Ming-Schale1.jpg|thumb|A Ming-dynasty [[blue-and-white porcelain]] dish with a dragon]]\n\nMost later Chinese ceramics, even of the finest quality, were made on an industrial scale, thus few names of individual potters were recorded. Many of the most important kiln workshops were owned by or reserved for the emperor, and large quantities of [[Chinese export porcelain]] were exported as [[diplomatic gift]]s or for trade from an early date, initially to East Asia and the Islamic world, and then from around the 16th century to Europe.  Chinese ceramics have had an enormous influence on other ceramic traditions in these areas.\n[[Image:Porcelaine chinoise Guimet 231103.jpg|thumb|[[Yaozhou ware]] [[celadon]] bowl, [[Song dynasty]], 10th-11th century.]]\n\nIncreasingly over their long history, Chinese ceramics can be classified between those made for the imperial court to use or distribute, those made for a discriminating Chinese market, and those for popular Chinese markets or [[Chinese export porcelain|for export]].  Some types of wares were also made only or mainly for special uses such as burial in tombs, or for use on altars.\n\n==Terminology and categories== \n[[File:Song Dynasty Porcelain.jpg|thumb|A [[Qingbai ware|qingbai]] porcelain vase, bowl, and model of a [[granary]] with transparent blue-toned glaze, from the period of the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279 AD)]]\n\nThe earliest Chinese pottery was [[earthenware]], which continued in production for utilitarian uses throughout Chinese history, but was increasingly less used for fine wares. [[Stoneware]], fired at higher temperatures, and naturally impervious to water, was developed very early and continued to be used for fine pottery in many areas at most periods; the tea bowls in [[Jian ware]] and [[Jizhou ware]] made during the [[Song dynasty]] are examples.\n\n{{anchor|Porcelain defined}}\n[[Porcelain]], on a Western definition, is \"a collective term comprising all ceramic ware that is white and translucent, no matter what ingredients are used to make it or to what use it is put\".<ref>''An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery.'' 2nd edition.

W. (1977) ''Chinese Pottery and Porcelain.'' Oxford University Press, Kuala Lumpur. {{ISBN|0-19-580372-8}}.</ref>\n\nChinese pottery can also be classified as being either ''northern'' or ''southern''.  China comprises two separate and geologically different land masses, brought together by [[continental drift]] and forming a junction that lies between the [[Yellow River|Yellow]] and [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] rivers, sometimes known as the [[Zhongnan Mountains|Nanshan]]-[[Qinling]] divide. The contrasting geology of the north and south led to differences in the raw materials available for making ceramics; in particular the north lacks [[petunse]] or \"porcelain stone\", needed for porcelain on the strict definition. Ware-types can be from very widespread kiln-sites in either north or south China, but the two can nearly always be distinguished, and influences across this divide may affect shape and decoration, but will be based on very different clay bodies, with fundamental effects.  The kiln types were also different, and in the north the fuel was usually coal, as opposed to wood in the south, which often affects the wares. Southern materials have high [[silica]], low [[alumina]] and high [[potassium oxide]], the reverse of northern materials in each case.  The northern materials are often very suitable for stoneware, while in the south there are also areas highly suitable for porcelain.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DCuAD6cofjYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Korean+art+from+Gompertz&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=&f=false Korean art from the Gompertz and other collections in the Fitzwilliam Museum], ed.

This in turn has led to confusion about when the first Chinese porcelain was made. Claims have been made for the late [[Han dynasty|Eastern Han dynasty]] (100\u2013200 AD), the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220\u2013280 AD), the [[Six Dynasties]] period (220\u2013589 AD), and the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013906 AD).\n\nKiln technology has always been a key factor in the development of Chinese pottery. The Chinese developed effective kilns capable of firing at around {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|F}} before 2000 BC.  These were updraft kilns, often built below ground.  Two main types of kiln were developed by about 200 AD and remained in use until modern times.  These are the [[dragon kiln]] of hilly southern China, usually fuelled by wood, long and thin and running up a slope, and the horseshoe-shaped [[mantou kiln]] of the north Chinese plains, smaller and more compact.  Both could reliably produce the temperatures of up to {{convert|1300|\u00b0C|F}} or more needed for porcelain.  In the late Ming, the [[egg-shaped kiln]] (''zhenyao'') was developed at [[Jingdezhen]], but mainly used there. This was something of a compromise between the other types, and offered locations in the firing chamber with a range of firing conditions.<ref>Rawson, 364, 369\u2013370; Vainker, 222\u2013223</ref>\n\n==History==\nImportant specific types of pottery, many coming from more than one period, are dealt with individually in sections lower down.\n\n===Early wares===\n[[File:Xianrendong Cave Pottery - 2.jpg|thumb|<center>[[Xianrendong]] cave pottery fragments, radiocarbon-dated to circa 20,000 [[before present|BP]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bar-Yosef |first1=Ofer |last2=Arpin |first2=Trina |last3=Pan |first3=Yan |last4=Cohen |first4=David |last5=Goldberg |first5=Paul |last6=Zhang |first6=Chi |last7=Wu |first7=Xiaohong |title=Early Pottery at 20,000 Years Ago in Xianrendong Cave, China |journal=Science |date=29 June 2012 |volume=336 |issue=6089 |pages=1696\u20131700 |doi=10.1126/science.1218643 |pmid=22745428 |language=en |issn=0036-8075}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Michael |title=Oldest pottery hints at cooking's ice-age origins |website=www.newscientist.com |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21985-oldest-pottery-hints-at-cookings-ice-age-origins/}}</ref></center>]]\n[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - painted jar.jpg|thumb|Painted jar of the [[Majiayao culture]], Late Neolithic period (3300\u20132200 BC)]] \nPottery dating from 20,000 years ago was found at the [[Xianrendong]] Cave site in [[Jiangxi]] province,<ref>[http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-28/science/32452370_1_bone-fragments-sediment-pottery \"Harvard, BU researchers find evidence of 20,000-year-old pottery\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130102041017/http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-28/science/32452370_1_bone-fragments-sediment-pottery |date=2013-01-02 }}.

[[Green-glazed pottery]], using [[lead-glazed earthenware]] in part of the later ''[[sancai]]'' formula, was used for some of these, though not for wares for use, as the raw lead made the glaze poisonous.\n\n===Sui and Tang dynasties, 581\u2013907 AD===\n[[File:Earthenware dish with sancai glaze and rosette medallion, Tang Dynasty.JPG|thumb|A [[sancai]] glazed offering tray, late 7th or early 8th century, [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907)]]\nDuring the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties (581 to 907 AD), a wide range of ceramics, low-fired and high-fired, were produced. These included the last significant fine earthenwares to be produced in China, mostly [[Lead-glazed earthenware|lead-glazed]] ''[[sancai]]'' (three-colour) wares.  Many of the well-known lively [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]], which were only made to be placed in elite tombs close to the capital in the north, are in ''sancai'', while others are unpainted or were painted over a [[slip (ceramics)|slip]]; the paint has now often fallen off.  The ''sancai'' vessels too may have been mainly for tombs, which is where they are all found; the glaze was less toxic than in the Han, but perhaps still to be avoided for use at the dining table.\n\nIn the south, the wares from the [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site]] in [[Tongguan Subdistrict|Tongguan]] are significant for their first regular use of [[underglaze]] painting; examples have been found in many places in the Islamic world. However their production tailed off as underglaze painting remained a minor technique for several centuries.<ref>Vainker, 82\u201384</ref>\n\n[[Yue ware]] was the leading high-fired, [[lime-glaze]]d [[celadon]] of the period, and was of very sophisticated design, patronized by the court. This was also the case with the northern porcelains of kilns in the provinces of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]], which for the first time met the Western and Eastern definition of porcelain, being both pure white and translucent.<ref>Vainker, 64\u201372</ref>  One of the first mentions of porcelain by a foreigner was in the ''Chain of Chronicles'', written by the Arab traveler and merchant [[Suleiman]] in 851 AD during the Tang dynasty who recorded that:<ref name=\"temple\"/><ref name=\"Bushell 1906\">Bushell, S.

The artistic emphasis of Song pottery was on subtle glaze effects and graceful shapes; other decoration, where there was any, was mostly in shallow [[relief]].  Initially this was carved with a knife, but later [[Molding (process)|moulds]] were used, with a loss of artistic quality.  Painting was mostly used in the popular [[Cizhou ware]].  \"What is clear is that in the Song Dynasty which tended to uphold the esthetics of conventional Confucianism, underglaze blue was not at all popular; Confucian esthetics emphasized simplicity, and the underglaze blue designs were judged to be too ornamental.\"<ref name=\"Zhiyan 2010\">Zhiyan, Li, et al.

[[Yue ware]] was succeeded by [[Northern Celadon]] and then in the south [[Longquan celadon]].  White and black wares were also important, especially in [[Cizhou ware]], and there were polychrome types, but the finer types of ceramics, for the court and the literati, remained monochrome, relying on glaze effects and shape.  A wide variety of styles evolved in various areas, and those that were successful were imitated in other areas.  Important kiln sites and stoneware styles included [[Ru ware|Ru]], [[Jun ware|Jun]],  Southern Song [[Guan ware|Guan]] or official ware, [[Jian ware|Jian]] and [[Jizhou ware|Jizhou]].  Whitish porcelain continued to be improved, and included the continuation of [[Ding ware]] and the arrival of the ''[[qingbai]]'' which would replace it.\n[[File:Bowl (Wan) with Peony, Chrysanthemum, and Prunus Sprays LACMA M.73.48.101.jpg|thumb|[[Ding ware]] bowl with flower sprays]]\nThe Liao, Xia and Jin were founded by non-literate, often nomadic people who conquered parts of China.  Pottery production continued under their rule, but their own artistic traditions merged to some extent with the Chinese, producing characteristic new styles.\n\nThe fine pottery of all these regions was mainly high-fired, with some earthenware produced because of its lower cost and more colourful glazes.  Some of the clay used was what is called [[kaolinite]] in the West.  In some cases stoneware was preferred for its darker colour or better working qualities.  Potteries used the local clay, and when that was dark or coarse and they wanted a fine white body, they covered the clay with white slip before applying glaze.\n\n===Yuan dynasty, 1271\u20131368===\n[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|Early [[blue and white porcelain]], c. 1335, the shape from Islamic metalwork]]\n\nThe Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] enforced the movement of artists of all sorts around the Mongol Empire, which in ceramics brought a major stylistic and technical influence from the Islamic world in the form of [[blue and white porcelain]], with underglaze painting in [[cobalt]]. This has been described as the \"last great innovation in ceramic technology\".<ref>Medley, 169</ref> Decoration by underglaze painted patterns had long been a feature of Chinese pottery, especially in the popular [[Cizhou ware]] (mostly using black over slip), but was perhaps regarded as rather vulgar by the court and the [[Scholar-official|literati class]], and the finest ceramics were monochrome, using an understated aesthetic with perfect shapes and subtle glaze effects, often over shallow decoration carved or moulded into the surface.<ref>Vainker, 115\u2013117, 180</ref>\n\nThis was a great contrast to the bright colours and complicated designs developed under the Yuan, whose organization was mostly based on [[Islamic art]], especially metalwork, although the animal and vegetable motifs remained based on Chinese tradition.<ref>Medley, 180\u2013182</ref> These were initially mainly made for export,<ref>Vainker, 139\u2013140, 180</ref> but became acceptable at court, and to buyers of fine ceramics internally.  Export markets readily accepted the style, which has continued to be produced ever since, both in China and around the world.\n\nBecause of this, improvements in water transportation and the re-unification under Mongol rule, pottery production started to concentrate near deposits of [[kaolin]], such as [[Jingdezhen ware|Jingdezhen]], which gradually became the pre-eminent centre for producing porcelain in a variety of styles, a position it has held ever since.  The scale of production greatly increased, and the scale and organization of the kilns became industrialized, with ownership by commercial syndicates, much [[division of labour]], and other typical features of [[mass production]].<ref>Medley, 171</ref>  Some other types of pottery, especially [[Longquan celadon]] and Cizhou ware, continued to flourish.\n\n===Ming dynasty, 1368\u20131644===\n[[File:Chinese - Wine Jar with Carp among Water Weeds and Lotuses - Walters 491917 - View A (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Wucai]] ''Goldfish Vase'' from the [[Jiajing Emperor|Jiajing period]] (1521\u201367) of the [[Ming dynasty]]]]\n\nThe [[Ming dynasty]] saw an extraordinary period of innovation in ceramic manufacture.

This esteem for relatively recent ceramics excited much scorn on the part of [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati scholars]] (such as [[Wen Zhenheng]], [[Tu Long]], and [[Gao Lian (dramatist)|Gao Lian]], who is cited below); these men fancied themselves arbiters of taste and found the painted aesthetic 'vulgar.'<ref>James C.Y.

Thus aside from supplying porcelain for domestic use, the kilns at Jingdezhen became the main production centre for large-scale [[Chinese export porcelain|porcelain exports to Europe]] starting with the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (1572\u20131620). By this time, [[kaolin]] and pottery stone were mixed in about equal proportions. Kaolin produced wares of great strength when added to the paste; it also enhanced the whiteness of the body\u2014a trait that became a much sought after property, especially when form blue-and-white wares grew in popularity. Pottery stone could be fired at a lower temperature ({{convert|1250|C|F|disp=x|; }}) than paste mixed with kaolin, which required {{convert|1350|C|F}}. These sorts of variations were important to keep in mind because the large southern egg-shaped kiln varied greatly in temperature. Near the firebox it was hottest; near the chimney, at the opposite end of the kiln, it was cooler.\n\n===Qing dynasty, 1644\u20131911===\n[[File:Qing-YellowGlazedBrushHolderJingdezhenWare-ShanghaiMuseum-May27-08.jpg|thumb|''Yellow-glazed brush-holder'', \"Chen Guo Zhi\" mark; Jingdezhen [[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang period]], (1821\u201350); [[Shanghai Museum]]]]\n{{Further|Porcelain trade in Qing China}}\nThe lengthy civil wars marking the transition from Ming to Qing caused a breakdown in the Imperial kilns system, forcing the managers to find new markets. The [[Transitional porcelain]] of about 1620 to the 1680s saw a new style in painting, mostly in blue and white, with new subject-matter of landscapes and figures painted very freely, borrowing from other media. The later part of the period saw Europe joining the existing export markets.\n\nThe Qing dynasty produced very varied porcelain styles, developing many of the innovations of the Ming. The most notable area of continuing innovation was in the increasing range of colours available, mostly in [[overglaze enamels]].  A very significant trade in [[Chinese export porcelain]] with the West developed.  Court taste was highly eclectic, still favouring monochrome wares, which now used a wide range of bright glaze colours.  Special glazing effects were highly regarded; new ones were developed and classic Song wares imitated with great skill. But the court now accepted wares with painted scenes in both blue and white and the new bright polychrome palettes.  Technical standards at Jingdezhen were remarkably high, though falling somewhat by the middle of the 19th century.\n\nDecoration, and sometimes shapes, became increasingly over-elaborate and fussy, and generally the Ming period is regarded as the greater; indeed in China this was the case at the time.  By the 18th century the tradition had ceased to innovate in any radical way, and the vitality of painting declines.\n\nPrimary source material on [[Qing dynasty]] porcelain is available from both foreign residents and domestic authors. Two letters written by P\u00e8re [[Fran\u00e7ois Xavier d'Entrecolles]], a [[Jesuit]] missionary and industrial spy who lived and worked in Jingdezhen in the early 18th century, described in detail manufacturing of porcelain in the city.<ref name=\"letters\">see:  [http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/entrecolles.htm Two letters written by P\u00e8re Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CPaGVF5x?url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/entrecolles.htm |date=2012-11-24 }} at Ceramics Today.com</ref> In his first letter dated 1712, d'Entrecolles described the way in which pottery stones were crushed, refined and formed into little white bricks, known in Chinese as ''[[petuntse]]''. He then went on to describe the refining of china clay ''[[kaolin]]'' along with the developmental stages of glazing and firing. He explained his motives: {{quote| Nothing but my curiosity could ever have prompted me to such researches, but it appears to me that a minute description of all that concerns this kind of work might,  be useful in Europe.}}\n\nIn 1743, during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], Tang Ying, the imperial supervisor in the city produced a memoir entitled ''Twenty Illustrations of the Manufacture of Porcelain''.

They were either painted in ''sancai'' or merely coated in white slip, often with paint added over the glaze, which has now mostly been lost. In some cases, a degree of individuality was imparted to the assembled figurines by hand-carving.\n\n===Greenwares or celadon wares===\nThe major group of [[celadon]] wares is named for its glaze, which uses [[iron oxide]] to give a broad spectrum of colours centred on a jade or olive green, but covering browns, cream and light blues. This is a similar range to that of [[jade]], always the most prestigious material in Chinese art, and the broad resemblance accounts for much of the attractiveness of celadon to the Chinese. Celadons are plain or decorated in [[relief]], which may be carved, inscribed or moulded.  Sometimes taken by the imperial court, celadons had a more regular market with the scholarly and middle classes, and were also exported in enormous quantities.  Important types are: [[Yue ware]], [[Yaozhou ware]] and the wider Northern Celadons, [[Ru ware]], [[Guan ware]], and finally [[Longquan celadon]].\n\n=== Jian ware ===\n{{main|Jian ware}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:jian bowl.jpg|thumb|left|Jian tea bowl, [[Song dynasty]], 960\u20131279 AD ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1891.1.226)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/91.1.226 |title=Tea bowl, Song dynasty, 960\u20131279; Jian ware |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>]] -->\n'''''Jian Zhan''''' blackwares, mainly comprising tea wares, were made at kilns located in [[Jianyang, Fujian]] province.

The glaze was made using clay similar to that used for forming the body, except [[ceramic flux|flux]]ed with wood-[[ash glaze|ash]]. At high temperatures the molten glaze separate to produce a pattern called \"hare's fur\". When Jian wares were set tilted for firing, drips run down the side, creating evidence of liquid glaze pooling.\n\nJian tea wares of the Song dynasty were also greatly appreciated and copied in Japan, where they were known as ''[[tenmoku]]'' wares.\n[[File:Bol Dynastie Song Mus\u00e9e Guimet 2418.jpg|thumb|''White Glazed Ding Ware Bowl with Incised Design'' Northern Song dynasty (11th\u201312th Century); Porcelain, Mus\u00e9e Guimet 2418]]\n\n=== Jizhou ware ===\n{{main|Jizhou ware}}\nJizhou ware was stoneware, mostly used for tea drinking.

Already in production when the Song emperors came to power in 940, ''Ding'' ware was the finest porcelain produced in northern China at the time, and was the first to enter the palace for official imperial use. Its paste is white, generally covered with an almost transparent glaze that dripped and collected in \"tears\", (though some ''Ding'' ware was glazed a monochrome black or brown, white was the much more common type). Overall, the ''Ding'' aesthetic relied more on its elegant shape than ostentatious decoration; designs were understated, either incised or stamped into the clay prior to glazing. Due to the way the dishes were stacked in the kiln, the edged remained unglazed, and had to be rimmed in metal such as gold or silver when used as tableware. Some hundred years later, a Southern Song dynasty writer commented that it was this defect that led to its demise as favoured imperial ware.<ref name=\"James C.Y. Watt pp. 236\">James C.Y. Watt, \"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\" in ''Possessing the Past'', pp. 236\u201338.</ref> Since the Song government lost access to these northern kilns when they fled south, it has been argued that Qingbai ware (''see below'') was viewed as a replacement for ''Ding''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Qingbai wine ewer and basin |publisher=The British Museum |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/q/qingbai_wine_ewer_and_basin.aspx }}</ref>\n\nAlthough not as highly ranked as ''Ru'' ware, the late Ming dynasty connoisseur [[Gao Lian (dramatist)|Gao Lian]] awards Ding ware a brief mention in his volume ''Eight Discourses on the Art of Living''.

The Ru kilns were near the Northern Song capital at [[Kaifeng]]. In similar fashion to [[Longquan celadon]]s, Ru pieces have small amounts of iron oxide in their glaze that [[oxidize]] and turn greenish when fired in a reducing atmosphere.  Ru wares range in colour\u2014from nearly white to a deep robin's egg\u2014and often are covered with reddish-brown crackles. The crackles, or \"[[crazing]]\", are caused when the glaze cools and contracts faster than the body, thus having to stretch and ultimately to split, (''as seen in the detail at right; see also'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20081209060525/http://www1.chinaculture.org/created/2005-06/09/content_69528.htm]). The art historian James Watt comments that the Song dynasty was the first period that viewed crazing as a merit rather than a defect. Moreover, as time went on, the bodies got thinner and thinner, while glazes got thicker, until by the end of the Southern Song the 'green-glaze' was thicker than the body, making it extremely 'fleshy' rather than 'bony,' to use the traditional analogy (''see section on'' Guan ''ware, below''). Too, the glaze tends to drip and pool slightly, leaving it thinner at the top, where the clay peeps through.\n\n[[File:RuWare-V&AFE.1-1970Det.jpg|thumb|''[[Ru ware|Ru Ware]] Bowl Stand'', detail of crazing; [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&A]] FE.1\u20131970<ref name=\"Collections.vam.ac.uk\"/>]]\n\nAs with Ding ware, the Song imperial court lost access to the Ru kilns after it fled Kaifeng when the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] conquered northern China, and settled at [[Hangzhou|Lin'an]] (present-day [[Hangzhou]]) in the south.

Characterized by a thicker body than Ding or Ru ware, Jun is covered with a turquoise and purple glaze, so thick and viscous looking that appears to melting off the golden-brown body. Not only are Jun vessels more thickly potted, their shape is much more robust than the fine Jun pieces, yet both types were appreciated at the court of [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]]. Jun production was centred at Jun-tai in [[Yuzhou, Henan|Yuzhou]], [[Henan Province]].<ref name=\"James C.Y.

Usually the term in English only applies to that produced by an official, imperially run kiln, which did not start until the Southern Song dynasty fled from the advancing [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and settled at [[Hangzhou|Lin'an]]. It was during this period that walls become so thin and glaze so thick that the latter superseded the former in breadth. As the clay in the foothills around Lin'an, was a brownish colour, and the glaze so viscous.<ref>\u2018Sheng Pa Chien'', AD 1591, by Kao Lien,\" pp.&nbsp;82\u20134.</ref>\n\n=== Ge ware ===\n[[File:Percival David Collection DSCF3585 01.jpg|thumb|[[Ge ware|Ge-type]] vase, with \"gold thread and iron wire\" double crackle]]\n{{Main|Ge ware}}\n'''''Ge''''' (Wade\u2013Giles:  '''''ko'''''), literally \"big-brother\" ware, due to a legend of two brothers working in Longquan, one made the typical [[celadon]] style ceramics, the elder made ''ge'' ware, produced in his private kiln. Ming dynasty commentator Gao Lian writes that the ''ge'' kiln took its clay from the same site as ''Guan'' ware, accounting for the difficulty in distinguishing one from the other (though Gao thinks \"''Ge'' is distinctly inferior\" to Guan).<ref>Gao Lian, \"The ''Tsun Sheng Pa Chien'', AD 1591, by Kao Lien,\" p. 84\u20135.</ref> Overall, Ge remains somewhat elusive, but basically comprises two types\u2014one with a 'warm rice-yellow glaze and two sets of crackles, a more prominent set of darker colour interspersed with a finer set of reddish lines' (called ''chin-ssu t'ieh-hsien'' or 'golden floss and iron threads', which can just faintly be detected on this bowl).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seco.glendale.edu/ceramics/songgebowl.html |title=Song Ge Ware Footed Bowl, Chinese |publisher=Seco.glendale.edu |accessdate=2012-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214162255/http://seco.glendale.edu/ceramics/songgebowl.html |archivedate=2012-12-14 }}</ref> The other Ge ware is much like Guan ware, with grayish glaze and one set of crackles. Once thought to have only been manufactured alongside [[Longquan celadon]], per its legendary founding, Ge is now believed to have also been produced at [[Jingdezhen]].<ref>James C.Y. Watt, \"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\" in ''Possessing the Past'', pp. 245\u201338.</ref>\n\nWhile similar to Guan ware, Ge typically has a grayish-blue glaze that is fully opaque with an almost matte finish. Its crackle pattern is exaggerated, often standing out in bold black. Though still shrouded in mystery, many specialists believe that Ge ware did not develop until the very late Southern Song dynasty or even the Yuan dynasty. In any case, enthusiasm for it persisted throughout the Ming dynasty; [[Wen Zhenheng]] preferred it to all other types of porcelain, in particular for brush washers and water droppers (although he preferred jade brush washers to porcelain, Guan and Ge were the best ceramic ones, especially if they have scalloped rims). Differences between later Ming imitations of Song/Yuan Ge include: Ming versions substitute a white porcelain body; they tend to be produced in a range of new shapes, for example those for the scholar's studio; glazes tend to be thinner and more lustrous; and slip is applied to the rim and base to simulate the \"brown mouth and iron foot\" of Guan ware.<ref>Robert Mowry ''The Chinese scholar's studio'', p. 164</ref>\n\n=== Qingbai wares ===\n{{main|Qingbai ware}}\n[[File:Lidded Prunus Vase (Meiping) with Lotus Sprays LACMA AC1999.38.6.1-.2.jpg|thumb|Lidded plum vase ([[meiping]]) with lotus sprays, [[Qingbai ware]], [[Southern Song]]. The glaze has collected in the carved indentations, where the colour is stronger.]]\n\nQingbai wares (also called 'yingqing')<ref>Wood, Nigel, ''Chinese Glazes''</ref> were made at Jingdezhen and at many other southern kilns from the time of the [[Northern Song dynasty]] until they were eclipsed in the 14th century by underglaze-decorated blue and white wares. Qingbai in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] literally means \"clear blue-white\". The qingbai glaze is a ''porcelain glaze'', so-called because it was made using pottery stone. The qingbai glaze is clear, but contains [[iron]] in small amounts. When applied over a white porcelain body the glaze produces a greenish-blue colour that gives the glaze its name. Some have incised or moulded decorations.\n\nThe Song dynasty qingbai bowl illustrated was likely made at the Jingdezhen village of Hutian, which was also the site of the imperial kilns established in 1004. The bowl has incised decoration, possibly representing clouds or the reflection of clouds in the water. The body is white, translucent and has the texture of very-fine [[sugar]], indicating that it was made using crushed and refined pottery stone instead of pottery stone and [[kaolin]]. The glaze and the body of the bowl would have been fired together, in a [[Saggar fired pottery|saggar]] in a large wood-burning [[dragon kiln]], typical of southern kilns in the period.\n\nThough many Song and Yuan dynasty qingbai bowls were fired upside down in special segmented saggars, a technique first developed at the [[Ding Ware|Ding]] kilns in [[Hebei]] province. The rims of such wares were left unglazed but were often bound with bands of [[silver]], [[copper]] or [[lead]].\n\nOne remarkable example of ''qingbai'' porcelain is the so-called [[Fonthill Vase]], described in a guide for [[Fonthill Abbey]] published in 1823 as \"an oriental china bottle, superbly mounted, said to be the earliest known specimen of porcelain introduced into Europe\".\n\nThe vase was made at Jingdezhen, probably around 1300 and was probably sent as a present to [[Pope Benedict XII]] by one of the last [[List of emperors of the Yuan dynasty|Yuan emperors]] of China, in 1338. The mounts referred to in the 1823 description were of enamelled silver-gilt and were added to the vase in Europe in 1381. An 18th-century water colour of the vase complete with its mounts exists, but the mounts themselves were removed and lost in the 19th century. The vase is now in the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. It is often held that ''qingbai'' wares were not subject to the higher standards and regulations of the other porcelain wares, since they were made for everyday use. They were mass-produced, and received little attention from scholars and [[antiquarian]]s. The Fonthill Vase, given by a Chinese emperor to a pope, might appear to cast at least some doubt on this view.\n\n=== Blue and white wares ===\n[[File:Bluepot porcelain.jpg|thumb|[[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi period]] (1661 to 1722) blue and white porcelain [[tea caddy]]]]\n{{main|Blue and white porcelain}}\n\nFollowing in the tradition of earlier ''qingbai'' porcelains, blue and white wares are glazed using a transparent ''porcelain glaze''. The blue decoration is painted onto the body of the porcelain before glazing, using very finely ground [[Cobalt(II) oxide|cobalt oxide]] mixed with water. After the decoration has been applied the pieces are glazed and fired.\n\nIt is believed that underglaze blue and white porcelain was first made in the [[Tang dynasty]]. Only three complete pieces of Tang blue and white porcelain are known to exist (in Singapore from the Indonesian Belitung shipwreck), but shards dating to the 8th or 9th century have been unearthed at [[Yangzhou]] in [[Jiangsu|Jiangsu Province]]. It has been suggested that the shards originated from a kiln in the province of [[Henan]]. In 1957, excavations at the site of a [[pagoda]] in [[Zhejiang]] province uncovered a Northern Song bowl decorated with underglaze blue and further fragments have since been discovered at the same site. In 1970 a small fragment of a blue and white bowl, again dated to the 11th century, was also excavated in the province of Zhejiang.\n\nIn 1975, shards decorated with underglaze blue were excavated at a kiln site in [[Jiangxi]] and, in the same year, an underglaze blue and white [[urn]] was excavated from a tomb dated to 1319, in the province of [[Jiangsu]]. It is of interest to note that a Yuan [[urn|funerary urn]] decorated with underglaze blue and underglaze red and dated 1338 is still in the Chinese taste, even though by this time the large-scale production of blue and white porcelain in the Yuan dynasty, [[Mongols|Mongol]] taste had started its influence at Jingdezhen.\n\nStarting early in the 14th century, blue and white porcelain rapidly became the main product of Jingdezhen, reaching the height of its technical excellence during the later years of the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1661-1722)<ref name=\"de Boulay 1973\">de Boulay, Anthony (1973). ''Chinese Porcelain''. Octopus Books, London. {{ISBN|0-7064-0045-3}}</ref> and continuing in present times to be an important product of the city.\n\nThe [[tea caddy]] illustrated shows many of the characteristics of blue and white porcelain produced during the Kangxi period. The translucent body showing through the clear glaze is of great whiteness and the cobalt decoration, applied in many layers, has a fine blue [[hue]]. The decoration, a sage in a landscape of lakes and mountains with ''blazed'' rocks is typical of the period. The piece would have been fired in a [[Saggar fired pottery|saggar]] (a lidded ceramic box intended to protect the piece from kiln debris, smoke and cinders during firing) in a [[reducing atmosphere]] in a wood-burning ''egg-shaped'' kiln, at a temperature approaching {{convert|1350|C|F}}.\n\nDistinctive blue-and-white porcelain was exported to Japan, where it is known as [[Tenkei blue-and-white ware]] or ''ko sometsukei''. This ware is thought to have been especially ordered by tea masters for [[Japanese tea ceremony|Japanese ceremony]].\n\n[[File:Status of Kuan Yin.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Guanyin]], Ming dynasty ([[Shanghai Museum]])]]\n\n=== Blanc de Chine ===\n{{main|Blanc de Chine}}\n\n''Blanc de Chine'' is a type of white porcelain made at [[Dehua County|Dehua]] in [[Fujian]] province. It has been produced from the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) to the present day. Large quantities arrived in Europe as [[Chinese Export Porcelain]] in the early 18th century and it was copied at [[Meissen]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe area along the Fujian coast was traditionally one of the main ceramic exporting centres. Over 180 kiln sites have been identified extending in historical range from the Song dynasty to the present.\n\nFrom the Ming dynasty, porcelain objects were manufactured that achieved a fusion of glaze and body traditionally referred to as \"ivory white\" and \"milk white\". The special characteristic of Dehua porcelain is the very small amount of iron oxide in it, allowing it to be fired in an oxidising atmosphere to a warm white or pale ivory colour.  (Wood, 2007)\n\nThe porcelain body is not very plastic but vessel forms have been made from it. Donnelly, (1969, pp.xi-xii) lists the following types of product: figures, boxes, vases and jars, cups and bowls, fishes, lamps, cup-stands, censers and flowerpots, animals, brush holders, wine and teapots, [[Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]] figures, secular figures and puppets. There was a large output of figures, especially religious figures, e.g. [[Guanyin]], [[Maitreya]], [[Arhat|Lohan]] and Ta-mo figures.\n[[File:Kinesisk vinoffersk\u00e5l i porslin med dekor i relief best\u00e5ende av huvudet och frambenen av en drake - Hallwylska museet - 95557.tif|thumb|left|Late-Ming [[Dehua porcelain|Dehua]] cup, with dragon]]\n\nThe numerous Dehua porcelain factories today make figures and tableware in modern styles. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] \"Dehua artisans applied their very best skills to produce immaculate statuettes of [[Mao Zedong]] and the Communist leaders. Portraits of the stars of the new proletarian opera in their most famous roles were produced on a truly massive scale.\"<ref>(Ayers and Bingling, 2002)</ref> Mao Zedong figures later fell out of favour but have been revived for foreign collectors.\n\nNotable artists in ''blanc de Chine'', such as the late Ming period [[He Chaozong]], signed their creations with their seals. Wares include crisply modeled figures, [[cup]]s, bowls and joss stick-holders.\n\nMany of the best examples of ''blanc de Chine'' are found in Japan where the white variety was termed ''hakugorai'' or \"Korean white\", a term often found in [[tea ceremony]] circles. The [[British Museum]] in London has a large number of ''blanc de Chine'' pieces, having received as a gift in 1980 the entire collection of P.J. Donnelly.<ref>(Harrison-Hall, 2001)</ref>\n\n===Painted colours===\n[[File:Jar (Ping) with the Eight Immortals (Baxian) LACMA 53.41.6a.jpg|thumb|''[[Wucai]]'' jar with the [[Eight Immortals]], Ming, [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] reign, 1573\u20131620]]\nChinese court taste long favoured monochrome wares, and although the Yuan dynasty saw blue and white porcelain accepted by the court, more fully polychrome styles took  much longer to be accepted.  Initially blue from [[cobalt]] was almost the only pigment that could withstand the high temperature of a porcelain firing without discolouring, but gradually (mostly during the Ming period) others were found, or the extra cost of a second firing at a lower temperature to fix [[overglaze enamels]] was accepted. Copper-reds could produce highly effective results underglaze, but at the cost of an extremely high proportion of greyish rejects, some of which remain in circulation, and thousands more of which have been found when kiln waste-heaps have been excavated.  Eventually underglaze blue and overglaze red became the usual way of achieving the same result.\n\nOverglaze painting, usually called \"enamels\", was widely used in the popular [[Cizhou ware]] stonewares, and was sometimes experimented with by kilns producing for the court, but not until the 15th century, under the Ming, was the ''[[doucai]]'' technique used for imperial wares. This combined underglaze blue outlines with overglaze enamels in further colours.<ref>Valenstein, 153-157</ref>  The ''[[wucai]]'' technique was a similar combination, with underglaze blue used more widely for highlights.<ref>Pierson, Stacey, ''From Object to Concept: Global Consumption and the Transformation of Ming Porcelain'', 2013, Hong Kong University Press, {{ISBN|9888139835}}, 9789888139835, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B4SD9lv7ZBUC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14 google books]</ref>\n\nTwo-colour wares, using underglaze blue and an overglaze colour, usually red, also produced very fine results. A number of different other methods using coloured glazes were tried, often with images lightly incised into the body.  The ''[[fahua]]'' technique outlined areas of coloured decoration with raised trails of slip, and the subtle \"secret\" (''[[an hua]]'') technique decorated using very light incisions that could hardly be seen.  As the range of glaze colours expanded, the taste for monochrome wares, now in the new strong colours, returned, and with it a number of special glazing effects were developed, including the return of crackle and spotty effects made by blowing powdered pigment onto the piece.<ref>Valenstein, 167, 172-178</ref>\n\n===={{anchor|Classification by colour}}Classification by colour, the {{lang|fr|famille}} groups====\nThe next development saw a group of 'families', or palettes of enamel colours used on Chinese porcelain. These are commonly known by their French names of {{lang|fr|famille jaune, noire, rose, verte}}, based on the dominant element in each colour palette are terms used to classify.  A large proportion of these were [[Chinese export porcelain|export wares]].\n\n* '''{{vanchor|Famille verte}}''' ({{lang|zh|\u5eb7\u7199\u4e94\u5f69}}, ''Kangxi wucai'', also {{lang|zh|\u7d20\u4e09\u5f69}}, ''susancai'', {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \u2018three colours on a plain [unglazed or thinly glazed] body\u2019), adopted in the [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi period]] (1661\u20131722), uses green and [[iron red]] with other overglaze colours. It developed from the ''wucai'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e94\u5f69}}, \"five colours\") style.\n** '''{{vanchor|Famille jaune}}''' is a variation using {{lang|fr|famille verte}} [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]] on a yellow ground ({{lang|zh|\u9ec3\u5730}}), often painted on the [[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]. \n** '''{{vanchor|Famille noire}}''' ({{lang|zh|\u9ed1\u5730\u7d20\u4e09\u5f69}}, ''modi susancai'') is another subtype of {{lang|fr|famille verte}}, but it uses a black ground.  Many {{lang|fr|famille jaune}} and  {{lang|fr|famille noir}} pieces were \"clobbered\" with the yellow or black added in the 19th century. \n* '''{{vanchor|Famille rose}}''' (known in Chinese as ''fencai'' ({{lang|zh|\u7c89\u5f69}}) or ''ruancai'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u8edf\u5f69}} / {{lang|zh-hans|\u8f6f\u5f69}}), {{abbr|lit.|literally}} 'soft colours' or 'pale colours', and later as ''Yangcai'' ({{lang|zh|\u6d0b\u5f69}}), lit. 'foreign colours') was introduced late in the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1661\u20131722), possibly around 1720. It used mainly pink or purple and remained popular throughout the 18th and the 19th centuries, also being widely adopted by European factories.  {{lang|fr|Famille rose}} enamel ware allows a greater range of colour and tone than was previously possible, enabling the depiction of more complex images, including flowers, figures and insects.\n\n{{Gallery \n| title        =  Examples of {{lang|fr|famille verte}} works\n| height = 120px\n| width = 120px\n| File:Porcelaine chinoise Guimet 271101.jpg | ''Famille verte'' dish, [[Kangxi period]] (1661-1722)\n| File:Wusai vase Shunzi period circa 1650 1660.jpg | ''Wucai'' vase, [[Shunzhi period]], {{circa|1650}}\u20131660\n| File:Wucai plate for exportation Kangxi period circa 1680 bis.jpg | ''Wucai'' [[Chinese export porcelain|export]] plate, [[Kangxi period]], {{ca.|1680}}\n| File:Wucai plate for exportation Kangxi period circa 1680.jpg | ''Wucai'' [[Chinese export porcelain|export]] plate, [[Kangxi period]], {{ca.|1680}}\n}}\n\n{{Gallery\n| title        = Examples of {{lang|fr|famille rose}} works\n| File:Jingdezhen soft paste porcelain flower holder Famille Rose 1736 1796 Qianlong period.jpg | [[Soft paste]] {{lang|fr|famille rose}} flower holder, [[Jingdezhen]], [[Qianlong period]] (1735\u201396)\n| File:Qing export porcelain with European figure Famille Rose first half of 18th century.jpg | [[Chinese export porcelain|Export porcelain]] with European figure, {{lang|fr|famille rose}}, first half of 18th century, Qing dynasty\n| File:Chinese Export Hard Paste Famille Rose Double Peacock Plates.jpg | [[Double Peacock Dinner Service]] [[Chinese export porcelain|export]]: {{lang|fr|famille rose}} [[service plates|service]] with peacocks over a rock, late 18th century\n}}\n\n==Stoneware==\n[[File:Yixing teapot, China, Chen Hongshou, Yang Pengnian, Qing dynasty, c. 1800-1835, stoneware - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC03858.JPG|thumb|left|Inscribed [[Yixing clay teapot|Yixing teapot]], Qing dynasty, c. 1800\u20131835, stoneware]]\nPottery classified as [[stoneware]] in the West is usually regarded as porcelain in Chinese terms, where a stoneware group is not recognised, and so the definition of porcelain is rather different, covering all vitrified high-fired wares.  Terms such as \"{{linktext|porcellaneous}}\" and \"near-porcelain\" are often used to reflect this, and cover wares that in Western terms lie on the border of stoneware and porcelain. High-fired stonewares were numerous from very early on, and included many high-prestige wares, including those for imperial use, as well as great quantities of everyday utilitarian pots.  Usually they achieved their reputation by their glazes.  Most of the [[celadon]] group, including [[Longquan celadon]]s, especially earlier ones, can be classified as stoneware, and all classic [[Jian ware]]s and [[Jizhou ware]]s.\n\nBy contrast, the [[Yixing clay teapot]]s and cups made from [[Yixing clay]] from [[Jiangsu]] province are usually left unglazed, and not washed after use, as the clay is believed to improve the taste of the tea, especially after it acquires a [[patina]] from long use. There are in fact a number of different clays, giving a range of colours. The pots are unusual in that they are often signed by their potters, which is very rare in China, perhaps because they were associated with the [[Scholar-official|literati]] culture, of which Jiangsu was a stronghold. The earliest datable example is from a burial of 1533 in [[Nanjing]]. Elaborately decorated examples, often with a rectangular body, were exported to Europe from the 18th century, and these and pots for local use often had poems inscribed on them.  As well as teaware and desk objects such as [[brush-rest]]s, fruit and other natural shapes were modelled as ornaments.  Production continues today, generally using simpler shapes.<ref>Vainker, 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n==The ceramics industry under the Ming==\n[[File:Ming dynasty Xuande mark and period (1426\u201335) imperial blue and white vase, from The Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u660e\u5ba3\u5fb7 \u666f\u5fb7\u93ae\u7aaf\u9752\u82b1\u8cab\u8033\u74f6, \u7ebd\u7ea6\u5927\u90fd\u535a\u7269\u9986 .jpg|thumbnail|right|Ming dynasty [[Xuande Emperor|Xuande]] mark and period (1426\u201335) imperial blue and white vase.]]\n\n=== Imperial and private kilns ===\nThe very first imperial kiln was established in the thirty-fifth year of Hongwu.<ref name=\"Ding, Pengbo 2013 P. 69\">Ding, Pengbo, \u4e01\u9e4f\u52c3. \u201c\u660e\u4ee3\u5fa1\u5668\u5382\u8bbe\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u201d (Discussing the Establishing Time in the Imperial Kilns in Ming Period), \u5357\u65b9\u6587\u7269 (Cultural Relics in the Southern China)13.3 (March 2013): 66-69.

Understandably, these demands came from different sectors of the court that expected particular designs. For example, yellow and green products decorated with mythical flying creatures were specifically requested by the Directorate for Palace Delicacies.<ref name=\"Pierson, Stacey 1800. pp. 229\">Pierson, Stacey. \u201cProduction, Distribution, and Aesthetics: Abundance and Chinese Porcelain from Jingdezhen, AD 1350\u20131800.\u201d ''Abundance: The Archaeology of Plenitude'', University Press of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, 2017, pp. 229\u2013250, p.236</ref> The need for both individual design and mass production was a recipe for exhausting demands on porcelain kilns.

Without cooperation and transparency between colleagues of different kilns, the satisfaction of the imperial court was in jeopardy.\n\nIn the late Ming period, the [[corvee]] system in ceramics reformed with the strong influence of commercialization.

Apart from making ceramics for people's everyday life, private kilns also accepted orders from the imperial court. However, making and selling imperial style ceramics in private kilns was strictly forbidden.<!-- contradiction here --><ref name=\"Yoshiaki Ten\u014d 1989 P. 53\"/>\n\nDuring the late Ming period, private kilns rose as imperial kilns declined. Many famous workers escaped from the overworked and underpaid environment in the imperial kilns to private ones. Private kilns were more involved in commercials than the imperial kilns did.<!-- what does this mean?? --> In the late Ming period, several private kilns won great popularity among the literati, who were enthusiastic about the antique style porcelain. Examples were the Cui kiln ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u516c\u7a91}}), Zhou kiln ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u7a91}}), and Hu kiln ({{lang|zh|\u58f6\u516c\u7a91}}).<ref name=\"Liu Mingshan p.242\"/> Ceramics in the late Ming dynasty was produced in high quality and quantity, making Jingdezhen one of the earliest commercial centres in the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dillon|first=Michael|date=1992|title=Transport and Marketing in the Development of the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry during the Ming and Qing Dynasties|url=|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=|pages=278\u2013290|via=}}</ref>\n\nCompetition in the porcelain industry erupted following the failure of the corvee system.<ref>Wen-Chin, Hsu. \u201cSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.\u201d ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', no. 1, 1988, pp. 135\u2013159. p.140</ref> With government control at a low, investors could invest in many means of production, especially in handicraft industries. In Jingdezhen, over 70 percent of the 100,000 families occupying the 6.5 square kilometre town were involved in the porcelain industry.\n\nThe economic resurgence brought on by the porcelain industry carried along its own ramifications. There existed two sides of the porcelain industry which are described as ''jiating shougongye'' ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5bb6\u5ead\u624b\u5de5\u4e1a}}, \"family-run industry\") and ''zuofang shougongye'' ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4f5c\u574a\u624b\u5de5\u4e1a}}, \"entrepreneurial industry\").<ref>Wen-Chin, Hsu. \u201cSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.\u201d ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', no. 1, 1988, pp. 135\u2013159. p.142</ref> Family-run industries reveal the ruthless and inhumane side of the porcelain industry as seen in the story of Yang Shi in \u201cAn Injustice Caused by a Slight Dispute Over One Penny\u201d.

Especially within work involving relatives or immediate family, one's own self worth and concept will be diminished in the face of success for the business.\n\nThe cut-throat mentality served to blur the family hierarchy within family-run industries to some degree. Porcelain production required both the construction of pots as well as the decorations done after. Within a family-run pottery industry, the women took on this decorating role which helped to increase their value to the family. Men and women had to work harmoniously to produce good quality work and ultimately this spread throughout the porcelain industry.<ref name=\"Wen-Chin, Hsu 1683. pp. 135\"/>\n\n=== Life as a potter ===\nIn the early Ming dynasty, the population could be divided into three categories: military, craftsmen, and peasants. Within the craftsmen system, most of the craftsmen were from the previous dynasty, the Yuan Dynasty, others were prisoners or unemployed people. Craftsmen households members had to work throughout their lifetime, and their status was hereditary. There were two subcategories within the craftsmen system: military craftsmen, who were specialized in producing weapon; the ordinary craftsmen, who worked in various other industries. Potters belonged to the latter subcategory.<ref>Li Chuanwen, \u674e\u4f20\u6587, \u660e\u4ee3\u5320\u4f5c\u5236\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty).

Usually, there were different types of workers in the imperial kilns. Most of the potters were selected from the craftsman households by the local government and served in the imperial kilns for three months in every four years for free; in other cases, workers were recruited from counties near the imperial kilns and paid regularly. Usually the recruited workers were assigned to different departments.<ref>Liu Mingshan, \u5218\u660e\u6749, \u201c\u660e\u4ee3\u5b98\u7a91\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528,\u201d (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), \u660e\u53f2\u7814\u7a76(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.221-222.</ref>\n\nThe imperial factory was divided into twenty-three departments, with each department having managers and workers. The number of managers was usually less than five, and the number of workers was usually about ten to twenty.<ref>Li Chuanwen, \u674e\u4f20\u6587, \u660e\u4ee3\u5320\u4f5c\u5236\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty).

More than half the firings of every kiln resulted in spoilt pieces and were thrown away in the neighborhood of Jingdezhen, resulting in a huge dump of porcelain fragments that still exist today. When the kiln was in action, it was important to control the fire, which ideally should produce a constant temperature. The proper choice, preparation, colouring, firing, and the slip should be made on every stage of the production.<ref>Jenyns, 16</ref> The regulations on the potters working in the imperial kiln were severe. Potters were punished for delaying, smuggling, producing inferior goods, and other misconducts.<ref>Li Chuanwen, \u674e\u4f20\u6587, \u660e\u4ee3\u5320\u4f5c\u5236\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty).

By the time of Xuande period, the number of potters escaping from the corvee was about five thousand; in the first year of Jingtai, the number reached about thirty thousand. There was also a great discrepancy in the number of workers in different departments. Sometimes private kiln workers from the corresponding departments would serve as temporary workers in the imperial kilns. To regulate the potters, the government reformed the policy so that the potters would not have to work in the imperial kilns if they pay certain amount of money per month.<ref>Li Chuanwen, \u674e\u4f20\u6587, \u660e\u4ee3\u5320\u4f5c\u5236\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty).

Unable to stand the hard law and the heavy work, lots of talented workers found their new positions in the private kilns. The imperial kilns suffered from the lost in talented potters and labors, and the quality of the porcelain declined dramatically.<ref>Liu Mingshan, \u5218\u660e\u6749, \u201c\u660e\u4ee3\u5b98\u7a91\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528,\u201d (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), \u660e\u53f2\u7814\u7a76(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.224.</ref>\n\nStarting from the ninth year of Jiajing, a new policy was carried out. The government prepared their own materials, utilized the private kilns to make porcelain, and paid the private kilns based on the number of porcelain produced. However, the state was usually not able to pay the amount required.<ref>Liu Mingshan, \u5218\u660e\u6749, \u201c\u660e\u4ee3\u5b98\u7a91\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528,\u201d (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), \u660e\u53f2\u7814\u7a76(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.223.</ref>\n\n=== Post-production ===\n[[File:MET DP342705 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Porcelain Jar with cobalt blue under a transparent glaze, [[Jingdezhen porcelain]], mid-15th century.]]\n\nThe industrialization of Chinese porcelain during the Ming dynasty was not possible without a post-production system that honored scalability as well as scarcity. Individual retail sales were important to kilns but wholesale orders were of even higher importance.<ref>Michael Dillon, \u201cTransport and Marketing in the Development of the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.\u201d ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', vol. 35, no. 3, 1992, pp. 278\u2013290. p.286</ref> In reality, wholesale orders were the backbone of porcelain economics. Without these orders that required months to a year of work to complete, demand would have definitely been lacking.\n\nMerchants entered provinces with little knowledge of how porcelain trade was conducted. They relied on brokers to introduce them to reliable kilns and ultimately negotiate prices. Once established, merchants took on negotiating matters. In particular, brokers helped alleviate risk for many kilns by analyzing the integrity of buyers. Due to the guild-esque nature between brokers and kiln owners, guilty knowledge of the buyer's secrets was common talk.<ref>Michael Dillon, Dillon, Michael. \u201cTransport and Marketing in the Development of the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.\u201d ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', vol. 35, no. 3, 1992, pp. 278\u2013290. p.287</ref> If a buyer was deemed as unreliable, word spread throughout the province of such news. Potters claimed the license to know who the bad buyers were. This dangerous knowledge had the ability to ruin a buyer's reputation but on the contrary contributed to the success of kilns.\n\nIn observing court orders, porcelain was required for culinary, religious, and display purposes. Since porcelain was often used once and thrown away by the court, imperial orders were at a continuous flow in porcelain factories.<ref name=\"Pierson, Stacey 1800. pp. 229\"/> Demand was often too high for kilns to meet which hints at the necessity for scalability.\n\nFrom their respective kilns, fine porcelain was distributed over sea and land to Southeast Asia, Japan and the Middle East. The magnitude of foreign trade can be understood in a record showing over sixteen million pieces circulating through a Dutch East India Company.<ref>Wen-Chin, Hsu. \u201cSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.\u201d ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', no. 1, 1988, pp. 135\u2013159. p.151</ref> The land transportation showed the intensity of labor in the porcelain industry. Dozens of carts sent from Mongolia, Manchuria, Persia and Arabic countries were loaded in the Ming capital full of porcelain and other Chinese goods. Some carts reached thirty feet in height which must have required extreme attention to avoid broken porcelain. Due to the hollowness of porcelain vases, they were filled with soil and beans.<ref>Wen-Chin, Hsu p. 151</ref> The growth of the bean roots helped porcelain withstand further pressure during transportation. In order to effectively transport large amounts of porcelain, as much space in carts must have been used indicated by the thirty foot high carts. Knowing the risk that came with placing fragile porcelain next to and on top of one another, handlers of the porcelain mitigated that risk through the soil and bean method.\n[[File:MET DP-14156-003 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Brush-rest with Arabic inscription; [[Chinese export porcelain|probably for export to the Islamic world]].]]\n\nLike the silk industry, the porcelain industry claimed merit for its mass-producing capabilities. Potters from lower economic backgrounds stuck true to their repetitive methods mostly due to the high risk in attempting new and not tested methods. Trying new techniques could result in the loss of an entire month's worth of work so for these potters, changing their method was not a luxury they could afford.<ref name=\"Finley, Robert 2010, pp. 17\">Finley, Robert \u201cThe Porcelain City: Jingdezhen in the Eighteenth Century.\u201d ''The Pilgrim Art: Cultures of Porcelain in World History,'' 1st ed., University of California Press, 2010, pp. 17\u201346. p.24</ref> These potters were found in peasant societies outside of Jingdezhen and highlight the particular code that limited their imaginative potential. For potters within Jingdezhen, the code that governed the way their products were created was greatly influenced by international markets. These markets inspired creativity and innovation as seen in how \u201cJingdezhen and other pottery centres produced ceramic versions of reliquaries, alms bowls, oil lamps, and stem-cups\u201d<ref name=\"Finley, Robert 2010, pp. 17\"/> The difference in code did not necessarily contribute to a hierarchical division but rather a diversification in the personality behind Chinese porcelain.\n\nForeign trade was not always beneficial for potters because the further away that products had to go from the source (Ex: Jingdezhen) the more vulnerable cargo became. In examining a report of a Spanish voyage, about a fifth of a Chinese ship crew were killed when met by a Spanish voyager of the name Juan de Salcedo.<ref>Laura Lee Junker, \u201cThe Long-Distance Porcelain Trade.\u201d ''Raiding, Trading. and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms'', University of Hawai'i Press, 1999, pp. 183\u2013220. p.196</ref> The two ships that were raided held many Chinese valuables including porcelain and most likely were used to trade off the coast of Midoro. Overall, international markets offered great potential for potters seeking greater wealth but unfortunately came with a vulnerability to crime.\n\nTrade on an international scale required organization between chiefs and potters. Throughout the Southeast Asian trading ports, chiefs had the power to set port fees as well as control interactions between elite merchants and foreign traders.<ref>Laura Lee Junker, \u201cThe Long-Distance Porcelain Trade.\u201d ''Raiding, Trading. and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms'', University of Hawai'i Press, 1999, pp. 183\u2013220. p.206</ref> By possessing the license to impose fees, chiefs were able to profit on almost every transaction within their respective markets and it serves to boost their brilliance in constructing such a diverse market. Potters of luxury porcelain would have to work under the rules set by the chiefs and thus their relationship constructed a hierarchy.\n\n== Fakes and reproductions ==\n[[File:Kangxi mark.jpg|thumb|[[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi period]] mark on a piece of late nineteenth century blue and white porcelain.]]\nChinese potters have a long tradition of borrowing design and decorative features from earlier wares.  Whilst ceramics with features thus borrowed might sometimes pose problems of [[provenance]], they would not generally be regarded as either reproductions or fakes. However, fakes and reproductions have also been made at many times during the long history of Chinese ceramics and continue to be made today in ever-increasing numbers.\n\nIn addition, the reign marks of earlier emperors (typically from the Ming) were often put on Qing wares, which scholars are often inclined to treat as a mark of respect  or aspiration rather than an attempt to deceive, although they clearly did often mislead centemporaries, and confuse understanding.\n\n* Imitations and reproductions of Song dynasty [[Longquan celadon]] wares were made at Jingdezhen in the early 18th century, but outright fakes were also made using special clay that were artificially aged by boiling in meat [[broth]], refiring and storage in [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s. P\u00e8re d'Entrecolles records that by this means the wares could be passed off as being hundreds of years old.<ref name=\"letters\"/>\n* In the late 19th century, fakes of Kangxi-period ''famille noire'' wares were made that were convincing enough to deceive the experts of the day. Many such pieces may still be seen in museums today, as may pieces of genuine Kangxi porcelain were given additional overglaze decoration in the late nineteenth century with ''famille noire'' enamels (a process known as \"clobbering\"). A body of modern expert opinion holds that porcelain decorated with ''famille noire'' enamels was not made at all during the Kangxi period, though this view is disputed.<ref name=\"de Boulay 1973\"/>\n* A fashion for Kangxi period (1661 to 1722) blue and white wares grew to large proportions in Europe during the later years of the 19th century and triggered the production at Jingdezhen of large quantities of porcelain wares that strike a resemblance to ceramics of earlier periods. Such blue and white wares were not fakes or even convincing reproductions, even though some pieces carried four-character Kangxi reign-marks that continue to cause confusion to this day. Kangxi reign-marks in the form shown in the illustration occur only on wares made towards the end of the 19th century or later, without exception.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Authentication==\nThe most widely known test is the [[thermoluminescence]] test, or TL test, which is used on some types of ceramic to estimate, roughly, the date of last firing. [[Thermoluminescence dating]] is carried out on small samples of pottery drilled or cut from the body of a piece, which can be risky and disfiguring. For this reason, the test is rarely used for dating finely potted, high-fired ceramics.

His method of casting pots in sand provided his successors with a viable business that operated for over two centuries.\n\nSmelting iron with coke ultimately released the iron industry from the limitation imposed by the preliminary step of \"charcoal burning\" where trees were first cut and burned to make charcoal. It also shifted the fuel used for making steel from renewable wood, to a fossil fuel, which began the modern anthropogenic process of [[global warming]].\n\nCoke-smelted cast iron went into steam engines, bridges, and many of the inventions of the 19th century.  Coke smelting made possible the great quantities of iron produced which drove the Industrial Revolution.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abraham Darby II]]\n* [[Abraham Darby III]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|wstitle=Darby, Abraham}}\n*[http://www.sedgleymanor.com/people/abraham_darby.html Abraham Darby and family biography]\n*[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blabrahamdarby.htm The Darby family of inventors]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050924062118/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/darbyo.htm The Darby dynasty]\n*[http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/our-attractions/darby-houses/ The Darby House]\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.booneshares.com/SomeAbrahamDarbycompanies.htm |title=The Coalbrookdale Company, with which the family was associated |access-date=7 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212132814/http://www.booneshares.com/SomeAbrahamDarbycompanies.htm |archive-date=12 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}\n*[http://www.britainunlimited.com/Biogs/Darby.htm Britain Unlimited's page on the Darbys]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darby, Abraham I}}\n[[Category:English ironmasters]]\n[[Category:People of the Industrial Revolution]]\n[[Category:English inventors]]\n[[Category:English Quakers]]\n[[Category:Foundrymen]]\n[[Category:1678 births]]\n[[Category:1717 deaths]]\n[[Category:Quaker families]]\n[[Category:17th-century Quakers]]\n[[Category:18th-century Quakers]]\n[[Category:Burials in Shropshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2012}}\n'''Abraham Darby''', in his later life called '''Abraham Darby the Elder''', now sometimes known for convenience as '''Abraham Darby I''' (14 April 1678 &ndash; 5 May 1717), was the first and best known of [[Abraham Darby (disambiguation)|several men of that name]].

He was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at [[Broseley]], Shropshire. His widow died only a few months later.\n\n==New company==\nDarby's death left the affairs of the business in a mess.  His own shares were mortgaged to Thomas Goldney, who then exchanged the debt for eight shares (of 16) in the business.  Richard Ford, who married Abraham's daughter Mary, had two shares and became manager, but on the widow's death Thomas Baylies took out [[letters of administration]] as a creditor and sought to sell the works.  Darby\u2019s eldest son, [[Abraham Darby II]], was only six years old and his two brothers younger still.  Accordingly, their uncle Joshua Sergeant bought back some of the shares on behalf of the Darby children.  The children were sent away to school,<ref>Raistrick, 48-51.</ref> and Abraham II began assisting in the management of the works in 1728 and he was awarded four shares in the company in 1732.<ref>Trinder, 26</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{unref|section|date=April 2020}}\nAbraham Darby made an important step towards the [[Industrial Revolution]]. His method of casting pots in sand provided his successors with a viable business that operated for over two centuries.\n\nSmelting iron with coke ultimately released the iron industry from the limitation imposed by the preliminary step of \"charcoal burning\" where trees were first cut and burned to make charcoal. It also shifted the fuel used for making steel from renewable wood, to a fossil fuel, which began the modern anthropogenic process of [[global warming]].\n\nCoke-smelted cast iron went into steam engines, bridges, and many of the inventions of the 19th century.  Coke smelting made possible the great quantities of iron produced which drove the Industrial Revolution.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abraham Darby II]]\n* [[Abraham Darby III]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|wstitle=Darby, Abraham}}\n*[http://www.sedgleymanor.com/people/abraham_darby.html Abraham Darby and family biography]\n*[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blabrahamdarby.htm The Darby family of inventors]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050924062118/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/darbyo.htm The Darby dynasty]\n*[http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/our-attractions/darby-houses/ The Darby House]\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.booneshares.com/SomeAbrahamDarbycompanies.htm |title=The Coalbrookdale Company, with which the family was associated |access-date=7 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212132814/http://www.booneshares.com/SomeAbrahamDarbycompanies.htm |archive-date=12 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}\n*[http://www.britainunlimited.com/Biogs/Darby.htm Britain Unlimited's page on the Darbys]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darby, Abraham I}}\n[[Category:English ironmasters]]\n[[Category:People of the Industrial Revolution]]\n[[Category:English inventors]]\n[[Category:English Quakers]]\n[[Category:Foundrymen]]\n[[Category:1678 births]]\n[[Category:1717 deaths]]\n[[Category:Quaker families]]\n[[Category:17th-century Quakers]]\n[[Category:18th-century Quakers]]\n[[Category:Burials in Shropshire]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMolding (process)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Darby_I"}
