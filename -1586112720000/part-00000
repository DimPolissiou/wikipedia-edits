Her father, Stiles Richard Dodson, was the son of Richard Dodson and Hannah Watson, being a descendant of Thomas and Mary Dodson, of whom the doctor's mother was also a descendant. Her mother, Mrs. Caroline Matilda Dodson, was the daughter of Stephen Harrison, and Mary Dodson. Miss Dodson's father and mother were natives of [[Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania]] and married in 1836. Her mother was Mrs. C. Matilda Dodson About six weeks after marriage, they left [[Pennsylvania]] for the West and settled in [[Van Buren County, Iowa]]. Stiles R. Dodson died in 1847, leaving his widow with four daughters, the youngest less than two years of age. That winter, the mother taught school in her own house. In the spring of 1848, she returned with her family to her father's house in Pennsylvania.

At about twelve, she was sent to an academy and normal institute. She began to teach in the winter of 1861. Returning at intervals to school, she followed the profession of teaching until the fall of 1871 when she matriculated at the [[Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania]], and entered upon the three year course just inaugurated. Dr. [[Ann Preston]] was then Dean. The summer of 1872, she spent in the Nurses' Training School of the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia. The course required was completed and Dodson received a certificate of the Training School for Nurses. The summer of 1873, she spent in the same hospital as student in the wards and out practice. She received her diploma in March, 1874, and went to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], for further study with Dr. [[Ruth A.

In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back in to the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match.

In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a nearfall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set in an undisclosed outdoor location around a [[graveyard]] and warehouse. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the grave, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show will feature a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania. [[Mojo Rawley]] then joined Gronkowski to continue the hype.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions with the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[King Corbin]]. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin. Elias then performed a roll-up on Corbin to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back in to the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a triple threat tag team ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] ([[Jey Uso]] and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for a seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a nearfall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set in an undisclosed outdoor location around a [[graveyard]] and warehouse. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the grave, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show will feature a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

Before the Civil War, it was connected with Indianapolis and then the Eastern cities by railroad, which resulted in sustained growth. Substantial growth came after the discovery of large natural gas reserves, which produced an economic boom in the mid-1880s. Among the businesses which the boom attracted was the fledgling automobile industry. A significant number of technical and engineering innovations were developed in Kokomo, particularly in automobile production, and, as a result, Kokomo became known as the \"City of Firsts.\" A substantial portion of Kokomo's employment still depends on the automobile industry.\n\n==History==\n===Historic Buildings in Kokomo, Indiana===\n[[File:ElliottHouseKokomo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Photograph of the Elliott House in the [[Old Silk Stocking Historic District]]]]\n\nThe following is a list of all the buildings in Kokomo, Indiana, that are listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:\n*[[Elwood Haynes Museum|Elwood Haynes House]]\n*[[Kokomo City Building]]\n*[[Kokomo Country Club|Kokomo Country Club Golf Course]]\n*[[Kokomo Courthouse Square Historic District]]\n*[[Kokomo High School and Memorial Gymnasium]]\n*[[Lake Erie and Western Depot Historic District]]\n*[[Learner Building]]\n*[[Old Silk Stocking Historic District]]\n*[[Seiberling Mansion]]<ref name=nris>{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n===Early history and incorporation===\nThe settler tradition says Kokomo was named for Kokomoko or [[Ma-Ko-Ko-Mo]] (meaning \"black walnut\"), shortened to Kokomo, said to have been one of the four sons of [[Jean Baptiste Richardville|Chief Richardville]] last of the chiefs of the [[Miami people]].<ref name=\"Blanchard1883\">{{cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Charles|date=1883|title=History of Howard and Tipton Counties, Indiana|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=F.A.

Colonel C.D. Murray was the agent at Kokomo for stock subscriptions in support of the railroad. In 1852 the construction of the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad commenced. In Kokomo Samuel C. Mills and Dr. Corydon Richmond, commercial competitors of David Foster, donated several lots to the railroad in order to secure the location of the rail depot near their commercial property. The route was laid along Buckeye Street at the insistence of the merchants who hoped to reduced drayage expenses. Samuel Mills built a large frame structure at the Howard flouring mills, which served as a warehouse for the company's freight and a passenger depot. For some time after 1854 Kokomo was the terminus of the line, but eventually the line was extended to Peru and then to Michigan City.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Railroads\n | last = Pollard | first = Otis C.\n | publisher = by Jackson Morrow (Indianapolis: B.F.

By 1853 a line was commenced between Kokomo and [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] (which was intended to become the hub of a network of lines for the company). Railroad service was inaugurated on that line on July 4, 1855.<ref>Watt, William J. (1999) ''The Pennsylvania Railroad in Indiana''. Indiana University Press. p. 30.</ref>\n\nThe most important rail line for Kokomo became the standard-gauge Clover Leaf line. This railroad would eventually link Kokomo with both the West Coast and the Eastern Seaboard. It began as a short line linking Frankfort and Kokomo, the [[Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad]]. Henry Y. Morrison of Frankfort was the principal promoter, and A.Y. Comstock acted for him in Kokomo. A failure of the proposed subsidy caused the promoters to turn all assets over to the contractors, who promised to complete the line. Construction began in 1873 and was completed the following year. Limited freight between the two cities made the line unprofitable. After a series of acquisitions by other railroads, the line became part of the [[Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad]]. A line connecting it to the east reached Kokomo on January 1, 1881.<ref>Railroads, pp. 419\u201320.</ref>\n\n===Mayor Cole===\nIn 1881, one of the most remarkable and controversial events in Kokomo's history took place. Mayor Henry C. Cole was shot to death by a sheriff's posse. Dr. Cole had a curious history and had stirred up a great deal of passion in the previous fifteen years. He was reputed to have been a gifted surgeon, who served in the Union Army during the Civil War and when afterwards he settled in Kokomo, he became a prominent physician.

In March 1886, a group of citizens, led principally by A.Y. Comstock (who had promoted the [[Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad]]) and D.C. Spraker (later President of Kokomo Rubber Company), circulated a memorandum seeking subscribers (at $100 each) for the purpose of boring for gas at a distance of at least {{convert|2000|ft}} below ground. It took until September to obtain the necessary 22 subscribers.

No fatal injuries were recorded during this tornado.\n\n==Environmental problems==\n=== Continental Steel Corporation ===\nFrom 1914 through 1986, the [[Continental Steel Corporation]] facility produced nails, wire and wire fence from scrap steel on a {{convert|183|acre|adj=on}} facility in Kokomo. Manufacturing operations in the steel plant and on other portions of the property included the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Steel-making operations had included reheating, casting rolling, drawing, pickling, galvanizing, tinning and tempering.\n\nAfter the company filed for bankruptcy in 1986, EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management investigated the plant and property and found soil, sediments, surface water and ground water contaminated with volatile organic compounds (PCBs) and several metals, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Lead contamination was also detected in soils on nearby residential properties.\n\nThe site was proposed to the [[National Priorities List]] as a [[Superfund]] site in 1988 and formally added in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Indiana Superfund sites\n | url = http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/query/queryhtm/nplfin.htm#IN\n | access-date = August 31, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, EPA received almost $6 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to complete needed cleanup at two problems at the Continental Steel Superfund site: the former Slag Processing Area and the site's contaminated ground water. The ARRA funding helped accelerate the cleanup of hazardous waste on the site. In the process, total of 15 Indiana contractors or subcontractors were involved in the ARRA-funded work, creating at least 45 temporary jobs.\n\nIn August 2010, using the ARRA funds, EPA completed the cleanup of the former slag processing area of the Superfund Site. Approximately {{convert|86000|short ton}} of slag were moved to the site's acid lagoon area for use as fill on that portion of the site. {{convert|2|ft|m|1|spell=In}} of clean soil were used to cap the former slag processing area, leaving it suitable for potential redevelopment. ARRA funds were also used to address contaminated groundwater at the site. This work included extensive groundwater sampling to determine the contaminated plume area and installation of groundwater extraction and monitoring wells. Three wind turbines will be used to generate much of the power needed to operate the groundwater extraction system.\n\nSite cleanup was completed in August 2011.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Region 5 Cleanup Sites, Continental Steel Corp.\n | url = http://www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/continental/\n | access-date = August 31, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 the former site was approved as the location of a [[Solar farm]] with installation of panels beginning in August 2016.

Some of these potential sources are currently being managed under other authorities but there is no cleanup approach focusing on the ground water plume. Water from several well fields in Kokomo are blended and treated prior to distribution. A water treatment system has been successfully removing the vinyl chloride from the finished drinking water, but this is not a permanent solution to address the contaminated ground water plume.\n\nThe site was proposed to the National Priorities List and added to the Superfund in March 2015.

Colonel C.D. Murray was the agent at Kokomo for stock subscriptions in support of the railroad. In 1852 the construction of the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad commenced. In Kokomo Samuel C. Mills and Dr. Corydon Richmond, commercial competitors of David Foster, donated several lots to the railroad in order to secure the location of the rail depot near their commercial property. The route was laid along Buckeye Street at the insistence of the merchants who hoped to reduced drayage expenses. Samuel Mills built a large frame structure at the Howard flouring mills, which served as a warehouse for the company's freight and a passenger depot. For some time after 1854 Kokomo was the terminus of the line, but eventually the line was extended to Peru and then to Michigan City.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Railroads\n | last = Pollard | first = Otis C.\n | publisher = by Jackson Morrow (Indianapolis: B.F.

By 1853 a line was commenced between Kokomo and [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] (which was intended to become the hub of a network of lines for the company). Railroad service was inaugurated on that line on July 4, 1855.<ref>Watt, William J. (1999) ''The Pennsylvania Railroad in Indiana''. Indiana University Press. p. 30.</ref>\n\nThe most important rail line for Kokomo became the standard-gauge Clover Leaf line. This railroad would eventually link Kokomo with both the West Coast and the Eastern Seaboard. It began as a short line linking Frankfort and Kokomo, the [[Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad]]. Henry Y. Morrison of Frankfort was the principal promoter, and A.Y. Comstock acted for him in Kokomo. A failure of the proposed subsidy caused the promoters to turn all assets over to the contractors, who promised to complete the line. Construction began in 1873 and was completed the following year. Limited freight between the two cities made the line unprofitable. After a series of acquisitions by other railroads, the line became part of the [[Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad]].

Mayor Henry C. Cole was shot to death by a sheriff's posse. Dr. Cole had a curious history and had stirred up a great deal of passion in the previous fifteen years. He was reputed to have been a gifted surgeon, who served in the Union Army during the Civil War and when afterwards he settled in Kokomo, he became a prominent physician.

Factor 8 was made from pooled plasma of thousands of donors. Later the plasma was screened for HIV and Hepatitis and heat treated to inactive HIV and Hepatitis. The teen had been attending [[Western School Corporation|Western Middle School]] (which is actually in [[Russiaville, Indiana|Russiaville]]) but was ostracized by his classmates, and forced to eat lunch alone and use a separate restroom. Many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied in support of banning White from attending the school. A lengthy administrative appeal process with the school system ensued, followed by death threats and violence against White and his family, including a bullet being fired through the window of their Kokomo home. Media coverage of the case made White into a national celebrity and spokesman for AIDS research and public education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCMr9jbq3Tk|title=AIDS Boy Banned From Attending School - 1st August 1985|first=|last=CampaignTB|date=November 2, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=August 18, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 1987, the White family left Kokomo for [[Cicero, Indiana]].

Manufacturing operations in the steel plant and on other portions of the property included the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Steel-making operations had included reheating, casting rolling, drawing, pickling, galvanizing, tinning and tempering.\n\nAfter the company filed for bankruptcy in 1986, EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management investigated the plant and property and found soil, sediments, surface water and ground water contaminated with volatile organic compounds (PCBs) and several metals, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Lead contamination was also detected in soils on nearby residential properties.\n\nThe site was proposed to the [[National Priorities List]] as a [[Superfund]] site in 1988 and formally added in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Indiana Superfund sites\n | url = http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/query/queryhtm/nplfin.htm#IN\n | access-date = August 31, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, EPA received almost $6 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to complete needed cleanup at two problems at the Continental Steel Superfund site: the former Slag Processing Area and the site's contaminated ground water. The ARRA funding helped accelerate the cleanup of hazardous waste on the site. In the process, total of 15 Indiana contractors or subcontractors were involved in the ARRA-funded work, creating at least 45 temporary jobs.\n\nIn August 2010, using the ARRA funds, EPA completed the cleanup of the former slag processing area of the Superfund Site. Approximately {{convert|86000|short ton}} of slag were moved to the site's acid lagoon area for use as fill on that portion of the site. {{convert|2|ft|m|1|spell=In}} of clean soil were used to cap the former slag processing area, leaving it suitable for potential redevelopment. ARRA funds were also used to address contaminated groundwater at the site.

As a result, Kokand is the main transportation junction in the Fergana Valley.\n\n== History ==\n\nKokand has existed since at least the 10th century, under the name of '''Khavakand''', and was frequently mentioned in traveler's accounts of the caravan route between [[South Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. The [[Han Dynasty]] of China conquered the entire city in the 1st Century B.C. Later, the Arabs reconquered the region from [[Tang Empire]]. The [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] destroyed Kokand in the 13th century.\n\nThe present city began as a fort in 1732 on the site of another older fortress called '''Eski-Kurgan'''. In 1740, it became the capital of an Uzbek kingdom, the [[Khanate of Kokand]], which reached as far as [[Kyzylorda]] to the west and [[Bishkek]] to the northeast. Kokand was also the major religious center of the Fergana Valley, boasting more than 300 [[mosque]]s.\n\nImperial forces of [[Russian Empire]] under [[Mikhail Skobelev]] captured the city in 1883 which then became part of [[Russian Turkistan]]. After joining of Kokand and the whole of Central Asia, in general, to the Empire, peace and order came to the region for 40 years. During World War I, two revolutions happened in the Russian Empire. Separatists took advantage of the situation to destabilize the city and to prevent revolutionary changes. So it was the capital of the short-lived (72 days) (1917\u201318) anti-[[Bolshevik]] Provisional Government of Autonomous Turkistan (also known as [[Kokand Autonomy]]).<ref>''The Politics of Muslim Cultural Reform, Jadidism in Central Asia'' by Adeeb Khalid, [[Oxford University Press]], 2000</ref> They sought co-operation from [[Alexander Dutov|Ataman Dutov]] and [[Alash Orda]]. However, their emissary to the [[Mohammed Alim Khan|Amir]] of [[Bukhara]] achieved little.\n\nIt is worth to note that the modern city was mainly developed since its joining to [[Russian Turkistan]].\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n[[File:Juma Mosque Qoqand.JPG|150px|right|alt=The Jummi Mosque|The Jummi Mosque, Kokand]]\n* The [[Palace of Khud\u00e1y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n|Palace of Khudayar Khan]] was built between 1863 and 1874 by [[Muhammad Khudayar Khan]].  Upon completion, it was one of the largest and most opulent palaces in Central Asia.  Nineteen of its original one hundred and thirteen rooms survive and now host a museum.\n* Jummi Mosque (right), a [[Jama Masjid|Friday mosque]] built in 1800\u20131812, and reopened in 1989, it can hold 10,000 worshipers.\n* Amin Beg Madrassah, built in 1813.\n* Dakhma-I-Shokhon, a necropolis of the Kokand Khans from the 1830s.\n* Khamza Museum, dedicated to Kokand's  Soviet hero [[Hamza Hakimzade Niyazi]].\n\n== Education and culture ==\n\nA number of [[madrasah]] can be found with the city. Kokand made contribution to Islam. It is also home to a number of notable [[hanafi]] scholars, such as Abdulhafiz Al-Quqoniy and Yorqinjon Qori Al-Quqoniy.\n\nThere are 2 institutes, 9 colleges and [[lyceum]]s, 40 secondary schools, 5 musical schools, a theater, and 20 libraries. There are 7 historical and house museums located in Kokand.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020802115758/http://www.kokand.uz/ More on Kokand]</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[black market]] provides nearly 75% of the income generated in the borders of the city.{{fact|date=February 2015}} This includes retail, groceries, employment, money exchange, agriculture and manufacturing of many goods. A large part of the population works as small business owners in outdoor markets.\n\nKokand is a center for the manufacture of [[fertilizers]], chemicals, machinery, and [[cotton]] and food products. Over the last two decades, new districts and public buildings have been created in the city as well as many houses, shops, cafes, restaurants and other private sector ventures. Kokand is an education center with one institute, nine colleges and lyceums, and numerous museums.\n\n== Notable people ==\n*[[Muhammad Sharif Gulkhani]], poet and satirist\n*[[Ziroatkhon Hoshimova]], [[First Lady of Uzbekistan]]\n*[[Ida Mayrin]] (born 1997), Israeli Olympic rhythmic gymnast\n*[[Yodgor Nasriddinova]], Uzbek-Soviet engineer and communist party official\n*[[Abdulla Qahhor]], Uzbek writer\n* [[Abraham Resnick]], rabbi\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Kokand}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020802115758/http://www.kokand.uz/ Official city portal of Kokand ]\n{{Fergana Region}}\n{{Cities in Uzbekistan}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Fergana Region]]\n[[Category:Populated places along the Silk Road]]\n[[Category:Fergana Oblast]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the city|the former state|Khanate of Kokand}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name = Kokand\n| native_name = Qo\u2018qon / \u049a\u045e\u049b\u043e\u043d\n| image_skyline = {{Photomontage\n| photo1a = Khudayar Khan Palace, Kokand 01.JPG\n| photo2a = Kokand Teahouse (495833).jpg\n| photo2b = Amin Beg Madrassah, Kokand (495828).jpg\n| photo3a = Church 01 01.JPG\n| photo3c = TDTUKokand.jpg\n| photo4a = \n| photo4c = \n| size = 280\n| spacing = 2\n| color = transparent\n| border = 0\n}}\n| image_caption = \n| image_flag =\n| image_seal =\n| image_map =\n| map_caption =\n| pushpin_map = Uzbekistan\n| pushpin_label_position = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption = Location in Uzbekistan\n| coordinates      = {{coord|40|31|43|N|70|56|33|E|region:UZ_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n| subdivision_name = {{flag|Uzbekistan}}\n| subdivision_type1 = [[Regions of Uzbekistan|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1 = [[Fergana Region]]\n| subdivision_type2 =\n| subdivision_name2 =\n| established_title =\n| established_date =\n| government_type =\n| leader_title = Hokim\n| leader_name = Ma'rufjon Usmonov\n| area_magnitude =\n| area_total_sq_mi =\n| area_total_km2 = 40\n| area_land_sq_mi =\n| area_land_km2 =\n| area_urban_sq_mi =\n| area_urban_km2 =\n| area_metro_km2 =\n| area_metro_sq_mi =\n| population_as_of = 2016\n| population_footnotes =\n| population_total = 239900\n| population_urban =\n| population_metro = \n| population_density_sq_mi =\n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| timezone = +5\n| utc_offset =\n| timezone_DST =\n| utc_offset_DST =\n| elevation_footnotes =\n| elevation_m = 409\n| elevation_ft =\n| postal_code_type = Postal code\n| postal_code = 150700\n| area_code =\n| website = {{URL|http://kokand.uz/}}\n| footnotes =\n}}\n\n'''Kokand''' ({{lang-uz|Qo\u2018qon}}, ''\u049a\u045e\u049b\u043e\u043d'', \u0642\u0648\u0642\u0627\u0646; {{lang-ru|\u041a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434}}; {{lang-fa|\u062e\u0648\u0642\u0646\u062f|Xuqand}}; [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]: \u062e\u0648\u0642\u0646\u062f, ''Xuqand''; {{lang-tg|\u0425\u04ef\u049b\u0430\u043d\u0434|X\u00f6kand}}) is a city in [[Fergana Region]] in eastern [[Uzbekistan]], at the southwestern edge of the [[Fergana Valley]].

As a result, Kokand is the main transportation junction in the Fergana Valley.\n\n== History ==\n\nKokand has existed since at least the 10th century, under the name of '''Khavakand''', and was frequently mentioned in traveler's accounts of the caravan route between [[South Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. The [[Han Dynasty]] of China conquered the entire city in the 1st Century B.C. Later, the Arabs reconquered the region from [[Tang Empire]]. The [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] destroyed Kokand in the 13th century.\n\nThe present city began as a fort in 1732 on the site of another older fortress called '''Eski-Kurgan'''. In 1740, it became the capital of an Uzbek kingdom, the [[Khanate of Kokand]], which reached as far as [[Kyzylorda]] to the west and [[Bishkek]] to the northeast. Kokand was also the major religious center of the Fergana Valley, boasting more than 300 [[mosque]]s.\n\nImperial forces of [[Russian Empire]] under [[Mikhail Skobelev]] captured the city in 1883 which then became part of [[Russian Turkistan]]. After joining of Kokand and the whole of Central Asia, in general, to the Empire, peace and order came to the region for 40 years. During World War I, two revolutions happened in the Russian Empire. Separatists took advantage of the situation to destabilize the city and to prevent revolutionary changes. So it was the capital of the short-lived (72 days) (1917\u201318) anti-[[Bolshevik]] Provisional Government of Autonomous Turkistan (also known as [[Kokand Autonomy]]).<ref>''The Politics of Muslim Cultural Reform, Jadidism in Central Asia'' by Adeeb Khalid, [[Oxford University Press]], 2000</ref> They sought co-operation from [[Alexander Dutov|Ataman Dutov]] and [[Alash Orda]]. However, their emissary to the [[Mohammed Alim Khan|Amir]] of [[Bukhara]] achieved little.\n\nIt is worth to note that the modern city was mainly developed since its joining to [[Russian Turkistan]].\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n[[File:Juma Mosque Qoqand.JPG|150px|right|alt=The Jummi Mosque|The Jummi Mosque, Kokand]]\n* The [[Palace of Khud\u00e1y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n|Palace of Khudayar Khan]] was built between 1863 and 1874 by [[Muhammad Khudayar Khan]].

There are 7 historical and house museums located in Kokand.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020802115758/http://www.kokand.uz/ More on Kokand]</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[black market]] provides nearly 75% of the income generated in the borders of the city.{{fact|date=February 2015}} This includes retail, groceries, employment, money exchange, agriculture and manufacturing of many goods. A large part of the population works as small business owners in outdoor markets.\n\nKokand is a center for the manufacture of [[fertilizers]], chemicals, machinery, and [[cotton]] and food products.

Koforidua was founded in 1875 by refugees from Ashanti. It is also called New Juaben.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/koforidua|title=Koforidua {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> The city has a [[Human settlement|settlement]]  city proper population of 183,727 people as of 2010, \n<ref name=\"World Gazetteer\"/> Koforidua is an amalgamation of 2 Municipalities ; [[New Juaben North (Ghana parliament constituency)|New Juaben North]] and South. The city is a blend of colonial and present day architecture. Ladies from koforidua are referred to as Koforidua Flowers'.\n\nKoforidua serves as a [[Commercial area|commercial centre]] for the [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern region]] and [[New-Juaben Municipal District]]. The city is home to many businesses, with the exception of heavy duty industries. The city is home to Intravenous Infusions Ltd., one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies in Ghana and West Africa, a leading producer of injections and drips .The company is listed on the Ghana Stock exchange and was registered in 1969 .\nThe city is home to many Government Departments and Ministries at the Regional level. The recent construction of the four-lane highway road linking the Koforidua Technical University and Koforidua to [[Oyoko, Koforidua|Oyoko]] brings commerce to the city. The highway also serves as a valid alternative route to reach [[Kumasi]].\n\n==Etymology==\nOral tradition has it that, Koforidua owes its name to an [[Akan people|Akan]] man, Kofi Ofori, who had built his hut under a huge mahogany tree. This tree provided shelter for weary farmers who were returning from their farms after a hard day's work. Over time, it became common for the farmers to say that they were going to rest under Kofi Ofori's tree. In [[Akan language|Akan]] the south country's native language, the twi word for tree is \"dua\". An amalgamation of Kofi Ofori's name and tree, therefore, becomes \"Koforidua.\"\nLadies from Koforidua are popularly known as Koforidua Flowers.\n\n==History==\nKoforidua was founded in 1875 by [[Akan people|Akan]] migrants from [[Asanteman]]. The completion of the Kumasi railway in 1923  saw Koforidua become an important road and rail junction. Koforidua is one of the country's oldest [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]-producing centres. It is also noted today for its weekly Thursday bead market,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mensah|first1=Henry|title=Experience Koforidua|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/geography/koforidua.php|website=Ghana Web|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> which draws bead buyers and sellers from all over the Eastern region.\n\n===Legend about Koforidua===\nLegend has it that, the Obuotabiri mountain found in New Juabeng, was the home of the gods and protected the people. It was believed to be inhabited by [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s and thus was considered the soul of the New Juabeng traditional area. All the townsfolk have great reverence for the mountain: OBUOTABIRI - the rock of Tabiri.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Umbrella Rock.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Umbrella Rock]] tourism site]]\nThe New Juaben Municipality falls within the [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern Region]] of South Ghana.

It is also called New Juaben.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/koforidua|title=Koforidua {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> The city has a [[Human settlement|settlement]]  city proper population of 183,727 people as of 2010 ,\n<ref name=\"World Gazetteer\"/> Koforidua is an amalgamation of 2 Municipalities ; [[New Juaben North (Ghana parliament constituency)|New Juaben North]] and South. The city is a blend of colonial and present day architecture. Ladies from koforidua are referred to as Koforidua Flowers'.\n\nKoforidua serves as a [[Commercial area|commercial centre]] for the [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern region]] and [[New-Juaben Municipal District]]. The city is home to many businesses, with the exception of heavy duty industries. The city is home to Intravenous Infusions Ltd., one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies in Ghana and West Africa, a leading producer of injections and drips .The company is listed on the Ghana Stock exchange and was registered in 1969 .\nThe city is home to many Government Departments and Ministries at the Regional level. The recent construction of the four-lane highway road linking the Koforidua Technical University and Koforidua to [[Oyoko, Koforidua|Oyoko]] brings commerce to the city. The highway also serves as a valid alternative route to reach [[Kumasi]].\n\n==Etymology==\nOral tradition has it that, Koforidua owes its name to an [[Akan people|Akan]] man, Kofi Ofori, who had built his hut under a huge mahogany tree. This tree provided shelter for weary farmers who were returning from their farms after a hard day's work. Over time, it became common for the farmers to say that they were going to rest under Kofi Ofori's tree. In [[Akan language|Akan]] the south country's native language, the twi word for tree is \"dua\". An amalgamation of Kofi Ofori's name and tree, therefore, becomes \"Koforidua.\"\nLadies from Koforidua are popularly known as Koforidua Flowers.\n\n==History==\nKoforidua was founded in 1875 by [[Akan people|Akan]] migrants from [[Asanteman]]. The completion of the Kumasi railway in 1923  saw Koforidua become an important road and rail junction. Koforidua is one of the country's oldest [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]-producing centres. It is also noted today for its weekly Thursday bead market,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mensah|first1=Henry|title=Experience Koforidua|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/geography/koforidua.php|website=Ghana Web|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> which draws bead buyers and sellers from all over the Eastern region.\n\n===Legend about Koforidua===\nLegend has it that, the Obuotabiri mountain found in New Juabeng, was the home of the gods and protected the people. It was believed to be inhabited by [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s and thus was considered the soul of the New Juabeng traditional area. All the townsfolk have great reverence for the mountain: OBUOTABIRI - the rock of Tabiri.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Umbrella Rock.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Umbrella Rock]] tourism site]]\nThe New Juaben Municipality falls within the [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern Region]] of South Ghana.
